            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>CHAP. I. The occasion of this Treatise.</head>
            <p>THe fairest eares of Corne are soonest blasted, so the more conspicuous the Church of England was among the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches, (as not being framed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the brainsicke dictates of some seditious Oratour, or the giddy humours of a tumultuous multitude, but with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deliberation, and the free consent and concurrence of all the Orders of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,) the more it was subjected to the envie and groundless calumnies of our Country men of the Roman Communion. But of all the slanderous aspersions cast upon our Church, that liyng fable of the Nagges head Ordination doth beare the bell away. Those monstrous fictions of the Cretian bulles and minotaures, (devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Athenians to revenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves upon Minos King of Creete, who had subdued them in a just warre, and compelled them to send their sons to him for hostages,) were not more malicious, nor that shamelesslie of Kentish long tailes more ridiculous. The first deviser of it doth justly deserve the Character of <hi>A
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54322:3"/>
man of a brasen forhead and leaden hearie.</hi> If the unpartiall reader after he have perused this treatise, thinke I doe him wrong. I do willingly submitte my self to his censure. This prodigious fable received its deathes wound from Mr. Masons penne, and hath remained ever since for the space of thirty yeares buried in deepe oblivion. And those assaies which it maketh now to get wing againe, by the assistence of two Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natian Fathers, are but the vaine attempts of a dying Cause. Neither would I have troubled the Reader or my self <hi>to bring Owles to Athens,</hi> or to confute a Cause which hath bene so demonstratively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed to my hand, but for two new addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions lately spread abroad. The one by orall tradition which concerneth my self. That <hi>Father T. and Father B. had so confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Bishop of Derry in the presence of the King, that he said he perceived his Father had made me a Lord, but not a Bishop,</hi> And that <hi>afterwards, by my power I had procured those two Iesuits to be prohibited that presence. So that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas Father Talbot used to be the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter in the Spanish treaties, now he was not admitted, and Don Iohn would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte no other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:54322:3"/>So the Bishop of Derry is accused not onely to have bene publickly baffeled, but also to have bene a disturber of publick affaires. Yet I know nothing of all this, which concerneth myself. I never heard of any such conference, or any such words, I never knew that Father Talbot was designed to that imploiment. I was never guilty of having any such power, muchles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se of any endevour to turne out any man. If the Fathers seemed too pragmaticall to those who were intrusted, or to involue the interest of their Religion into Civill trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, what is that to me? If it were true they may thanke themselves. If it were false, they may thanke them who did it. Whether true or false I never had an hand, nor so much as a little finger in it.</p>
            <p>All the truth that I know is this. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that these two Fathers, had spoken largely in the Courte of the Succession of our English Bishops, but never in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, I sought out Father B, and had pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate conference with him about it in the Iesuits College at Bruges, and afterwards some discourse with Father T. and him together in mine owne Chamber. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they did say, they put into writing to which I returned them an answer, shewing not onely that there
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54322:4"/>
was not, but that it was morally impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible there should be any such Ordination at the nagges head. From that day to this I never heard any thing of it, that concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned myself. Now if a man should search for an Authour of this fabulous Relation, he shall be sure to have it fathered upon some very credible perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, without names, who had it from Iohn an okes whilest he was living, and he had it from Iohn a Stiles, and he had it from No body, but feined it himself out of a good intention, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that case Theology which he had learned of Machiavell, <hi>To advance the credit of Religion</hi> by all meanes possible true or false.</p>
            <p>The other addition concerneth the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and Reverend Bishop of Duresme one of the ancientest Bishops this day li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the Christian world, being 95 yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res old at least. That he owned and justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the nagges head Ordination in publick Parliament, in the house of the Peeres: It is very well, we can not desire a better place where to have it spoken, then the house of Parliament. Nor better witnesses then the Lords spirituall and temporall. We have no man of the Episcopall Order, whose memory can reach so neare those times, or in whose integrity we doe more
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54322:4"/>
confide, then the Bishop of Duresme. He might heare many things either from the persons praetended to have bene then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated, or from the Notaries or witnesses who were then present at that imaginary Consecration. Or at least he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the tradition of that age from such as were eiewitnesses of what passed. Let it be put to his Testimony if they thinke fitte, (without doubt he is the same man he was then) or to the Testimony of any other of his age and Reputation, whom they can produce. We refuse no sort of proofe but onely vaine <hi>hear say,</hi> which as our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish proverbe saith is commonly, and in this case most undoubtedly a lier. Nay we would not refuse the Testimony of Mr. Neale himself, though a professed enemy, who was the onely founder of this silly fable, so he might be examined upon oath, before equall Iudges, but compell him either to shame the divell, and eate his owne words, or to runne himself into such palpable absurdities Contradictions and impossibilities, that no man of reason how partiall soever, could give any credit to him. My first taske shall be, before I meddle with the fable it self to vindicate the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Duresme, and the truth which is wounded through his sydes, with this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54322:5"/>
to the Reader, that if this branch of the Legend be proved apparently to be false, which is pretended to have bene pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blickly acted in a full house of the Peeres of the Realme, we can expect no truth from the voluntary reporte of one single meane malicious enemy, to his own party. And with all a confessed Spie, of what was done at the Nagges head. Breake ice in one place, and it will crack in more.</p>

            <p>TO vindicate the Bishop of Duresme, I shall first set downe the relation of this passage in the words of the Fathers themselves.</p>

               <hi>In the beginning of the late Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment some Presbiterian Lordes presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the upper house a certeine booke, proving that the Protestant Bishops had no succession or consecration, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were no Bishops, and by consequence had no right to sitte in Parliament. Hereupon Doctor Morton pretended Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop

of Durrham who is yet alive, made a speech against this booke in his owne and all the Bishops behalfe then present. He endeavoured to prove succession from the last Catholick Bishops, who (said he) by imposition of hands ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the first Protestant Bishops at the Nagges head in Cheap syde, as vvas No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious to all the vvorld. Therefore the afore said booke ought to be looked upon as a groundless libell. This vvas told to many by one of the ancientest Peeres of England, praesent in Parliament vvhen Morton made his speech. And thesame he is ready to depose upon his oath. Nay he cannot believe that any vvill be so impudent as to denie a thing so notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, vvhereof there are as many vvit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses living, as there are Lords and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops that vvere that day in the upper house of Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here are three passages. One concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a booke presented to the upper house, against the successio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of English Bishops, by some presbiterian Lords.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54322:6"/>
The second concerning the pretended re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of this booke by the Bishop of Duresme. The third the proofe of both these allegations by the Testimony of an Ancient Peere of England,</p>
            <p>First for the booke, It is most true there was a booke written about that time by a single Lord against Episcopacy, and dedicated to the members of both houses of Parliament. No wonder. How often have the Parliaments in the reignes of Queene Elisabeth and King Iames bene troubled with such <hi>Requests</hi> and <hi>Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> It is no strange thing that a weake eie should be offended with the light of the sun. We may justly ascribe the reviving of the Aerian heresy in these later daies to the Dispensations of the Courte of Rome who licensed ordinary Priests to ordeine, and confirme, and do the most essentiall offices of Bishops So their Scholes do teach us, <hi>A Preest may be the ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vators. And yet they are not able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce one president of such a dispensation throughout the primitive times, A good
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54322:6"/>
Christian ought to regarde more what the whole Christian world in all ages hath pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised, then what a few conceited per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in this last age have fancied. Among all the Easterne Southern and Northerne Christians, who make innumerable mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, there neither is nor ever was one formed Church that wanted Bishops. Yet these are as farre from submitting to the exorbitant power of the Roman Bishop as we. Among all the westerne Churches and their Colonies, there never was one for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Church for 1500. yeares, that wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Bishops. If there be any persons so farre possessed with prejudice, that they chuse rather to follow the private dictates of their owne phrensy, then the perpetuall and universall practise of the Catholick Church, enter not into their secrets o my soule.</p>
            <p>Thus farre we agree, but in all the rest of the circumstances, (though they be not much materiall) the Fathers do pittifully mistake themselves, and vary much from the Testimony of their witness, and much more from the truth. First the Authour of this booke was no presbyterian Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> much less a company or caball of Presbite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Lords in the plurall, but my Lord Brookes, one that had as little favour for
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54322:7"/>
Presbytery as for Episcopacy.</p>
            <p>Secondly the booke was not praesented to the upper house. It might be brought into the house privately, yet not be praesen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the house publickly. If it had bene publickly praesented, the Clerkes of the Parliament or some of them must needes have known of it and made an Act of it, but they know no such thing. The Lords Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and Temporall could not all have Forgotten it, but they remember no such thing, as by their respective certificates praesently shall appeare.</p>
            <p>Thirdly as the Authour is mistaken, and praesentation mistaken. So the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject likewise is mistaken. <hi>Sit liber Iudex,</hi> let the booke speake for it self<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thus an able freind certifieth me. <hi>I have got my Lord Brookes booke which he wrote against the Bishops with much labour, and perused it with no less Patience. And there is not in it the least shadow of any Argument, that the Bishops ought not to sitte in Parliament, because they had no succession or consecration.</hi> What did my Lord Brookes regard succession or Consecration or holy orders, who had a Coachman to be his preacher. The less Canonicall the ordination had bene, the more he would have applauded it. Time and place and forme and all were agreeable to that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54322:7"/>

                  <p>I do hereby in the praesence of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God solemnely protest and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to all the world, that what this Authour there affirmes concerning me is a most notorious untruth and a grosse slander. For to the best of my knowledge

and remembrance, no such booke as he there mentions was ever presented to the upper house in that or any other Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that ever I sate in. And if there had, I could never have made such a speech as is there pretended, seeing I have ever spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> according to my thoughts, and alwaies believed that fable of the Nagges head consecration to have proceded from the father of lies; as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Recordes of the Church still ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tant, which were so faithfully tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, and published by Mr. Mason, do evidently testifie. And whereas the same impudent Libeller doth moreover say, that what he there affirmes was told to many, by one of the ancientest Peeres of England, praesent in Parliament, when I made this praetended speech: and that he is ready to depose the same upon his oath: And that he can not believe any will be so impudent, to denie a thing so notorious, whereof there are as many witnesses living, as there are Lords and Bishops that were that day in the upper house of Parliament <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I answer, that

I am very unwilling to beleeve any peere of England should have so little sense of his Conscience and honour, as either to sweare or so much as affirme such a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious untruth.

               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:54322:14"/>This is my Charity. And my ground for it is this. When I had once conference with him about this relation, he told me the name of the Naggeshead did surprise him, and he betooke himself to inquire of another what it meant. And when I urged to him, that it was incredible that any Protestant Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop should make such a speech, unlesse he used it onely by way of Supposition, as <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentum ad hominem,</hi> a reason fitte for my Lord <hi>Brookes,</hi> that such a Consecration as that was, agreed well enough with his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, He told me he knew not that, the Bishop might answer so for himself.</p>
            <p>To conclude, I have heard the Bishop of <hi>Lincolne</hi> did once mention the Fable of the Nagges head in a speech in Parliament, but with as much Detestation of it, as our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestours used to name the Devill. Why might not the mistake both of the person, and of the drift or scope of his speech, be the occasion of this relation? I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of charity run into two such right handed errours, then condemne a Noble Gentleman of whose ingenuity I never had any reason to doubt, of a malicious lie. Take it at the very best, the mistake is great enough, to mistake both the person of the speaker, and the scope of his speech. I hope they will all do that which in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science

they are obliged to do, that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitte the Bishop of <hi>Duresme,</hi> and crave his pardon for their mistake.

               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:54322:16"/>We say Arch Bishop <hi>Parker</hi> was conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated alone, at Lambeth, in the Church, by foure Bishops, authorised thereunto by Commission under the great Seale of England, with Sermon, with Sacrament, with all due solemnities, upon the 17 day of December Anno 1559. before foure of the most eniment publick Notaries in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland; and particularly by the same publick Notary who was Principall Actuary both at Cardinall <hi>Poles</hi> Consecration and Arch Bishop <hi>Parkers.</hi> And that all the rest of the Bishops were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Consecrated at other times, some in the same moneth but not upon the same day, some in the same yeare but not the same moneth, and some the yeare following. And to prove the truth of our relation and falshood of theirs, we produce the Registet of the See of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, as authentick as the world hath any, the Registers of the other fourteene Sees then vacant, all as carefully kept by sworne Officers as the Recordes of the Vatican it self. We produce all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions under the privy seale and great Seale of England: We produce the rolles or Recordes of the Chancery; And if the Recordes of the Signet office had not been unfortunately burned in King <hi>Iames</hi> his time, it might have been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54322:16"/>
by those also: We produce an Act of Parliament express in the pointe, within seven yeares after the Consecration: We produce all the controverted Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions published to the world in printe <hi>Anno</hi> 1572<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> three yeares before Arch Bishop <hi>Parkers</hi> death, whilest all things were fresh in mens memories. These bright beames had bene able to dasell the eies of <hi>Mr. Neale</hi> himself, whilest he was living, and have made him recant his lewd lie, or confess himself starke blinde.</p>
            <p>The first reason which I bring against this ridiculous fable,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The first reason.</hi>
               </note> it taken from the palpable Contradictions, and grosse absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities and defects of those Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick writers, who have related this silly tale of a tub, and agree in nothing but in their common malice against the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland. It is no strange matter for such as write upon hearesay, or relie upon the exact truth of other mens notes or memories, to mistake in some inconsiderable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance: as to set downe the name of a place amisse, which may be the transcribers faulte, or the printers, as well as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours: Or to say two Suffragans for one, when there were two named in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, and but one present at the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration. Such immateriall differences
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54322:17"/>
which are so remote from the heart of the Cause, about indifferent Circumstances, may bring the exactnesse of the Relation into question, but not the substantiall truth of it. Such petty unsignificant variations, do rather prove that the Relations were not made upon compact or confederacy. Especially where there are originall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordes taken upon the place by sworne No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, whose names, and hands, and Acts are as well known to every man versed in the Recordes of those times, as a man knoweth his owne house. To which all Relaters and Relations must submitte, and are ready to submitte as to an infallible rule.</p>
            <p>But he who should give credit to such a silly senslesse fable as this is, which is wholy composed of absurd, improbable, incoherent, inconsistent, contradictory fictions, had need to have a very implicite faith. The greatest shew of any accord among them is about the Consecrater, yet even in this they disagree one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The common opinion is that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Scory</hi> alone did consecrate them. But Mr. Constable one of their principall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours supposeth, that Bishop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Barlow</hi> might joine with him in the Consecration. And <hi>Sanders,</hi> whose penne in other cases useth to runne over, one who had as much
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54322:17"/>
malice as any of them, and had reason to know the passages of those times better then all of them, leaveth it doubtfull, when, or where, or by whom they were ordeined, <hi>quomodocunque facti sunt isti Pseudo-Episcopi; by what meanes soever they were ordeined.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But they disagree much more among themselves, who they should be that were ordeined. First <hi>Mr. Waddesworth</hi> (whose ingenuity deserveth to be commended) doth not say that any of our Bishops were actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally consecrated there, but onely that <hi>there was an attempt to consecrate the First of them,</hi> that was Arch-Bishop <hi>Parker.</hi> But that which destoyeth the credit of this attempt is this, that it is evident by the Recordes, that Arch-Bishop <hi>Parker</hi> was not personally present at his Confirmation in <hi>Bowes</hi> Church, or at his Confirmation dinner at the <hi>Nagges head,</hi> which gave the occasion to this merry Legend: but was confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by his Proctor <hi>Nicholas Bullingham</hi> Doctor in the Lawes, upon the ninth of December Anno 1559. A man may be confirmed by Proxie, but no man can be
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54322:18"/>
ordeined by proxie. It is a ruled case in their owne law, <hi>Non licet Sacramentum ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quod praeter matrimonium absenti administrare.</hi> So if there was an attempt to consecrate any man at the <hi>Nagges head,</hi> it must be Doctor <hi>Bullingham,</hi> it could not be Arch Bishop <hi>Parker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others say there was more then an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, that one or more of them were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually ordeined there: but they name none. Others name some, but they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde not one with another in naming of them. Some say, <hi>Iewell, Sands, Horn, Grindall</hi>; where was Arch Bishop <hi>Parker</hi>? Others say, <hi>Parker, Grindall, Horne, Sands.</hi> Lastly others say, they were all ordeined there, who were named to Bishopricks, and number fifteen of them. These fathers speake indefinitely, <hi>Parker and his fellowes.</hi> But they seeme to extend this word <hi>fellowes</hi> as farre as Doctor <hi>Champneys</hi> fifteene: for they tell us, that they <hi>all kneeled downe before him,</hi> and <hi>he laid the Bible upon every one of their heads or shoulders.</hi> Thus these <hi>Cadmean</hi> brethren, like those false wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses which testified against Christ, destroy one another with their mutuall Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:54322:18"/>Thirdly, the time is a principall Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance in all Consecrations, and is evermore most punctually recorded by the Actuaries, or publick Notaries. But in this fabulous Relation the time is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed. It seemeth the Forger was no good Actuary, and either did not know how materiall that Circumstance was, or had forgotten it. Onely Doctor <hi>Champney</hi> telleth us, that it was before the ninth of September Anno 1559. But this is not precise enough for an Act: and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, it is most apparently false and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible. For whereas there are two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions under the greate Seale of <hi>England,</hi> for the Confirmation and Consecration of Arch Bishop <hi>Parker,</hi> both recorded in the Rolles; the one which was not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, dated the said very ninth day of September; and the other which was executed, dated the sixth day of December following: if Doctor Champney said true, Arch Bishop <hi>Parker</hi> was conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated before he was confirmed, yea before there was any Commission out, either for his Consecration or Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; which is one of the drowsiest dreames that could droppe from an English penne.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:54322:19"/>Lastly, every Consecration must be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed before one or more publick Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. (We shall shew them Notaries enough of great eminence, beyond all exception, for Arch-Bishop <hi>Parkers</hi> true Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.) And indeed what could a Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion availe any man, without a publick No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to Recorde it, to make an authentick Certificate of it under the seale of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Consecrater? Now who recorded the <hi>Nagges head</hi> Consecration? who drew it up into Acts? Who certified it? No bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, because the silly forger did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what things were requisite to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration. Onely as the <hi>Athenians</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times said of <hi>Metiochus, Metiochus grindes the corne, Metiochus bakes the bread, Metiochus mendes the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, Metiochus doth all, an evill yeare to Metiochus</hi>: So we may say of Mr. <hi>Neale</hi>; Mr. <hi>Neale</hi> was the spie, Mr. <hi>Neale</hi> was the witness, Mr. <hi>Neale</hi> was the publick Notary, Mr. <hi>Neale</hi> was the chiefe Eugenier or forger, Mr. <hi>Neale was</hi> all, what honours are due to Mr. <hi>Neale</hi>?</p>
            <q>
               <l>Qui tot sustinuit, qui tanta negotia solus.</l>
            </q>
            <p>So they feine a Consecration without a publick Notary, or (which is all one) no
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54322:19"/>
man ever knew who that publick Notary was; At a time impossible, or els no man knoweth at what time; without any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinty who consecrated, whether <hi>Scory</hi> alone, or <hi>Scory</hi> and <hi>Barlow</hi> together, or God knoweth who; and yet with much lesse certeinty who were consecrated, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther none at all, but onely an attempt was made, or one, and who that one was; or some indefinitely, without naming who they were, or how many they were; or foure expressly, but dissenting one from another who those foure were. Here is a story com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed altogether of uncerteinties and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, like <hi>A man and no man, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>it a bird and no bird, on a tree and no tree, with a stone and no stone.</hi> To make this uncerteine, groundless, contradictory rumour, to be the touchstone of truth, and to overballance all the authentick Recordes of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, in a matter of such publick concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: is just to make the Parish clock goe truer then the Sun, because the Clerke who settes it is our Freind.</p>
            <p>My second reason against this senseless fable,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Seeond reason.</hi>
               </note> is the late discovery of it to the world, and the long concealing of it in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> holes and corners before they durst adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture present it to the view of the world,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54322:20"/>
Can any man who is in his right wittes be so stupide as to imagine, that the <hi>Nagges head</hi> Ordination happened in the yeare 1559, and (if these Fathers say truely) was <hi>notoriously knowne to all the world</hi>; and that it should never once Peepe into the light for almost a whole age after it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have been done, that is till after the yeare sixteen hundred? We use to say a monster is but nine daies wonder: but this ugly monster was not taken notice of in the world untill after forty yeares. The reason is evident; Either it was then but newly hatched, or it had bene kept all that time at dry nurse in a closet. If it had bene so <hi>notorious to all the world</hi> from the yeare 1559 as the fathers feine, all the windowes in the <hi>Nagges head</hi> would have been full of it, and the roome would have been shewed to all their guests, where such a prodigious pageant had bene acted.</p>
            <p>I dare appeale to the judgments of these Fathers themselves, whether it be Credible, that this story should be notoriously know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne to the world in the beginning of Queene <hi>Elisabeths</hi> reigne, and yet neither <hi>Stapleton,</hi> nor <hi>Harding,</hi> nor <hi>Bristow,</hi> nor <hi>Alan,</hi> nor <hi>Reynoldes,</hi> nor <hi>Parsons,</hi> nor any one of all their Roman Catholick writers, should
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54322:20"/>
so much as mention it for forty yeares en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing; especially writing so much as they did upon that very subject, the validity or invalidity of our Ordination. How could their silence have bene excused from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying of their cause, to lose such an egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious advantage? Was it peradventure out of affection to us, to conceale the Defects of the Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts? No, they had will enough, but they durst not avouch such a Monstrous untruth in earnest, (if ever they did heare of such a vain rumour, which I can not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily beleeve,) so contrary to the knowledg of that age.</p>
            <p>Especially let them tell me how it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to passe, that Nicolas <hi>Sanders,</hi> who professeth to write <hi>the Ecclesiasticall history of England, from the one and twentieth yeare of Henry the eighth,</hi> untill the Eight and <hi>twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth yeare of Queene</hi> Elisabeth then current, in his three bookes of the <hi>Originall and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse of the English Schisme,</hi> hath not one syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable of the <hi>Nagges head</hi> Ordination? He was never accused of partiality for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, (but as malicious against the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants as any man could wish): nor of concealing truths to their advantage, but of Devising fables to their preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:54322:21"/>He having related the forme of our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Consecrations, partly true and partly false, proceedth to this first Ordination of Protestant Bishops, in the beginning of Queen <hi>Elisabeths</hi> Reigne; alleging that <hi>the Catholick Bishops refused to impose hands upon them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>De Schism. Angl. c.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 400. <hi>Edit Rom.</hi>
               </note> And that <hi>they had not of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves two or three Bishops, or so much as one Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan.</hi> What a shameless untruth is this, that there were not two or three Protestant Bishops, when the Queenes Commission under the great Seale of <hi>England,</hi> recorded in the Rolles, is directed to seven Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Bishops, expresly by their names and titles?</p>
            <p>He addeth, that <hi>they were very instant with an Irish Arch Bishop to have presided at their Ordination, but he would not.</hi> He mistaketh the matter altogether, They might have had seven Irish Arch Bishops and Bishops if they had needed them; where the proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings were not so rigorous, where the old Bishops complied and held their places, and joined in such Ecclesiasticall Acts, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they had made away to their kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, all the lands belonging to their Sees. We found one Bishoprick reduced to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54322:21"/>
five markes a yeare by these tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risers, another to forty shillings a yeare, and all of them to very poore pittances for Prelates. But by this meanes there wanted no Ordeiners. Never did any man question the Ordination of the first Protestant Bishops in <hi>Ireland</hi> untill this day.</p>
            <p>Then he telleth, how being thus rejected by the Catholick Bishops and the Irish Arch Bishop, they applied themselves <hi>to the lay Magistrate in the ensuing Parliament for a confirmation, from whence they were called Parliamentary Bishops.</hi> By whom were they called so? By no man but himself and his fellowes. How many Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were passed over, one after another, before that Parliament? Was there any thing moved in this Parliament, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning any the least essentiall of our Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Ordination? Not at all, but onely concerning the repealing and reviving of an English Statute. English Statutes can not change the essentialls of Ordination, either to make that Consecration valid which was invalid, or that invalid which was valid. The validity or invalidity of Ordination, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54322:22"/>
not upon humane law, but upon the institution of Christ. Neither did we ever since that Parliament change one syllable in our forme of Ordination. Then what was this Confirmation which he speakes of? It was onely a Declaration of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, that all the Objections which these men made against our Ordinations, were slanders and calumnies: and that all the Bishops which had been ordeined in the Queenes time, had bene rightly ordeined, according to the forme prescribed by the Church of England, and the Lawes of the Land. These men want no confidence, who are not ashamed to cite this Statute in this case. But we shall meete with this Parliament againe.</p>
            <p>In all this impertinent Discourse, where is the fable of the <hi>Nagges head</hi> Ordination<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It had bene a thousand times more mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall then all this <hi>Iargon.</hi> And you may be sure it had not been missing, if there had bene the least graine of truth in it, or is there had but been any suspicion of it when that was written. It was not then full thirty yeares after Arch-Bishop <hi>Parkers</hi> Consecration, and there were store of eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witnesses living to have hissed such a sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse fable out of the world, And therefore
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54322:22"/>
               <hi>Sanders</hi> very prudently for himself, after so many intimations, passeth by their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination in a deepe silence, which was the onely worke he tooke in hand to shew. <hi>Qualescunque fuerint aut quo modocun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que facti sint isti Pseudo-Episcopi &amp;c. VVhat manner of persons soever these False-Bishops were, or after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner soever they were ordeined &amp;c.</hi> If Bishop <hi>Scory</hi> had ordeined them all at the <hi>Naggeshead,</hi> by layng a Bible upon their heads, and this forme of wordes, <hi>Take thou Authority to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach the word of god Sincerely, M.

And if there had bene the least suspicion of it, he would have blowen it abroad upon a silver Trumpet: but God be thanked there was none. The universall silence of all the Romish writers of that age, when the <hi>Naggeshead</hi> Ordination is pretended to have been done, in a case which concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them all so nearely, and which was the Chiefe subject of all their disputes; is a convincing proofe to all men who are not altogether possessed with prejudice, that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54322:23"/>
either it was devised long after, or was so lewde a lie, that no man dared to owne it, whilest thousands of eyewitnesses of Arch Bishop <hi>Parkers</hi> true Consecration at <hi>Lambeth</hi> were living.</p>

            <head>CHAP. III. The fourth and fifth reasons against this improbable fiction, from the no necessity of it, and the lesse ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of it.</head>
            <p>MY fourth plea is, because there was no need to play this counterfeit pageant. We use to say Necessity hath no law. that is, regardeth no law. In time of warre the lawes are silent, but this was a time of peace. First there could be no necessity why they should have a clandestine Consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without a Register or publick Notary, when they might have had an Army of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Notaries ready upon their whistle, eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> under their elbowes at <hi>Bowes</hi> Church, out of the Courtes of the <hi>Arches,</hi> and the <hi>Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and <hi>Prerogative.</hi> Secondly, there was no necessity why they should anticipate the Queenes <hi>Letters patents</hi> for their consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by whose gracious favour they were elected, and of the accomplishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t whereof in due time they could not doubt; unlesse they would wilfully destroy their owne hopes, by such a mad pranke as this had been, that is, unlesse they would them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54322:25"/>
hew downe the bough where upon they stood. Thirdly, there was no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity that they should chuse a common Taverne for the place of their Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when the Keies of all the Churches in the Kingdome were at their Command, Fourthly, there could be no necessity why they should deserte the forme of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion prescribed by the Law, which was agreeable both to their judgements, and to their desires, and to their duties; and to omitte the essentialls of Ordination, both matter and forme, which they knew well enough, to be consecrated after a new brainsick manner.</p>
            <p>Then all the necessity which can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, is want of a competent number of Ordeiners. Suppose there had bene such a necessity 'to be ordeined by two Bishops, or by one Bishop, this very necessity had bene a sufficient Dispensation with the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of the Canons, and had instified the Act. as <hi>St. Gregory</hi> pleadeth to <hi>Augustine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In the English Church wherein there i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:54322:25"/>
these protestant Bishops have bene validely ordeined, if they received the essentialls of Ordination. But what a remedy is this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they could not have a competent number of Bishops, according to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Church, and the lawes of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, therefore to reject the essentialls of Ordination, for a defect which was not es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall, and to cast of obedience to their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, both civill a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Ecclesiasticall? This had bene just like little children which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not have some toy which they desire, cast away their garments, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever their Pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts had provided for them, Wante of three Bishops might in some ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses make a consecration illegall or uncano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall, but it could not have rendered it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valide, as this silly prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded Ordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had.</p>
            <p>But now I come up close to the ground worke of the fable,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rot.</hi> 14. <hi>Pars</hi> 2. <hi>Elisab.</hi>
               </note> and I denie positively that there was any such want of a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent number of Bishops, as they pretend. And for proofe hereof, I bring no vaine rumours or uncertein conjectures, but the evident and authentick testimony of the great seale of England, affixed to the Queenes <hi>Leuers Patents,</hi> for authorising the Confirmation and Consecration of Arch-Bishop <hi>Parker,</hi> dated the sixth day of <hi>December,</hi> Anno 1559. dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

I adde, that if it had bene need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, they might have had seven more out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> Arch Bishops and Bishops, for such a worke as a consecration. <hi>Ireland</hi> never wanted store of Ordeiners. Nor ever yet did any man object, want of a Competent number of Consecraters, to an Irish Protestant Bishop. They who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred freely in the Consecration of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Bishops at home, would not have denied their concurrence in England, if they had been commanded. Which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes me give no credit to that vaine reporte<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of an Irish Arch Bishop prisoner in the tower, who refused to complie with the desires of the protestant Bishops, <hi>for his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and a large rewarde.</hi> But the Arch
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54322:26"/>
Bishop wanteth a name, and the Fabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> wanteth a ground; the witnesses and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaders are all unkowne. And if there had bene a grane of truth in this relation; yet in this case one man is no man, one mans refusall signifieth nothing.</p>
            <p>Against the evident truth of this assertion, two things may be opposed out of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of these Fathers. The First is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, concerning the Bishop of Landaffe, that he was no Protestant, but a Roman Catholick untill his death. So they say in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that <hi>he was the onely man of all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Bishops, that tooke the oath of Supremacy.</hi> Observe how prejudice and partiality doth blindfold men of learning and partes; They confess he tooke the oath of supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, and yet esteeme him a good Roman Catholick. I see censures go by favour, and one may Steale an horse, better then another looke over the hedge. I am well contented, that they reckon him for so good a Catholick.</p>
            <p>They adde, that <hi>he knew</hi> Parker <hi>and the rest which were to be ordered Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops to be hereticks, and averse from the Doctrine of the Roman Catholick Church, which he Constantly adhered unto, (the Supremacy onely excepted)
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54322:27"/>
during his life.</hi> And a little after they tell us, that <hi>he desired to be numbred among Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks.</hi> Now what if the Bishop of Landaff after all this should prove to be a protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t? Then all the Fathers story is quite spoiled. And so he was. If he knew <hi>Parker</hi> and the rest, to be heretickes, he knew himself to be one of their brother hereticks. His daily masse was the English Leiturgy, as well as theirs, He adhered constantly to a Protestant Bishoprick during his life, as well as any of them, And if he did not hold it as long as any of them, it was deaths fault, and none of his fault.</p>
            <p>They say <hi>they prevailed with him to give them a meeting at the Nagges head in Cheape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, where they hoped he would ordeine them Bishops, despairing that ever he would do it in a Church, because that would be too great and notorious a scandall for Catholicks.</hi> They were too modest. They might easily have prevailed with him, or have had him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to joine in their consecration in a Church, after a legall manner. He who did not stick at renouncing the Pope, and swearing an oath of Supremacy to his Prince, would not have stucke at a legall Ordination, upon the just command of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54322:27"/>
his Prince. But to desire him to do it in a taverne, in a clandestine manner, without the authority of the greate seale, before their election was confirmed, was to desire him out of Curtesy to run into a Premu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire, that is to forfeit his Bishoprick of Landaffe, his estate, his liberty. Is it become a more notorious scandall to Catholicks, to ordeine in a Church, then in a taverne, in the judgment of these fathers? There may be scandall taken at the former, but notorious scandall is given by the later.</p>
            <p>Here Bishop <hi>Bonner</hi> steppeth upon the stage, and had well neare prevented the whole pageant, by sending his <hi>Chaplein to the Bishop of Landaffe, to forbid him under paine of excommunication to exercise any such power of giving Orders in his diocesse, where with the old man being terrified, and other wise moved in conscience refused to proceed.</hi> Bishop <hi>Bonner</hi> was allwaies very fierce which way soever he went: If <hi>Acworth</hi> say true,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth cont. monar. Sander. l.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 195.</note> he escaped once very narrowly in <hi>Rome,</hi> either burning or boiling in scalding leade, for being so violent before the Assembly of Cardinalls, against the Pope, on the behalf of <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, if he had not secured himself by flight. Afterwards he made such bonefires of protestants,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54322:28"/>
and rendered himself so odious, that his prison was his onely safeguard from being torne in pieces by the People. But that was, <hi>dum stetit Iliam &amp; ingens Gloria Teu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crorum,</hi> whilest he had his Prince to be his second. Now he was deprived, and had no more to doe with the Bishoprick of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, then with the Bishoprick of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> he had the habituall power of the Keies, but he had no flock to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise it upon. If he had continued Bishop of <hi>London</hi> still, what hath the Bishop of <hi>London</hi> to do with the Bishop of <hi>Landaffe? Par in parem non habet potestatem.</hi> Thirdly, Bowes Church which is neare the <hi>Nagges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> wherein the Ecclesiasticall parte of this story, so farre as it hath any truth in it, was really acted, (that is the Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Arch Bishop Parkers election) though it be in the City of London, as many Churches more, is not in the Diocesse of London, but a Peculiar under the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction of the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, the Fathers say that <hi>when Parker and the rest see that he had refused, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled the poore old man, calling him doating foole, and some of them saying, This old foole thinketh that we can not be Bishops, unlesse we
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54322:28"/>
be greased.</hi> The contrary is evident by the Recordes of the confirmation, that Arch Bishop <hi>Parker</hi> was not present in person: So this whole narration is composed of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes, and mistakes, and incongruities, and contradictions. But that which disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth the falsity of it apparently to all the world is this, that the Bishop of Landaff lived and died a protestant Bishop, in the reigne of Queene Elisabeth, as he had bene formerly in the reigne of King Edward, for proofe whereof I produce two of their owne Authours.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sand. de Schism. l.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 350</note> The one is Sanders, <hi>But the Bishops, who had bene created out of the Church in those most wicked times, who had now repented from their hearts of their Schisme, being not contented wiih this common dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and confirmation, did each of them parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly crave pardon of their former grievous fault from the See Apostolick, and Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their Bishopricks, excepting the Bishop of Landaffe, who omitting it rather out of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence then malice, did onely relapse into Schisme in the reigne of Queene Elisabeth, as we interprete it by the just judgement of god.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Confut. Apol. parte</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</note> He acknowledgeth, that he became a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant againe, that is in their language, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapsed into Schisme.</hi> The other is cited by Doctor Harding, <hi>We had onely one foole
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54322:29"/>
among us,</hi> (we see whose livery the foole was,) <hi>who now I know not by what entisements is become yours, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy the name of a Lord and a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, whose learning is very little, and his credit by this action much lost.</hi> Thus writeth Doctor <hi>Harding</hi> of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Landaffe,</hi> about the fifth yeare of Queene <hi>Elisabeth,</hi> at which time he was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and continued protestant Bishop of <hi>Landaff.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A second objection against the truth of that which hath bene said of the competent Number of our Protestant Bishops to make a canonicall Ordination, is an exception against all the seven Bishops named in the letters Patents, that they were no true Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, because all of them were ordeined in a time of Schisme, and two of them in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time, according to a new forme of Ordination, and consequently they could not ordeine. <hi>That Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which was instituted by Edward the sixth was judged invalide by the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Brookes Novel, Cafes placit.</hi> 493.</note> 
               <hi>and so declared by publick judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Queene Maries reigne, in so much as leases made by King Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54322:29"/>
Bishops, though confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Deane and Chapiter were not esteemed available, because they were not (saith the sentence) consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor Bishops.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the First part of this objection, that our consecraters were ordeined themselves by Schismaticks or in a time of Schisme, I answer three waies. First this argument is a meere begging of the quaestion. The case in briefe is this.

               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:54322:32"/>
But if reordination be such a sacrilege, many Romanists are guilty of grosse sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, who reordeine those Proselites whom they seduce from us, with the same essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialls, matter and forme, imposition of hands, and these words <hi>Receive the holy Ghost</hi>; wherewith they had been formerly ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by us.</p>
            <p>Lastly I answer, (and this answer alone is sufficient to determine this controversy,) that King Edwards forme of ordination was judged valide in Queene Maries daies by all Catholicks, and particularly by Cardinall <hi>Pole</hi> then Apostolicall Legate in England, and by the then Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fourth, and by all the clergy and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of England. The case was this. In the Act for repealing all statutes made against the see of Rome, in the first and second yeares of Philip and Mary, the Lords Spirituall and Temporall in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment assembled, representing the whole body of the Realme of England, presented their common request to the King and Queene, that they would be a meanes to the Legate to obteine some settlements by authority of the Popes Holiness, for peace sake, in some Articles where of this is one. <hi>That institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Benefices and other Promotions
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54322:33"/>
Ecclesiasticall, and Dispensations made accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the forme of the Act of Parliament might be confirmed.</hi> Institutions could not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, except Ordinations were confirmed. For the greatest part of the English Clergy had received both their benefices and their holy orders, after the casting out of the Popes usurped authority out of <hi>England.</hi> And both benefices and holy orders are comprehended under the name of Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall Promotions. This will appeare much more clearely by the very words of the Cardinalls Dispensation, <hi>Ac omnes ecclesiasticas seculares seu quorumvis or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinum regulares personas, quae aliquas impetrationes, dispensationes, conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siones, gratias &amp; indulta, tam ordines quam beneficia Ecclesiastica, seu alias spirituales materias, pretensa authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate supremitatis Ecclesiae Anglicanae, licet nulliter &amp; de facto obtenuerint, &amp; ad cor reversae Ecclesiae unitati restitutae fuerint, in suis Ordinibus &amp; beneficiis, per nosipsos seu a nobis ad id deputatos misericorditer recipiemus, prout jam multae receptae fuerunt, secumque super his opportune in domino dispensabimus;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54322:33"/>
And we vvill graciously receive</hi> (or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terteine)
<hi>by our selves or by others depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by us to that purpose,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>(as many have already been received) in their Orders and in their Benifices, all Ecclesiasticall Perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s as well Secularas Regular of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Orders, vvhich have obteined any suites, dispensations, grants, graces, and indulgences, as vvell in their Ecclesiasticall Orders, as Benefices and other spirituall matters, by the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded authority of the Supremacy of the Church of England, though ineffectually and onely</hi> de facto, <hi>so they be penitent, and be returned to the unity of the Church. And vve vvill in due season dispense vvith them in the Lord for these things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we see evidently, that upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of the Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ds Spirituall and Temporall and Commons, being the representative body of the Church and Kingdome of England, by the intercession of the King and Queene, the Popes Legate did receive all persons, which had been Ordeined or Beneficed, either in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> or King <hi>Edward,</hi> in their respective Orders
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54322:34"/>
and Benefices, which they were actually possessed of, at the time of the making of this dispensation or Confirmation, without any exception or Condition, but onely this, that they were returned to the unity of the Catholick Church. Neither was there ever any one of them who were then retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, either deprived of their Benefices, or compelled to be reordeined. From whence I argue thus, Either King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighths Bishops and Priests, and likewise the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Priests Ordeined in King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the sixths time, had all the Essentialls of Episcopall and Priestly Ordination, which were required by the institution of Christ; and then they ought not to be reor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined, Then (in the judgement of these Fathers themselves) it is grievous sacrilege to reordeine them: Or they wanted some essentiall of their respective Ordinations, which was required by the institution of Christ; and then it was not in the power of all the Popes and Legates that ever were in the world, to confirme their respective Orders, or dispense with them to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute their functions in the Church. But the Legate did Dispense with them to hold their Orders, and exercise their severall functions in the Church, and the Pope
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54322:34"/>
did confirme that dispensation. This doth clearely destroy all the pretensions of the Romanists against the validity of our <hi>Orders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may perhaps be objected, that the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensative word is <hi>recipiemus, we will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi> not we do receive. I answer, the case is all one; If it were unlawfull to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them in the present, it was as unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to receive the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the future. All that was done after, was to take a particular absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or confirmation from the Pope or his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, which many of the Principall Clergy did, but not all; No not all the Bishops, Not the Bishop of <hi>Landaff,</hi> as <hi>Sanders</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>De Schism. l.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 305.</note> Yet he injoied his Bishoprick, So did all the rest if the Clergy, who never had any particular confirmation. It is not materiall at all, whether they were confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by a generall or by a speciall dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, so they were confirmed or dispensed with at all, to hold all their Benefices, and to exercise their respective Functions in the Church, which no man can denie.</p>
            <p>Secondly it may be objected, that it is said in the Dispensation, <hi>licet nulliter &amp; de facto obtenuerint, Although they had obteined</hi> their Benefices and Promotions <hi>ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and onely in fact</hi> without right: which
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54322:35"/>
doth intimate that their Orders were voide and null, before they had obteined this dispensation. I answer, that he stiled them voide and null, not absolutely but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively, <hi>quoad exercitium,</hi> because by the Roman law they might not be lawfully exercised without a Dispensation: but not <hi>quoad Characterem,</hi> as to the Character. If they had wanted any thing necessary to the imprinting of the Character, or any thing essentiall by the institution of Christ, the Popes Dispensation and Confirmation had been but like a seale put to a blanke piece of paper. And so the Cardinalls dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation in generall, and particularly for Benefices and Ecclesiasticall Promotions, Dispensations, and Graces given by such Order as the lawes of the Realme allowed and prescribed, in King <hi>Henries</hi> time and King <hi>Edwards</hi> time, was then and there ratified by act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Lastly, that this Dispensation was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards confirmed by the Pope, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve by the confession of <hi>Sanders</hi> himself, though a malicious enemy. <hi>He</hi> (that is Cardinall <hi>Pole,</hi> in a publick Instrument set forth in the name and by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Pope) <hi>Confirmed all Bishop
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54322:35"/>
which had bene made in the former Schisme,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>De Schism. l.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 350.</note> 
               <hi>so they were Catholick in their judgment of Religion, and the six new Bishopricks which King Henry had erected in the time of the Schisme. And this writing being affixed to the Statute, was published with the rest of the Decrees of that Parliament, and their minds were pacified. All which things were established and confirmed afterwards, by the Letters of Pope</hi> Paul <hi>the fourth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have seene, that there were a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent number of Protestant Bishops be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond 'Exception to make a Consecration: And so the necessity, which is their onely <hi>Basis</hi> or Foundation of the <hi>Nagges head</hi> Consecration, being quite taken away, this prodigious fable having nothing els to support the incredibilities and inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stencies of it, doth melt away of it self like winter ice.</p>
            <p>The fifth reason is drawen from that well known principle in Rethorick,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>A fifth reason</hi>

               <hi>Cui bono?</hi> or what advantage could such a consecration, as the <hi>Nagges head</hi> Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is pretended to have been, bring to the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54322:36"/>
Consecraters or the persons consecrated. God and Nature never made any thing in vaine. The haire of the head, the nailes upon the fingers ends, do serve both for ornament and muniment. The leafes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the blossomes, the blossomes produce the fruite, which is Natures end. In sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitives, the Spider doth not weave her webbes, nor the silly Bee make her celles in vaine. But especially intellectuall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have alwaies some end of their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Now consider, what good such a mock Consecratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> could doe the persons so consecrated? Could it helpe them to the possession of their Bishopricks by the law of England? Nothing lesse. There is such a concatenation of our English Customes and Recordes, that the counterfeiting of of any one can do no good, except they could counterfeite them all, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.</p>
            <p>When any Bishops See becommeth voide, there issueth a Writ out of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer to seise the Temporalties into the Kings hand, as being the ancient and well knowne Patron of the English Church; leaving the Spiritualties to the Arch Bishop or to the Deane and Chapiter, according to the custome of the place. Next the King
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54322:36"/>
granteth his <hi>Conge d'Eslire</hi> or his License to chuse a Bishop, to the Deane and Chapiter; upon the receite of this License, the Deane and Chapiter, within a certein number of daies, chuse a Bishop, and certifie their Election to the King, under the common seale of the Chapiter.</p>
            <p>Upon the returne of this Certificate, the King granteth out a Commission under the great seale of England to the Arch Bishop, or in the vacancy of the Arch Bishoprick to so many Bishops, to examine the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: and if they find it fairely made to confirme it, and after Confirmation to proceed to the Consecration of the person elected, according to the forme prescribed by the Church of England. This Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission or Mandate must passe both through the Signet office and Chancery, and be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested by the Clerkes of both those offices, and signed by the Lord Chanceller and Lord privy seale, and be inrolled. So as it is morally impossible there should be any forgery in it.</p>
            <p>Vpon the receite of this Mandate, the Bishops who are authorised by the King, do meete first at <hi>Bowes</hi> Church in <hi>London,</hi> where with the assistence of the Chiefe Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Judges of the Realme, the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54322:37"/>
Deane of the Arches, the Iudges of the Prerogative and Audience, with their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisters to Actuate what is done, they do solemnely in forme of law confirme the election. Which being done, and it being late before it be done, the Commissioners and Iudges were and are sometimes invited to the <hi>Nagges head</hi> to a dinner, as being very neare <hi>Bowes</hi> Church, and in those daies the onely place of note, This mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting led Mr. <hi>Neale</hi> (a man altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with such formes,) into this fooles Paradise; first to suspect, and upon suspicion to conclude, that they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an Ordination there, and lastly to broach his brainsick conceites in corners; and finding them to be greedily swallowed by such as wished them true, to assert his owne drowsy suspicion for a reall truth. But the mischief is, that Doctor <hi>Parker</hi> who was to be consecrated, was not present in person, but by his Proxie.</p>
            <p>After the Confirmation is done, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly about three or foure daies, (but as it happened in Arch Bishop <hi>Parkers</hi> case nine daies,) the Commissioners proceed to the Consecration; for the most part out of their respect to the Archbishop in the Chappell at
<hi>Lambeth,</hi> with Sermon, Sacrament, and all solemnity requisite, according to the forme
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:54322:37"/>
prescribed by the Church of <hi>England</hi>; in the presence of publick Notaries or sworne Officers, who reduce every thing that is done with all the circumstances into Acts, and enter them into the Register of the See of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> Where they are carefully kept by the principall Officer in a publicke office, as Recordes, where every one who desireth may view them from time to time, and have a copy of them if he please. And it is to be noted, that at any Consecration, especially of an Arch-Bishop, great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of principall Courtiers and Citisens are present: so as it is no more possible to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>Now if any man desire a reason why this first Commission was not executed, the best account I can give him is this, That it was directed to six Bishops, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an [<hi>aut minus, or at the least foure of you</hi>]: so as if any one of the six were sick or absent, or refused, the rest could not proceed to Confirme, or Consecrate. And that some of them did refuse, I am very apt to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve, because three of them not long after were deprived. But the Reader may note, First that there were three Protestant Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops in that First Commission. They who were such punctuall observers of the law of <hi>England,</hi> that they would not proceed to consecrate without a fourth, in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:54322:44"/>
of both the Archiepiscopall Sees, certeinly would never give way to a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate profane Ordination at the <hi>Nagges head,</hi> by one single Bishop. And secondly, that for all their pretended intelligence, our English Romish writers are great strangers to the true passages of those times, knowing nothing but what they heare at <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Rhemes,</hi> or <hi>Doway.</hi> If it were otherwise we should have heard of this Commission sooner.</p>

            <p>Before I proceed further, to prevent cavills, I must acquainte the Reader, that the Suffragan Bishop of <hi>Bedford</hi> is misna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Richard</hi> in the Rolles; by what mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake or errour, after so long time it is folly to inquire. We may Conjecture how it might easily, and most probably did come to passe: but to say positively how it did come to passe, whether it was the errour of the transcriber, or the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake of him who gave the instructions, or it was no faulte at all, (he might have two names, as many have had, and many
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:54322:46"/>
have and owne them severally,) is not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. In the Ecclesiasticall Register of the Church, he is alwaies stiled by his right name <hi>Iohn,</hi> throughout all the Acts of the Confirmation and Consecration of Arch Bishop <hi>Parker.</hi> Once his name had been written <hi>Richard,</hi> but it was corrected, and my friend assureth me, that it is the onely word in that long narration which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punged or interlined; So exact is that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde. This is certeine, his right name was <hi>Iohn,</hi> as it is in the Register. To this the Recordes of his own Consecration, and twenty other Recordes do beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
            <p>But as to the validity of the Act or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, it is not materiall whether his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me were <hi>Iohn</hi> or <hi>Richard,</hi> or both, or nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So he was truely ordeined himself, and did truely concurre in ordeining, it is no matter how he is Stiled in the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or in the Register.

            <p>There are two differences betweene these two Commissions. The first is an [<hi>aut minus, Or at the least foure of you</hi>], which clause is prudently inserted into all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions, where many Commissioners are named, least the sicknesse, or absence, or neglect of any one or more, might hinder the worke. The question is, why they are limited to foure, when the Canons of the Catholick Church require but three. The answer is obvious, because the Statutes of <hi>England</hi> do require foure in case one of the Consecraters be not an Arch Bishop, or deputed by one. Three had bene enough to make a valide Ordination, yea to make a Canonicall Ordination; and the Queene might have dispensed with her owne lawes: but she would have the Arch Bishop to be ordeined both according to the canons of the Catholick Church, and the known <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>awes of England.</p>
            <p>The second difference betweene the two Commissions is this, that there is a <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

[<hi>Supplyng by our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne authority all defects either in the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or in ihe Executers of this Commission, or any of them</hi>].

            </p>
            <p>But still the question is, to what end was this clause inserted? I answer, it is en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Others thinke, this clause might have relation to the present condition of Bishop <hi>Barlow</hi> and Bishop <hi>Scory,</hi> who were not yet inthroned into their new Bishopricks. It might be so, but if it was, it was a great mistake in the Lawiers who drew up the Commission. The Office and the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Bishop are two distinct things; Ordination is an act of the Key of Order, and a Bishop uninthroned may ordeine as well as a Bishop inthroned. The Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Suffragan Bishops, who had no peculiar Bishoprickes, was alwaies admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and reputed as good in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, (if the Suffragans had Episcopall Ordination,) as the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of rhe greatest Bishops in the wolrd.</p>
            <p>But since this clause doth extend ir self both to the Consecration and the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craters, I am confident that the onely

            </p>
            <p>This is the very case related by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. Now the exception of Bishop <hi>Bonner,</hi> and <hi>Stapleton,</hi> and the rest, was this. <hi>The booke of Ordination</hi> was expresly established by name by <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:54322:49"/>
And that Act was expresly repealed by Queene Mary: But <hi>the booke of Ordination</hi> was not expresly restored by Queene <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sabeth,</hi> but onely in generall termes under the name and notion of the Booke of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Praiers and administration of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and other orders rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. Therefore they who were ordeined according to the said forme of Ordination in the beginning of Queene <hi>Elisabeths</hi> time, were not legally ordeined. And those Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops which had bene ordeined according to that forme in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time, though they were legally ordeined then, yet they were not legall Bishops now, because Quee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <hi>Maries</hi> statute was still in force, and was not yet repealed.</p>
            <p>Is this all? Take courage Reader, Here is nothing that toucheth the validity of our Ordination, but onely the legality of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is easily satisfied. First I answe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly, it is also a part of our forme of Administration of the Sacraments. We denie not Ordination to be a Sacrament, though it be not one of those two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are generally necessary to salvation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, although it were supposed that Ordination were no Sacrament, nor the booke of Ordination a part of the booke of Common praier: yet no man can denie that it is a part of our Ecclesiasticall rites and ceremonies, and under that notion suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently authorised. Lastly,

They who have legislative power to make a law, have legislative power to expound a law.<note place="margin">8. <hi>Elc. cap.</hi> 1.</note> Queene <hi>Elisabeth</hi> and her Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made the law, Queene <hi>Elisabeth</hi> and her Parliament expounded the law, by the same authority that made it; declaring that under the booke of Common Praier, the forme of Ordination was comprehended and ought to be understood. And so ended the grand cavill of Bishop <hi>Bonner</hi> and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Sapleton</hi> and the rest, of the illega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of our Ordination; shewing nothing but this, how apt a drowning cause is to catch hold of every reed,</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Supplentes</hi> or this dispensative clause had Relation to this cavill, (which as it did breake out afterwards into an open controversy, so it was then whispered in corners,) is very evident by one clause in the Statute: that <hi>for the avoiding of all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions and ambiguities that might he objected against the lawfull Confirmations, investing, and Consecrations of any Arch-Bishops, Bishops &amp;c. the Queene in her Letters Patents had not onely used such words as had bene accustomed to be used by King Henry and King Edward, but also diverse other generall wordes, whereby her Highness by her Supreme power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, hath dispensed with all causes and doubts of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:54322:50"/>
any imperfection or disability that could be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</hi> The end of this clause and that Statute was the same: And this was the onely question or ambiguity which was moved.</p>
            <p>Yet although the case was so evident, and was so judged by the Parliament, that the forme of Consecration was compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under the name and notion of the booke of Common praier &amp;c: yet in the indictment against Bishop <hi>Bonner,</hi> I do commend the discretion of our Iudges, and much more the moderation of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. Criminall lawes should be written with a beame of the sun, without all ambiguity.</p>
            <p>Lastly, before I leave this third consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, I desire the Reader to observe three things with me. First, that this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensative neither hath, nor can be construed to have any reference to any Consecration that was already past, or that was acted by Bishop <hi>Scory</hi> alone; as that silly Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration at the <hi>Nagges head</hi> is supposed to have been.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that this dispensative clause doth not extend at all to the institution of Christ, or any essentiall of Ordination, nor to the Canons of the universall Church: but
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:54322:51"/>
onely to the Statutes and Ecclesiasticall lawes of England. <hi>Si quid desit aut deerit eorum quae per Statuta hujus Regni nostri, aut per leges Ecclesiasticas requiruntur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, that the Commissioners authorised by these Letters Pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate Arch Bishop <hi>Parker,</hi> did make use of this <hi>Supplentes</hi> or dispensative power in the Confirmation of the Election, which is a politicall Act, (as by the words of the Confirmation in the next paragraph shall appeare,) but not in the Consecration, which is a purely spirituall act, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth meerely to the Key of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>Fourthly we say, that by virtue of these Letters Patents of December the sixth, foure of the Commissioners therein named did meete in <hi>Bowes</hi> Church, upon the ninth day of the same moneth: and then and there with the advise of the chiefe Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Lawiers of the Kingdome, the Deane of the Arches, the Iudges of the Prerogative and Audience, did solemnely confirme the election. This is proved by the Recorde of the Confirmation or definitive sentence it self, in these words.</p>

            <p>I cite this the more largely, that our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries may see what use was made of the dispensation, whieh they cavill so much against: But in the Consecration which is an act of the Key of order, they made no use at all of it.

            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:54322:56"/>To this unanswerable reason, these Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers pretend to give two answers: But they are such as are able to satisfie any man, that no answer is to be expected. The first answer is in their printed booke pag. 16, that <hi>the word Recordes is but a generall terme.</hi> As if truth ought not to be regarded in generalls; as well as in particulars. Yet the termes which are added to <hi>Recordes,</hi> that is, [<hi>of her Fathers time, her brothers time, and her time</hi>], are no generall but restrei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning termes.</p>
            <p>They adde, that <hi>it is a word of course, which men do rather suppose then exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, when they mention things that have been practised in former times.</hi> What latitude these Fathers may allow their <hi>Confitents</hi> in case Theology for <hi>words of Course,</hi> I do not now examine; but what have words of Course to do in a printed law? They might as well tell the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in plaine termes, that they lied, or that they spake they knew not or regarded not what: as tell them that their words were but <hi>words of course.</hi> If these wordes of course were not true, why did not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hey confute them then, when all things were fresh in mens memories? No man
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:54322:57"/>
can beleeve that they did forbeare out of affection to the Parliament, but because they could not then oppose so evident truth.</p>
            <p>Yet they conclude it to be <hi>evident, that there were no such Recordes of Parkers consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> This is more then words of course, to charge the Parliament directly with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth. But how is it evident that there were no such Recordes? because <hi>they were never produced to those Roman Catholick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, who desired to see some evidence of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers Consecration.</hi> This is wonderfull, They were cited in printe, they were alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Parliament in the Publick <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes</hi> of the Kingdome, of which no man can pleade ignorance; and yet they tell us they were never produced. But to satisfie their very pretensions. Their exception<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> in those daies were of another nature, either against our English Ordinall, or against the <hi>Legality</hi> of our Bishops; which later exception hath been answered alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the former shall be answered i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> due place. The reason why Bishop <hi>Iewell,</hi> and Bishop <hi>Horne,</hi> and others did not ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> these Recordes more expressely, was no dread at all least they should be found to be counterfeit, but because they had no
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:54322:57"/>
need to cite them, to answer any thing that was objected against them. Either the Roman Catholick writers of those daies were false to their owne interest, to smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a thing which (if it had been true) had been so much to their advantage; which no rationall man can imagine: Or the <hi>Nagges head</hi> Ordination was altogether unknowne and unheard of in those daies; which is most certeine.</p>
            <p>But now the Fathers change their note, <hi>could they not be forged as well in Queene</hi> Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sabeths <hi>time as in King</hi> Iames <hi>his reigne</hi>? This is to blow hote and cold with the same breath. Before they demanded, <hi>how it was possible they should be extant then and not produced?</hi> Now they tell us, they might be extant then, and yet forged: Nay, such a dexterity they have in turning all which they touch into gold, that they make this very supposition that they were extant then, to be a proofe against us that they were forged. Therefore they were not produced, because <hi>in Queene Elisabeths time many were living, who would have proved them to be forged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Observe first, what honour and respect
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:54322:58"/>
our Countrymen do beare to our Princes and Parliaments united. Before they did as good as gave them the lie, And now they make them at the least Accessaries to forgery, so farre as to avouch and justifie forged Recordes. Secondly observe, with what confidence and conscience they say that these Recordes were never produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: And yet confesse that they were cited in Printe, and alleged in our very Statutes. If Bishop <hi>Iewell</hi> and Bishop <hi>Horne</hi> had cited them, (as they would have cited them if they had had occasion), they could have done no more then was done. Did any man upon this publication go about to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of forgery? No I warrant you, The case was too plaine to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced. The Parliament, and the booke of the lifes of the seventy Arch Bishops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> printed by <hi>Iohn Day Anno</hi> 1572. have spoiled the Fathers Arguments, [<hi>They were not produced, therefore they were forged</hi>]<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and furnished us with a demonstrative proofe of the contrary. They were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and cited in printe, and neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, nor so much as accused of forgery; Therefore they were not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
            <p>It seemeth this answer did not satisfie
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:54322:58"/>
the Fathers themselves: and therefore the one of them hath addeth a second ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in the margent, with his penne, in these words; <hi>The Act of Parliament relates onely to the Recordes of the Queenes Letters Patents, and not to the Recordes of the Bishops Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Ordination.</hi> They say that glosse is accursed which corrupteth and Contradicteth the text, as this glosse doth egregiously. The Statute speaketh expresly, of <hi>the Recordes of Elections and Confirmations and Consecrations,</hi> which are all of them Ecclesiasticall Acts, and none of them Recorded in the Rolles of Chancery, or any other civill Court of Recordes, but onely in the Ecclesiasticall Registers of the Arch-Bishops, Deanes and Chapiters respectively. This an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer is a groundlesse evasion.</p>
            <p>My fifth ground to prove that these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordes were not forged, is taken from that booke of the lifes of the seventy suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Arch-Bishops of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> printed in <hi>London</hi> in the yeare 1572; wherein the Authour, (that was Arch Bishop <hi>Parker</hi> himself,) having described the Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Consecrations of Bishop <hi>Grindall,</hi>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:54322:59"/>
Bishop <hi>Sands,</hi> Bishop <hi>Iewell,</hi> Bishop <hi>Horne,</hi> and all the rest of those first Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Bishops, he addeth in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, <hi>Hae confirmationes &amp; consecratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in Registris apparent: These confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and consecrations de appeare in the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</hi> Then the Registers were then extant, and not onely extant but publickly prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whilest all things were fresh in mens memories, yet no man did or durst except against the truth of them; So free they were not onely from corruption, but from suspicion.</p>
            <p>The sixth and last ground to prove that the Recordes were not forged, is taken from the agreement and concurrence of our civill Recordes (which no man ever doubted of) with our Ecclesiasticall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisters. We have seene the Queenes Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Pate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, directed to seven other Bishops, for the confirmation and consecration of Arch-Bishop <hi>Parker,</hi> dated the sixth of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember anno</hi> 1559; Therefore upon the sixth of <hi>December</hi> 1559 he was neither Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med nor Consecrated. We have seene the Ecclesiasticall Recordes, how by virtue of those very Letters Patents, he was confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med upon the ninth day, and consecrated upon the seventeenth day of the same
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:54322:59"/>
Moneth. We find three other Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, directed to Arch-Bishop <hi>Parker</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self as a Consecrated Bishop, for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation and Consecration of other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops; namely <hi>Richard Coxe, Edmund Grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall,</hi> and <hi>Edwin Sandes,</hi> dated the Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>December,</hi> that is the very next day after his consecration: Therefore he was then consecrated. And this agreeth exactly with the Ecclesiasticall Register.</p>

That forme differeth from our forme in all things. In the Consecrater, or Minister of the Consecration: We must have three Bishops at the least, there was but one.

            <p>My third witnesse is <hi>Mr. Hart,</hi> a stiffe Roman Catholick, but a very ingenuous person, who having seene undoubted co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of Doctor <hi>Reynolds</hi> his Ordination by Bishop <hi>Freake,</hi> and of Bishop <hi>Freakes</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration by Arch Bishop <hi>Parker,</hi> and lastly of Arch Bishop <hi>Parkers</hi> owne, Consecration: he was so fully satisfied with it, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:54322:66"/>

            </p>
            <p>A fifth witnesse is Mr. Wadsworth, who in an Epistle to a freind in England doth testifie, that <hi>before he left England he read the Consecration of Arch Bishop Parker in our Registers.</hi> This made him so mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate above his fellowes, that whereas some of them tell of five, and the most of them of fifteen, which were consecrated at the Nagges head,<note place="margin">

to come to London to be consecrated; That he should leave all those Churches in London, which are immediately under his owne Iurisdiction, to chuse a common taverne, as the fittest place for such a worke; That Bishop Bonner being deprived of his Bishoprick, and a prisoner in London, should send Neale from Oxford, and send a command by him to one over whom he never had any Iurisdiction; That the other Bishop being then a Protestant should obey him being a Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, when there were so many Churches in the City to performe that worke in, where the Bishop of London never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended any Iurisdiction; That these things should be treated, and concluded, and executed all at one meeting; that Bishop Bonner did foresee it would be so, And command his servant to attend there untill he see the end of that businesse.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ive Reader may easily perceive he feared to be caught in a lie.</hi> First, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers seem to argue after this manner; Many Athenian writers did mention the Cretan Bulls and Minotaurs and Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, but no Cretan did write against them, therefore those ridiculous Fables were true. Rather, the Cretans laughed
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:54322:69"/>
at their womannish <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>evenge, to thinke to repaire themselves for a beating, with scolding and lying: such ridiculous Fictions ought to be entertained with scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne and contempt, <hi>Spreta exolescunt, si iras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caris agnita videmur.</hi> Secondly, it might be (for any thing I know to the contrary) Mr. <hi>Mason</hi> was the first who dissected this lie, and laid the falsity of it open to the world: but he was not the first who avou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and justified the Canonicall Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, and personall Succession of our Protestant Bishops, which is the same thing in effect; the Bishop of <hi>Hereford</hi> did it before him, and Doctor <hi>Reynolds</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Bishop of <hi>Hereford,</hi> and he that writ the life of Arch-Bishop <hi>Parker</hi> before Doctor <hi>Reynolds,</hi> and the Parliament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him that writ Arch Bishop <hi>Parkers</hi> life, and the publick Registers of the Church before the Parliament.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they would make us believe that this Fable was ancient, and published to the world from the beginning of Queen <hi>Elisabeths</hi> time in print, and unanswered by the Protestants untill the 13, of King <hi>Iames:</hi> but there is no such thing. For their credit, let them produce one Authour that mentioneth it in the beginning of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:54322:70"/>
Queen <hi>Elisabeths</hi> time, or if they cannot doe that, for forty yeares after, that is, before the yeare 1600: or otherwise the case is plain that it is an upstart lie, newly coined about the beginning of King <hi>Iames</hi> his time; the Fathers would not have us answer it before it was coined, or before it was known to us.</p>
            <p>Where they say that Mr, <hi>Mason</hi> did handle this Controversy <hi>weakly and faintly,</hi> they know they doe him wrong: He hath so thrashed their Authours, <hi>Fusherbert,</hi> and <hi>Fitz-Simon,</hi> and <hi>Holywood,</hi> and <hi>Constable,</hi> and <hi>Kellison,</hi> and <hi>Champney,</hi> that the cause hath wanted a Champion eversince, untill these Fathers tooke up the Bucklers. But whereas they adde, that <hi>Mr. Mason vvas affraid to be convinced by some aged per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that might then be living, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member vvhat passed in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Queen</hi> E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:54322:70"/>Why did none of their Authors goe to him, or imploy some of their Friends to inquire of him?

            <p>They say, <hi>in the yeare</hi> 1603, <hi>none of the Protestant Clergy durst call it a fable, as some now doe.</hi> I am the man, I did call it so, I do call it so. Such a blind relation as this is, of a businesse pretended to be acted in the yeare 1559, being of such consequence, as whereupon the succession of the Church of <hi>England</hi> did depend, and never publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed untill after the yeare 1600, as if the Church of England had neither Friends nor Enemies; deserveth to be stiled <hi>a Tale of a Tub</hi> and no better.</p>

               </gap> Mr. <hi>Holywords</hi> bables: but if ever such a a question was proposed to him, it may be after a clear answer to the matter of Fact
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:54322:71"/>
he might urge this as <hi>argumentum ad homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem</hi>; that though both Bishop <hi>Scory</hi> and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Coverdale</hi> had been but simple Priests, (as they were complete Bishops), yet joi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with Bishop <hi>Barlow</hi> and Bishop <hi>Hodgskings,</hi> two undoubted Bishops (otherwi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e <hi>Gardiner</hi> and <hi>Bonner</hi> and <hi>Tunstall</hi> and <hi>Thurleby</hi> and the rest were no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,) the Ordination was as Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall, as for one Bishop and two Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred Abbats to consecrate a Bishop (which you allow in case of Necessity), or one Bishop and two simple Presbyters to consecrate a Bishop by Papall Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation. So this question will not concern us at all, but them very much, to reconcile themselves to themselves. They teach that the matter and form of Ordination are essentialls of Christs own Institution, They teach that it is grievous Sacrilege to change the matter of this Sacrament, They teach that the matter of Episcopall Ordination is Imposition of hands of three Bishops, upon the person consecrated: and yet with them one Bishop and two Abbats, or one Bishop and two simple Priests extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily by Papall dispensation, may or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dein Bishops. The essentialls of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments doe consist <hi>in indivisibili,</hi> once Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:54322:72"/>
alwaies Essentiall, whether ordinarily, or extraordinarily whether with dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or without. So this Question whether a Priest in case of Necessity may ordein Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, doth concern them much, but us not at all. But for my part I believe the whole Relation is feined, for so much as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth Bishop <hi>Bancroft.</hi>

            <p>You say, <hi>Parker and the rest of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Bishops, not being able to answer the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick arguments against the invalidity of their Ordination</hi> &amp;c.

form of Ordination which you feign to have bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> used at the <hi>Nagges head,</hi> as <hi>illegall,</hi> and <hi>extravagant,</hi> and (which weigheth more then both of them) invalid, as much as yourselves.</p>
            <p>They <hi>were forced to begge an act of Parliament, whereby they might enjoy the Temporalities, not withstanding the known defects of their Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration &amp;c.</hi> O Ingenuity! whither art thou Fled out of the world?

Did the Parliament ever make any such establishment of their Temporalties, more then of their Spiritualties? Did the Parliament ever take any notice of any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of their Consecration? Nay, did not the Parliament declare their Consecration to have been free from all defects? Nay, doth not the Parliament quite contrary, brand these Reports for <hi>slanderous speeches,</hi>
               <note place="margin">8. <hi>Elis. cap.</hi> 1.</note> and justify their Consecrations to have <hi>been duely and orderly done, according to the Lawes of this Realm</hi>: and that <hi>it is very evident and apparent, that no cause of scruple ambiguity or doubt, can be justly objected</hi> against their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions Confirmations or Consecrations.</p>
            <p>Yet they give a reason of what they say, <hi>for albeit</hi> Edward <hi>the sixths rite of Ordination was reestablished by Act of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:54322:75"/>
Parliament in the first yeare of Queen</hi> Elisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth: <hi>yet it was notorious that the Ordination at the</hi> Nagges head <hi>was very different from it, and formed</hi> extempore <hi>by</hi> Scoryes <hi>Puritani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Spirit &amp;c.</hi> I take that which you grant out of <hi>Sanders,</hi> that King <hi>Edwards</hi> Form of Ordination, was reestablished by Act of Parliament 1. <hi>Elisabethae</hi>; wherein you doe unwittingly condemne both Bishop <hi>Bonners</hi> and <hi>Stapletons</hi> plea of illegality. The rest which you say is partly true and partly false. It is very true that there is great difference between the English Form of Ordeining, and your <hi>Nagges head</hi> Ordination, as much as is between the head of a living horse and the sign of the <hi>Nagges head,</hi> or between that which hath a reall entity and an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary <hi>Chim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Then they repeat the words of a part of the Statute, and thence conclude, <hi>By which Act appeares that not onely King</hi> Edwards

               <hi>rite, but any other used since the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Queeens reign, upon her Commission was enacted for good, and consequently that of the Nagges head might passe. Cujus co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarium verum est.</hi> The Contrary to what these Fathers infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, doth follow necessarily from these words which the Fathers cite. The words of the Act are these, [<hi>By virtue of the Queens Letters Patents or Commission</hi>]: Every one of the Letters Patents is extant in the Rolles, not one of them did ever authorise any form but that which was legally establis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed; that is, the Form of <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth. First, the Queens Letters Patents or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission hath an <hi>aut minus</hi> in it, <hi>or at the least three or foure of you</hi>: but to justify the <hi>Nag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges head</hi> Ordination, the <hi>aut minus</hi> must be altered to <hi>at the least</hi> one or two of you. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Queens Letters Patents have alwaies this clause in them: <hi>Iuxta Formam &amp; effectum Statutorum in ea parte editorum &amp; provisorum; According to the form and effect of the Statutes in that case made and provided:</hi> but the Statutes allow no lesse number then four, or at the least three to ordein, At the <hi>Nagges head</hi> (you say there was but one
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:54322:76"/>
Ordeiner. Our Statutes prescribe <hi>Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hands</hi> as the Essentiall matter of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, and these words, <hi>Receive the Holy Ghost</hi> as the form of Ordination: but your <hi>Nagges head</hi> Ordination is a mere Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasm, without matter or Forme; our Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes allow no such fanaticall and Phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall Formes, as your Form of the <hi>Nagges head.</hi> And so your Consequence, [<hi>Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that of the Nagges head might passe</hi>], is foundered of all four, and can neither passe nor repasse, unlesse you can rase these words [<hi>by virtue of the Queens Letters Patents</hi>] out of the Statute, and insert these [<hi>without the Queens Letters Patents</hi>]: and likewise rase these words out of the Commission [<hi>according to the Form and effect of the Statutes</hi>], and insert these [<hi>contrary to the Form and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the Statutes</hi>]. A single Falsification will doe your cause no good. Two poisons may perchance help it at a dead lift.</p>
            <p>It is in vain to tell us, that Mr <hi>Mason see this over clear to be denied,</hi> who know better that Mr. <hi>Mason</hi> did not onely deny it over and over again, but sqeesed the poore Fable to durt. I have shewed you particularly what was the end of the Queens Dispensations,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:54322:76"/>
the same which is the end of Papall Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations, to meet with latent objections or cavills. I have shewed you what that Cavill was; which needed no Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in point of Law, but onely to stop the mouths of Gainsaiers. But where you adde, that <hi>the Queens Dispensation was given, not in conditionall but in very absolute Termes</hi>: You are absolutely mistaken. The Queens dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation was both in Generall Termes, which determin nothing, (not like the Popes Dispensations, <hi>A quibusvis excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municationis suspensionis &amp; interdicti sententiis</hi>): and also in these condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall Terms, <hi>si quid &amp;c. desit aut deerit eorum quae per Statuta hujus reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni nostri, aut per leges Ecclesiasticas in hac parte requiruntur: If any thing is or shall be wanting, which are required by the Lawes Civill or Ecclesiasticall of this Kingdome.</hi> You see it is conditionall and hath reference onely to the Lawes of <hi>England.</hi>

            <p>They goe on, <hi>the truth is, all the world laughed at the</hi> Nagges head <hi>Consecration, and held it to be invalid, not so much for being performed in a Tavern, as for the new form invented by</hi> Scory.
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:54322:77"/>
If all the world did laugh at it in those dayes, they laughed in their sleeves, where no body could see them laugh. It had been too much to laugh at a jeast before it was made, nay before it was devised. The Reader may well wonder, how <hi>all the world</hi> came to get notice of it so early as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> reign, and we onely in <hi>England</hi> should heare nothing of it for above 40 yeares after? but assoone as we did heare of it, we laught at it as well as they, and held it as invalid as they could doe for their hearts; but they laught at it as Bishop <hi>Scoryes</hi> Invention, and we laught at it as theirs.</p>

But finall sentence there was never any given, untill the Parliament gave a finall sentence in it, That Bishop <hi>Horn</hi> and all the rest were legall Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops.

            <p>They tell us, <hi>he was a man specially shot at.</hi> Rather he was a man graciously preserved by the Queens mercy, from the rage of the Common people against him.

He who had so great a hand in framing the Oath, He who had taken it himself, both in King <hi>Henryes</hi> time, and King <hi>Edwards</hi> time, and made so many others to take it, He who had been so great a stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler in <hi>Rome</hi> for the Kings Supremacy, who writ that Preface before Bishop <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diners</hi> booke <hi>de vera Obedientia</hi>: if he had suffered by the Oath of Supremacy, he had but been scourged with a rod of his own making.</p>
            <p>Their next reason to prove the Nullity of our Holy Orders, is taken from <hi>the constant Practice of the Romane Catholicks, to Reor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dein Protestant Ministers, not condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally but absolutely,</hi> which they call <hi>an evident Argument of our mere Laity.</hi> A doughty Argument indeed, drawn from their own

But none of all your Doctors did ever urge any such thing, as required that we should cite the Registers in prudence, as by a cleare answer to all your Testimonies shall appeare. The water did not stop there in those dayes: yet even in Arch Bishop <hi>Parkers</hi> life time the Consecration of our Bishops was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished to the world in Print; either shew us as much for your <hi>Nagges head</hi> Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or hold your peace for ever. Bishop <hi>Andrews</hi> the learned Bishop of <hi>Winchesters absurdities falsities and lies,</hi> are easily talked of, men may talke of black Swans: but he who hath laid your greatest Champions in the dust, requires another manner of Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer then Mr. <hi>Fitzherbert.</hi>

This is enough to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer your Objection; this is enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute your Romance of the <hi>Nagges head.</hi> Yet thus much you yourselves confesse, in the same Paragraph, that in a booke prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the yeare 1605 (that is eight yeares before the yeare 1613, wherein you say that Mr, <hi>Mason</hi> printed his booke) called <hi>Antiquitates Britanniae,</hi> there is <hi>a Register of the Protestant Bishops of</hi> England: The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there was a Register of the Consecration of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Bishops extant, before Mr. <hi>Mason</hi> did write of that subject.

How should we give credit to a man who tells us three notorious untruths in foure lines? First, that it is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that <hi>Archbishop</hi> Parker <hi>was made a Bishop by</hi> Barlow Scory <hi>and three others,</hi> by virtue of a Commission from Queen <hi>Elisabeth</hi>: he was made a Bishop by Barlow Scory and two others. Secondly, that this work was acted on the 17. day of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, An: 1559, which was acted on the 17. Day of December 1559.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>pa.</hi> 10.</note> Thirdly, that <hi>we had no form then or Order to doe such a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>; whereas you yourselves confesse, that <hi>Edward the sixths rite of Ordination, was reesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in the First yeare of Queen Elisabeth</hi>: and Archbishop <hi>Parkers</hi> Ordination was in the second of Queen <hi>Elisabeth.</hi> He who stumbles so thick and three fold, may erre in his viewing the Manuscript as well as the rest. But to gratify you, suppose it was <hi>foisted in,</hi> what good will that doe you? It must of necessity be foisted in before it was printed, it could not be foisted
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:54322:83"/>
in after it was printed, And it must be foi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted in by a Protestant, for no Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick would foist it in. So still you see a Register of Protestant Bishops, was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished to the world in print, eyght yeares before <hi>Mr. Mason</hi> published his booke.</p>
            <p>Your Friend saith, that <hi>this printed Booke of</hi> Parkers Antiquitates Britanniae, <hi>is the first that mentioneth any such pretended Consecration of him and the rest.</hi> So it might be well when it was first printed, that was not in the yeare 1605, but in Arch-Bishop <hi>Parkers</hi> life time, three yeares before his death, An. 1570. So much you might have lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the very Title-page of the Booke, printed at <hi>Hannovv; Historia antehac non nisi semel, nimirum Londini in Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibus Iohannis Day anno</hi> 1572. <hi>excusa: That this History vvas printed formerly at</hi> London <hi>in the house of</hi> Iohn Day <hi>in the yeare</hi> 1572. This doth utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the Credit of your Friends Relation, that he had viewed the Manuscript of that Booke.

            <p>Your Friends last Exception against the Authority of that booke called <hi>Antiquita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes Britanniae,</hi> is, that <hi>it conteineth more things done after Matthew Parker had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that Booke.</hi> So you confesse that Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop <hi>Parker</hi> himself (about whom all our controversy is,) was the Author of that booke; wherein I agree with you. The conclusion of the Preface, and many other reasons invite me to doe so. Surely this Author meant that there is something con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in this Register, which is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Compasse of the following Lifes in the <hi>Hannow</hi> Edition. (that may well be because <hi>Matthew Parkers</hi> life is foisted out in this Edition:) but there is nothing which was not in the <hi>London</hi> Edition, much more largely then it is in this Register, especially for the Confirmations and Consecrations of our Protestant Bishops: there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing after the time when this Register was made, which is prefixed in the Frontispice of it in the Hannow E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, with M P for <hi>Matthew Parker.
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:54322:85"/>
Matthew Parker</hi> died May the 27, <hi>Anno</hi> 1575: he printed his booke at <hi>London</hi> three yeares before his death, without the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours name, in the yeare 1572. I appeale to the ingenuous Reader, (let him be of what Communion he will, or never so full of prejudice), whether it be credible, that Arch Bishop <hi>Parkers</hi> own booke should be printed in <hi>London,</hi> by the Queens Printer, in his life time, and have any thing foisted into it contrary to his sense.</p>
            <p>Here then we have a Register of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Bishops, with their Confirmations and Consecrations, published to the world in Print at <hi>London,</hi> by Arch Bishop <hi>Parker</hi> himself, (who was the principall person and most concerned in that Controversy,) as if it should dare all the Adversaries of our Church to except against it, if they could<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Registers cannot be concealed, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies kept in the most publick and conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous places of great Cities, whither every one hath accesse to them who will. They need no printing, but this was printed (a work of supererogation). They who dared not to except against it then, when it was fresh in all mens memories, ought not to be admitted to make conjecturall exceptions now.</p>
            <p>Now the Fathers come to shew, how
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:54322:85"/>
their Doctors did object to our Protestant Clergy, <hi>the Nullity and Illegality of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination.</hi> If their Doctors give a cause or reason of their knowledge, we are bound to answer that: but if they object nothing but their own Iudgement and authority, we regard it not; their judgement may weigh some thing with them, but nothing at all with us. This is not to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Advocates, but Iudges over us, which we do not allow. If I should produce the Testimonies of fourscore Protestant Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, who affirm that we have a good Succession, or that their Succession is not good, what would they value it?</p>
            <p>The first is Doctor <hi>Bristow; Consider what Church that is, whose Ministers are but very Laymen, unsent, uncalled, unconsecrated, holding therefore amongst us when they repent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, no other place but of Laymen, in no case admitted, no nor looking to Minister in any Office, unlesse they take Orders which before they had not.</hi> Here is Doctor <hi>Bristows</hi> Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but where are his grounds? He bringeth none at all, but the practise of the Roman Church, and that not generall. <hi>Paul</hi> the 4, and Cardinall <hi>Poole,</hi> and the Court of Rome in those dayes were of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Iudgement, and so are many others: and so may they themselves come to be,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:54322:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
when they have considered more serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the matter, that we have both the same old Essentialls. That which excuseth their Reordination from formall Sacrilege (for from materiall it cannot be excused upon their own grounds,) is this, that they cannot discover the truth of the matter of Fact, for the hideous Fables raised by our Countrymen. But where is the <hi>Nag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges head</hi> Ordination in <hi>Dr. Bristow</hi>? Then had been the time to have objected it, and printed it, if there had bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any reality in it. Either <hi>Dr. Bristow</hi> had never heard of this Pageant, or he was ashamed of it. Here we meet with <hi>Dr. Fulke</hi> again, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d what they say of him shall be a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>swered in its proper place</p>
            <p>Their next witnesse is <hi>Mr. Reinolds, There is no Heardman in all Turky, who doth not undertake the Government of his Heard, upon better reason and greater right Order and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, then these your magnificent Apostles. &amp;c.</hi> And why an <hi>Heardsman in Turky,</hi> but onely to allude to his Title of <hi>Calvino Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cismus</hi>? An heardsman in Turky hath as much right to order his heard, as an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardman in Christendome; unlesse perhaps your <hi>Dr.</hi> did think, that Dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Grace, not in nature. This is saying, but we expect proving. It is well known that you pretend more to a <hi>magnificent Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolate,</hi>

them we. If the authority of the holy Scripture (which knoweth no other Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialls of Ordination; but <hi>imposition of hands</hi> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d these words <hi>Receive the Holy Ghost,</hi>) if the perpetual practise of the universall church, if the Prescription of the ancient Councell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and above 200.

But on the contrary, there is no <hi>Heardman in Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky</hi> who hath not more sufficient grounds or assura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the lawfulnesse of his Office, then you have for the discharge of your Holy Orders, upon your own grounds.

onely whereupon, the Validity or Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of Ordination doth depend: but onely from the Lawes of <hi>England.</hi> First for the Canons, we maintein that our Form of Episcopall Ordination hath the same Essentialls with the Roman: but in other things of an inferiour allay it differeth from it. The Papall Canons were never admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for binding Lawes in <hi>England,</hi> further then they were received by our selves, and incorporated into our Lawes: but our Ordination is conformable to the Canons of the Catholick Church, which prescribe no new Matter and Form in Priestly Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. And for our Statutes, the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament hath answered that Objection suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, shewing clearly, that the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our first Protestant Bishops was le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall, and for the Validity of it, we crave no mans favour.</p>
            <p>Their last witnesse is <hi>Dr. Harding,</hi> who had as good a will (if there had been any reality in it) to have spoken of the <hi>Nagges head</hi> Ordination as the best, but he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not a Syllable of it more then the rest: and though they keep a great stirre with him, he bringeth nothing that is worth the weighing. First he readeth us a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Lecture, that Sacerdos <hi>Signifieth both a Priest and a Bishop.</hi> Let it signify so,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:54322:88"/>
and in <hi>St. Hieroms</hi> sense, what will he inferre from thence? Next, he askes Bishop Iewell <hi>of Bishoply and Priestly vocation and sending.</hi> What new canting language is this? Could he not as well have made use of the old Ecclesiasticall word of <hi>Ordination</hi>? Third<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly he taxeth the Bishop, that <hi>he answereth not by what example hands were laid on him, or who sent him.</hi> What doth this concern any questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between them and us? Hands were laid on him by the example of Christ, of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, of the Primitive and Modern Church: so Christ se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t him, the King se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t him, the Church sent him, in severall respects. He telleth us, that when he had <hi>duely considered</hi> his Protestant Ordination in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time, <hi>he did not take himself for lawfull deacon in all respects.</hi> If his Protestant Ordination were a Nullity (as these me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> say), the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was a lawfull Deacon in no respect. Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the 4. and Cardinall <hi>Poole</hi> were of another mind. Then follow his two grand excepit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against our Ordination, wherein you shal find nothing of your <hi>Nagges head</hi> fable The former exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, that King <hi>Edwards</hi> Bishops <hi>who gave Orders, were out of Orders themselves,</hi> The second is, that <hi>they ministred not orders according to the Rite a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d manner of the Catholick Church.</hi> For the former exception, I referre him to the Councell of <hi>Carthage</hi> in

            <p>Their next proofe against our Records, is taken from the Contradictions of our Writers, Mr. Masons <hi>Registers and Records, disagree with those that</hi> Mr. Goodwin <hi>used in his Catalogue of Bishops, sometimes in the Day sometimes in the moneth, sometimes in the year.</hi> And againe, <hi>Mr. Mason Sutcliffe and Mr. Butler, all speaking of</hi> Mr. Parkers <hi>Consecration, doe all differ one from another in naming his Consecraters</hi>; Mr. Mason <hi>saith it was done by Barlow, Scory, Coverdale<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Hodgskins.</hi> Mr. Sutcliffe <hi>saith, besides the three first there vvas tvvo Suffragans.</hi> M Butler <hi>saith, the Suffragan of</hi> Dover <hi>vvas one. vvho is not named in the Commission. So as these men seem to have had three Disagreeing Registers.</hi> I answer, first that it is scarcely possible to avoid errours in transcribing and printing of Bookes, in the Authors absence, especially in names and numbers. To keep a balling and a stirre about these <hi>Errata</hi> of the pen or of the presse, is like the barking of little Curres,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:54322:90"/>
which trouble the whole Vicinage about the Mooneshining in the Water. Such were the most of these.</p>
            <p>Secondly supposing that some very few of these were the reall mistakes of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, yet innocent mistakes, which have no plot in them or design of Interest or Advantage, which conduce neither <hi>pro</hi> nor <hi>contra</hi> to any Controversy that is on Foot, they ought not to be exaggerated or pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed severely; It is the Wisdome of a wise man to passe by an Infirmity. Such are all these petty Differences. Whether Arch-Bishop <hi>Parker</hi> was consecrated by three City Bishops and two Suffragan, or by three City Bishops and one Suffragan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, and whether this one Suffragan were Suffraga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Bedford</hi> or Suffragan of <hi>Dover,</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>duceth nothing to any Controversy which is on Foot in the Church, and signifieth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the Validity or invalidity, legality or illegality, canonicalnesse or uncanoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calnesse of his Ordination. All Memories are not so happy, to remember names and numbers, after a long distance of time, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially if they entered but by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and were not <hi>Oculis subjecta fidelibus.</hi> I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> any man should put me to depose (wanting my notes and memorialls,) what Priests
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:54322:90"/>
did impose hands upon me with Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Mathews</hi> at my Priestly Ordination, or what Bishops did joine with my Lord Primate of <hi>Ireland</hi> at my Episcopall Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, I could not doe it exactly. I know there were more then the Canons doe require, at either Ordination; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre my self to the Register. Whether two Suffragans or one Suffragan, is an easy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake. when there were two in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, and but one at the Consecration: so is the Suffragan of <hi>Dover</hi> for the Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan of <hi>Bedford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, whether these were the faults of the pen or the presse or the Authour: yet after retractation it ought not to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. It is inhumane to charge any man with that fault, which he himself had cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and amended. Bishop <hi>Goodwin</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected all these errours himself, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Monitor, and published his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of his errours to the world in Print long since, in a new Edition of his booke. Likewise Dr. <hi>Sutcliffe</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged his mistake and gave order to <hi>Mr. Mason</hi> to publish it to the world, as he did.</p>
            <p>To ground exceptions upon the errours of the presse, or the slips of the tongue or
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:54322:91"/>
pen or of the memory, after they have been publickly amended, is like flies to delight in sores, and neglect the body when it is sound. I have the same errour crept into a booke of mine, of [five] for [four], how it came I know not, for the booke was printed in my absence: but I have corrected it in mine own Copy and in many Copies of my Friends, where I meet with the booke.</p>
            <p>Lastly, there is no danger in such petty differences, so long as all parties doe sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themselves to the publick Registers of the Church, as all these writers doe; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though is may be some of them were better acquainted with Polemick Writers, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with Registers, or the practicall customes of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> The very Reference or submission of themselves to the Register, is an Implicit retractation of their errours. As in a City the Clocks may differ, and the peoples Iudgements of the time of the day, but both Clocks and Clerkes must submit to the Sun dyall when the sun shineth out: so all private memorialls must be, and are submitted to the publick Register of the Church. Where these Fathers talk of plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Registers, they erre because they understand not our Customes. Every Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:54322:91"/>
throughout the Kingdome hath one Registry at least, every Dean and Chapter hath a Registry. The ordinations of Priests and Deacons, and the Institution of Clerkes to Benefices, are recorded in the Registries of the Respective Bishops, in whose dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses they are ordeined and instituted. The elections of Bishops and Inthronisations and Installations, in the Registry of the respective Deans and Chapiters: and the Confirmations and Consecrations of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops, in the Registry of the Archbishop where they are consecrated; except th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of their Ordination will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>atisfy you, that they were no Enthusiasts, (as you imagin,) you may quickly receive satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: But if they had said any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our Lawes and Canons, you must
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:54322:92"/>
not thinke to wrangle the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gland out of a good possession, by private voluntary speculations. Let us see what these Doctrs say as you allege them, for I have not their bookes in present. Mr. <hi>Whitaker</hi> saith, <hi>I would not have you thinke we make such reckoning of your Orders, as to hold our own Vocation unlawfull without them.</hi> You see Doctor <hi>Whitaker</hi> justifieth our Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this very place as lawfull, and much more plainly elswhere in his writings. That <hi>though our Bishops and Ministers be not Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined by Papisticall Bishops, yet they are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and lawfully ordeined</hi>: Again, <hi>The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists account none lawfull Pastors, but such as are created according to their Form or Order.</hi> These are your two main Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our Ordination, that we are not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined by Bishops of your Communion. That we are not ordeined according to the Roman Form. In both of these Doctor <hi>Whitaker</hi> is wholy for us against you, that which he maketh no reckoning of, is your Form of Ordination, as it is contradistinct from ours, as it is in many things, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in your double matter and Form in Priestly Ordination.</p>
            <p>You say Mr. <hi>Fulke</hi> speakes more plainly Let us heare him. <hi>You are highly deceived
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:54322:93"/>
if you thinke we esteem your Offices of Bishops Priests and Deacons better then Laymen: and with all our heart we defie, abhorre, detest, and spit at your stinking, greasy, Antichristian Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi> This is high enough indeed, and might have been expressed in more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate termes: but it is to be expounded, not of the invalidity of your Ordination, as if it wanted any Essentiall, but partly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the not using or abusing these sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Offices, and partly in respect of the Lawes of <hi>England.</hi> Excesses may make an Ordination unlawfull, although they do not make it invalid. Holy Orders are an excellent Grace conferred by God for the Conversion of men: but if those who have them, instead of preaching truth do teach errours to his people, and adulterate the old Christian Faith by addition of new Articles, they are no longer true Pastors, but Wolves which destroy the Flock, and so they are not onely no better, but worse then Lay men, <hi>Corruptio optimi pessima.</hi> In this respect they tell you, that your Priests and Bishops are no true Priests and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, as <hi>Marcellus</hi> told his Soldiers that they were no true Romans (who were naturall Romans) because they wanted the old Roman virtue. Lastly you have
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:54322:93"/>
habituall power to exercise these Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but you want actuall power in <hi>England,</hi> by reason of the not applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or rather the substraction of the matter by our Lawes: so you are no legall Bishops or Priests there. This I take to have been the sense of these two Doctors.</p>
            <p>Now are we come to their grand ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, against Bishop <hi>Barlow,</hi> who was one of the Consecraters of Archbishop <hi>Parker,</hi> whose Consecration is not found in the Archbishops Register, and there fore they conclude that he was never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated. If this objection were true, yet it doth not render Archbishop <hi>Parkers</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration either invalid or uncanonicall, because there were three other Bishops who joined in that Consecration besides Bishop <hi>Barlow,</hi> which is the full number required by the Canons. But this objection is most false. Bishop <hi>Barlow</hi> was a Consecrated Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop above 20 yeares before the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Archbishop <hi>Parker.</hi> They should have done well to have proposed this doubt in Bishop Barlows lifetime, and then they might have had the Testimony of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secraters under an Archiepiscopall or
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:54322:94"/>
Episcopall Seale, for their satisfaction, The Testimony of the Archi-Episcopall Register, is a full proofe of Consecration affirmatively, but it is not a full proofe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively; such a Bishops Consecration is not recorded in this Register, therefore he was not Consecrated. For first, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence of an Officer or some crosse acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent might hinder the recording. Secondly Fire or Thieves or some such Casualty might destroy or purloin the Record. Thirdly though it be not recorded in this Register, it may be recorded in another, the Arch Bishop may, and Arch Bishop <hi>Cranmer</hi> usually did delegate or give Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to three other Bishops for Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration. And though the work be ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily performed at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> because of the place, where they may have three Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops alwaies present without any further Charge: yet they are not obliged by any Law to Consecrate them there. And if there be a sufficient number of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops near the Cathedrall which is to be filled, or if the person who is to be Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated do desire it, they may be Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted either in that, or any of their own Churches. The Bishops of the Province of Yorke, by reason of the former conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:54322:94"/>
are usually consecrated at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> yet I have known in my time Bishop <hi>Sine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes</hi> of <hi>Carlile</hi> consecrated at Yorke upon his own desire, by the Archbisop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and the Bishops of <hi>Durham, Chester,</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> A man might seek long enough for his Consecration in the Archbishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buries Register</hi> and misse it, but it is to be found in the Register at Yorke. So the Omission of it in that Register though it be no full proofe, yet it is a probable proofe that Bishop <hi>Barlow</hi> was not Consecrated there, but it is no proofe at all that he was not Consecrated elswere.</p>
            <p>And this I take to have been the case both of Bishop <hi>Barlow</hi> and Bishop Gardiner: and although the effluxion of above an hundred yeares since, hath rendered it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re difficult to find where it was done, yet by the help of those Records which are in the Court of Faculties, I should not despaire of finding it yet.</p>
            <p>But there are so many evident proofes that he was Cousecrated, that no ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous person can have the Face to deny it. The first reason is, his actuall possession of 4. Bishopricks one after another, St. <hi>Assaph, St. Davids, Bath and Wells</hi> and <hi>Chichester,</hi> in the Reigns of three Princes. They feign some pretenses why Archbishop <hi>Parker</hi> was
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:54322:95"/>
not consecrated Canonically<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because there wanted a competent number of Bishops, though it were most false: but what can they feign why Bishop <hi>Barlow</hi> was not consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Henry</hi> the eighths time? was <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth a Baby to be jeasted withall? In Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop <hi>Parkers</hi> case, they suppose all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops to have been stark mad, to cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves down headlong from a Precipice, when they had a faire paire of Stairs to des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend by: but in Bishop <hi>Barlowes</hi> case they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose all the world to have been asleep; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept there had been such an Vniversall sleep it had been impossible for any man in those dayes to creep into a Bishoprick in <hi>England</hi> without Consecration. To say he is actually possessed of a Bishoprick therefore he is Consecrated, is as clear a Demonstration in the English Law, as it is in nature to say the Sun shineth, therefore it is Day.</p>
            <p>But it may be objected, that he held all these Bishopricks as a Commendatory, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in Title, as an Vsufructuary not as a true owner. It is impossible, Vsufructuaries are not elected and confirmed, but Bishop <hi>Barlow</hi> was both elected and Confirmed. The <hi>Conge d'eslire</hi> to the Dean and Chapter, the Letters Patents for his Confirmation, the Commission for the restitution of his Temporalties, do all prove that he was no
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:54322:95"/>
Vsufructuary but a right owner, This is a second reason.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The same Letters Patents that doe authorise Bishop <hi>Barlowes</hi> Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, did likewise Command the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop with the assistence of other Bishops to Consecrate him himself. or to give a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to other Bishops to Consecrate him, which if they did not perform within a prescribed time, or perform after another manner the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is prescribed by the Law, it was not onely a losse of their Bishopricks by the Law of <hi>England,</hi> but a Premunire or the losse of all their Estates, their Liberties, and a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting themselves out of the Kings Protectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 25, Hen: 8. c. 20. No me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their right wits would r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n such a hazard, or rather evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly ruine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selves and all their hopes without any need, without any e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in the whole world. Fourthly, by the same Law no man could be acknowledged a Bishop in <hi>England,</hi> but he who was Consecrated legally, by three Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops with the consent of the Metropolitan, but Bishop <hi>Barlow</hi> was acknowledged to be a true Bishop; The King received his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage for his Bishoprick; the King comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to be restored to his Temporalties, which is never done untill the Consecratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be passed. King <hi>Henry</hi> sent him into <hi>Scotland</hi> as his Ambassadour with the title of Bishop

of <hi>St. Davids</hi>; and in his restitution to the Temporalties of that See, the King related that <hi>the Arch Bishop had made him Bishop and Pastor of the Church of St.</hi> Davids. This could not be if he had not been Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, he was admitted to sit in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament as a Consecrated Bishop: for no man can sit there as a Bishop before he be Consecrated, but it is plain by the Records of the house of the Lords that he did sit in Parliament many times in the 31 of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. in his Episcopall habit, as a Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated Bishop; and being neither a Bishop of one of the five Principall Sees, nor a Privy Counseller, he must sit and did sit according to the time of his Consecration, between the Bishops of <hi>Chichester</hi> and St, <hi>Assaph.</hi> What a strange boldnesse, is it to question his Consecration now, whom the whole Parliament, and his Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craters among the rest, did admit wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout scruple then as a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secrated Bishop.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, There is no act more proper or essentiall to a Bishop then Ordination, <hi>What doth a Bishop that a Priest doth not</hi> (saith St. Hierom) <hi>except Ordination?</hi> But it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the Records of his own See, that Bishop <hi>Barlow</hi> did Ordein Priests and

Deacons fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> time to time, and by the Arch Bishops Register that he, joined in Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Ordination, and was one of those three Bishops who imposed hands upon Bishop Buckley Feb. 19. 1541,</p>

            <p>Lastly, an unconsecrated person hath neither Antecessors nor Successors, he succeedeth no man, no man succeedeth him. If a grant of any hereditaments be made to him and his Successours, it is absolutely void<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And who gave this Iudgement? Their open enemies, who made no scruple to take away their Lifes, whose unjust judgement we doe not value a rush: but <hi>Paul</hi> the 4. and Cardinall <hi>Pole</hi>; more authentick Iudges of their own party, gave a later Iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary.</p>
            <p>They aske, <hi>how it is possible that Barlowes Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secration should not be found recorded (if ever it was), as well as his preferment to the Priory of</hi> Bisham, <hi>and Election and Confirmation to the Bishoprick of</hi> St. Assaph. I answer it is very easy to conceive. I have shewed him sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry wayes how it might be, and one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable way how it was. I desire the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to observe the extreme partiality of these Fathers, they make it impossible for the Acts of one Consecration to be lost or stollen, and yet accuse us of forging fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Consecrations. It is easier to steale fifteen, then to Forge one Act.</p>
            <p>We have often asked a reason of them,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:54322:99"/>
why the Protestants should decline their own Consecrations? They give us one, <hi>The truth is, that</hi> Barlow <hi>as most of the Clergy in</hi> England <hi>in those times were Puritans, and inclined to Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glianisme, therefore they contemned and rejected Consecration as a rag of Rome, and were contented with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary calling of God and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as all other Churches are, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Reformation.</hi> It is well they premised <hi>the truth is,</hi> otherwise there had not been one word of truth in what they say. First how do they know this? It must be either by Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but I am confident they can name no author for it: or by Revelation, but that they may not doe: or it is (to speake spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly) their own Imagination. It is a great boldnesse, to take the liberty to cast aspersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the Clergy of a whole Nation. Secondly, how commeth Bishop <hi>Barlow,</hi> to be taxed of Puritanism? we meet him a Prior and a Bishop, we find him in his Robes, in his Rochet, in his Cope, Officiating, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining, Confirming. He who made no scruple to Ordein and Consecrate others <hi>gratis,</hi> certainly did not forbeare his own Consecration with the apparent hazard of the losse of his Bishoprick, out of scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

of Conscience. Thirdly, this asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is not well accommodated to the times, For first Zuinglianisme was but short hee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in those Dayes when Bishop <hi>Barlow</hi> was Consecrated, who sate in Parliament as a Consecrated Bishop 31. Henr. 8: and the first Sermon that ever Zuinglius Preached as a Probationer, was in <hi>Zurick</hi> in the yeare 1510. that was in the 10. or 11. yeare of He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ry the eighth. If there were any one Zuinglian in those dayes, upon their grounds, it is most likely to have been Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Gardiner,</hi> for his Consecration doth not appeare more then Bishop <hi>Barlowes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there is yet a greater mistake in it; it is the Anabaptists who <hi>reject Ordination, and content themselves with the extraordinary calling of the Spirit,</hi> not the <hi>Zuinglians.</hi> In the writings of <hi>Zuinglius</hi> we find a Letter of him and ten other of the principall <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetian</hi> Theologians, to the Bishop of <hi>Constance</hi>; beseeching him in all humility and observance, <hi>to favour and help forward their beginnings, as an excellent work and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a Bishop</hi>; They implore his <hi>Clemency, Wisdome, learning, that he would be the first fruits of the German Bishops</hi>; They beseech him <hi>by the Common Christ, by that fatherly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which he owes unto them, to looke graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:54322:101"/>
upon them &amp;c</hi>; They court him <hi>to shew himself a Father, and grant the request of his obedient sonnes, Zuinglius</hi> and the <hi>Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glians</hi> liked Bishops well enough, if he could have had them. But the Bishop of <hi>Constance</hi> of another Communion was their Bishop.</p>
            <p>Here Meanderlike they make a winding from St. <hi>Asaph</hi> back again to Cheapside, from Bishop <hi>Barlowes</hi> Consecration to Archbishop Parkers. They say, that <hi>if there had been any other Consecration of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop Parker then that of the Nagges head, Iohn Stow would not conceale it in his Annales</hi>; who is so diligent in <hi>setting down all that passed in and about London, and professeth personall respect to him, he having related the Consecration of Cardinall</hi> Pole <hi>with so many particulars.</hi> They adde out of Dr. <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pney,</hi> that Iohn Stow <hi>acknowledged to many per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sons that the story of the Nagges head was true.</hi> Their store is very low, when they are forced to produce <hi>Iohn Stow,</hi> who scarce knew what a Consecration was. But what saith he in his Chronicles? Not a word, either of the feigned Consecration at the <hi>Nagges head,</hi> or of the true Consecration at <hi>Lambeth.</hi> But <hi>he told it to many persons by word of mouth, that the Story of the Nagges head was very true.</hi> If he did, he lied notoriously
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:54322:102"/>
to many persons, but we acquit him of that calumny: let it rest upon them, who think it a meritorious Act, to advance religion by any means true or false, we are too well acquainted with their hearsay reports. They who dare wrest his printed workes, ought not to be trusted what he spake by word of mouth, to some body, whom no body knowes. Their Authour saith <hi>to some persons,</hi> they say <hi>to many persons,</hi> thus this snowball increaseth. <hi>Iohn Stowe</hi> is now dead, and dead men do not bite: yet let us know to whom he said it? Doctor <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pney</hi> tells us, <hi>they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>imorous and would not be named.</hi> Good reason, for they have no names: so <hi>Iohn Stow</hi> is a silent witnesse, and they are namelesse witnesses.</p>
            <p>So much for the man: now for the thing I give three answers; First if <hi>Iohn Stow</hi> were a lover of the truth, he should rather have set down the <hi>Nagges head</hi> Ordination (if there was any such thing) then the <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> Ordination. Men would suppose the Lambeth Ordination of themselves, where nothing is said to the contrary, it is presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for the Law: but the <hi>Nagges head</hi> Consecration, had been such a Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, as never was before, never will follow after.</p>
            <p>Secondly, their Authours wrest <hi>Iohn
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:54322:102"/>
Stow</hi> abhominably. He was no profest wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Ecclesiasticall Annales. It is true he mentioneth the Consecration of Cardinall <hi>Pole,</hi> whether it was his respect to his Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, as being a neare Kinsman to the Queen, a Cardinall, the Popes Legate, and his grand Minister for the reconciliation of <hi>England,</hi> or because a toy tooke him in the head: but not with so many particulars as the Fathers intimate; all he saith is this, <hi>the</hi> 21 <hi>of March</hi> Dr. Cranmer <hi>Archbishop of</hi> Canterbury <hi>was burnt at</hi> Oxford, <hi>the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me day Cardinall</hi> Pole <hi>sang his first Masse at</hi> Greenwich <hi>in the Friars Church, on Sunday next he was Consecrated Archbishop of</hi> Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury (here was speedy worke), <hi>and the</hi> 25 <hi>of March received the Pall with the usuall Ceremonies at Bowes Church in Cheape.</hi> Here is another <hi>Nagges head</hi> meeting; where he was Consecrated, by whom, after what Form, he leaveth the Reader to presume: but of all the other Consecrations perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time, this diligent Authour mentioneth not so much as one; of all the Consecrations in Queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths time, I think not one; of all the Consecrations in <hi>England</hi> since the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, not one, or so rarely that they are not to be taken notice of. If the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of these Fathers were of any value
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:54322:103"/>
               <hi>Iohn Stow</hi> mentioneth not his Consecration at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> therefore he was not Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated there, we never had a Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>England,</hi> since the Conquest, but Cardinal '<hi>Poles</hi>: for he mentioneth none but that which I remember, I am sure if he mention any it is most rarely. If the Fathers argument were good, Archbishop <hi>Parker</hi> was never elected, nor confirmed, because his Election and Confirmation are not recordsd by <hi>Iohn Stow</hi>: but all our Records Civill as well as Ecclesiasticall do testify the Contrary.</p>
            <p>Lastly, if the Fathers would lay aside their prejudice, there is enough in <hi>Iohn Stowes</hi> Annales, to discover the falshood of their lying Fable of the Consecration at the <hi>Nagges head.</hi> By their account the <hi>Nagges head</hi> Consecration was September 7. Anno 1559, but after this in relating the solemne Obsequies kept in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church, for the French King, <hi>Iohn Stow</hi> calleth him, Dr. <hi>Parker Arch-Bishop of Canterbury Elect,</hi> therefore the <hi>Nagges head</hi> Consecration is a lying Fable; if he was still Elect, he was not then Consecrated. But afterward speaking of his Death May 17. 1575, which is the next time I find him mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he stileth him the <hi>right Reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:54322:103"/>
in God</hi> Matthew Parker <hi>Dr. of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity Archbishop of Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terbury.</hi> Here is no more the word <hi>Elect,</hi> for after Confirmation and Consecration, the word Elect ceaseth, here he is complete <hi>Archbishop of Canterbury.</hi>

But who is the man doth accuse us of so many Falsifications? One <hi>Gregory Martin,</hi> one of their fellowes, whose censure we do not weigh a button. This is a new Inartificiall Kind of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, from the Authority of their own Writers.</p>
            <p>But they use it much, so it followeth in the next words, <hi>it is want of Charity to think that</hi> Stapleton, Harding, Bristow <hi>and the rest of the English Catholick Doctors, who did

forsake all at home for Conscience sake, would publish to the world in print, the Nullity of</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers <hi>Ordination; thereby engaging posterity to commit so many damnable Sacrileges, in reor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deining those who had been validly ordeined al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, without due examination of the matter.</hi> This plea is much like that of the old Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that his Adversary, did not receive the wound with his whole body, that he might have killed him fairly. They would have us rather put up the losse of our Holy Orders, then the skill of their Doctors should be questioned.

I hope <hi>Stephen</hi> the sixth and <hi>Sergius</hi> the third, two Popes, were other manner of men then your English Doctors, and did both pretend to examine the matter as duely, and to be as a verse from damnable Sacrilege as you, yet they decreed publickly, and most unjustly, (as you yourselves doe now confesse) that all the holy Orders received from <hi>Formosus</hi> were void, and compelled all those who had been ordeined by him, to be reordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. <hi>Bell. de Rom.

The Earle was invited to the Consecration, at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> therefore it was at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> The Earle was not at the <hi>Nagges head</hi>; Mr. <hi>Neale</hi> himself, who see more then ever was acted, or so much as thought of, did not see that. Is it the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome when one is invited to a Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to come after it is done to dinner: or to invite a Nobleman to a Consecration in one place, and then be consecrated in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? This had been so farre from concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the shamefulnesse of such a brainsick Consecration, that it been a ready meanes to divulge it to all the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:54322:105"/>They adde, <hi>Besides we must take the Earles Friends word for the Earles Testimony, and</hi> Mr. Masons <hi>word for his namelesse Friend.</hi> That is none of <hi>Mr. Masons</hi> fault, but Mr. <hi>Holywoods, Mr. Constables, Mr. Sacrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scoes, Dr. Champneys, Mr. Fitz Herberts, Mr Fitz-Simons,</hi> who first broached this odious Fable. <hi>Mr. Mason</hi> published this rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the world in print while the Earle was yet living, on purpose that they might enquire and satisfy themselves; if they did not, they can blame no body but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; if they did by themselves or their Friends, (as it is most likely they did) it is evident the answer did not content them, and so we never heard more of them since. It had been the greatest folly in the world to allege the Testimony of such a Noble man in his Life time, contrary to his own knowledge, which might have been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved from his own Authority, and so have easily laid <hi>Mr. Mason</hi> flat upon his back. You may remember your own case with the Bishop of <hi>Durham.</hi> But it was too true to be contradicted then, and too late to be Contradicted now.</p>
            <p>They say, <hi>they bring more then one witnesse of the</hi> Nagges head <hi>Consecration.</hi> Pardon me, You never produced one yet, and which is lesse then producing, you never so much

as named a witnesse, whilst he himself was living. In or about the yeare 1603. you first named <hi>Mr. Neale</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent <hi>Iohn</hi> Stow, when they were both dead; you might as well have named the man in the Moone as <hi>Iohn Stow.</hi> Onely I confesse you named the Bishop of <hi>Durham</hi> in his life time, and you see what is the issue of it: and if you had named the others in their life times, you must have expected a like issue, either the perpetuall infamy of your witnesse, or the utter confusion of your Cause. You speake much of <hi>the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and virtue, and judgement</hi> of your hearsay Witnesses, <hi>who knew how to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish between an Episcopall Consecration, and a banquet.</hi> I hope you doe not meane that the Earle of <hi>Nottingham</hi> did not know, how to distinguish between a banquet and a Consecration, if he did not, the High Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralship of England was ill committed to him: or that he had not as much regard to his honour and Conscience, as any of your Priests. We meddle not with their Learning and virtue, but we are no more obliged to take their Testimonies upon hearsay, then they would take our Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. They have give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an account to God, and know before this time whether they
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:54322:106"/>
have done well or ill.</p>
            <p>They proceed, <hi>The Priests and Iesuits, to whom the Recordes were shewed in King Iames his time, protested against them as forged and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, as appeareth by the Testimony of men yet living, whose honesty cannot be called in question. Father</hi> Faircloth, <hi>one of the impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned Iesuits, testified so much to many by word of mouth and in writing.</hi> Where is the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting? where is the protestation? why are they not produced? Still here are no proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes but upon Hearsay. One eye Witnesse is worth an hundred such, who can sweare to no more but that they heard it, and God knowes through how many Hucksters hands. I hope the Bishop of <hi>Durhams</hi> case will make them more wary for the future.</p>
            <p>But they are angry with <hi>some Protestants, who endeavour to make this well grounded story a meer Fable, and thereby call many persons of much more learning, virtue, and prudence then themselves Fooles or knaves.</hi> We are plain <hi>Macedonians,</hi> who call a Fable a Fable, without either welt or gard: yea, so noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a Fable, that (but that you tell us the Contrary), we could not believe that any one of you did ever give any credit to it your selves; any more then the <hi>Athenians</hi> did believe those monstrous Fables of Bulls
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:54322:106"/>
and Minotaures, which themselves had raised, because some of their eminent Citi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>zens had devised it or related it: But we call no men <hi>Fooles or Knaues,</hi> That lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is too unmannerly for civill Writers.

Excuse me, there are credulity, and prejudice, and mistakes, and pious frauds in the world, and none of these will willingly weare the Livery of Knaves or Fooles. We are not of the same mind with Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> and Pope <hi>Sergius,</hi> for the reordeining of those, who had been ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by <hi>Formosus,</hi> yet we do not call them <hi>knaves or Fooles.</hi> We cannot beleeve what you yourselves have related of my Lord of <hi>Durham,</hi> yet we are not guilty of such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant expressions.</p>

            <p>IT seemeth to me, that the Fathers insist too much upon the honesty, and virtue, and learning of their own party<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with an Adversary, virtue is like fire, which preserveth it self by being covered with ashes: but spread abroad by osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, it is quickly extinguished; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Comparisons are odious, and beget altercation.

But the maine defect in this part of your discourse is this, the Bishop of <hi>Chalced<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </hi> confesseth of Mr. <hi>Oldcorn,</hi> one of your Order, that he acknowledged these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords to be Authentick, and the rest of the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:54322:107"/>
imprisoned Priests, who viewed the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, are charged publickly in print to have done the same, by Bishop Goodwin, by Mr. Mason; every thing ought to be unloosed the same way it is bound. They were all Schollars and could write, if this charge were not true, they ought to have published a Protestation to the world in print to the contrary, whilest their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries were living, whilest the Witnesses were living: but now after they and their Adversaries, and the witnesses are all so long dead, to talke of a verball protestation to some of their Friends, upon hearsay, signifieth nothing.</p>
            <p>Now we must make another winding, and return to Bishop <hi>Barlow</hi>: but I hold to the clue, in hope at length to get out of this fictitious Labyrinth. <hi>Henry the</hi> 8. <hi>Letters Patents, vvhereby Bishop</hi> Barlow <hi>vvas installed in</hi> (they would say restored to) <hi>the Temporalties of his Bishoprick, make mention of his acceptation and Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, but none of his Consecration. why should this last be omitted, if he were really consecrated?</hi> This objectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sheweth nothing, but the unskilfulnesse of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in our English Customes and Forms.
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:54322:108"/>
Let them compare all the restitutions of their friends to their Temporalties in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, as Cardinall <hi>Poles,</hi> Bishop <hi>Gardiners</hi> and the rest, and they shall find the Form the very same with Bishop <hi>Barlowes</hi>; I hope they will not conclude thence that none of them were consecrated. The reason of the Forme is very prudent, In a Restitution to Temporalties, they take no notice of any Acts that are purely Spirituall, as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration is: but onely of such Acts as are Temporall, as Acceptation and Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>But <hi>if he was restored to his Temporalties not being Consecrated, he might also sit in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without Consecration.</hi> The Assumtion is understood, <hi>but Bishop</hi> Barlow <hi>was restored to his Temporalties without Consecration</hi>; which is most false. From the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Nation untill this Day, they are not able to produce one instance, of one Bishop, who was duely Elected, duely confirmed, and duely restored to his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralties by the Kings Mandate, without Consecration, or did sit in Parliament without Consecration. He must sit in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament in his Episcopall habit, but that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be before Consecration. It seemeth they think that Bishops sit in Parliament, as Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:54322:108"/>
Barons: but it a great mistake, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops sate in the Great Councells of the Kingdome, before the names of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Barons were heard of in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They bring an Argument from <hi>the exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of our Records,</hi> and that connexion that is between Records of one Court and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The first thing necessary to obtein a Bishoprick in <hi>England,</hi> is the Kings <hi>Conge d'eslire</hi>; that appears in the Rolles. Next, the actuall Election; that appeares in the Records of the Dean and Chapiter. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Kings Acceptation of the Election, and his Commission to the Archbishop, or four Bishops in the Vacancy, to Confirm the Election and Consecrate the person E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and Confirmed legally; that appeares in the Letters Patents enrolled. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Confirmation of the Election be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Dean of the Arches, but by the Archbishops appointment, (this is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med alwaies in <hi>Bow</hi> Church, except extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily it be performed elswhere by Commission); this appeares in the Records of the Archbishop. Fifthly, the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration it self by the Archbishop and other Bishops, or other Bishops without him by virtue of his Commission; this appeares in the Records of the Protonothary of the See
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:54322:109"/>
of Canterbury. Lastly the Restitution of the Temporalties; which appeares in the Rolles, and his Enthronisation in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the Dean and Chapiter. Every one of these takes another by the hand, and he who will enjoy a Bishoprick in <hi>England,</hi> must have them all. The Chapiter cannot elect without the Kings <hi>Conge d'Eslire.</hi> The King never grants his Letters Patents for Confirmation and Consecration, untill he have a Certificate of the Dea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and Chapiters Electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The Dean of the <hi>Arches</hi> never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, untill he have the Kings Commission. The Archbishop never Consecrates untill the Election be confirmed. And lastly the King never receiveth Homage for the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick, or giveth the Temporalties, nor the Dea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and Chapiter Enthrone, untill after Consecration. He that hath any one of these acts, must of Necessity have all that goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it in this Method: and he that hath the last, hath them all. But this was more then Mr. Neale, or whosoever was Inventer of that silly Fable, did understa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, otherwise he would have framed a more possible relatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>Hence they argue, The Records <hi>being so exact, how is it possible that no Copies of Barlowes Consecration do appeare in any Court or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick of</hi> England? They mistake the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wholy, the Consecration ought not to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:54322:109"/>
appeare in any Court but one, that is that Registry where he was Consecrated, which being not certainly known, at so great a distance of time, is not so easily found, and I believe was neversought for yet further the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Lambeth.</hi> But all the other Acts doe appeare in their proper Courts; The Kings Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, the Dean and Chapiters Election, the Kings Letters Patents, the Confirmation of the Dean of the Arches, which all goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Consecration: and his doing Homage, and the Restitution of him to his Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralties, and his Enthronisation, all which do follow the Consecration, and are infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible proofes in Law of the Consecration: as likewise his sitting in Parliament, his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deining of Priests, his Consecrating of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, his letting of Leases, his receiving of Heriditame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to him and his Successours, his exchanging of Lands; all which are as irrefragable proofes of his Consecration, as any man hath to prove that such persons were his Parents, either Father or Mother. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the right Register is sought, which must be by the help of the Court of Faculties, I doubt not but his Consecration will be found in the proper place, as all the rest are.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. Mason</hi> alleged, that Bishop <hi>Gardiners</hi> Consecration was not to be found in the Register of <hi>Lambeth,</hi> any more then Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:54322:110"/>
               <hi>Barlowes</hi>: yet no man doubted of his Ordination. They answer first, that Mr. Mason did not seek so solicito<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sly or diligently <hi>for Bishop</hi> Gardiners <hi>Consecration, as for Bishop</hi> Barlowes. Then why do not they whom it doth concern, cause more diligent search to be made? without fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Records of Bishop <hi>Gardiners</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration, they cannot accuse Bishop <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi> of want of Consecration, upon that onely reason. Secondly they answer, that if Gardiners <hi>Consecration, were as doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as</hi> Barlowes <hi>and</hi> Parkers, <hi>they would take the same advise they give us, to repaire with speed to some other Church of undoubted Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.</hi> Yes, where will they find a more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Clergy? They may goe further and fare worse. <hi>Rome</hi> itself hath not more exact Records, nor a more undoubted Succession, then the Church of <hi>England.</hi> There is no reason in the world to doubt either of Archbishop <hi>Parkers</hi> Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Bishop <hi>Gardiners,</hi> or Bishop <hi>Barlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes.</hi> Neither doth his Consecration con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us so much, at the Fathers imagine: there were three Consecraters (which is the Canonicall number) besides him.</p>
            <p>It is high time for the Fathers to wind up, and draw to a Conclusion of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. That which followeth next is too high
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:54322:110"/>
and can scarcely be tolerated; to accuse the publick Records and Archives of the Kingdome, and to insimulate the Primates and Metropolitans of <hi>England</hi> of Forgery, upon no ground but their own Imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. I doubt whether they durst offer it to a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow Woman. <hi>As to the impossibility of forging so many Registers, in case there be so many, it is easily answered, that it is no more then that the Consecraters and other persons concerned, should have conspired to give in a false Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, that the Consecration was perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with all due Cerimonies and Rites, and thereby deceive the Courts or make them dissemble.</hi> Should any man accuse the Generall of their order, or one of their Provincialls, or but the Rector of one of their Colleges, of Forgery and counterfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the publick Records of the Order; how would they storm, and thunder, and mingle heaven and earth together and cry out. <hi>No moderate or prudent persons can suspect that such persons should damne their soules, that so many pious learned Divines should engage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their posterity, in damnable Sacrileges, without feare of damnation.</hi>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:54322:111"/>
If a man will not believe every ridiculous Fable, which they tell by word of mouth upon hearsay, they <hi>call persons of more vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue learning and prudence then themselves, Foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les and Knaves</hi>: But they may insimulate the principall Fathers of our Church, of certifying most pernicious lyes under their hands and seales, not for a piece of bread, which is a poore temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but for nothing, that is to make them both <hi>Fooles and Kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves.</hi> Is not this blowing hot and cold with the same breath? <hi>or to have the Faith of our Lord Iesus Christ with respect of persons</hi>? Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the politicall principles of the Church of <hi>England</hi> with your own, and try if you can find any thing so pernicious to mankind and all humane Society, in ours more then in yours. Compare the Case Theology of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> with your own, and try if you can find any thing so destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to Morality, to truth, and Iustice, and Conscience, as might lead us to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate such Crimes more then yourselves. We are not affraid of a Paralell. You pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse great endeavours to make Proselites; we do not condemne Zeale, yet wish you had more light with it: even in prudence, which you yourselves extoll, this is not your right Course, to follow those Birds, with noise and clamour, which you desire to catch.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:54322:111"/>In summe, your answer or solution is full of ignorant mistakes. It confoundeth Civill Rolles and Ecclesiasticall Registers. It supposeth that our Records are but tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions, one out of another; whereas every Court recordeth its own Acts, and keeps itself within its own bounds. It ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth notice but of one Consecrater: where as we have alwaies three at the least, many times five or six. It quite forgetteth pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Notaries, which must be present at every Consecration with us, to draw up what is done into Acts; with us every one of these Notaries when he is admitted to that charge, doth take a solemne Oath upon his knees to discharge his Office faithfully, that is, not to make false Certificates. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it is absurd and unseasonable, to enquire how a thing came to passe that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was: you ought First to have proved, that our Records were forged, and then it had been more seasonable to have enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red modestly, how it came to passe. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is incredible, that persons of such prudence and eminence, should make false Certificates under their hands and seales, to the utter ruine of themselves and all that had a hand it, and no advantage to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son breathing. It is incredible that those
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:54322:112"/>
Records should be counterfeited in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which were avowed publickly for Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick by the whole Parliament of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> in the 8 yeare of Queen <hi>Elisabeth</hi>; which were published to the world in print by the person most concerned, as if he da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all the world to except against them: and yet no man offered to except against them then. Fourthly, it is impossible to give in a false Certificate of a Consecration which was never performed in <hi>England,</hi> (especially at <hi>Lambeth</hi>) before lesse then thousands of eye witnesses: and that at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> in the Face of the Court and West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster Hall. Surely they thinke we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate in Closets, or holes, or hay mowes. They may even as well say that the publick Acts of our Parliaments are counterfeited, and the publick Acts of our Synods are counterfeited, and all our publick monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments counterfeited. It is none of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestest Pleas, <hi>Negare factum,</hi> to deny such publick Acts as these. Fifthly, this answer is pernicious to mankind, it is destructive to all Societies of men, that Bishops of so great eminence, should conspire with pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Notaries, to give in false Certificates, in a matter of such High Consequence as Holy Orders are, without any temptation,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:54322:112"/>
without any hope of Advantage to them selves or others. It affordeth a large Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary for jealousies and suspicions. It ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminateth all credit and confidence out of the world, and instructeth all men to trust nothing, but what they see with their eyes. Lastly, it is contradictory to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; They have told us, I know not how often, and tell us again in this Paragraph, That <hi>if the</hi> Nagges head <hi>Consecration had been false, they might have convinced it by a thousand witnesses</hi>: Here they make it an <hi>easy</hi> thing, for <hi>the Consecraters and other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons concerned, to conspire together to give in a false Certificate, that the Consecration was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with all due Ceremonies and Rites,</hi> and thereby deceive the <hi>Courts or make them dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble.</hi> If the world will be deceived so, it is but right and reason that it be deceived; to be deceived by a false Certificate, that may be convinced by a thousand witnesses, is selfdeceit.</p>
            <p>But they say, <hi>this is more possible and more probable, then that all the Clergy should conspire not to produce the same Registers, when they were so hardly pressed by their Adversaries.</hi> These are but empty pretenses, there was no pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to produce Registers, nor any thing objected that did deserve the production
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:54322:113"/>
of a Register. That which was objected against our Orders in those dayes was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Form of Ordination published by Edward the sixth, and the Legality of our Ordination in the time of Queen <hi>Elisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>; the <hi>Nagges head</hi> Consecration was never objected in those dayes. Besides, Registers are Publick enough themselves, and need no production; and yet our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisters were produced, produced by the Parliament 8 <hi>Elisab.</hi> who cited them as au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Records, produced and published to the world in Print, that was another production.</p>
            <p>They adde, <hi>Or that so many Catholicks should have been so foolish to invent or maintein the Story of the</hi> Nagges head, <hi>in such a time when if it had been false, they might have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by a thousand Witnesses.</hi> Feare them not, they were wiser then to publish such a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Fable in those dayes; they might perchance whisper it in Corners among themselves, but the boldest of them durst not maintain it, or object it in print, for feare of shame and disgrace. It was folly to give any eare to it, but is was knavery to invent it: and to doe it after such a bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling manner, (whosoever was the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venter) was knavery and Folly complicated together.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:54322:113"/>If the Fathers write any more upon this subject, I desire them to bring us no more <hi>hearesay</hi> testimonies of their owne party; whatsoever esteeme they may have them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, of their judgment, and prudence, and impartiality. It is not the manner of Polemick writers to urge the authority of their owne Doctors to an Adversary, or allege the moderne practise of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Church. We have our owne Church and our owne Doctors as well as they. If we would pinne our faith to the sleeues of their Writers, and submit to their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and beleeve all their reportes, and let all things be as they would have it, we needed not to have any more controversy with them: but we might well raise a worse controversy in our selves with our owne consciences.</p>

            <head>CHA. XI. Of our formes of Episcopall and priestly ordination, of Zuinglia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme, of Arch Bishop Lavvd, of ceremonies. Our assurance of our Orders.</head>
            <p>WE have done with the Nagges head for the present. That which follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth next doth better become Schollers, as having more shew of truth and reality in it. They object that <hi>in all the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Ritualls, not onely of the west but of the East, there is not one forme of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrating Bishops, that hath not the word Bishops in it, or some other words expressing the particular authority and power of a Bishop distinctly. But in our Consecration, there is not one word to expresse the difference and power of Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy. For these vvordes [receive the holy Ghost] are indifferent to priesthood and Episcopacy, and used in both Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> I answer, that the forme of Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall Ordination used at the same time when hands are imposed, is the same both in their forme and ours, [<hi>Receive the holy Ghost</hi>], And if these words be considered
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:54322:114"/>
singly in a divided sense from the rest of the Office, there is nothing either in our forme or theirs which doth distinctly and reciprocally expresse Episcopall power and Authority. But if these words be considered coniointly in a compounded sense, there is enough to expresse Episcopall power and authority distinctly, and as much in our forme as theirs.</p>
            <p>First two Bishops present the Bishop elect to the Arch-Bishop of the Province, with these words, <hi>most Reverend Father in Christ, we present to you this godly and learned man to be Consecrated Bishop.</hi> There is one expression.</p>
            <p>Then the Arch-Bishop causeth the Kings Letters Patents to be produced and read, which require the Arch Bishop to consecrate him a <hi>Bishop.</hi> There is a second expression.</p>
            <p>Thirdly the new Bishop takes his oath of canonicall obedience. <hi>I A B elected Bishop of the Church and See of C. do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse and promise all reverence and due obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Arch Bishop and Metropoliticall Church of D. and his Successours. So God help me &amp;c.</hi> This is a third Expression.</p>
            <p>Next the Arch Bishop exhorts the whole Assembly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to solemne praier for this person thus elected and presented, before
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:54322:115"/>
they admit him to that office (that is the Office of a Bishop,) whereunto they hope he is called by the holy Ghost, after the example of Christ before he did chuse his Apostles, and the church of Antioch before they laid hands upon Paul and Barnabas. This is a fourth expression.</p>
            <p>Then followeth the <hi>Litany,</hi> wherein there is this expresse petition for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be ordeined Bishop, <hi>we beseech thee to give thy blessing and grace to this our brother elected Bishop, that he may discharge that office whereunto he is called diligently to the Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of thy Church.</hi> To which all the congregation answer, <hi>Heare us O Lord we beseech thee.</hi> Here is a fifth expression.</p>
            <p>Then followeth this praier wherewith the <hi>Litany</hi> is concluded. <hi>Allmighty God, the giver of all good things, which by thy holy Spirit hast constituted diverse orders of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in thy Church, vouchsafe we beseech the to looke graciously upon this thy servant, now called to the Office of a Bishop.</hi> This is a sixth expression.</p>
            <p>Next the Arch-Bishop telleth him he must examine him, before he admit him to that administratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whereunto he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and maketh a solemne praier for him, that <hi>God who hath constituted some Prophets, some Apostles &amp;c. to the Edification of his
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:54322:115"/>
Church, would grant to this his servant the grace to use the authority committed to him, to edification not destruction, to distribute food in due season to the family of Christ, as becommeth a faithfull and prudent Steward.</hi> This autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity can be no other then Episcopall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, nor this Stewardship any other thing then Episcopacy. This is a seve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th expressio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>Then followeth imposition of hands, by the Arch-Bishop and all the Bishops present, with these words <hi>Receive the holy Ghost</hi> &amp;c: and lastly the tradition of the Bible into his hands, exhorting him <hi>to behave himself towards the flock of Christ, as a Pastour, not devouring but feeding the flock.</hi> All this implieth Episcopall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. They may except against Christs owne forme of ordeining his Apostles if they will, and against the forme used by their owne Church: but if they be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient formes, our forme is sufficient. This was the same forme which was used in Edward the sixths time, and we have seen how Cardinall Pole and Paul the fourth confirmed all without exception, that were ordeined according to this forme; so they would reunite themselves to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>They bring the very same objection against our Priestly Ordination, <hi>The forme
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:54322:116"/>
or words whereby men are made Priests must expresse authority and power to consecrate, or make present Christs body and blood, (whether with or without transubstantiation is not the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent controversy with Protestants.)</hi> Thus far we accorde, to the truth of the presence of Christs body and blood; So they leave us this latitude for the manner of his presence. Abate us Transubstantiation, and those things which are consequents of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the manner of presence, and we have no difference with them in this particular. They who are ordeined Priests, ought to have power to consecrate the Sacrament of the body and blood of Christ, that is, to make them present after such manner as they were present ar the first in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stitution; whether it be done by enuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the words of Christ, as it is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the westerne Church, or by praier, as it is practised in the Easterne Church; or whether these two be both the same thing in effect, that is, that the formes of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments be mysticall praiers and implicite invocations. Our Church for more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant caution useth both formes, as well in the Consecration of the Sacrament, as in the ordination of Priests. In the holy Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist, our consecration is a repetition of that which was done by Christ, and now done
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:54322:116"/>
by him that consecrateth in the person of Christ: otherwise the Priest could not say <hi>this is my body.</hi> And likewise in Episcopall Consecration, <hi>Homo imponit manus, deus lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitur gratiam, Sacerdos imponit supplicem dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>eram, Deus benedicit potente dex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>era: Man imposeth hands, God conferreth grace, The Bishop imposeth his suppliant right hand, God blesseth with his Almighty right hand.</hi> In both consecrations Christ himself is the chiefe consecrater still, Then if power of consecratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be nothing els but power to do that which Christ did, and ordeined to be done, our Priests want not power to conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate. They adde, <hi>in all formes of Ordeining Priests, that ever were used in the Easterne or Westerne Church, is expresly set downe the word Priest, or some other words expressing the proper function and authority of Priesthood &amp;c. The Grecians using the word Priest or Bishop in their formes, do sufficiently expresse the respective po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of every Order. But our Reformers did not put into the forme of ordeining Priests, any words expressing authority to make Christs body present.</hi> I answer, that if by formes of ordeining Priests, they understa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that essentiall forme of words, which is used at the same instant of time whilest hands are imposed, I denie that in all formes of Priestly ordination, the word Priest is set downe either expresly
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:54322:117"/>
or aequivalently. It is set downe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly in the Easterne Church, it is not set downe expresly in the Westerne Church. Both the Easterne and Westerne formes are lawfull, but the Westerne commeth nearer to the institution of Christ.</p>
            <p>But if by formes of Ordeining, they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand Ordinalls or Ritualls, or the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire forme of ordeining: both our Church and their Church have not onely aequiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent expressions of Priestly power, but even the expresse word <hi>Priest</hi> it self, which is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient both to direct and to expresse the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Consecrater. Vnder that name the Arch Deacon prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth them, <hi>Right Reverend Father in Christ, I present unto you these persons here present, to be admitted to the Order ef Priesthood.</hi> Vnder that name the Bishop admitteth them, <hi>well beloved bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, these are they whom we purpose by the grace of God this day to admit</hi> [cooptare] <hi>into the holy office of Priesthood.</hi> Vnder this name the whole assembly praieth for them, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, vouchsafe we beseech thee to looke graciously upon these thy servants, which this day are called to the office of Priesthood.</hi> It were to be wished, that writers of Controversies would make more use of their owne eyes, and trust lesse other mens citations.</p>
            <p>Secondly I answer, that it is not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:54322:117"/>
that the essentiall formes of Sacraments should be alwaies so very expresse and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate, that the words are not capable of extension to any other matter: if they be as determinate and expresse, as the example and prescription of Christ, it is sufficient. The forme of baptisme is, <hi>I baptise the in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost</hi>: Not I baptise the to <hi>Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> or for <hi>Remission of sins.</hi> There are many other kinds of baptismes or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shings, besides this Sacramentall baptisme: yet this forme is as large as the institution of Christ. And these generall words are efficacious both to regeneration and remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sinnes, as well as if regeneration and remission of sins had bene expresly mentioned. In this forme of baptisme, there is enough antecedent to direct and regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te both the actions and intentions of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister: So there is likewise in our forme of Ordination.</p>
            <p>Thirdly I answer, that in our very essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall forme of Priestly Ordination, Priestly power and authority is sufficiently expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; we need not seeke for a needle in a bottle of hay. The words of our Ordinall are cleare enough. First <hi>Receive the Holy Ghost,</hi> (That is the grace of the holy Ghost) <hi>to exercise and dicharge the Office of Priest<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hood,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:54322:118"/>
to which thou hast been now presented, to which thou hast been now accepted, and for which we have praied to God, that in it thou maiest dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scharge thy duty faithfully and acceptably.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, in these words, <hi>whose sins thou doest remit they are remitted,</hi> that is not onely by Priestly absolution: but by preaching, by baptising, by administring the holy Eucharist, which is a meanes to applie the alsufficient sacrifice of Christ, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Sinnes. He who authoriseth a man to accomplish a worke, doth autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise him to use all meanes which tend to the accomplishment thereof,</p>
            <p>That which is objected, that <hi>Laymen have power to remit sinnes by Baptisme, but no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to consecrate,</hi> signifieth nothing as to this point. For first their owne Doctors do acknowledge, that <hi>a Lay man can not baptise solemnely, nor in the presence of a Priest or a Deacon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bell. de Sac. Bapt. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 7.</note> 
               <hi>nor in their absence, except onely in case of necessity.</hi> Saint <hi>Austin</hi> gives the reason, because <hi>no man may invade another mans of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</hi> Lay men may, and are bound to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct others in case of necessity: yet the office of preaching and instructing others is Conferred by Ordination. The ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary office of remitting sinnes, both by baptisme and by the holy Eucharist, doth belong to Bishops and under the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Priests.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:54322:118"/>Thirdly, this Priestly power to consecrate is conteined in these words, <hi>Be thou a faithfull dispenser of the word of God, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</hi> And afterwards, when the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop delivers the holy Bible into the hands of those who are ordeined Priests, <hi>Have thou authority to preach the word of God, and Administer the Sacraments.</hi> We do not deny, but Deacons have been admitted to distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute and Minister the Sacraments, by the Command or permission of Priests, or as Subservient unto them: but there is as much difference between a subservie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t distributio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Sacrament, and the <hi>Dispensing</hi> or <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministring</hi> of it, as there is betweene the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Porter who distributeth the almes at the gate, and the Office of the Steward who is the proper dispenser of it. Looke to it Gentlemen; If your owne Ordination be valide, Ours is as valide, and more pure.</p>
            <p>They make the cause of these defects in our forme of Ordination, to be, because <hi>Zuinglianisme and Puritanisme did prevaile in the English Church in those daies. They bele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not the reall presence: therefore they put no word in their forme expressing power to conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate. They held Episcopacy and Priesthood to be one and the same thing: Therefore they put not in one word expressing the Episcopall Function.</hi> This is called leaping over the stile before
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:54322:119"/>
a man comes at it, To devise reasons of that which never was. First prove our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, if you can: And then find out a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> many reasons of them as you list. But to say the truth; the cause and the effect are well coupled together. The cause, that is the Zuinglianisme of our predecessours, never had any reall existence in the nature of things, but onely in these me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s imaginations: So the defects of our Ordinalls are not reall but imaginary. Herein the Fathers adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to farre, to tell us that we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in our formes of Ordeining, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse either the Priestly or Episcopall fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: when every child that is able to reade can tell them, that we have the expresse words of Bishops and Priests in our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, over and over againe, And mainteine to all the the world that <hi>the three Orders,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               </note> 
               <hi>of Bishops Priests and Deacons, have been ever from the beginning in the Church of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This they say <hi>is the true reason, why Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker and his Collegues were contented with the Nagges head Consecration,</hi> (that is to say, one brainsick whimsey is the reason of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther): <hi>and why others recurred to extraordinary vocation in Queene Elisabeths time.</hi> Say what others? name one genuine son of the Church of England if you can? Doctor <hi>Whitakers,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Fulke,</hi> who are the onely two
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:54322:119"/>
men mentioned by you, are both profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly against you. Doctor <hi>Whitakers</hi> saith <hi>we do not condemne all the Order of Bishops, as he falsely slanders us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>De Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. cont.</hi> 2. <hi>q.</hi> 5 <hi>c.</hi> 3.</note> 
               <hi>but onely the false Bishops of the Church of Rome.</hi> And Doctor Fulke, <hi>for Order and seemely goverment among the Clergy, there was allwaies one Principall, to whom the name of Bishop or Superintendent hath been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, which roome</hi> Titus <hi>exercised in</hi> Crete, Timothy <hi>in</hi> Ephesus,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>In Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum c.</hi> 1</note> 
               <hi>others in other Places.</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that <hi>the Ordination, or Consecration, by imposition of hands, was alwaies principally committed to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Fathers proceed, <hi>If Mr.</hi> Lawd <hi>had found successe in his first attempts, it is very cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, he would in time have reformed the Forme of the English Ordination.</hi> That pious and learned Prelate wanted not other degrees in Church and Schooles, which they omit. He was a great lover of peace, but too ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious to dance after their pipe, too much versed in Antiquity to admit their new matter and forme, or to attempt to correct the <hi>Magnificat</hi> for satisfaction of their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. But whence had they this credible Relation? We are very confident, they have neither Authour nor ground for it, but their owne imagination. And if it be so, what excuse they have for it in their Case Divinity, they know best: but in ours we could not excuse it from down right ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:54322:120"/>They have such an eye at our order and uniformity, that they can not let our <hi>long Cloakes and Surplesses</hi> alone. We never had any such animosities among us about our Cloakes, as some of their Religious Orders have had about their gownes: both for the colour of them, whether they should be black, or white, or gray, or the naturall Colour of the sheep; And for the fashion them, whether they should belong or short &amp;c, in so much as two Popes successively could not determine it.</p>
            <p>If Mr. <hi>Mason</hi> did commend the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the English Church, for paring away superfluous Ceremonies in Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he did well. Ceremonies are advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Order, decency, modesty, and gravity in the service of God, Expressions of those heavenly desires and dispositions, which we ought to bring along with us to Gods house, Adjuments of attention and devotion, Furtherances of Edification, visible instructers, helps of Memory, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cercises of faith, the shell that preserves the Kernell of Religion from contempt, the leaves that defend the blossomes and the fruite: but if they grow over thick and ranke, they hinder the fruite from comming to maturity, and then the Gardiner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pluckes them of. There is great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:54322:120"/>
the hearty expressions of a faithfull Friend, and the mimicall gestures of a faw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning flatterer: betwee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the unaffected come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenesse of a grave Matrone, and the phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasticall paintings, and patchings, and powderings, of a garish Curtesan.</p>
            <p>When Ceremonies become burthensome by excessive superfluity, or unlawfull Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies are obtruded, or the Substance of divine worship is placed in Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or the service of God is more respected for humane ornaments then for the Divine Ordinance; it is high time to pare away excesses, and reduce things to the ancient meane.</p>
            <p>These Fathers are quite out, where they make it lawfull at some times to adde, but never to pare away: yet we have pared away nothing, which is either prescribed or practised by the true Catholick Church. If our Ancestors have pared away any such things out of any mistake, (which we do not beleeve,) let it be made appeare evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to us, and we are more ready to welcome it againe at the foredore, then our Ancestours were to cast it out at the backdore. <hi>Errare possumus haeretici esse no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, as an impetuous wind doth not blow downe those trees which are well
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:54322:121"/>
radicated, but causeth them to spread their rootes more firmely in the earth: so these concussions of our Adversaries, do confirme us in the undoubted assurance of the truth, and validity, and legality of our holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. We have no more reason to doubt of the truth of our Orders, because of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent judgment of an handfull of our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall countrymen, and some few forreine Doctors misinformed by them: then they themselves have to doubt of the truth of their Orders who were ordeined by <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosus,</hi> because two Popes <hi>Stephen</hi> and <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi> one after another, out of passion and prejudice, declared them to be voide and invalide.</p>
            <p>But supposing that which we can never grant, without betraying both our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves and the truth, that there were some remote probabilities, that might occasion suspicion in some persons prepossessed with prejudice, of the legality of our Orders: yet for any man upon such pretended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certeinties, to leave the communion of that Church wherein he was baptised, which gave him his Christian being, and to Apostate to them, where he shall meet with much greater grounds of feare, both of Schisme and Idolatry; were to plo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge himself in a certein crime, for feare of
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:54322:121"/>
an uncertein danger.</p>
            <p>Here the Fathers make a briefe repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of whatsoever they have said before in this discourse, (either out of distrust of the Readers memory, or confidence of their owne atchievements,) of the <hi>Nagges head,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Neale,</hi> and the Protestant writers, and Bishop <hi>Bancroft,</hi> and Bishop <hi>Morton</hi> and the other Bishops that sate with him the last Parliament, (which being the onely thing alleged by them in the Authours life time, and proved so undeniably to be false, is enough to condemne all the rest of their <hi>Hearesay</hi> reports, for groundlesse fables) of our Registers, of King <hi>Edwards</hi> Bishops, of Bishop <hi>Barlow,</hi> and of the forme of our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; Directing him who will cleare all those doubtes, what he hath to do, as if we were their Iournymen. Let them not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themselves about that, they are cleared to the least graine.</p>
            <p>But if they will receive advise for advise, and pursue a prudentiall course which they prescribe to others; if they regard the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent face of the skie, and looke well to their owne interest, and the present conjuncture of their affaires: they have more need and are more ingaged in reputation to defend themselves, then to oppugne others.</p>
            <p>So they conclude their discourse with
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:54322:122"/>
this short Corollary, <hi>How unfortunately was Charles the first late King of England, misin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in matter of his Bishops and Clergy? what scruple could he have had, if he had known the truth, to give way to the Parliament, to pull downe Parliament Bishops, who were so farre from being</hi> de jure divino, <hi>that they were not so much as</hi> de jure Ecclesiastico? We thanke you Gentlemen for your good will, The Orthodox Clergy of <hi>England</hi> are your feare. And you know what commonly followeth after feare, Hate, <hi>Oderunt quos metuunt.</hi> What pitty it is that you were not of King <hi>Charles</hi> his Councell, to have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised him better? yet we observe few Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thrive worse, then where you pretend to be great ministers. If you had coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailed him upon this Subject, perhaps you might have found him too hard for you; as another did whose heart he burst with downe right reason. If ever that innocent King had a finger in the blood of any of that party, that was it, to choake a man with reason: but certeinly that wise Prince would not have much regarded your posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive conclusions, upon hearsay premisses.</p>
            <p>We hold our Benefices by human right, our offices of Priests and Bishops both by divine right and humane right. But put the case we did hold our Bishopricks onely
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:54322:122"/>
by humane right, Is it one of your cases of conscience, that a Soveraigne Prince may justly take away from his Subjects any thing which they hold by humane right? If one man take from another that which he holds justly by the law of man, he is a thief and a robber by the law of God. Let us alter the case a little, from our Bisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prickes to their Colleges or their treasures: If any man should attempt to take them from them, upon this ground because they held them but by humane right, they would quickly cry out with <hi>Ploiden, the case is altered.</hi> Be our right divine, or humane, or both, if we be not able to defend it against any thing the Fathers can bring against it, we deserve to lose it.</p>
