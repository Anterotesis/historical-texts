         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Doctrine, Discipline, Regiment, and Policie established here by Ecclesiasticall and Civill Lawes, and sworne and subscribed unto by the Kings Majesty, the severall Presbetries, and Parish Churches of the Land; as it had the applause of forraine Divines, so was it in all points agreeable unto the Word; neither could the most rigid <hi>Aristarchus</hi> of these times, challenge any irregularity in the same.

If their aimes were truly for the advancement of Religion, how comes it to passe, that whiles they make so much adoe, and move every stone against us for our modest refusing of obedience to certaine ordinances of men, which in our consciences we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to be unlawfull, they manumisse &amp; set free the Simony, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Swearing, prophanation of the Sabbath, Drunkennesse, Who or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, with other grosse and scandalous vices, of some of their owne side, by which Gods owne Commandements are most fearfully violated? This just recrimination we may well use for our owne most lawfull defence. Neither doe we hereby intend any mans shame (God knowes) but his reformation rather.

For a true Church as it retaines pure Doctrine, so also it keeps simplicity of Ceremonies, &amp;c. but a hypocriticall Church, as it departs from pure Doctrine, so for the most part, it changeth and augmenteth the Ceremonies instituted of God, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth its owne Traditions,</hi> &amp;c. And as touching our controverted Ceremonies in particular, if you consider what we have written against them, you shall easily perceive that they are matters of no small, but very great consequence.

               <hi>Romans,</hi> who built the Temple of <hi>Concord</hi> just in the place where the seditious outrages of the two <hi>Gracchi Tiberius and Cajus</hi> had beene acted: <note n="b" place="margin">ib. c. 26.</note> which Temple, in the subsequent times, did not restraine, but by the contrary, give further scope unto more bloudie seditions. So that they should have built <hi>Discord</hi> a Temple in that place rather then <hi>Concord,</hi> as <hi>Augustine</hi> pleasantly tickleth them. Doe our Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites thinke that the bane of Peace, is never in yeelding to the course of the time, but ever in refuising to yeeld? or will they not rather aknowledge, that as a man <note n="c" place="margin">Ovid.

For the reason of the reservation, was, because some reverend Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes who dealt and laboured in the reformation of those Churches, perceaving the occurring lets and oppositions which were caused by most dangerous Shismes and Seditions, and by the raging of bloudy warres, scarcely exspected to effectuat so much as the purging of the Church from fundamentall errors and grosse Idolatry: which wrought them to be content, that lesser abuses in Discipline and Church po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie should be then tollerated, because they saw not how to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them all at that time. In the meane while they were so farre from desiring any of the Churches to retaine these Popish Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which might have convenient occasion of ejecting them, (farre lesse to recall them beeing once ejected,) that they testifyed plainly their dislike of the same, and wished, that those Churches wherein they lived, might have some blessed opportunity to be rid of all such rotten Relicks, riven Ragges, and rotten Remainders of Poperie.

               <hi>For this liberty we ought stoutly to fight against false Teachers.</hi> Finally, it is to be noted. that though in some things we may and doe commendably refuse obedience to the Lawes of those whom God hath set over us, yet are we ever obliged (and accordingly intend) still to subject our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves unto them.

Yet most certaine it is, that without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diligence in the use of the meanes, you shall neither convince your Adversaries, nor yet exoner your owne consciences, nor lastly have such comfort in the day of your suffering as otherwise you should. I know that principally and above all we are <note n="c" place="margin">Heb. 5. 7.</note> to offer up to God, Prayers and Supplications with strong crying and teares, which are the weapons of our spirituall warrefare: but as this ought to be done, so the atchieving of other secundary meanes, ought not to be left undone.</p>

But thou wilt say, my conscience suffers me not to obey, for I am persuaded that such things are not right, nor well appoynted.

               <p>Two things are here replied, 1. That there is reason for adstricting <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>III</label> of our practise, in these things, <note n="n" place="margin">B. Lind.

And to submit our selves to every ordinance of man for the Lords sake, 1 <hi>Pet,</hi> 2. 16. and <note n="o" place="margin">Spots.

Pet. 5 3.</note> Tyrannize over the Lords Inheritance, and to <note n="q" place="margin">Mark. 7. 9.</note> make the Commandements of God of no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect by their Traditions, they must give us leave to trie their precepts by the sure rule of Gods Word, and when we finde that they require of us any thing in the worship of God, which is either against or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3270:15"/>
his written Worde, then modesty to refuse obedience, which is the only way for order, and shunning of strife and contention. It will be said againe, that except we prove the things commanded by these who are set over us, to be unlawfull in themselves, we can not be allowed to refuse obedience to their ordinances. <hi>Ans.</hi> This unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of the Ceremonies in themselves, hath beene proved by us already, &amp; shall yet againe be proved in this Dispute. But put the case they were lawfull in themselves, yet have we good reason for refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them. <hi>David thought the feeding of his body was cause sufficient to breake the Law of the shewbread. Christ thought the satisfying of the Disciples hunger; to be cause sufficient to breake the Ceremony of the Sabbath: He thought also, that the healing of the leapers bodies was a just excuse to breake the Law that forbade the touching of them Much more then may we think now in our estimation, that the feeding of other mens soules, the satisfying of our owne consciences, togither with the consciences of other men &amp; the healing of mens superstition &amp; spiritual leprosie are causes sufficient to breake the Law of the Ceremonies &amp; of the Crosse, which are not Gods but mens</hi>

               <p>Secondly, it is replied, that our Christian liberty is not taken <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>IV</label> away when practise is restrained, because conscience is still left free. <hi>The Christian Liberty</hi>

                  <note n="u" place="margin">Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. p. 42.</note> saith <hi>Dr. Burgesse, that the Ceremonies in question are ordained to be used necessarily, though the judgment concerning them, &amp; immediate conscience to God, be left free. Ans.</hi> 1. Who doubts of this that liberty of practise may be restrained in the use of things which are in themselves indifferent? but yet if the bare auctority of an Ecclesiasticall Law, without any other reason, then the will and pleasure of men, be made to restraine practise, then is Christian Liberty taken away. <note n="x" place="margin">Thes. theol. de li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers Christ thes. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Iunius,</hi> saith that <hi>externum optis ligatur</hi> from the use of things indifferent, when the conscience is not bound; but in that same place he sheweth, that the outward action is bound &amp; restrained, only <hi>quo usque circumstantiae ob quas necessitas imperata est, se ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendunt.</hi> So that it is not the auctority of an Ecclesiasticall Law, but the occasion and ground of it, which adstricts the practise, when the conscience is left free. 2. When the auctority of the Churches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution is obtruded to bind and restraine the practise of Christians in the use of things indifferent, they are bereaved of their Liberty as well as if an opinion of necessity were borne in upon their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences. Therefore we see when the Apostle, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. gives Liberty of Mariage, he doeth not only leave the conscience free in its Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the lawfullnesse of Mariage, but also give liberty of practise,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3270:15"/>
to marry or not to marry. And <hi>Coll</hi> 2. 21. When he giveth instances of such human ordinances as take away Christian Liberty, he saith not, <hi>you must think that you may not touch,</hi> &amp;c. but, <hi>touch not,</hi> &amp;c. tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us, that when the practise is restrained from touching, tasting, handling, by the ordinances of men, then is Christian liberty spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, though the conscience be left free. <hi>Camero</hi> speaking of the servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude which is opposed to Christian liberty <note n="y" place="margin">Frel. in <hi>Math.</hi> 18. 7. tom. 2. p. 340.</note> saith, that it is either <hi>animi servitus, or corporis servitus.</hi> Then if the outward man be brought in bondage, this makes up spirituall thraldome, though there be no more. But, 3. The Ceremonies are imposed with an opinion of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity upon the conscience it self, for proof whereof, I proceed to the next point.</p>

               <p>Concerning the first of these we will heare what <hi>Dr. Field</hi>

               <p>If any say, that I derogate much from the Auctority of the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>VII</label> Church, when I doe nothing which shee prescribeth, except I see it lawfull and expedient; because I should doe this much for the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and admonition of a Brother. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. I give farre more reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the direction of the Church, then to the admonition of a Brother, because that is Ministeriall, this fraternall: that comes from Auctority, this only from Charity: that is Publike, this Privat: that is given by many, this by one: And finally, the Church hath a calling
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:3270:17"/>
to direct me in some things, wherein a brother hath not. 2. If it be still instanced, that in the point of obedience, I doe no more for the Church then for any brother, because I am bound to doe that which is made evident to be lawfull and expedient, though a privat Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian doe but exhort me to it, or, whether I be exhorted to it or not. For answere to this, I say, that I will obey the directions of the Church in many things, rather then the directions of a brother; for in two things which are in themselves indifferent, and none of them inexpedient, I will doe that which the Church requireth, though my brother should exhort me to the contrary. But allwayes I hold me at this sure ground, that I am never bound in conscience to obey the ordinances of the Church, except they be evidently lawfull &amp; expedient. This is that, <hi>fine quo non obligant,</hi> and also that which doeth chiefly binde, though it be not the only thing which bindeth. Now for making the matter more plaine, we must consider, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of the Church, are either lawfull, or unlawfull: if unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, they bind not at all: if lawfull, they are either concerning things necessary as <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 28. and then the necessity of the things doeth tind, whether the Church ordaine them or not; or else concerning things indifferent, as when the Church ordaineth, that in great Townes there shall be Sermon on such a day of the weeke, &amp; publike prayers every day at such an houre, here it is not the bare Auctority of the Church that bindeth, without respect to the lawfullnesse or expediency of the thing it selfe which is ordained, (else we were bound to doe every thing which the Church ordaines, were it never so unlawfull, for <hi>quod competit alicui qua tali, competit omni tali.</hi> We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Auctority of the Church making lawes, as well in unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ordinances as in lawfull:) not yet is it the lawfullnesse or expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency of the thing it self, without respect to the ordinance of the Church, (for possibly other times and diets were as lawfull, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient too, for such exercises, as those ordained by the Church:) but it is the Auctority of the Church prescribing a thing lawfull or expedient. In such a case then neither doeth the Auctority of the Curch binde, except the thing be lawfull and expedient, not doeth the lawfulnesse &amp; expediency of the thing binde, except the Church ordaine it, but both these joyntly doe binde.</p>
               <p>I come now to examine what is the judgment of Formalists, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <label type="milestone">

more is considered, as giving them power to binde, but only the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctority of those who make them; some Formalists doe give (as I will shew,) and all of them (being well advised) must give an affirmative answeare. And I pray what did <note n="i" place="margin">de Pont. Rom. lib. 4. cap. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> say more, when expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing how conscience is subject to humane Auctority, he taught, that conscience belongeth <hi>ad humanum forum, quatenus homo ex praecepto ita obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatur ad opus externum faciendum, ut si non faciat, judicat ipse in conscientia sua se male facere, &amp; hoc sufficit ad conscientiam obligandam?</hi> but to proceede par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly.</p>
               <p>I beginne with <hi>Field</hi> himselfe, whose resolution of the question pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>IX</label> is, <note n="k" place="margin">ubi supra.</note> that we are bound only to give obedience to such hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Lawes as prescribe things profitable, not for that humane lawes have power to binde the conscience, but because the things they command are of that nature, that not to performe them, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Iustice or Charity. Whereupon he concludeth out of <hi>Staple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> that we are bound to the performance of things prescribed by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Lawes, in such sort, that the not performance of them is sinne, not <hi>ex sola legislatori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If they say, that we must thinke those lawes to be profitable or convenient, which they, who are set over us, thinke to be so, then they know not what they say: for, exeeming conscience from being bound by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane lawes in one thing, they would have it bound by them in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing. If conscience must needs judge that to be profitable, which seemeth so to these that are set over us, then (sure) is power given to them for binding the conscience so straitly, that it may not judge otherwise then they judge, and force is placed in their bare Auctority, for necessitating and constraining the assenting judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of conscience.</p>
               <p>Some man perhaps will say, that we are bound to obey the lawes <label type="milestone">

Survey our charges where we have laboured, if they be not found to be of the faithfullest subjects that be in the Land, we deserve no favour. Nay, there is, wherein we stretch our consciences to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most to conforme, &amp; to obey in diverse matters. Are we refractary in other things as Balaams asse said to his Master? have I used to serve thee so at other tymes?</hi> And as touching scandall, he sheweth first, that by our not confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, we doe not scandalize Superiours, but edify them; although it may be we displease them, of which we are sorry, even as <hi>Ioab</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased <hi>David,</hi> when he contested against the numbring of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, yet did he not scandalize <hi>David,</hi> but edify him. And secoundly, whereas it might be alledged, that Non-conformity doeth scandalize the people, before whom it soundeth as it were an allarum of disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, we replie with him? <hi>Daniel will not omit the Ceremony of looking out at the Window towards Ierusalem. Mordecai omitteth the Ceremony of bowing the knee to Haman; Christ will not use the Ceremony of washing hands, though a tradition of the Elders and Governours of the Church then being.

               </p>
               <p>But some of our Opposites goe about to derive the obligatory <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>XI</label> power of the Churches Lawes, not so much from the utility of the Lwaes themselves, or from any scandall which should follow upon the not obeying of them, as from the Churches owne Auctority, which maketh them. <note n="n" place="margin">pral. tom. 1. de potest: eccl. contr. 2. pag. 371.</note> 
                  <hi>Camero</hi> speaketh of two sorts of Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall Lawes, 1. Such as prescribe things frivolous or unjust, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning such things as (though they neither detract any thing from the glory of God, nor cause any damnage to our nighbour, yet) bring some detriment to our selves. 2. Such as prescribe things belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to order and shunning of scandall. Touching the former, he teacheth rightly, that conscience is never bound to the obedience of such Lawes, except only in the case of scandall and contempt, and that if at any time such Lawes may be neglected and not obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, without scandall given, or contempt shewed, no mans conscience is holden with them. But touching the other sorte of the Churches lawes, he saith, that they bind the conscience indirectly, not only <hi>respectu materiae praecepti</hi> (which doeth not at all obliege, except in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the end whereunto it is referred, namely, the conserving of order, and the not giving of scandall;) but also <hi>respectu praecipientis,</hi> because God will not have those who are set over us in the Church to be contemned. He foresawe (belike,) that whereas it is pretended in behalfe of those Ecclesiasticall Lawes which injoyne the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Ceremonies, that the things which they prescribe pertaine to order and to the shunning of scandall, and so bind the conscience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly in respect of the end: one might answeare; I am persuaded
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:3270:20"/>
upon evident grounds, that those prescribed Ceremonies pertaine not to order, and to the shunning of scandall, but to misorder, and to the giving of scandall. Therefore he laboured to binde such a ones conscience with another tie, which is the Auctority of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers. And this Auctority he would have one to take, as ground enough to believe, that that which the Church prescribeth, doeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to order and the shunning of scandall, and in that perswasion to doe it. But, 1. How doth this Doctrine differ from that which <note n="o" place="margin">ibid. pag. 366.</note> himselfe setteth downe as the opinion of Papists, <hi>posse cos qui prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunt Ecclesiae, cogere fideles ut id credant vel faciant, quod ipsi judicaverint?</hi> 2. It is well observed by our <note n="p" place="margin">Par. com. in <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. dub. 7.</note> Writers, that the Apostles never made things indifferent to be necessary, except onely in respect of scandall, and that out of the case of scandall, they still left the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of men free, which <hi>Observation</hi> they gather from <hi>Act.</hi> 15. &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <note n="q" place="margin">ubi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra, p. 372.</note> 
                  <hi>Camero</hi> himselfe noteth, that though the Church pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed abstinence from things sacrificed to Idols, yet the Apostle would not have the Faithfull to abstaine for conscience sake, why then holdeth he, that beside the end of shunning scandall and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping order, conscience is bound even by the Churches owne Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctority? 3. As for the reason whereby he would prove that the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Lawes doe binde, even <hi>respectu praecipientis,</hi> his forme of spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king is very bad: <hi>Deus</hi> (saith he) <hi>non vult contemni praepositos Ecclesia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nisi justa &amp; necessaria de causa.</hi> Where falsely he supposeth, not onely that there may occurre a just and necessary cause of contemning those whom God hath set over us in the Church, but also, that the not obeying of them inferreth the contemning of them. Now, the not obeying of their Lawes, inferreth not the contemning of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, (which were not allowable) but onely the contemning of their Lawes, And as <note n="r" place="margin">

So wee say of all Superiours in generall, that we may sometimes have just reasons for contemning their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, yet are we not to contemne, but to honour themselves. But, 4. Let us take <hi>Cameros</hi> meaning to be, that God will not have us to refuse obedience, unto those who are set over us in the Church: none of our Opposites dare say, that God will have us to obey those who are set over us in the Church, in any other things, then such as may bee done both lawfully and conveniently for the shunning of scandall; and if so, then the Churches precept can not binde, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept as it is grounded upon such or such reasons.</p>

yet thus are wee dealt with. <hi>B.

And <hi>B. Spotswood,</hi> to such as object, that their conscience will not suffer them to obey, because they are perswaded that such things are not right, answereth; That the sentence of their Superiours ought to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them, and make their conscience yeeld to obedience. Their words I have before transcribed. By which it doeth manifestly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that they would beare dominion over our consciences, not as Lords onely, by requiring the willing and readie assent of our consciences, to those things which are urged upon us by their sole Will and Auctority, but even as Tyrants, not caring if they get so much as constrained obedience, and if by their Auctority they can compell conscience, to that which is contrary to the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> and full persuasion which it hath conceived.</p>
               <p>It will be said, that our consciences are in an error, and therefore ought to be corrected by the sentence of Superiours, whose Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctority <label type="milestone">

It is an audacious contempt in <note n="z" place="margin">com. in <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Calvines</hi> judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to doe any thing <hi>repugnante conscientia.</hi> The learned Casuists teach us, that an erring conscience, though <hi>non obligat,</hi> yet <hi>ligat;</hi> though we be not obliged to doe that which it prescribeth, yet are we bound not to doe that which it condemneth. <hi>Quicquid fit repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnante &amp; reclamante conscientia, peccatum est, etiamsi repugnantia ista gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vem errorem includat,</hi> saith <note n="a" place="margin">Theol. cas cap. 2.</note>

                  <note n="b" place="margin">Enchir. class. 2. cap. 7.</note> saith <hi>Hemmingius.</hi> This holds ever true of an erring conscience about matters of fact, and especially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout things indifferent. If any say, that hereby a necessity of sinning is laid on them, whose Consciences are in an error, I answer, that so long as a man keeps an erroneous conscience, a necessity of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning lies on him, and that through his owne fault. This necessity ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth from this supposition, that he retaine his erring conscience, and so is not absolute, because he should informe his conscience rightly, so that he may both doe that which he ought to doe, &amp; doe it so from the approbation of his conscience. If it be said again, what
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3270:21"/>
should be done to them, who have not laid downe the error of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, but doe still retaine the same? I answer, <note n="c" place="margin">Bald de consc. cas. lib. 1. cap. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>eligatur id quod tutius &amp; melius est.</hi> If therefore the error of conscience be about weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and necessary matters, then it is better to urge men to the doing of a necessary duty in the service of God, then to permit them to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect the same, because their erring conscience disapproveth it: for example; It is better to urge a prophane man to come and heare Gods Word, then to suffer him to neglect the hearing of the same, because his conscience alloweth him not to heare. But if the error of conscience be about unnecessary things, or such as are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves indifferent, then it is <hi>pars tutior,</hi> the surest and safest part not to urge men, to doe that which in their consciences they condemne. Wherefore, since the Ceremonies are not among the number of such necessary things, as may not be omitted without the perill of Salvation; the invincible disallowance of our consciences, should make our Opposites not presse them upon us, because by practising them we could not but sinne, in that our consciences judge them unlawfull. If any of our weake Bretheren thinke, that he must and should abstaine from the eating of flesh upon some certaine day, though this thing bee in it selfe indifferent and not necessary, yet <note n="d" place="margin">de conse. cas. lib. 1. cap. 7.</note> saith <hi>Balduin, he who is thus perswaded in his conscience, if he should doe the contrarie sinneth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conscience then though erring, doeth ever binde in such sorte, that he who doeth against his conscience, sinneth against God. Which <label type="milestone">

It supposeth, that he who may command a cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from one kind of labour, upon one of the sixe dayes, may also command a cessation from all kind of labour, but there is a differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce: for the Law of God hath allowed us to labour sixe dayes of every week, which liberty no human power can take from us. But we can not say, that the law of God alloweth us sixe dayes of every week, to Oeconomicall and private workes, (for then we should never be bound to put our hands to a publike worke.)

                  </gap>ion from some labour, but not from all. 2. The Bishop reasoneth from a cessation from ordinary labour for extraordinary labour, to a cessation from ordinary labour for no labour: for they who use their weapons for the defence of the Crowne or liberty of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, doe not cease from labour, but only change ordinary labour into extraordinary, and private labour into publike: Whereas our Opposites pleade for a cessation from all labour upon their holy dayes. 3. He skippeth <hi>de genere in genus:</hi> because the King may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a cessation for civill workes, therefore he may command a holy rest for the exercise of Religion, as if he had so great power in Sacred as in Civill things.</p>
               <p>The B hath yet a thrid dart to throw at us. <hi>If the Church</hi>

may not shee for constant and eternall blessings, which doe infinitly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell all occasionall benefites, appoint ordinary times of commemoration or thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving. Ans.</hi> There are two reasons, for which the Church may and should appoint Fasts or Festivities upon occasionall motives, and neither of them agreeth with ordinary Festivities. 1. Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Fasts either for obtaining some great blessing, or averting some great judgement, are necessary meanes to be used in such cases: like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, extraordinary Festivities are necessary testifications of our thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse for the benefits which we have impetrate by our extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Fasts; but ordinary Festivities for constant, &amp; eternall blessings, have no necessary use. The celebration of set Anniversary dayes, is no necessary meane for conserving the commemoration of the benefits of redemption, Because we have occasion, not only every Sabbath day, but every other day, to call to minde these benefites, either in hearing, or reading, or meditating upon Gods Word. <hi>Dies Christo dicatos tollendos existimo judicoque</hi> saith <note n="d" place="margin">apud <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And as for particularities, all the particular causes, occasions, and times of fasting, could not be determined in Scripture, because they are infinite, as <note n="e" place="margin">pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And albeit so many were allowable, yet who seeth not, how easily the Scripture might have comprehended them, because they are set, constant, and anniversary times, observed for permanent and continuing causes, and not moveable or mutable, as Fasts which are appointed for ocurring causes, and therefore may be infinit. I conclude, that since Gods Word hath given us a generall

                  <hi>Tilen</hi> also beateth upon. <hi>Ans.</hi> There is huge difference betwixt the rest which is injoyned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on anniversary Festivities, and the rest which is required, during the time of the weekly meetings for Divine Worship. For, 1. Vpon Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stivall dayes, rest from labour is required all the day over, whereas upon the dayes of ordinary and weekly meetings, rest is required, onely during the time of publike Worship. 2. Cessation from la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for Prayers or Preaching on those appointed dayes of the week, at some occasions may be omitted, but the rest, and comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration appointed by the Church to be precisely observed upon the anniversary Festivall dayes, must not be omitted, in the <note n="k" place="margin">ubi supra pag. 25.</note> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops judgment. 3. Men are straitly commanded &amp; compelled to rest from labour upon Holydayes, but to leave worke to come to the ordinary weekly meetings, they are only exhorted. And here I marke how the Bishop contradicteth himselfe: for in one place where his Antagonist maintaineth truly, that the Craftsman can not be lawfully commanded nor compelled to leave his worke, and to goe to publike Divine Service, except on the day that the Lord hath san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified: <note n="l" place="margin">ibid. pag. 17.</note> He replieth, <hi>if he may be lawfully commanded to cease from his labour, during the time of divine service, he may be as lawfully compelled to obey the command.</hi> Who can give these words any sence, or see any thing in them said against his Antagonists position, except he be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to say, that the Craftman may be both commanded and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to leave his worke, &amp; goe to Divine Service, on the week dayes appointed for the same? Nay, he laboureth to prove thus much out of the 9. head of the first booke of Discipline, which saith: <hi>In great Townes, we think expedient that every day there be either Sermon or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayers,</hi> &amp;c. Where there is nothing of compulsion, or a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing command, only there is an exhortation. But ere the Bishop have said much, he forgetteth himselfe, <note n="m" place="margin">ibid. pag. 27.</note> and tells us, that it were against Equity &amp; Charity, to adstrict the husband-man to leave his plough, so oft as the dayes of weekly preaching doe returne, but that on the Festivall dayes, reason would, that if he did not leave his plough willingly, by Auctority he should be forced. Which place confirmeth this difference, which we give betwixt rest on the holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes, and rest at the times of weekly meeting.</p>

Where the Apostle will have the <hi>Colossians,</hi> not to suffer themselves to be iudged by any man in respect of an Holy day, i. e. to be condemned for not observing a Holy-day, for, <note n="n" place="margin">Calv. com. in illum loc.</note> 
                  <hi>judicare hic significat culpae reum facere;</hi> and <note n="o" place="margin">Zanch. com. ibid.</note> the meaning is: suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not your selves to be condemned by those false Apostles, or by any mortall man, in the cause of meate, that is, for meate or drinke taken, or for any Holy-day, or any part of an Holy-day neglected. Two other reasons the Apostle giveth in this place, against Festivall dayes; one, <hi>vers.</hi> 17. What should we doe with the shadow, when we have the body? another, <hi>vers.</hi> 20. Why should we be subject to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ordinances, since through Christ we are dead to them, and have nothing adoe with them? Now, by the same reasons are our Holy-dayes to be condemned, as taking away Christian Liberty; and so that which the Apostle saith, doeth militate as well against them, as against any other Holy-dayes: for whereas it might bee thought, that the Apostle doeth not condemne all Holy-dayes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause both he permitteth others to observe dayes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 5. And he himselfe also did observe one of the Iewish Feasts, <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 21. It is easily answered, that our Holy-dayes have no warrant from these places, except our Opposites will say, that they esteeme their Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stivall dayes holier then other dayes, and that they observe the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wish Festivities. Neither of which they doe aknowledge; and if they did, yet they must consider, that that which the Apostle either said or did hereanent, is to be expounded and understood of bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with the weake Iewes, whom he permitted to esteeme one day above another, and for whose cause he did in his owne practise, thus farre applie himselfe to their infirmity at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3270:26"/>
Mosaicall Rites were like a dead man not yet buried, as <hi>Augustines simile</hi> runnes. So that all this can make nothing for Holy-dayes, after the full promulgation of the Gospell, and after that the Iewish Ceremonies are not onely dead, but also buried, and so, deadly to be used by us.

meaning, after such a manner, and for such an end, as the Iewes did. The former, our Opposites dare not hold, for then they should grant that he condemneth their owne <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Pentecost,</hi> because these two Feasts were observed by the Iewes. Nor yet can they hold them at the latter, for he condemneth that observation of dayes which had crept into the Church of <hi>Galatia,</hi> which was not Iewish nor Typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, seeing the Galatians, believing that Christ was already come, could not keep them as figures of his comming, as the Iewes did, but rather as memorialls that he was already come, saith <note n="y" place="margin">ubi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra.</note>

If the Apostles reasons wherewith he impugnes the observation of dayes, hold good against our Holy-dayes, so well as against the Iewish or Popish dayes, then doeth he condemne those, no lesse then these. But the Apostles reasons agree to our Holy dayes. For, 1. according to that reason, <hi>Gal</hi> 4. 3. they bring us under a Yoke of bondage. <note n="z" place="margin">Epist. 118. adla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuar.</note>

The Yoke and Bondage of Christians in respect of Feasts, is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier, then the Yoke of the Iewes, not onely for the multitude of them, but because <hi>Christianorum Festa<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ab hominibus tantum, judaeorum vero a Deo fuerint instituta,</hi> saith <note n="a" place="margin">de orig.

The other reason, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 9. hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth as good against our Holy dayes.

               <p>Thus we see, how the Apostles reasons hold good against our <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>IV</label> Holy-dayes: let us see next, what respects of difference the B. can imagine to evidence, wherefore the judaicall dayes may be thought condemned by the Apostle, and not ours. He deviseth a double re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect: and first <note n="g" place="margin">ubi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra pag. 40.</note> he tels us, that the Iewish observation of dayes, was to a typicall use, and whereas it is objected by us, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Iewes did not observe them as shadowes of things to come, because then they had denied Christ: he answereth thus. <hi>Howbeit the converted Iewes did not observe the Iewish dayes, as shadowes of things to come, yet they might have observed them, as memorials of bypast temporall and typicall benefites, and for present temporall blessings, as the benefite of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery out of Egypt, and for the fruits of the earth, which use was also typicall. Ans.</hi> 1. This is his owne conjecture onely, therefore he himselfe propoundeth it doubtfully, for he dare not say, they did observe them as memorials, &amp;c. but, they might have observed: to which guessing, if I reply, they might also not haue observed them as memorials of those bypast or present benefites, we say as much against him, and as truly, as he hath said against us. 2. His forme of reasoning is very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ncouth, for to prove, that the observation of dayes by the converted Iewes was to a typicall use, he alleadgeth, that they might have observed, &amp;c. Thus proving a position by a supposition. o brave! 3. There is no sence in his conjecture, for he yeelds, that they did not observe those dayes, as shadowes of things to come, and yet he saith, they might have observed them as memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials of by past typicall benefites: now they could not observe those
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:3270:27"/>
dayes as memorials of types, except they observed them also, as shadowing forth the antitypes. <hi>Pentecoste</hi> saith <note n="h" place="margin">com. in <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Davenant, &amp; illa legis datae celebratio, Spiritus Sancti missionem, &amp; legis in tabulis cordium per cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem Spiritum inscriptionem, adumbravit. Scenopegiae festum peregrinatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem hominis pij per hoc mundi desertum ad caelestem patriam delineabat,</hi> &amp;c. So that the Feast of Pentecost, if it had been observed, as a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall of the promulgation of the Law, could not but shadowe forth the sending of the holy Spirit into our hearts, to write the Law in them. And the Feast of Tabernacles, if it had been observed as a memoriall of the benefits, which Cod bestowed on his people in the wildernesse, could not but shadowe out Gods conducting of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, through the cours of their pilgrimage in this world, to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Canaan. 4. If Feasts which were memorials of temporall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites, were for this reason misticall, then he must graunt against himselfe, that much more are our Feasts misticall, which are me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morialls of Spirituall benefites, and consecrated to be holy signes &amp; symbols, for making us call to minde the misteries of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 5. Before this Dispute take an end, we shall see out of the best learned among our Opposites, <note n="i" place="margin">infra part. 3. in the arg. of superstition.</note> that they observe the Holy dayes as misticall, and more misticall, then the B. here describeth the Iewish dayes to have been, and so we shall see the falshood of that pretence, that they are observed onely for order and policy, and not for mistery. 6. If we would knowe the true reason, which made the converted Iewes to observe those dayes, it was not any misticall use, but that which made them thinke themselves obliged to other Mosaicall Rites; even <hi>propter auctoritatem legis,</hi> saith <note n="k" place="margin">animad. in Bell. contr. 3: lib. 4. cap. 16. nota 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius:</hi> for albeit they could not be ignorant, that these Rites were shadowes of things to come, and that the body was of Christ, in whom, and in the vertue of whose death, they did stablish their Faith, yet they did not at first understand, how such things as were once appointed by God himselfe, and given to his people, as ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to be keeped by them throughout their generations, could be altogither abolished, and for this cause, though they did condes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to a change of the use and signification of those Ceremonies, as being no more typicall of the Kingdome of Christ, which they believed to be already come: yet still they held themselves bound to the use of the things themselves, as things commanded by God.</p>
               <p>Thus much may be collected from <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 21. Where <hi>Iames</hi> gives a reason, wherefore it was expedient, that the Gentiles should ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve some of the Iewish Rites for a time, as <note n="l" place="margin">com. in illum locum.</note>

                  <hi>Iunius</hi> expound the place: His reason is, because the Iewes, being so long accustomed with the hearing of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and such as did preach the same, could not be made at first to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, how the ordinances which God gave to his people by the hand of <hi>Moses,</hi> might be cast off and not regarded: which importeth
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:3270:28"/>
as much as I say, namely, that the reason wherefore the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Iewes were so apt to be scandalized by such as cared not for the Ceremoniall Law, and held themselves obliged to observe the same, was, because they saw not how they could be exeemed from the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and statutes of the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> with which they had been educated and accustomed.</p>
               <p>Rests the seconde respect of difference given by the B. <hi>Further,</hi>

                  <note n="o" place="margin">ubi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra.</note> saith he, <hi>they did observe them with opinion of necessity, as things institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God for his worship and their salvation, which sort of observation was legall. Ans.</hi> 1. Be it so: he can not hereupon inferre, that the Apostle doth onely condemne the observation of Iudaicall dayes, for he seeth nothing of observing dayes with opinion of necessity, but simply and absolutely he condemneth the observing of dayes, and his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons reflexe on our Holy-dayes, as well as the Iewish. 2. Their opinion of necessity, he either refers to the institution, which these dayes once had from God, or else to the use which at that time they had for Gods Worship and their Salvation. That they observed them with opinion of necessity, as things which had been instituted by God, it is most likely: but that they observed them with opinion of necessity, as things necessary for Gods Worship and their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is more then can be made good; it is more probable, that they observed them merely and simply, for that they had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be instituted by God in his Law. For to say, that they obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them to the same use and end, for which God did institute them, is false; because then they had observed them as types and shadowes of the comming of Christ, and so had denied Christ. 3. If the Apostle condemne the observing of dayes instituted by God, with opinion of necessity, much more doeth he condemne the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving of dayes instituted by men, with such an opinion. And such is the observation of dayes urged upon us. Though the B. pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that the observing of our Holy-dayes is not imposed with opinion of necessity, shall we therefore thinke it is so? Nay, Papists doe also pretend, <note n="p" place="margin">Bell. de Euchar. lib. 6. cap. 13.</note> that the observation of their Ceremonies is not necessary, nor the neglecting of them a mortall sinne. I have proved heretofore out of our Opposites their owne wordes, that the Ceremonies in question, (and by consequence Holy-dayes among the rest) are urged upon us with opinion of necessity, and as their words, so their workes bewray them, for they urge the Ceremonies with so exorbitant vehemency, and punish refusers with so excessive severity, as if they were the weightiest matters of the Law of God. Yet they would have us believe, that they have but sober and meane thoughts of these matters, as of circumstances determined for order and policy onely: Iust like <note n="q" place="margin">Proverb. 26. 18. 19.</note> a man who casts firebrands and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, and yet saith, Am not I in sporte? They will tell us, that they
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3270:28"/>
urge not the Ceremonies as necessary in themselves, but onely as necessary in respect of the Churches determination, and because of the necessity of obeying those, who are set over us. But I pray, is not this as much as the <note n="r" place="margin">annot. on <hi>Math.</hi> 6. 15. sect. 5.</note> Rhemists say, who place the necessity of their Rites and observances, not in the nature of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but in the Churches precept?</p>

                  <hi>B. Lindsey,</hi> taken out of one of his epistles to <hi>Hallerus:</hi> which I finde in the volume before quoted, pag. 136. 137. that which they gripe to in this Epistle, is, that <hi>Calvine,</hi> speaking of the abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Festivall dayes in <hi>Geneva,</hi> saith, <hi>hoc tamen testatum esse volo, si mihi delata optio fuisset, quod nunc constitutum est, non fuisse pro senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia dicturum. Ans.</hi> That which made <hi>Calvine</hi> say so, was not any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king which he had to Festivall dayes, for he <note n="t" place="margin">ibid. pag. 138.</note> cals the abolishing of them <hi>ordo bene compositus.</hi> But as himselfe sheweth in the following Epistle which beareth this title. <hi>Cal. Ministro Burensi, S. D.</hi> The reason, why he durst scarcely have so determined, if his judgement had been required, was, because he saw neither end nor remedy for the prevailing tumult of contention raised about Festivall dayes, and likely to impede the course of Reformation, therefore <hi>fovendae pacis studio,</hi> he professeth, that he durst not make mention of the abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those Holy-dayes. Because he would have tolerated Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-dayes, because he durst not at that time, and as the case then stood, have spoken of the abolishing them, can it be hereupon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that he allowed of them? No sure. But it is observable, how both these <hi>Prelates</hi> pervert <hi>Calvins</hi> words. <hi>B. Spotswood</hi> alledgeth his words anent the abolishing of these Festivall dayes, thus: <hi>Ego neque suasor neque impulsor fui, atque hoc testatum volo, si mihi delata optio,</hi> &amp;c. Whereas the words in that Epistle lie thus, <hi>ego tametsi neque suasor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que impulfor fui, sic tamen accidisse non moleste fero. Quod si statum no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strae Ecclesiae aeque compertum haberes, non dubitares meo judicio subscribere. Hoc tamen testatum esse volo, si mihi delata optio, &amp;c.</hi> The B. would have made his hearers believe, that <hi>Calvine was not content with the abolishing of the festivall dayes,</hi> whereas his words testify the very contrary. <hi>B. Lindsey</hi> is as grosse in perverting the end of that Epistle. <hi>Nec tamen est cur homines adeo exasperentur, si libertate nostra ut Ecclesiae edificatio postulat utimur,</hi> &amp;c. from which words he concludes, that in <hi>Calvines</hi> judgement the observation and abrogation of those dayes, is in the power and liberty of the Church. But the reader will perceave, that <hi>Calvine</hi> there speaketh only of the Churches liberty to abrogate Holy dayes, and no thing of her power to observe them, for he is shewing that howbeit he durst not have given advise to abolish them, if the decision had been referred to him, yet they had no reason for them who were offended at the abolishing of them in <hi>Geneva,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that Church had done no more then she had power and liberty to doe for edification, 3. Other Testimonies they produce, which can not help them much. That which <note n="u" place="margin">ubi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra pag. 91.</note>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:3270:30"/>
                  <hi>Zanchius</hi> his confession, maketh him but small advantage, for though <hi>Zanchius</hi> there alloweth of the sanctification of some Festivall dayes, yet writing on the fourth Commandement, he aknowledgeth that it is more agreeable to the first institution, and to the writings of the Apostles, that one day of the week only be sanctified. What meant the <note n="x" place="margin">ibid. pag. 41.</note> B. to say, that this place is falsified &amp; mutilated by his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagonist? who quotes it not to prove that <hi>Zanchius</hi> dissallowed of Festivall dayes, but to prove that in <hi>Zanchius</hi> his judgement, the sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the Sabbath only, &amp; no other day in the week, agreeth best with Divine and Apostolicall institution: was there any need to alledge more of <hi>Zanchius</hi> his words then concerned the point which he had to prove? <note n="y" place="margin">ibid. pag. 95.</note> the B. alledgeth also a Testimony out of <hi>Perkins</hi> on <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 10. which makes him but very litle help: For albeit <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> thought good, in some sort to excuse the observing of dayes, in his owne mother Church of <hi>England,</hi> yet I find in that place, 1. He complaineth that the greatest part respects those Holy-dayes more then they should. 2. He alloweth only the observing of dayes for orders sake, that men may come to the Church to heare Gods Word: which respect will not be enough to the B. if there be not a solemnizing &amp; celebrating of the memory of some of Gods inesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable benefites, and a dedicating of the day to this end &amp; purpose. 3. He saith, that it is the priviledge of God to appoint an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary day of rest: so that he permitteth not power to the Church, for appointing a set, constant, and anniversary day of rest, for such a day becommeth an ordinary day of rest. 4. He preferreth the practise of those Churches of the Protestants, who doe not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve Holy-dayes, because (saith he,) the Church in the Apostles dayes, had no Holy-day beside the Lords day, and the fourth Commandement injoynes the labour of sixe dayes.</p>
               <p>The B. meeteth with another answeare in his Antagonist, which <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>V</label> crosseth his Testimonies, namely, that howsoever forrain Divines in their Epistles and Councells, spake some times sparingly against Holy-dayes, when their advise was sought of Churches newly risen out of Popery and greatly distressed, yet they never advised a Church to resume them, where they were removed. The <note n="z" place="margin">ubi supra pag. 83.</note> B. objecteth against this answeare, that <hi>Calvine</hi> Epist. 51. <hi>adviseth the Monbelgar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens not to contend against the Prince for not resuming</hi> (he should have said, for not receiving, if he had translated <hi>Calvines</hi> words faithfully) <hi>of all Festivall dayes, but only such as served not to edification, and were seen to be superstitious.

If holy dayes in <hi>Calvines</hi> judgement be foolries; If he gave advyce not to approve them; If he thought them occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of superstition; If he held it superstition to distinguish one day from another, or to esteeme one above another; If he call them Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daicall, though kept to the honour of God; judge then what allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wance they had from him. 2.

expedient and necessary to conforme unto such burthensome and beggarly Ceremonies, as are many wayes inconvenient, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions of sundry evill effects. His principall reason is, <note n="f" place="margin">ibid. pag. 8.</note> That the Apostles by direction of the Holy Ghost, and upon reasons of common and perpetuall equity, did practise themselves, and caused others to practice, yea advised and injoyned (as matters good and necessary to be done) Ceremonies so inconvenient and evill in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny maine and materiall respects, as the Ceremonies injoyned and prescribed in the Church of <hi>England</hi> are supposed to be; whence he would have it to followe, that to suffer deprivation for refusing to conforme to the Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England,,</hi> is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the doctrine and practise of the Apostles. <hi>Ans.</hi> These Iewish Ceremonies in the use and practise of the Apostles, were no way evill and inconvenient, as himselfe every where confesseth; whereas therefore <note n="g" place="margin">Ibid. p. 9. 10. 11.</note> he tels us, that those Ceremonies were abused to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition, were of misticall signification, imposed and observed as parts of Gods worship, swerving from the generall rules of Gods word, not profitable for order, decencie, and edification, offensive many wayes, and infringing Christian liberty; he runnes at random all the while: for these things agree not to the Iewish Ceremonies, as they were rightly used by the Apostles themselves, and by others at their advise, but onely as they were superstitiously used with opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of necessity by the obstinate Iewes, and by the false teachers, who impugned Christian liberty. So that all that can followe upon <hi>Mr. Sprints</hi> Argument, is this, That notwithstanding of the evils and inconveniences which follow upon certaine Ceremonies in the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious abuse of them by others, yet if in our practise they have a necessary or expedient use, then (after the example of the Apostles) we may well conforme unto them. Now all this commeth not neere the point, which <hi>Mr. Sprint</hi> undertaketh to prove, namely, That graunting the controverted Ceremonies to be in out use and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of the same, many wayes evill and inconvenient, yet to suffer deprivation for refusing to conforme to the same, is contrary to the doctrine and practise of the Apostles. And as touching the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison instituted betwixt our controverted Ceremonies, and these an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquated Ceremonies of the Iewes, practised and prescribed by the Apostles, after the ascension of Christ, and before the full promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Gospell, many evils there be in ours which could not be found in theirs. For, 1. Ours, have no necessary use and might well be spared: Theirs, had a necessary use for avoiding of scandall, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 28. 2. Ours, produce manifold inconveniences (whereof we are to speake hereafter) in our use and practise of the same, which is prescribed: Theirs, in the use and practise of the same, which was injoyned by the Apostles, were most expedient, for winning of the obstinate Iewes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 20. &amp; for keeping of the weake, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 22.

Ours, have certaine misticall significations. Theirs, not so: for it is no where to be read, that the Apostles either practised or prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed them as significative resemblances of any mistery of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God. 6. Ours, make us (though unnecessarily) like unto I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters in their Idolatrous actions: Theirs, not so. 7. Ours, are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed with a necessity both of practise and opinion, even out of the case of scandall: Theirs, not so. 8. Ours, are pressed by naked will and Auctority: Theirs, by such speciall grounds of momentaneous reason, as made the practise of the same necessary for a certaine time, whither the Apostles had injoyned it or not. 9. Ours, are urged even upon such, as in their consciences judge them to be unlawfull: Theirs, not so. 10. Ours, have no better originall then humane and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian invention. Theirs, had their originall from Gods owne institution. 11. Ours, are the accursed monuments of Popish Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, to be ejected with detestation: Theirs, were the memorials of Mosaicall policy, to be buried with honour. 12. Ours, are pressed by such pretended reasons, as make them ever and every where ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary: Theirs, by such reasons, as did onely conclude a necessity of using them at sometimes, and in some places. 13. Ours, are urged after the full promulgation of the Gospell, and aknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christian liberty: Theirs, before the same. 14. Ours, are ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the carelesse neglect of pressing more necessary duties: Theirs not so.

               <p>His seconde reason, whereby he goeth about to prove, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>III</label> of conforming to inconvenient Ceremonies in the case of deprivation, <note n="i" place="margin">ubi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra pag. 24. 28.</note> he taketh from this ground: That when two duties commanded of God, doe meet in one practise, so as we can not doe them both, in this case we must performe the greatter duty, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect the lesser. Now, whereas he saith, when two duties doe meet, &amp;c. he means not, that both may be duties at once, for then a man shall be so straitned, that he must needs commit a sinne, in that he must needs omit one of the duties. But (as he explaineth himselfe) he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them duties, being considered apart: as, to heare a Sermon at the Church on the Sabbath, and to tend a sicke person ready to die at home at the same time, both are duties being considered apart,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3270:34"/>
but meeting togither in our practise at one time, there is but one duty, because the lesser worke binds not for that present. Now he assumes, that the doctrine and practise of suffering deprivation for refusing to conforme to inconvenient Ceremonies, doeth cause men to neglect greater duties, to performe the lesser. For proofe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he enlargeth a needlesse discourse, tending to prove, that prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching is a greater duty and of higher bond, then the duty of labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring unto fit Ceremonies, or of refusing inconvenient Ceremonies; which can not helpe his cause. That which he had to prove, was, that not to suffer deprivation for refusing of inconvenient Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, is a greater duty, then the refusing of inconvenient Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. But it will be said, that to suffer deprivation for refusing of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient Ceremonies, doeth cause men to neglect the preaching of the Word, and that is a greater duty, then the refusing of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Ceremonies. <hi>Ans. 1.

Sprint</hi> him selfe layeth downe one ground, which proveth the refusing of inconvenient Ceremonies to be a greater duty, then the preaching of the Word: for <note n="k" place="margin">ibid. p. 52.</note> he hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, that the substantials of the seconde Table doe overrule the Ceremonials of the first Table, according to that which God saith, <hi>I will have mercy and not sacrifice, Math.</hi> 12. 7. And <note n="l" place="margin">ibid. pag. 28.</note> elsewhere he teacheth; that to tend a sicke person ready to die, is a greater duty, then the hearing of the Word. Now to practise inconvenient and scandalous Ceremonies, is to commit Soule-murther, and so to breake one of the most substantiall duties of the second Table. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Sprints</hi> owne ground, the refusing of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient and scandalous Ceremonies, is a greater duty, then the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Word, which is but a Ceremoniall of the first Table, and if the neglect of tending a sicke persons body, be a greater sinne, then to omit the hearing of many Sermons, much more to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the soules of men by practising inconvenient and scandalous Ceremonies, is a greater sinne then to omit the preaching of many Sermons, which is all the omission (if there be any) of those who suffer deprivation for refuising to conforme unto inconvenient Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies. But, 2. We denie, that the suffering of deprivation for refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to conforme unto inconvenient Ceremonies, causeth men to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect, or omit the duty of preaching. Neither hath <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Sprint</hi> alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged any thing for proofe hereof, except that this duty of preaching can not be done with us ordinarily, as things doe stand, if Ministers doe not conforme: for by order they are to be deprived of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry. Now what of all this? for though by the oppressing power of proud Prelats many are hindered from continuing in preaching, because of their refusing inconvenient Ceremonies, yet they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, who suffer deprivation for this cause, can not be said to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect or omit the duty of Preaching: most gladly would they
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3270:34"/>
preach, but are not permitted; And how can a man be said to omit or neglect that, which he would faine doe, but it lieth not in his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to get it done? All the strentgh of <hi>Mr. Sprints</hi> Argument lieth in this; That forasmuch as Ministers are hindred from preaching, if they doe not conforme, therefore their suffring of deprivation for refusing conformity, doeth cause them neglect the duty of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching. Which Argument, that I may destroy it with his owne wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, let us note, <note n="m" place="margin">ibid. p. 62.</note> that he alloweth a man (though not to suffer deprivation yet) to suffer any civill penalty or externall losse, for refusing of inconvenient Ceremonies commanded and injoyned by the Magistrate. Now, put the case, that for refusing inconvenient Ceremonies, I be so fined, spoiled, and oppressed, that I can not have sufficient wordly meanes for my selfe and them of my hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold; hence I argue thus, (if <hi>Mr. Sprints</hi> Argument hold good) that forasmuch as I am by strong violence hindered from providing for my selfe, and them of my houshould, if I doe not conforme, therefore my suffering of those losses for refusing of conformity, doeth cause me to neglect the duty of providing for my selfe, and for them of my family, which neglect should make me worse then an infidell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Sprint</hi> now addeth a third, proving, that to suffer deprivation <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>IV</label> for refusing to conforme to the prescribed Ceremonies, (howbeit <note place="margin">
                     <hi>(n)</hi> ibib p. 63.</note> many wayes inconvenient, is contrary to the royall law of love: which he laboureth to evidence three wayes. First, he saith, that to suffer deprivation for refusing to conforme, doeth by abstaining from a thing in nature in different (such as our Ceremonies (saith he) are proved to be) needelesly deprive men of the ordinary meanes of their salvation, which is the preaching ministery of the Word, &amp;c. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. That the controverted Ceremonies are in nature indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, neither he, nor any of his side hath yet proven: they suppone, that they are indifferent, but they prove it not. 2. We denie, that the suffering of deprivation for refusing to conforme to the prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed Ceremonies, doth deprive men of the preaching of the Word. Neither saith <hi>Mr. Sprint</hi> ought for proofe hereof, but that which we have already confuted, <hi>viz.</hi> that as things doe stand, all such as doe not conforme are to be deprived: whence it followeth onely, that the injury and violence of Prelats, (not the suffering of depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for refusing to conforme) depriveth men of the preaching of the Word. Secondly, he saith, <note n="o" place="margin">pag 67.</note> that the doctrine and practise of suffering deprivation for inconvenient Ceremonies, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth both the Apostolicall Churches, and all Churches since their times, because there hath been no Church, which hath not practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed inconvenient Ceremonies. <hi>Ans.</hi> It is most false which he saith of the Apostolicall Churches, for those Iewish Ceremonies practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by them, were most convenient, as we have said before. And as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3270:35"/>
for other Churches in after ages, so many of them as have practised inconvenient Ceremonies, are not herein to be followed by us. Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter goe right with a few then erre with a multitude. Thirdly, <note n="p" place="margin">pag. 68. 69. 70.</note> he saith, That the suffering of deprivation for refusing to conforme, breedeth and produceth sundry scandals. First saith he, It is the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of fraternall discord. O egregious impudency! who seeth not that the Ceremonies are the incendiary sparkles, from which the fire of contention hath its beeing and burning? so that conforming, (not refusing) is the furnishing of fewell, and casting of faggets to the fire. Secondly hee alledgeth, that the suffering of deprivation for refusing to conforme, twofold more scandalizeth the Papist then conformity, for he doeth farre more insult to see a godly Minister thrust out, and with him all the truth of God pressed, then to see him weare a Surplice, &amp;c. Thirdly he saith, it twofolde more scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizeth the Atheist, Libertine and Epicure, who by the painfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters deprivall, will triumph to see a doore opened for him without resistance, to live in Drunkennesse, Whooredome, Swearing, &amp;c. Now, for answer to his seconde and third pretenses, we say: 1. <hi>Mr. Sprint</hi> implieth indirectly, that when non-conforming Ministers are thrust out, Papists, Atheists, Libertines, and Epicures, exspect but small Opposition from those conforming Ministers who come in their rowmes. Our Opposites have a skilfull Procter (forsooth) of <hi>Mr. Sprint.</hi> And indeed if Papists and Atheists were so affrayed of Conformists, as of Non conformists, they would not thus insult. 2. We must distinguish betwixt deprivation and the suffering of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation. Papists insult indeed, that their assured frinds the Prelates, are so powerfull, as to thrust out from the publike Ministery, the greatest enemies of Popery. But as for the Ministers, their suffering of themselves to be thrust out, and deprived for refusing of Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, it is so farre from giving to Papists any matter of insulting, that it will rather grieve them &amp; gall them to the heart, to understa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that sundry powerfull, painefull, and learned Ministers, are so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse from Popery, that before they conforme to any Ceremony of the same, they will suffer for refusall: and that their constancy and courage in suffering for such a cause, will confirme many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors, in the perswasion of the trueth of their Doctrine, which they taught against conforming unto Popish Ceremonies. But to goe on; Fourthly (saith he) it twofolde more scandalizeth such a one; as doth truly feare the name of God, who could be more contented, to injoy the meanes of his Faith and Salvation with a small inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency of some Ceremonies, which he grieveth at, then to loose his Pastor, the Gospell, and the ordinary meanes of his Faith and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Ans. 1. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Sprint</hi> supposeth, that such a one, as for no respect whatsoever, would be contended with the practise of some inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Ceremonies, doth not truly feare the name of God. And who
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3270:35"/>
is the Puritane now? Is not <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Sprint,</hi> who standeth in such a huge distance from all who are of our mind, and so farre preferreth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and his followers to us, as if we did no truly feare the name of God? Secondly, he supposeth, that when Non-conforming Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters are thrust out, the ordinary meanes of Faith and Salvation are not dispensed (to the comfort and contentment of such as truly feare the name of God) by those conforming Ministers, who are sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate in their stead. Which, how his fellowes will take with, let them looke to it. 3. Forasmuch as the feare of God is to depart from evill, therefore such a one as doth truly feare the name of God, in so farre, as he doth feare the name of God, and <hi>quatenus,</hi> he is such a one, will never take well with the practise of inconvenient Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, which is not a parting from, but a cleaving unto evill. 4. They, who truly feare the name of God, are indeed scandalized by the Prelates their depriving of Ministers for refusing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme: but by the Ministers, their suffering of deprivation for this cause, they are not scandalized, but edified. But fiftly saith <hi>Mr. Sprint,</hi> it offendeth the Magistrate, by provoking him (perswaded and resolved as he is) to disgrace these otherwise well deserving Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, and to strike them with the Sword of Auctority. <hi>Ans.</hi> Our refusall to conforme to inconvenient Ceremonies, beeing a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary duty, if the Magistrate be provoked therewith, we are blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse: neither can it any otherwise provoke him to disgrace those well deserving Ministers, then <hi>Moses</hi> his seeking of liberty for Israell to goe and serve God according to his will, provoked <hi>Pharaoh</hi> the more to oppresse them; or then Christs preaching of the truth, and his abstaining from the superstitious Ceremonies of the Pharisees, provoked them to disgrace him, and plot his hurt. Howbeit we are not ignorant, that the Magistrate is not provoked by our refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to conforme, except as it is misreported, misdeemed, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constructed to him by the false Calumnies of our Adversaries: which beeing so, he is not incited by our deed, but by theirs.</p>
               <p>Now sixtly saith <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Sprint,</hi> it unjustly condemneth the Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>V</label> of all true Churches that ever were Primitive, and Reformed, and all sound Teachers of all times and places, whose universall Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine it hath been, that conformity to inconvenient Ceremonies is necessary, in case of deprivation. <hi>Ans.</hi> That the Ceremonies prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised by the Apostles and Apostolike Churches were not inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, it hath been already shewed. That since their times, sundry Churches both auncient and reformed have practised inconvenient Ceremonies, we denie not: yet <hi>(q) Mr. Sprint</hi> himselfe will not defend all the practises of those Churches, whose practise he alledgeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us. But that all sound Teachers, of all times and places, have taught the necessity of conformity to inconvenient Ceremonies, in case of deprivation, hee neither doeth, neither can make good.

But <note n="h" place="margin">ubi supra pag. 55.</note> 
                  <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Sprint</hi> excepteth against this rule, that it is not generally true; for evidence whereof, he alledgeth many things, partly false, partly impertinent, upon which I holde it not needfull, here to insist. As for such examples objected by him, as carry some shewe of making against this rule, which he dare not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3270:36"/>
admit, I will make some answeare thereto. He saith, that some times even negative precepts have beene lawfully violated: for these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts were negative; none but Priests must eate shew-bread, yet <hi>David</hi> did lawfully violate it: Thou shall doe no worke upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; yet the Priests brake this, and are blamelesse: let nothing of Gods good creatures be lost; yet <hi>Paul</hi> and his company did lawfully cast away their goods in the ship, to save their lives, &amp;c. <hi>Ans. Mr. Sprint</hi> might easily have understood, that when Divines say, the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative precepts bind at all times, but not to all times, the negative precepts both at all times; and to all times, they ever meane, <hi>specie actionis manente eadem:</hi> so long as a action forbidden in a negative pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, ceaseth not to be evill, as long the negative precept bindeth to all times: whereas even whiles an action commanded in an affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive precept, ceaseth not to be good, yet the affirmative precept bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not to all times. So that the rule is not crossed by the alledged examples; for <hi>Davids</hi> eating of the shewbread; the Priests labour upon the Sabbath; and <hi>Pauls</hi> casting of the goods into the sea; were not evill, but good actions (the kind of the action beeing changed by the circumstances.) In the meane time, the foresaid rule still cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Sprints</hi> tenet. For he holdeth, that even whiles certaine Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies remaine evill in their use, and cease not to be scandalous and inconvenient, yet we are not ever bound to abstaine from them, but may in the case of deprivation practise them. Which directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicteth the rule.</p>
               <p>The position therefore which we mantaine against <hi>Mr. Sprint,</hi> and <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>VI</label> from which we will not departe the breadth of one naile, is this, that we can never lawfully conforme (no not in the case of depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation) unto any Ceremony which is scandalous and inconvenient in the use of it. For further confirmation whereof, we say, 1. Every negative precept of the Law of God bindeth to all times, in such sort, that the action which it forbiddeth, (so long as it remaineth evill, &amp; the kinde of it is not changed,) can never lawfully be done. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, forasmuch as to abstaine from things scandalous and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, is one of the negative precepts of the Law of God; and the Ceremonies whereunto <hi>Mr. Sprint</hi> would have us to conforme in the case of deprivation are, and remaine scandalous and inconvenient in our practise and use of them, according to his owne presupposall; It followeth, that the use and practise of the same is altogither unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto us. 2. That which is lawfull in the nature of it, is never lawfull in the use of it, except only when it is expedient for edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as teacheth the Apost. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 12. &amp; 10. 23. The <hi>Corinthians</hi> objected that all indifferent things were lawfull <note n="i" place="margin">Paraeus. in. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 12.</note> The Apostle ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a limitation, <hi>esse licita quatenus conducunt,</hi> they are lawfull to be used in so farre as they are expedient. 3.

To conforme unto inconvenient and scandalous Ceremonies, in the case of deprivation, is at the best, to doe evill that good may come of it: which was the pretence of those Councellours, of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the 5. <note n="r" place="margin">Thuan. hist. lib. 39. pag. 367.</note> who advised him to suffer stewes at <hi>Rome,</hi> for preventing a greater evill of abusing chast women and honest matrons.

The difference betwixt that which is simply evill, and that which is evill in use and by accident, is in that the one may never be done, the other is unlawfull only <hi>pro tempore:</hi> but in this they agree, that both are unlawfull; for <note n="x" place="margin">Paraeus in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 23.</note> that which is evill by accident, whiles it is such, is unlawfull to be done, no lesse then that which is in nature evill. 3.

Sabbath, <hi>David</hi> his eating of the shewbread, and the Apostles their practising of very hurtfull Ceremonies; all which things beeing unlawfull, were done lawfully to further greater duties.</p>
               <p>We have answeared already, that the Priests their killing of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices on the Sabbath, and <hi>Davids</hi> eating of the shewbread, were not unlawfull, because the Circumstances changed the kinde of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.

Howsoever, that we may have some light in this matter, let us distinguish betwixt these two things, 1. The peoples legall unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, when they came to eat the Passeover. 2. Their adventuring to eate it, notwithstanding their uncleannesse. That they were at that time uncleane, it was a sinne. But whiles they prepared their hearts truly to seek God, and repented of their uncleannesse, that in this case they adventured to eat the Passeover, was no sinne: because <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>it is the will of God, that such as prepare their hearts unfainedly to seeke him, lament their wants, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent for that they are not so prepared and sanctified for his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship as they ought, (there being no other thing to hold them bake, beside some defect of sanctity in themselves) notwithstanding of any defect which is in them, draw near to him in the use of his holy ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. As touching the former, no man will say that they choosed to be uncleane, that they might further Gods worship. But as for the latter, repenting of their uncleannes, they choosed to keep the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, this they did to further Gods worship, and this was no sinne, especially if we observe with <hi>Tremellius,</hi> that it is said <hi>vers.</hi> 20.

The best lancing of the oposterne were, not to observe them at all, or to preach against them, which are tried to worke this effect more powerfully, then the Bishops cure hath done: for all know, that there is none so free of this superstition, as those who observe not the Holy-dayes.</p>

I hope it is not unknowen, how humbly and reverently many sincere Christians, with feare and trembling, doe addresse themselves to that most holy Sacrament, who yet for all the world, would not kneel in receaving it.

               </p>
               <p>Thus we perceave, what prejudice hath arisen, and yet ariseth, to <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>IV</label> the true and saving Doctrine, by the meanes of symbolizing with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in these Ceremonis. But because some Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists approve not of this course of Reconciliation, they (I knowe) would purge the Ceremonies of the blame of it; I will therefore shew, that Reconcilers are set forward in their course of Reconciliation, by meanes of the Romane Rites remaining in Reformed Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>G. Gassander</hi> in his booke <hi>de officio pijviri,</hi> relates unto us, how hee was entered into this course, and conceived this purpose of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation: and tels, that from his youthood hee was most observant of Ecclesiasticall Ceremonies, yet so, that he abhorred all supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And when he had read the Writers of that age, who promised some Reformation and Repurgation of superstitious worships and absurd opinions, he saith, <hi>mire illorum institutum placuit: qui tamen ita superstitiones &amp; abusiones, quae nonnullis Ceremoniis Ecclesiasticis admixtae e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, exos as haberem ut ipsam Ecclesiasticam politiam, quae his Ceremoniis fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re constat, non sublatam &amp; eversam, sed repurgatam &amp; emendatam esse vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> Wee see the first thing which induced him to a Reconciliation, was his liking which hee had to Popish Ceremonies, and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in Protestant Churches. And as this course hath been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, so is it also advanced by the Ceremonies: for thereby <note n="h" place="margin">Park. of the crosse. part. 2. pag. 80.</note> people are induced to say, as they said once, when Popish Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies did reenter in <hi>Germany. We perceave now, that the Pope is not so blacke as Luther made him.</hi> And as for the Reconcilers themselves, may they not conceave strong hopes to compasse their end? may they not confidently imbarke in this businesse? may they not with great exspectation of prosperous successe atchieve their project? when once they have footing upon our union with <hi>Rome</hi> in Ceremonies and Church policy; they can not but hereupon conceive no small
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3270:41"/>
animosity to worke out their intended purpose.</p>
               <p>Doe I talke of a <hi>Chimaera,</hi> &amp; imagine now that which is not? Nay, I will really examplify that which I say, in that <hi>Proteus</hi> and <hi>Versipel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> the Archbishop of <hi>Spalato.</hi> For in the narration of the passages which were betwixt his Majesty and him, collected by the Bishop of <hi>Durham,</hi> we finde, <note n="i" place="margin">pag. 32.</note> that he thought the procuring of concorde betwixt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be easie. And his reasons were, because <note n="k" place="margin">ibid. pag. 34.</note> he was verily perswaded, that the Pope would approve the English Liturgie, and the publike use of it, as he professed in his colloquy with the Bishops of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Durham,</hi> and the Deane of <hi>Winchester.</hi> And further, <note n="l" place="margin">ibid. pag. 41.</note> he told he was of opinion, that the Churches of <hi>Rome</hi> and of <hi>England,</hi> excluding Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans, were radically one Church. This made him say; <note n="m" place="margin">ibid. pag. 42.</note> 
                  <hi>I doe finde here, why to commend this Church, as a Church abhorring from Puritanisme, reformed with moderation, and worthy to be received into the Communion of the Catholike Church.</hi> In the following words he tels, that he could carry something out of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which should comfort all them who hate Puritane strictnesse, and desire the peace of the Church, (meaning them who desired the same Reconciliation with himselfe.) What is more cleare, then that the English Ceremonies, were that which made him prosequute, and gave him hope to effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate, a Reconciliation betwixt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and that of <hi>Rome?</hi>
               </p>

We have heard before from <hi>Spotswood,</hi> that novations in a Church, even in the smallest things, are dangerous. Who can then blame us to shunne a danger, and fearing the worst, to resist evill beginnings? to give no place to the Divell; to crush the Viper while it is in the shell; to abstaine from all appearance of evill, 1 <hi>Thessal</hi> 5. 22.

                  <hi>Musculus</hi> reprehends Bishops, for departing from the Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolicall and most auncient simplicity, and for adding Ceremonies unto Ceremonies in a worldly splendor and spectability, whereas the worship of God ought to be pure and simple.</p>
               <p>The Policy then which is most simple and single, and lest luste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the pompe &amp; bravery of Ceremonies, can not but be most expedient for edification. <note n="f" place="margin">Psal. 45. 13.</note> The Kings daughter is most like her selfe, when shee is all glorious within, not without, and <note n="g" place="margin">Luk. 17. 20. 21.</note> the Kingdome of God appeareth best what it is, when it commeth not with observation: But <hi>superstition</hi> (saith <note n="h" place="margin">Popish prejudic. cap. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Camero, the mother of Ceremonies, is lavish and prodigall; Spirituall Whooredome as it is, it hath this common with the bodily; both of them must have their paintings, their trinkets, their invenglements.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the Ceremonies are impediments to the inward and spirituall worship, because they are fleshly and externall. <note n="i" place="margin">Calv. com. in <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 5.</note> In the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <label type="milestone">

                  <note n="k" place="margin">Luk. 17. 21.</note> saith Christ. Now if the Apostle, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. say, that bodily exercise such as fasting, watching, &amp;c. which are requisite as helpes and furtherances to the humiliation of the soule, doe but profit a litle, then may we say of our unnecessary and unprofitable Ceremonies, that they are excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly nocent and harmefull to true and spirituall worship. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle is not speaking of playes and pastimes, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would have us to thinke. Who can believe that <hi>Timothie</hi> was so much addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to play, that the Apostle had need to admonish him, that such exercise profiteth litle? He is speaking then of such bodily exercises, as in those primitive times were used religiously, as fasting, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, lying on the ground, and such like; and he would have <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> rather to exercise himselfe to the life and power of Godlinesse, &amp; to substantiall worship, then to any of these outward things. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth the Apostle, condemne only the superstitious use of those exercieses, as <note n="l" place="margin">com. in illum locum.</note> 
                  <hi>Calvine</hi> well observeth: <hi>alioqui in totum damnaret:</hi> Whereas he doth only extenuate &amp; derogate from them, saying, that they profit litle. <hi>Ergo</hi> (saith he) <hi>ut maxime integer sit animus, &amp; rectue finis, tamen in externis actionibus nihill reperit Paulus quod magnifaciat.

Wherefore, because a transition from idolatry and Superstition, is more easie to Atheisme &amp; the propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of holy things, then to the golden mediocrity, he saith, he could have wished, that <hi>Beza</hi> had not generally condemned all Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies without making any difference.</p>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Neither <hi>Beza,</hi> nor any other, who mislike the English Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, condemneth such Rites and circumstances in the externall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

What shall we say then, of such a conjunction as this, <hi>que tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum decori serviunt, hominesque sui admoneant officii?</hi> Why would not <hi>Saravia</hi> write a Chronologie, I say not <hi>Magnarum</hi> (as others), but <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randarum conjunctionum,</hi> and record, that at such a time he found out the conjunction and compatibility of two things, which were ever thought incompatible in former ages, namely, Rites serving only for decency, and holy significant Ceremonies admonishing men of their duty in Gods worship? Had there been no Moralist (trowe we) then to note, that decency and things serving only for decency have place in civility &amp; all morall actions, in which notwithstanding there is no significant nor admonitory sacred signes of mens duty in Gods worship? And thus should these two things be seavered, which he hath conjoyned and confounded.</p>
               <p>To conclude, we condemne the English controverted Ceremonies which are regarded as holy and significant, as most in expedient, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they derogate from the true inward and spirituall worship; for <hi>mans nature</hi> saith <note n="n" place="margin">Popish. prajud. cap. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Camero, is delighted in that which is fleshly and outward, neglecting that which is spirituall and inward.</hi> And this is the reason, why least spirituall, lively, and holy disposition hath followed upon the addition of unnecessary Ceremonies; and why there was never so much zeall, life, and power of Religion inwardly, in the Church of Christ, as then, when shee was freest of Ceremonies. This much <note n="o" place="margin">Camero Ibid.</note> a Formalist of great note, is forced to a knowledge. <hi>Let us consider</hi> saith he, <hi>the Primitive Church, flourishing more in times of the Apostles, then ever it did afterwards: Who will not admire her great simplicity in all poynts, and especially in Ceremonies? for excepting the celebration of Baptisme by washing of water; and of the holy Supper, according to the Lords institution, in taking the Bread and Wine, &amp; distributing them after thanksgiving: excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting also the imposition of hands upon those who extraordinarily received the holy Ghost, whether it were in a generall calling, or a particular, to a charge in the Church, and availing for a miraculous effect, of healing the sicke; I say, these excepted, there will not be found any other Ceremony in those primitive times, so admirable was their simplicity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Ceremonies are a great hinderance to edification, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>III</label> because they make much time and paines to be spent about them,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:3270:43"/>
which might be, and (if they were removed) should be spent more profitably for godly edifying. That which is said of the Ceremonies which crept into the auncient Church, agreeth well to them. <note n="p" place="margin">Hospin. ubi supra.</note> 
                  <hi>Ista Ceremoniarum accumulatio tum ipsos doctores tum etiam ipsos auditores, a stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio docendi atque discendi verbum Dei abstraxit, atque impedivit necessarias &amp; utiles divini eloquii institutiones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pulpits sound oftentimes with declamations for the Ceremonies, when there is need of pressing the power of Godlinesse upon the consciences of people, and when there are many more necessary thinges to be urged. The Presse also sends forth idle discourses and defences of the Ceremonies, which might be employed more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably.</p>
               <p>And moreover, faithfull men whose labours might be very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to the Church, in the Holy Ministery, have neither a doore of enterance, nor a doore of utterance licentiated to them, and that because they will not consent, nor yeeld themselves to be the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py instruments of imposing this yoke of Ceremoniall bondage upon the necks of Gods people. Others who have entered, &amp; have been both faithfull &amp; painefull Labourers in the Lords Vineyard, are thrust from their charges, for no other quarrell, but that of Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity.

               <p n="2">II. This occasion of halting, stumbling, or swerving, which we call Scandall, is sometimes onely given on the part of the offender, sometimes onely taken on the part of the offended, sometimes both given on the one part, and taken on the other.

               <p n="3">III. All these three kindes of Scandall are sinfull. The first is the sinne of the offender; for it is a fault to give my brother occasion of stumbling, though he stumble not. The second is the sinne of the offended, who should not take offence where he hath no cause. The third is a sinne on both sides; for as it is a fault to lay an occasion of falling before another, so it is a fault in him to fall, though hee have occasion.</p>

Put the case a man stay away from the Christian Assemblies, and publike worship of God, intending to employ his studies all this time, for the good of the Church by writing; such a man doth not onely not intend the fall of others, but by the contrary he intendeth edification; yet doth he scandalize them, because <hi>ratio &amp; conditio ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> is scandalous and inductive to sinne.</p>
               <p n="5">V. An active Scandall is given (and so is faulty) many wayes. If it be in a thing lawfull, then it makes our brother condemne our lawfull deed, yea animates him by our example, to that which in his conscience he condemneth, both which are sinne. If it be in a thing unlawfull, then is the Scandall given and peccant, if either our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be made to fall into the outward act of sinne; or 2.

Now, their taking of offence, though it proceed of weaknesse, yet is sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, for their weaknesse and ignorance is a fault, and doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse them.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. A Scandall may be at first onely passive, &amp; yet afterward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come active. For example, <hi>Gedeons</hi> Ephod, and the brasen Serpent, were monuments of Gods mercies, and were neither evill, nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of evill, so that when people were first scandalized by them, the Scandall was merely passive, but the keeping and retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them, after that Scandall rose out of them, made the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall to become active also, because the reserving of them after that time, was not without appearance of evill.</p>

We ought for the Scandall of the malitious, to abstaine from all things from which we ought to abstaine for the Scandall of the weake; for we ought not to abstaine from necessary things for the Scandall of the weake, no more then for the Scandall of the mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and from things that are not necessary, we ought to abstaine for the Scandall of the malitious, as well as for the Scandall of the weake.

Neverthelesse, the kind of Scandall remaines the same, whether we have to doe with the malitious or the weake.</p>
               <p>They are therefore greatly mistaken, who conclude from <hi>Paul</hi> his not circumcising of <hi>Titus, Gal.</hi> 2. 4. 5. that he cared not for the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall of the malitious.

               <p>Christ his not caring for the Scandall of the Pharisees, is also ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to prove, that if the thing bee lawfull or indifferent, wee are not to care for the offence of the malitious. But <note n="c" place="margin">of the crosse part. 2. p. 57.</note>

And first, they commonly answer us, that the Scandall which followeth upon the Ceremonies, is passive and taken onely, not active and given: which answer I find both impertinent and false. It is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, because put the case the Scandall were onely passive and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, yet the occasion of it should be removed out of the way, when it is not a thing necessary, according to my 8. 11. and 12 Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and if any of our Opposites will denie this, let them blush for shame. <note n="i" place="margin">Mal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> com. ibid.</note> One of our owne Writers upon this same place noteth, that this Scandall which Christ eshewed, had been a Scandall taken onely, because the exactors of the tribute money, ought not to have been ignorant of Christ his immunity and dignity, yet because they were ignorant of the same, lest he should seeme to give a Scandall; <hi>cedere potius sua libertate voluit. Ideo non tantum dicit: ne scandalizentur: sed ne scandalizemus cos, hoc est, ne scandali materiam eis demus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their answeare is also false; 1. There is no scandall taken, but (if <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>III</label> it be knowen to be taken, and the thing at which it is taken be not necessary,) it is also given. The Scandall of the weake in the Apostles times, who were offended with the liberty of eating all sorts of meats, was passive and taken, as <note n="l" place="margin">com. in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Zanchius</hi> observeth, yet was that Scandall given and peccant, upon their part who used their liberty of eating all sorts of meats, &amp; so cared not for the offence of the weake. Think they then that our taking of offence can excuse their giving of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence? Nay, since the things whereby they offend us, are no neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary things, they are greatly to be blamed.</p>
               <p>That the Ceremonies are not necessary in themselves our Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites a knowledge; and that they are not necessary in respect of the Churches determination, I have proven in the first part of my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. Wherefore having no necessity in them, they ought to be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, when scandall is knowen to arise out of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Giving and not graunting, that the Scandall of them who were first offended at the Ceremonies, was only passive, yet the using of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:3270:51"/>
them after Scandall is knowen to rise out of them, must be an active Scandall, because the keeping of a thing which is not necessary, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter scandall riseth out of it, is an active Scandall, though the Scandall which at first rose out of it, had beene only passive, as I shew in my seventh Proposition.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The trueth is, that both first and last, the Scandall of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies is active and given; for an active Scandall is <hi>dictum vel factum vere malum, aut mali speciem habens, quo auctor aliis peccandi occasionem prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet,</hi> say <note n="m" place="margin">Polan. Synt. theol. lib. 6. c. 3. col. 19.</note> our Divines. An active Scandall is ever a sinne in him who offendeth, <hi>quia vel ipsum opus quod facit est peccatum, vel etiam si ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beat speciem peccati, &amp;c.</hi> Say the <note n="n" place="margin">Aquin. 2. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Now to say the least that can be said, the Ceremonies have a very <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>IV</label> great appearance of evill, and so the Scandall which followeth them shall be proven to be active. <note n="p" place="margin">Cent. 1. lib. 2. cap. 4. col. 450.</note> The Divines of <hi>Magdeburge</hi> inferre from 1. <hi>Thess. 5. 22. speciem mali etiam scandala conficere.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But to discover the appearance of evill which is in the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, let us consider with <note n="s" place="margin">comm. in 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Zanchius,</hi> that the appearance of evill, from which the Apostle exhorteth to abstaine, may be expounded two wayes. First, it may be referred to the preceeding words, and so meant of Prophecie and trying the Doctrine of Prophets or Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, for we should be ware in this matter, of all which hath any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of evill, that is, from all things, <hi>quae ab Haereticis in suam sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiam, malamque consequentiam trahi possunt.</hi> For example saith <hi>Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius, Nestorius</hi> said that we are saved by the blood, not of the Sonne of God, but of the sonne of man. Now if any suppressing that negative, should say, we are saved by the blood of the sonne of man, though this might receave a right explication, yet it hath an appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of evill, because from it <hi>Nestorius</hi> might confirme his heresie. Appearance of evill thus expounded, will be found in the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in question. If a Phrase or forme of speaking, from which He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes may draw bad consequences, &amp; confirme their errors, though not truly, yet in shew, be an appearance of evill; then much more are visible Ceremonies and receaved Customes, from which Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes get occasion to confirme their hereticall errors and damnable superstitions, very plaine and undeniable appearances of much evill.</p>
               <p>Now Papists confirme many of their superstitions by the English
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:3270:51"/>
Ceremonies. <note n="t" place="margin">of the crosse cap. 3. sect. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Parker</hi> giveth too many cleare instances, namely, that by the English Crosse, <hi>Martiall</hi> justifyeth the Popish Crosse; And <hi>Saunders,</hi> the Popish Images; That the English Service booke, is dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen by <hi>Parsons</hi> and <hi>Bristowe,</hi> to a countenancing of their Masse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>booke: That <hi>Rainold</hi> draweth privat Baptisme, to a proofe of the necessity which they put in that Sacrament: That the <hi>Rhemists</hi> drawe the Absolution of the sicke, prescribed in the Communion-booke, to an approbation of their Absolution, Auricular Confession, and Sacrament of Pennance. To these Instances I adde, that <note n="u" place="margin">annot. on <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 10.</note> the <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists</hi> confirme their Feast of the assumption of <hi>Mary,</hi> from the other Feasts which the Church of <hi>England</hi> observeth. And so doth, <note n="x" place="margin">confer. with Rain. c. 8. div. 2. pag. 408. 410.</note> I. <hi>Hart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It will be said, that Papists have no ground nor reason to confirme <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>V</label> any of their superstitions by the English Ceremonies. But I answere: 1. If it were so, yet for asmuch, as Papists draw them to a confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of their superstitions, we should abstaine from them as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of evill. Eating (at a privat banquet) of that which was sacrificed to Idols, did confirme ane Idolater and Infidell in his religion, as <note n="y" place="margin">com. in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>Pareus</hi> noteth: yet from this, the Idolater had no reason to confirme himselfe in his Idolatry; but because the Idolater seeing it, might draw it to a confirmation; the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle will have it for that respect foreborne. When the <hi>Arrians</hi> abused Trin immersion in Baptisme, to signify three natures of the three persons, <note n="z" place="margin">lib. 1. epist. 41.</note> Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> and <note n="a" place="margin">Can. 5.</note> the fourth Councell of <hi>Toledo</hi> ordained, that in <hi>Spaine,</hi> thrise washing should no longer be used in Baptisme, but once only. The <hi>Arrians</hi> had no just reason to draw such a signification from the Ceremony of Trin-immersion: yet was it abolished when those Heretikes did so abuse it. If any say, that we are saved by the blood of the sonne of man, the phrase is orthodoxe, because of the communication or rather communion of properties, and the <hi>Nestorians</hi> can not with good reason by it confirme their He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, yet are we to abstaine from this forme of speach, in <hi>Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius</hi> his judgment, when it is drawen to the confirmation of that error.</p>
               <p>I conclude with that which <note n="b" place="margin">ubi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra.</note> 
                  <hi>Parker</hi> alledgeth out of the <hi>Harmony of Confessions. Cum adiaphora rapiuntur ad confessionem, libera esse desinunt.</hi> Marke <hi>rapiuntur.</hi> 2.

               <p>
                  <hi>Zanchius</hi> hath another exposition of the appearance of evill, which doth also agree to the Ceremonies. The appearance of evill which <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>VI</label> maketh Scandall, and from which the Apostle would have us to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine, may be taken generally of all sorts of sinne, &amp; all evill things whatsoever: for so we should abstaine from all that which hath any appearance of evill; <hi>nullam praebentes occasionem proximo nostro aliquid mali de nobis suspicandi.</hi> He instanceth for example, the ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And thus we see, how great appearance of evill, is more then mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest in the Ceremonies, which maketh the Scandall active, if there were no more. But afterwards we shall see the Ceremonies to be evill and unlawfull in themselves, and so to be in the worst kinde of active Scandall.</p>

               <p>I will yet descend more particularly to confute our Opposites their severall answeares and defences, which they have used against <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>IX</label> our Argument of Scandall. And I beginne with our Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; <hi>As for the Godly amongst us</hi> 
                  <note n="q" place="margin">Serm. at Perth. as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semb.</note> saith he, <hi>we are sorry they should be grieved, but it is their owne fault: for if the things be in themselves lawfull, what is it that should offend them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. He does not well expresse Scandall (whereof he is there speaking) by griefe, for I may be grieved, yet not scandalized, and scandalized, yet not grieved, according to my first proposition touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scandall.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To what purpose tells he, it is their owne fault? Thinkes he that there are any offended without their owne fault? <note n="*" place="margin">Non enim solum scandaliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, sed etiam scandalizari peccatum, est, quia in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitatis est <hi>saith</hi> Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donat. upon <hi>Math.</hi> 18. 7.</note> To be offended is ever a fault, as I shew in my 3. and 6. Propositions; so that if a Scandall be not removed, where it is mens owne fault that they are offended, then no Scandall shall ever be removed; because all who are scandalized, commit a fault in being Scandalized. <hi>Nihil potest esse hominicausa sufficiens peccati, quod est spiritualis ruina, nisi propria vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntas, &amp; ideo dicta vel facta alterius hominis possunt esse solum causa imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecta aliqualiter inducens ad ruinam,</hi> saith <note n="r" place="margin">2. 2a. q. 43 art. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Aquinas;</hi> giving a reason why in the definition of Scandall, he saith not, that it giveth cause, but that it giveth occasion of ruine.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Why thinkes he, that if the things be in themselves lawfull, they are purged of Scandall? <note n="s" place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 23.</note> what if they edify not? what if hey be not expedient? are they not therefore scandalous, because in themselves lawfull? this shift is destroyed by my 9. Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And I pray, were not all meats lawfull for the Gentiles in the Apostles times? yet this could not excuse their eating all sorts of meats, when the Iewes were thereby offended.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whereas he demandeth, if the thinges be in themselves lawfull; what is it that should offend them? I demand againe; though adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, murder &amp;c. be in themselves unlawfull, what is it that should offend us? should we offend or be scandalized for any thing? hay, then we should sinne, for to be offended is a sinne.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He had said to better purpose; what is it that may offend them, or doth offend them, that it may be voided? whereunto I answere,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:3270:53"/>
that there is a twofold Scandall which may be and hath beene given by thinges lawfull in themselves, (as I touched in my. 5. Proposition) <hi>Viz.</hi> the giving of occasion to the weake to condemne our lawful deeds, &amp; the animating of them to followe our example against their owne consciences: both wayes we make them to sinne. The Apostle 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 29. where he is speaking of a certaine kind of Idolothyts which are in themselves lawfull, and only evill in the case of Scandall, sheweth, that if the weake in a privat banquet, see the stronge eating such meates as have beene offered to Idolls, notwith standing of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning given, then is the weake one scandalized; because would the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole say, <note n="t" place="margin">Pare us com in il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumlocum.</note> 
                  <hi>velipse etiam edet tuo exemplo, vacillante conscientia, vel tacite factum tuum damnabit.</hi> Behold what Scandall may arise, even out of thinges which are in themselves lawfull, which also ariseth out of the Ceremonies, (let them be as lawfull as can be.) 1. We are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to dissallow of lawfull thinges, and to condemne the doers, as superstitious and popishly affected. 2. We are animated by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Formalists to practise Conformity, which in our conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces we condemne, and by consequence doe sinne, because he that doubteth is damned, and whatsoever is not of faith, is sinne.</p>
               <p>Let us see next how the Bishop of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> can helpe the cause. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>X</label> He will have us not to respect Scandall, because it is removed by the Law. For <note n="u" place="margin">Epist. to the past. of the Church of Scotland</note> saith he, <hi>by obedience to a lawfull ordinance, no man gives Scandall. And if any take offence, both the cause and occasion thereof is the perversnesse only of the person offended. Tertullian saith well, res bona nemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem offendit nisi malam mentem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. I shew in my 9. Proposition, that the ordinance of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours can not make that to be no scandall which otherwise should be Scandall. If this be not taken well from us, let <note n="x" place="margin">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>besse Iren. lib. 2. cap. 20. num. 19.</note> one of our Opposites speake for us; who aknowledgeth, that human power can not make us doe that which we can not doe without giving of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall, and that in this case, the pretext of obedience to Superiours shall not excuse us at the hands of the Supreme judge.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I would learne of him what makes a lawfull ordinance about matters of fact or thinges to be done? Not the will of Superiours; else there shall be no unlawfull ordinances; (for every ordinance hath the will of the ordainer:) Not the lawfullnesse of the thing in it selfe which is ordained neither; for then every ordinance, which prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth a thing lawfull in it selfe, were it never so inexpedient in respect of supervenient circum stances, should be lawfull. To a lawfull or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance then required, not only that the thing ordained be lawfull in it selfe, is also that it be not inexpedient. So that a thing may be lawfull in itselfe, yet not lawfully ordained, because the ordinance commandeth the doing of it, whereas there are many thinges lawfull which ought not to be done, because they are not expedient, 1. Cor. 6. 12.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:3270:54"/>
3. Since it can not be a lawfull ordinance which ordaineth a thing inexpedient, it can not be a lawfull obedience which is yeelded to such an ordinance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If by a lawfull ordinance he meane (as it seems he doth) an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance prescribing, that which is lawfull in it selfe, then his answere is false. What if an ordinance of Superiours, had ordained the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> to eate freely of all meates which were in themselves cleane? Durst the Bishop say, that this ordinance of Superiours had beene of greater waight and superiour reason, then the Law of Charity which is Gods Law? Had no man given scandall by obedience to this ordinance? And would not the Apostle, for all that, have forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den as he did the using of this liberty with the offence of others?</p>
               <p n="5">5. When any man is offended at a thing lawfull prescribed by an ordinance, the cause thereof is indeed in himselfe (yet it is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes his perversnesse, but oftimes weaknesse:) but the occasion of it, is the thing at which he offendeth, which occasion should ever be removed when it is not a thing necessary, as I shew already.</p>
               <p n="6">6. As for that sentence of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> it must admit the exception of a reverend Divine. He signifieth (saith <note n="y" place="margin">comm. in. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Paraeus)</hi> scandall not to be properly committed, save in thinges evill in themselves, or else indifferent: <hi>quanquam interdum circa bonas intempestive factas etiam com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitti possit.</hi>

And first, he will not heare us touching Scandall, except we first a knowledge the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies not to be evill in themselves: otherwise he thinks we debate in vaine about Scandall, since we have a more convenient way to exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minat the Ceremonies by proving them to be evill in themselves, and also because when we are pressed with the weight of Arguments, we will still runne back to this point, that nothing which in it selfe is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, can be done without Scandall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The Argument of Scandall is not vainly or idly debated, for though we prove the Ceremonies to be evill in themselves, yet fitly we argument also from the Scandall of them, because this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth yet more. 1. <hi>ad rem;</hi> For the Scandall of a thing is more then the unlawfullnesse of it: every unlawfull thing is not scandalous, but that only which is done to the knowledge of another. 2. <hi>ad hominem;</hi> For that we may either content or convince our Opposites, we argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>ex ipsorum concessis,</hi> to this purpose; that since they yeeld the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies to be in themselves indifferent, therefore they must a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that they are to be foreborne, because scandall followeth upon them, &amp; they should abstaine from thinges indifferent, in the case of scandall.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas he thinkes we will still turne back to the unlawfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:3270:54"/>
of the Ceremonies in themselves, albeit we may justly make use of this answear, when they goe about to purge the Ceremonies from Scandall by the lawfullnesse of them in themselves, (because the Argument of Scandall doeth not presuppose our concession of the lawfulnesse of the Ceremonies, but theirs;) yet he deceives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in thinking that we can not handle this Argument without it, for were they never so lawfull in themselves, we <note n="a" place="margin">supra sect. 4. 5. 6.</note> evince the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall of them from the appearance of evill which is in them, so that without respecting the unlawfullnesse of the Ceremonies in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, we can and doe make good our Argument of Scandall, so farre as concerneth the Ceremonies considered by themselves.</p>
               <p>But when our Opposites object, that many are scandalized by us who refuse the Ceremonies, we here compare the Scandall of Non-conformity, if there be any such (for though some be displeased at it, I see not how they are scandalized by it,) with the Scandall of Conformity, and shew them that the Scandall of Non-conformity is not to be cared for, because it is necessary, and that by reason of the unlawfullnesse of the Ceremonies. I will make all this plaine by a <hi>simile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Pastor dealing with a Fornicator, layeth before him both his sinne and the Scandall of it too. Now as touching the Scandall, the Fornicator careth not for it, because he is in the opinion that Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is indifferent. Whereupon the Pastor thus proceedeth. If it were indifferent, as you say, yet because Scandall riseth out of it, you should abstaine. And so amongst many Arguments against Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, the Pastor useth this Argument taken from the Scandall of it, both for aggravating the sinne in it selfe, and for convincing the sinner, and this Argument of Scandall, the Pastor can make good against the Fornicator, out of his owne ultroneous and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired concession of the indifferency of Fornication (because things indifferent and in the case of Scandall, and when they are done with the appearance of evill, should be forborne) without ever mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the unlawfulnesse of it. But if in an froward tergiversation, the Fornicator beginne to reply, that he also is scandalized and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to goe on in his Fornication obstinately, by the Pastors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buking him for so light a matter, and that the Pastors reproofe to him hath appearance of evill, as much as his Fornication hath to the Pastor: Albeit here it may be answered, that the Pastors reproofe is not done <hi>inordinatè,</hi> neither hath any appearance of evill, except in the Fornicators perverse interpretation, yet for stopping the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicators mouth as well more forcibly as more quickly, the Pastor rejoyndeth, that if any scandall followe upon his reproofe, it is not to be regarded, because the thing is necessary and that because For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication beeing a great sinne, he may not but reprove it.</p>
               <p>So, albeit our Argument of Scandall holdeth out against the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:3270:55"/>
considered by themselves, without making mention of the unlawfulnesse of them in themselves: albeit also when the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall of Non-conformity (if there bee any such) is compared with the Scandall of Conformity, we say truly, that this hath appearance of evill in its own condition, and that hath none, except in the false interpretation of those who glory in gainsaying.</p>
               <p>Yet for further convincing of our Opposites, &amp; darting through their most subtile subterfuges, with a mortall stroke, we send them away with this finall answer; you should abstaine from the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies when Scandall riseth out of them, because you confesse them to be in themselves indifferent. But we doe avouch and prove them to be unlawfull, wherefore it is necessary for us to abstaine, though all the world should be offended.</p>
               <p>The <note n="b" place="margin">ibid. num. 7.</note> Dr. proceedeth to throw backe the Argument of Scandall upon our own heads, and to charge us with scandalizing both the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>XII</label> Church and common wealth, by our refusing the Ceremonies. But what? should a Doctor be a Dictator? or a Proctor, a Prater? why then doeth he ventilate words for reason? That some are displeased at our Non-conformity, we understand to our great griefe: but that thereby any are scandalized, we understand not, and if we did, yet that which is necessary, such as Non-conformity is, can be taken away by no Scandall.</p>
               <p>But <note n="c" place="margin">Num. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14.</note> the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. goeth forward, denying that there is in the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies so much as any appearance of evill, to make them Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. Where I observe, that he dare not adventure to describe how a thing is said to have appearance of evill, and consequently a scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous condition. The man is cautelous, and perceiveth peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the appearance of evill can be made to appeare no other thing, then that which doeth more then appeare in the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. And this I have heretofore evinced out of <hi>Zanchius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <note n="d" place="margin">Num. 15, 16.</note> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. holdeth him upon kneeling in receiving the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Elements, and denieth that it is scandalous, or any way indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to spirituall ruine. But (if he will) he may consider, that the ruder sort who can not distinguish betwixt worshipping the Bread, and worshipping before the Bread, nor discerne how to make Christ the passive object of that worship, and the Bread the active, and how to worship Christ in the Bread, and make the worship relative from the Bread to Christ; are by his example induced to Bread-worship, when they perceive bowing downe before the consecrated Bread, in the very same forme and fashion, wherein Papists are seen to worship it, but can not conceive the nice distinctions which he and his companions use to purge their kneeling in that act from Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. As for others who have more knowledge, they are also indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ruine, being animated by his example to doe that which their consciences doe condemne.</p>

There occurreth next an objection taken from <hi>Paul</hi> his not taking wages at <hi>Corinth,</hi> (though he might lawfully) for shunning the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence both of the malitious and the weake: In the solution whereof <note n="f" place="margin">Num. 17.</note> the Dr. spendeth some words. The substance of his answer is this: that <hi>Paul</hi> taught it was lawfull to take wages, and that they should not be offended at it, and if we doe as he did, we must teach that the Ceremonies are lawfull in themselves, yet not using our power for the time, lest the weake be offended, or lest the malitious glory: but for all that, not denying our right and liberty, nor suffering a yoke of bondage to be imposed upon us by contumacious men. And besides, that the Apostle was commanded by no Ecclesiasticall decree to take wages from the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> as we are commanded by the decree of <hi>Perth</hi> to receive the five Articles: so that <hi>Paul</hi> might without contempt of Ecclesiasticall Auctority, abstaine from taking of wages, but we can not without contempt of the Church, reject the Articles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This importeth, that if the question were not <hi>de jure,</hi> and if we misliked the Ceremonies, and were offended at them, for some other reason then their unlawfulnesse, for this offence they would abstaine. It may be his reverend Fathers returne him small thankes for this device. For let some men be brought forth, acknowledging the Ceremonies to bee in themselves indifferent, yet offended at them for their inexpediency, whether they be weake or malitious, the Dr. thinkes he should abstaine for their cause.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How knowes he, that they who were offended at <hi>Paul</hi> his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of wages at <hi>Corinth,</hi> thought not his taking of wages there un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, even as we thinke the Ceremonies unlawfull?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Why judgeth he that we are not scandalized through weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but through malice and contumacy? So he giveth it forth both in this place, and <note n="g" place="margin">Iren. lib. 1. cap. 10. §. 2.</note> else where. Who art thou that judgeth another mans servant?</p>
               <p>But 4. If we were malitious in offending at the Ceremonies as things unlawfull, and in urging of Non-conformity as necessary, should they therefore contemne our beeing scandalized? Those that would have <hi>Titus</hi> circumcised, were they not malitious? Did they not urge Circumcision as necessary? Held they it not unlawfull, not to circumcise <hi>Titus?</hi> yet did the Apostle abstaine, because they were to be scandalized, that is, made worse and more wicked calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, by the circumcising of <hi>Titus,</hi> as <note n="h" place="margin">supra cap. 8. sect. 6.</note> I have shewed; so that albeit wee are not to care for the displeasing of men, that malitiously and contumaciously, urge (as necessary) abstaining from that which is lawfull to be done; yet must we care for scandalizing them and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them worse: rather ere that be, we ought to abstaine from the use of our liberty.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If an Ecclesiasticall decree had commanded <hi>Paul</hi> at that time
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:3270:56"/>
to take wages at <hi>Corinth,</hi> the Dr. thinkes hee had contemned Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall Auctority in not taking wages, though some should be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at his taking wages. What? could an Ecclesiasticall decree command <hi>Paul</hi> to take wages in the case of Scandall? or could hee have obeyed such a decree in the case of Scandall? We have seen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that no humane Auctority, can make that no Scandall, which otherwise were Scandall: so that <hi>Paul</hi> had not contemned Ecclesias<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Auctority, by not obeying their command, in this case of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall which had followed by his obeying: for he had not been bound to obey, nay hee had been bound not to obey in such a case, yea further, albeit Scandall had not been to follow by his taking wages, yet he had no more contemned the Church by not obeying a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to take wages, then he had done by living unmarried, if the Church had commanded him to marry. The bare Auctority of the Church could neither restraine his liberty nor ours in things in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, when there is no more to binde but the Auctority of an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Why holds he us contemners of the Church, for not receiving the five Articles of <hi>Perth?</hi> we can not be called contemners for not obeying, but for not subjecting our selves, wherewith we can not be charged. Could he not distinguish betwixt subjection and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience? Art thou a Doctor in Israell, and knowest not these things? Nay, art thou a Conformist, and knowest not what thy <note n="i" place="margin">Field of the Church lib. 4. cap. 34. &amp; Bils. apud Parker of the Crosse part. 2. pag. 33.</note> fellow Conformists doe hold?</p>
               <p>One point more resteth, at which <note n="k" place="margin">ibid. l. 2. cap. 20. num. 14.</note> the Dr. holdeth him in this Argument, namely, that for the offence of the weake, necessary <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>XIII</label> things are not to be omitted, such as is obedience to Superiours, but their mindes are to be better informed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Obedience to Superiours can not purge that from Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall which otherwise were Scandall, as <note n="l" place="margin">supra cap. 8. sect. 5. &amp; cap. 9. sect, 10.</note> we have seen before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That information and giving of a reason, can not excuse the doing of that out of which Scandall riseth, <note n="m" place="margin">ibid. sect. 7.</note> we have also proven already.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the Ordinance of Superiours can not make the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies necessary, I have proven in the first part of this Dispute. This <note n="n" place="margin">Morney mister. of iniq. in the conclus.</note> is given for one of the chiefe markes of the man of sinne, <hi>That which is indifferent, he by his lawes and prohibitions maketh to be sinne,</hi> and shall they who professe to take part with Christ against Antichrist, doe no lesse then this? It will be replyed, that the Ceremonies are not thought necessary in themselves, nor Non-conformity, unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in it selfe, but onely in respect of the Churches ordinance.

the Churches Customes and Commandements. How comes it then, that they are not ashamed to pretend such a necessity for the stumbling blockes of those offending Ceremonies among us, as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists pretend for the like among them?</p>
               <p>But the English Formalists have here somewhat to say, which we will heare. <note n="p" place="margin">Eccl. Pol. lib. 4. 11. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Hooker</hi> tell us, that Ceremonies are scandalous <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>XIV</label> either in their very nature, or else through the agreement of men to rise them unto evill; and that Ceremonies of this kind, are either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised at first unto evill, or else having had a profitable use, they are afterwards interpreted and wrested to the contrary. As for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Ceremonies, he saith, that they are neither scandalous in their owne nature; nor because they were devised unto evill; nor yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they of the Church of <hi>England</hi> abuse them unto evill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Though all this were true, yet forasmuch as they have been abused by the Papists unto Idolatry and superstition, and are monuments of Popery, the trophees of Antichrist, and the reliques of <hi>Romes</hi> whoorish bravery: they must be graunted, at least for this respect, to be more then manifest appearances of evill, and so scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous.</p>
               <p>But 2. It is falle which he saith, for kneeling in receiving the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, is in its owne nature evill and Idolatrous, because reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Adoration, before a mere creature, which purposly wee set before us in the act of adoring, to have state in the worship, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it be an actuall Image in that act representing Christ to us, (such as the Bread in the act of receiving,) draweth us within the compasse of coadoration or relative worship, as shall be copiously proven afterwards.</p>
               <p>Other of the Ceremonies that are not evill in their owne nature, yet were devised to evill, for example, the Surplice. The <note n="q" place="margin">cap. 1. sect. 3.</note> replier to <hi>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Mourtons</hi> Particular defence, observeth, that this superstition about apparell in Divine worship, beganne first among the Frensh Bishops, unto whom <hi>Caelestinus</hi> writeth thus. <hi>Discernendi, &amp;c. We are to be distinguished from the common people and others, by Doctrine, not by Garment, by Conversation, not by Habite, by the Purity of minde, not by At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire: for if wee study to innovation, we tread underfoot the order which hath been delivered unto us by our Fathers, to make place to idle superstitions; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought not leade the mindes of the Faithfull into such things: for they are rather to be instructed then played withall: neither are we to blinde and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile their eyes, but to infuse instructions into their mindes.</hi> In which words <hi>Caelestinus</hi> reprehends this apparell, as a novelty which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>nded to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition, and made way to the mocking and deceiving of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:3270:57"/>
Lastly, whereas he saith, the Ceremonies are not abused by them in <hi>England</hi> I instance the contrary in Holy-dayes. <note n="r" place="margin">expos. of the creed art. of Christs birth.</note> 
                  <hi>Perkins</hi> saith, that the Feast of Christs Nativity, so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly called, is not spent in praising the name of God, but in riffling, dycing, carding, masking, mumming, and in all licentious liberty, for the most part, as though it were some Heathen Feast of <hi>Ceres</hi> or <hi>Bacchu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>.</hi> And <note n="s" place="margin">com. on <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 10.</note> elsewhere he complaineth of the great abuse of Holy-dayes among them.</p>
               <p>As touching the rule which is alledged against the Ceremonies out of <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine, namely, that in those things from which <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>XV</label> we may lawfully abstaine, we should frame the usage of our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with regard to the weaknesse of our bretheren. <hi>Hooker</hi> answea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to it. 1. That the weake bretheren among them, were not as the Iewes, who were knowne to be generally weake, whereas saith he, the imbecillity of ours is not common to so many, but onely here and there some such a one is found. 2. He tels us, that these scandalous meats, from which the Gentiles were exhorted to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine for feare of offending the Iewes, can not represent the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies; for their using of meats, was a matter of private action in common life, where every man was free to order that which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe did; but the Ceremonies are publike constitutions for orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Church, and wee are not to looke that the Church is to change her publike lawes and ordinances, made according to that which is judged ordinarily and commonly fittest for the whole, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it chaunce that for some particular men, the same be found inconvenient, especially when there may be other remedies also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the sores of particular inconveniences. Let them bee better instructed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This is bad divinity, that would make us not regard the scandalizing of a few particular men; Christs <note n="t" place="margin">Math. 18, 6.</note> woe stricketh not onely upon them who offend many, but even upon them who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend so much as one of his litls ones.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That which he saith of the few in <hi>England,</hi> and not many, who are scandalized by the Ceremonies, hath been answered by a <note n="u" place="margin">Parker of the crosse cap. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>. sect. 10.</note> Countryman of his owne. And as for us, we find most certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that not a few but many, even the greatest part of <hi>Scotland</hi> one way or other are scandalized by the Ceremonies: some are ledde by them to drinke in superstition, and to fall into sundry grosse abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in Religion; others are made to use them doubtingly and so dammably. And how many who refuse them, are animated to use them against their consciences, and so to bee damned? who is not made to stumble? and what way doe they not impede the Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church?</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:3270:57"/>
3. What if there had been a publike constitution, commanding the Gentiles to eat all meates freely, and that this had been judged ordinarily and commonly fittest for the whole, even to signifie the liberty of the Church of the New Testament? should not the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles notwithstanding of this constitution, have abstained because of the Scandall of the Iewes? How comes it then that that which the Apostle writeth against the Scandall of meates, &amp; the reasons which he giveth, are found to hold ever good, whether there be a consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution or not?</p>
               <p n="4">4. As for his remedy against the Scandall of particular men, which is to instruct them better, it hath beene answeared <note n="x" place="margin">sect, 7.</note> before.</p>
               <p>Now if I reck on <hi>Paybody</hi> to be no body, perhaps some body will <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>XVI:</label> not take it well. I will therefore examine how he handleth this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. Four things are answered <note n="y" place="margin">Apol. part. 3. cap. 5.</note> by him to those places, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. and 15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. and 10. <hi>Muth.</hi> 18. 6. which are alledged against the use of things indifferent, when wee can not use them without Scandall.</p>
               <p>First, he saith, that all those Scriptures which are quotted as condemning the scandalizing of others in things indifferent, speake onely of scandalizing them who are weake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. be it so: thought he that they are all malitious, and none weake, who are offended by the Ceremonies? He himselfe descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth the weak whom we are forbidden to scandalize, to be such as are weake in knowledge and certainty of the truth. Now there are many who are in this respect weake, scandalized by the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. But I say moreover, that his description is imperfect, for there are some who know the truth, and that certainly, who are notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing to be accounted weak, in regard of the defect of that pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which should guide, &amp; that stability which should accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny all their actions, in the particular usage of such things as they knowe certainely in their generall kinde to bee agreeable to trueth and righteousnesse. Such Christians are impeded by the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies from going on in their Christian course, so fast as otherwise they would, if not also made to waver or stumble. And thus are they properly scandalized according to my fifth Proposition. <hi>Si quis nostra culpa vel impingit, vel abducitur a recto curs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>, vel tardatur, cum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimur offendere</hi> saith <note n="z" place="margin">com. in <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Calvine. Porro scandalum est dictum vel factum quo impeditur Evangelij cursus, cujus ampliationem &amp; propagationem, totius vitae nostrae scopum esse oportet</hi> saith <note n="a" place="margin">

                  <hi>Martyr.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a fault to give offence even to the strong, or else <note n="b" place="margin">Math. 16. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> was not to be blamed for giving offence to Christ. Yea it is a fault
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:3270:58"/>
to offend the very malitious by-things that are not necessary, as I have proven in my 12 Proposition.</p>
               <p>Secondly saith he, all those Scriptures condemne onely the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall of the weake, which is made at that time, when we know they <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>XVII</label> will be scandalized.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. If he speake of certaine and infallible knowledge, none but God knoweth whether a man shall be scandalized or not, by that which we are to doe: He must meane therefore of such knowledge as we can have of the event of our actions: and so his answere brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth great damnage to his owne cause. Formalists knowe, that their weake bretheren have been of a long time scandalized by the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and they heare them professing that they are yet scandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and how then can they but knowe that Scandall will still follow upon that which they doe?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Albeit they know not that their bretheren will be scandalized by the Ceremonies, yea albeit their bretheren should not be scandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed thereby, yet because the Ceremonies are appearances of evill; inductive to sinne; and occasions of ruine; Scandall is given by them, whether it be taken by their bretheren or not, according to my 4 and 5 Propositions.</p>
               <p>Thirdly saith <hi>Paybody,</hi> all those Scriptures condemne onely that <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>XVIII</label> offence of another in things indifferent, which is made by him who is at liberty and not bound: they speake not of using or refusing those things, as men are tied by the commandement of Auctority. Where he laboureth to prove, that obedience to the Magistrate in a thing indifferent, is a better duty then the pleasing of a private person in such a thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. I have proven heretofore, that the commandement of Auctority, can not make the use of a thing indifferent to bee no Scandall, which otherwise were Scandall.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I have also proven in the first part of this Dispute, that an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall constitution can not bind us nor take away our liberty in the using or not using of a thing indifferent in it selfe, except some other reason bee shewed us then the bare Auctority of the Church. As touching the civill Magistrate, his place and power, to judge and determine in things pertaining to the worship of God, we shall see it afterwards, and so shall we knowe how farre his decisions and ordinances in this kinde of things, have force to binde us to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He should have proven, that obedience to the Magistrate in a thing indifferent, is a better duty then abstaining from that which
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:3270:58"/>
scandalizeth many Christians: he should not have opposed pleasing and scandalizing (for perhaps a man is most scandalized when he is most pleased;) but edifying and scandalizing, according to my first Proposition. Now will any body, except <hi>Paybody,</hi> say, that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Magistrate in a thing indifferent, out of which Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall riseth, is a better duty then forbearing for the edification of many Christian soules, and for shunning to scandalize them. This wee must take to bee his meaning, or else he saith nothing to the purpose.</p>
               <p>His fourth answere is, that all those Scriptures condemning scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>XIX</label> must needs especially condemne that which is greatest. <hi>Peter</hi> and his companions comming to <hi>Antioch,</hi> were in danger of a double scandall; either of the Iewes by eating with the Gentiles, which was the lesse, or of the Gentiles in refuising their company, as if they had not beene bretheren, which was farre the greater: Now <hi>Paul</hi> bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Peter</hi> very much, that for the avoiding the lesser scandall he &amp; and his companions fell into the greater.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. He is greatly mistaken, whiles he thinkes that a man can be so straited betwixt two scandalls, that he can not choose but give the one of them; <note n="c" place="margin">Ames. lib. 5. de consc. c. 11.</note> For <hi>Nulla datur talis perplexitas, ut necessarium sit pio homini sive hoc sive illud faciat, scandalum alicui dare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That sentence of choosing the least of two evills, must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of evills of punishment, not of evills of sinne, as I shew <note n="d" place="margin">supr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> cap. 1.</note> before, so that he is in a foule error, whiles he would have us to choose the least of two scandalls.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As for the example which he alledgeth, he deceiveth himselfe to thinke that <hi>Peter</hi> had given scandall to the Iewes, by his eating with the Gentiles. <hi>Cum Gentibus cibum capiens, recte utebatur libertate Christiana,</hi> say <note n="e" place="margin">cent. 1. lib. 2. c. 10. col. 560.</note> the <hi>Magdeburgians:</hi> but when certaine Iewes came from <hi>Iames</hi> he withdrew himselfe, fearing the Iewes, and so <hi>quod ante de libertate Christiana edificarat, rursus destruebat:</hi> By eating then with the Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les he gave no scandall, but by the contrary he did edify. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I say, that his eating with the Gentiles was a thing necessary, and that for shunning of two great scandalls; the one, of the Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, by compelling them to judaize; the other, of the Iewes, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming them in judaisme, both vvhich followed upon his withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vving from the Gentiles; so that by his eating vvith the Gentiles no scandall could be given, and if any had beene taken, it was not to be carred for. Wherefore there was but one scandall, which <hi>Peter</hi> and his companions were in danger of, which also they did give, &amp; for which <hi>Paul</hi> reprehended them, namely, their withdrawing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the Gentiles, &amp; keeping company only with the Iewes;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:3270:59"/>
whereby both the Iewes and the Gentiles were scandalized, because both were made to think, (at least occasion was given to both for thinking) the observation of the Ceremoniall law necessary. That which deceiveth <hi>Paybody,</hi> is the confounding of <hi>scandalizing</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spleasing. Peter</hi> by eating with the Gentiles perhapes had displeased the Iewes, but he had thereby edifyed them though: The scandall which he gave them was by judaizing; <hi>Iudaizabat olim Petrus per dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulationem</hi> saith <note n="f" place="margin">de ause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib. pap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>Paraeus</hi> noteth. How then can it be said, that he had scandalized them by his eating with the Gentiles: for here upon it should followe that there was a necessity of doing evill laid upon <hi>Peter,</hi> so that he behooved to offend the Iewes, either by his eating with the Gentiles, or by his not eating with the Gentiles, for he could not both eat with them and not eat with them. This is therefore plaine, that if he scandalized the Iewes by his not eating with the Gentiles, as I have shewed, then had he not scandalized them, but edifyed them by his eating with the Gentiles.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I perceive he would say, that the scandall of Non-conformity is a greater scandall, then the scandall of Conformity; and so he would make us gaine litle by our Argument of scandall. <note n="h" place="margin">ubi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra. p. 441.</note> He is bold to object, <hi>where one is offended with our practise of kneeling, twentie; I may say ten thousand are offended with your refusall.</hi> O Adventurous A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetique!

               <p>Yet I reply, 1. Though sundry (yet not ten thousand for one) are displeased by our refusall, who can shew us, that any are thereby scandalized, that is, made worse, and induced to ruine? This man is bold to say well to it; but we have solidly proven, that scandall ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth out of kneeling, and the rest of the Ceremonies, let it be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured to us, with the same measure wherewith we mette.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Put the case that ten thousand were scandalized by our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusall, will it thereupon follow, that our refusall is a greater scandall then their practising? Nay then, let it be said that the Crosse of Christ is a greater scandall, then a privat mans Fornication, because both <note n="i" place="margin">1.

Doe they not aknovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the indifferency of the thinges themselves? Doe they not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit many of their people either to kneel, or to sit at the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion? Have not many of themselves taken the Communion sitting in some places? Have not our Conformists in <hi>Scotland</hi> hitherto com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly omitted Bishopping of Children, and the ministration of the Sacraments in private places? As for our selves, we make our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning plaine, when we object the scandall of Conformity, for many ignorant and superstitious persons are by the Ceremonies confirmed <hi>(expertus loquor)</hi> in their error and superstition: so that now they even settle themselves upon the old dregges of Popish superstition &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, from which they were not well purged.

               <p>My first argument against the lawfulnesse of the Ceremonies, I drawe from the superstition of them. I cannot marvell enough how <hi>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

Burges</hi> could thinke to rub the superstition vpon non-conformists, whom they set forth as fancying their abstinence from the Ceremonies to be a singular peece of service done to God, placing Religion in the not vsing of them, &amp; teaching men to abstaine from them for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science sake. <note n="a" place="margin">Fresh sute ag.

We abstaine from the Ceremonies even as from lying, cursing, stealing, &amp;c. Shall we be houlden superstitious for abstaining from things vnlawfull? The superstition therefore is not on our side, but on theirs.</p>
               <p>For first, superstition is the opposite vice to Religion, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse <label type="milestone">

               <p>First, I require the <hi>B.</hi> to shew us a difference betwixt the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>10</label> of holy dayes by formalists, &amp; their keeping of the Lords day: for upon holy dayes they injoyne a cessation from worke, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating of the day to Divine worship, even as upon the Lords day. The <note n="k" place="margin">ubi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra pag. 21.</note> Bishop alledgeth five respects of difference, but they are not true. First, he saith, that the Lords day is commanded to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of necessity, for conscience of the Divine ordinance, as a day sanctified and blessed by God himselfe. <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. so have we heard from <hi>Hooker,</hi> that holy dayes are sanctified by Gods extraordinary workes, but because the B<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dare not say so much, therefore I say. 2. This difference can not shew us, that they observe holy dayes onely for order and policy, and that they place no worship in the observing of them, as in the observing of the Lords day, (which is the point that we require) for worship is placed in the observing of humane, as well as of Divine ordinances; otherwise worship hath never bene placed in the keeping of Pharisaicall and Popish tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This way is worship placed in the keeping of holy dayes, when for conscience of an humane ordinance, they are both kept as holy, and thought necessary to be so kept. 3. The B. contradicteth himselfe, for <note n="l" place="margin">Ep. to the Past. of the Church of Scotl.</note> elswhere he defendeth, that the Church hath power to change the Lords day. Secondly, he giveth us this difference, that the Lords day is observed, as the Sabbath of Iehovah, and as a day whereon God himselfe did rest after the creation. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This is false of the Lords day, for after the creation, God rested vpon the seventh day, not upon the first. 2. <hi>Dr Douname</hi> saith <note n="m" place="margin">on praec. 5.</note>, that festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall dayes also are to be consecrated as Sabbaths to the Lord. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the B. tells us, that the Lords day is observed in memory of the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:3270:65"/>
Lords Resurrection. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. He shall never make this good, for, we observe the Lords day in memory of the whole worke of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. 2. If it were so, this could make no difference, for just so Christmasse is observed in memory of the Lords Nativity, Good-friday, in memory of his Passion, &amp;c. His fourth &amp; fifth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects of difference, are certaine misteries in the Lords day, But we shall see by and by, how his fellow Formalists who are more inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous then himselfe, shew us misteries in the Festivall dayes also. Lastly, albeit the B. have told us that there is no worship appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto the Festivall dayes, which may not be performed at any other time, yet this can not with him make a difference betwixt them and the Lords day: for in his Epistle which I have quotted, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth his judgment to be the same of the Lords day, and teacheth us, that the worship performed on it, is not so appropriated to that time, but lawfully the same may be performed at any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient time, as the Church shall thinke fit. Now as the worship performed on the Lords day, is appropriated (in his judgment) to that time, so long as the Church altereth it not, and no longer, just as much thinks he, of the appropriating to Festivall dayes, the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship performed on the same.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the holy dayes be observed by Formalists only for order and <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>11</label> policy, then they must say the Church hath power to change them. But this power they take from the Church, by saying that they are dedicated and consecrated to those holy uses, to which they are applied. <hi>Semel Deo dicatum non est ad usus humanos ulterius transferendum,</hi> saith one of the <note n="n" place="margin">Bonifac. 8. de reg. ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris. reg. 51.</note> Popes. And by the dedication of Churches, the founders surrender that right, which otherwise they might have in them, saith one of the <note n="o" place="margin">Hook. eccl. pol lib. 5. s. 12.</note> Formalists themselves. If then the Church hath dedicated holy dayes to the worship of God, then hath shee denuded her self of all power to change them, or put them to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther use: which were otherwise, if holy dayes were appointed to be kept, onely for order and policy. Yea further, times and places which are applied to the worship of God, as circumstances onely for outward order and policy, may be by a private Christian applied to an civill use, for in so doing he breaketh not the ordinance of the Church: for example, Materiall Churches are appointed to be the receptacles of Christian assemblies, and that only for such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon commodity and decency, which hath place as well in civill as in holy meetings, and not for any holinesse conceived, to be in them, more then in other houses. Now if I be standing in a Church-yard when it raineth, may not I go into the Church that I may be defended from the injury of the weather? If I must meet w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

then, may serve for a civill use, the same way that it serveth to a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly use. And so for times appointed for ordinary preaching upon weeke dayes in great townes, may not I apply those times to a civill use, when I can not conveniently apply them to the vse for which the Church appointeth them? I trust our Prelates shall say, I may, because they use to be otherwise employed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Divine worship, during the times of weekly preaching. Now if holy dayes were commanded to be kept only for order and policy, they might be applied to another use, as wel as those ordinary times of weekly meetings in great townes: whereas we are required of necessity to keep them holy.</p>

As touching those demands which tie him as so many gordian knots, because he can not vnloose them, he goeth about to break them, <note n="c" place="margin">ubi supra pag. 23.</note> telling us, that they order these things so for vnity with the Catholike Church. This is even as some na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Philosophers, who take upon them to give a reason and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3270:67"/>
cause for all things in nature, when they can finde no other, they flee to <hi>Sympathia Phisica.</hi> When it is asked, wherefore the loadstone doth attract yron rather then other mettall? they answere, that the cause thereof is <hi>sympathia phisica inter magnetem, &amp; ferrum.</hi> With such kind of etimology doth the B. here serve us, yet peradventure hee might have given us another cause. If so, my retractation is, that if he be excused one way, hee must be accused an other way, and if he be blamelesse of Ignorance, he is blameworthy for dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The true causes why those things are so ordered, we may find in <hi>B. Andrews</hi> his Sermons, which I have made use of in handling this argument. For example, <note n="d" place="margin">Serm. on <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 39. 40.</note> the reason why there is but one day betwixt the Passion and the Resurrection, is, because that <hi>Ionas</hi> was but one day in the Whales belly, and Christ but one day in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some of the earth, for in their going thither, he sets out Good-fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day: in their being there Easter-eve: in their comming thence Easter day. As for the 50 dayes betwixt Easter and Pentecost, <note n="e" place="margin">Serm. on <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 18. 19.</note> he saith, <hi>fiftie is the number of the Iubilee; which number agreeth well with this feast, the Feast of Pentecost. VVhat the one in yeares, the other in dayes. So that this is the Iubilee as it were of the yeare, or the yearly memory of the yeare of Iubilee: that, the Pentecost of yeares: this, the Iubilee of dayes.</hi> In the end of the same Sermon he tells us the reason, why there are ten dayes appoynted betwixt the Ascension, and Pentecost. <hi>The feast of Iubilee</hi> saith he, <hi>beganne ever after the high Priest had offered his Sacrifice, and had beene in the Sancta Sanctorum, as this Iubilee of Christ also tooke place from his entering into the holy places, made without hands, after his propitiatory sacrifice, offered up for the quick and the dead, and for all yet unborne, at Easter. And it was the tenth day, that: and this now is the tenth day since.</hi> He hath told us also <note n="f" place="margin">Serm. on <hi>Math.</hi> 6. 16.</note>. why there is not a certaine day of the moneth appointed for Easter, as there is for the Nativity, namely, because the fast of Lent must end with that high feast, according to the Prophecy of <hi>Zachary.</hi> Wherefore I conclude, <hi>aliquid misterii alunt,</hi> and so <hi>aliquid monstri</hi> too.</p>

The Argument in hand I frame thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All things and rites, which have beene notriously abused to idolatry, if they be not such, as either God or nature hath made to be of a necessary use, should be utterly abolished and purged away from Divine worship, in such sort that they may not be accounted nor used by us, as sacred things, or rites pertaining to the same.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Crosse, Surplice, kneeling in the act of receiving the Commuion, &amp;c. are things and rites, &amp;c. and are not such as either God or nature, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo, they should be utterlie abolished, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the proposition I shall first explaine it, and then prove it; I say, <hi>all things and rites,</hi> for they are alike forbidden as I shall shew. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> I say, <hi>which have beene notoriously abused to idolatry,</hi> because if the abuse be not knowne we are blamelesse for retaining the things and rites which have beene abused. I say, <hi>if they be not such as either God or nature hath made to be of a necessary use,</hi> because if they be of a necessary use, either through Gods institution, as the Sacraments, or through na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures law, as the opening of our mouths to speake (for when I am to preach or pray publikly, nature makes it necessary, that I open my mouth to speake audibly and articularly,) then the abuse can not take away the use. I say, <hi>they may not be used by us, as sacred things and rites pertaining to Divine worship,</hi> because without the compasse of worship, they may be used to a naturall or civill purpose. If I could get no other meat to eate, then the consecrated hoste which Papists Idolatrize in the circumgestation of it, I might lawfully eat
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3270:68"/>
it, and if I could get no other cloaths to put on, then the holy gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments wherein a Priest hath said Masse, I might lawfully weare them. Things abused to Idolatry, are only then unlawfull, when they are used no otherwise then religiously, and as things sacred.</p>
               <p>The proposition thus explained, is confirmed by these five proofes, 1. Gods owne praecept, <hi>Isa. 30. 22. Ye shall defile also the</hi>

The grauen images of their Gods shall ye burne with fire: thou shalt not desire the silver and gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therein: for it is an abomination to the Lord thy God.</hi> Reade to the same purpose <hi>Numb. 33. 52. Deut.</hi> 7. 5. and 12. 2. 3. Secondly, God hath not only by his praecepts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to abolish all the reliques of Idolatrie, but by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises also manifested unto us, how acceptable service this should be to him.

                  <hi>Iunius, subjicitur sua promissio,</hi> namely, that the Lord wold give them the promised land, and they should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possesse the inhabitants thereof, <hi>Vers.</hi> 53. yea there is a promise of remission and reconciliation to this worke. <hi>Isa. 27. 9. By this shall the iniquity of Iacob be purged, and this is all the fruit to take away his sinne: when he maketh all the stones of the Altar as chalke stones, that are beaten asunder, the groves and images shall not stand up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Churches of <hi>Pergamos</hi> and <hi>Theatyra</hi> are reproved for suffering the use of Idolothyts, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 2. 14. 20. Where the eating <label type="milestone">

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3270:69"/>
with Divells. Now Idolatry and fellowship with divells, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose are unlawfull, though no scandall should followe upon them. And whereas he thinkes meates sacrificed to Idolls, to be lawfull enough out of the case of scandall, for this reason, because they are the good Creatures of God, he should have considered better the Apostles mind concerning such Idolothyts. Which <note n="o" place="margin">In praec. 2. p. 534.</note> 
                  <hi>Zanchius</hi> setteth downe thus, <hi>Verum est, per so haec nihil sunt, sed respectu eorum quibus immolantur aliquid sunt: quia per haec, illis quibus immolantur, nos consocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur.

Of the one, the Apostle speakes from the 14 <hi>Verse</hi> of that Chapter, to the 23. Of the other, from the 23. <hi>verse</hi> to the end; This is <hi>Beza</hi> his distinction in his Annotations on that Chapter. Of the first sort, he delivers the Apostles minde thus; that as Christians have their holy banquets, which are badges of their communion both with Christ and among themselves, and as the Israëlites by their sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices did seale their copulation in the same religion, so also Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters <hi>cum suis idolis aut potius daemonibus, solemnibus illis epulis copulantur.</hi> So that this sort of <note n="p" place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 10.</note> Idolothyts were eaten in Temples, and publike solemne banquets, which were dedicated to the honour of idolls. <note n="q" place="margin">annot. on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Cartwright</hi> sheweth, that the Apostle is comparing the Table of the Lord, with the Table of Idolaters: whereupon it followeth, that as wee use the Lords Table religiously, so that Table of Idolaters of which the Apostle speaketh, had state in the idolatrous worship, like that feast <hi>Num. 25. 3. quod in honorem falsorum Deorum celebrabatur,</hi> saith <note n="r" place="margin">com. in illum locum.</note> 
                  <hi>Calvine.</hi> This first sort of Idolathyts, <note n="s" place="margin">anal. in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Pareus</hi> calls the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of Idolls, and from such he saith, the Apostle dissuadeth by this argument, <hi>Participare e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Corinthians moved a question, whether they might lawfully eat things sacrificed to Idolls? <hi>In privatis conviviis,</hi> saith <note n="t" place="margin">ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>Pareus.</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle resolves them that <hi>domi in privato convictu</hi> they might eate them, except it were in the case of scandall, thus <note n="u" place="margin">annot. ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>Beza.</hi> The first sort of Idolothyts are meant of <hi>Apoc.</hi> 2. as <hi>Beza</hi> there noteth, and of this sort must we understand <note n="x" place="margin">de bono conjugali, cap. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Augustine</hi> to meane, whiles he saith, that it were better <hi>mori fame, quam Idolothytis vesci.</hi> These sortes are simply &amp; in themselves unlawfull. And if meates sacrificed to Idols be so unlawfull, then much more such things and rites as have not only beene sacrificed and destinated to the honour of Idolls, (for this is but one kinde of Idolatrous abuse,) but also of a long time, publikly and solemnely employed in the worshipping of Idolls, and deeply defiled with Idolatry, much more I say, are they unlawfull to be applied to Gods most pure and holy worship, and therein used by us publikely and solemnely, so that the world may see us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming, and joyning our selves unto Idolaters.</p>

                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:3270:69"/>
Fourthly, I fortify my proposition by approven examples: and first, we find that <hi>Iacob, Genes.</hi> 35. 4. did not only abolish out of his <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> house, the Idolls, but their eare-rings also, because they were <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitionis insignia,</hi> as <hi>Calvine; res ad idololatriam pertinentes,</hi> as <hi>Iunius; monilia idolis consecrata,</hi> as <hi>Pareus</hi> calleth them; all writting upon that place. We have also the example of <hi>Elijah, 1. Kings</hi> 18. 30. he would by no meanes offer upon <hi>Baals</hi> Altar, but would needs repaire the Lords Altar, though this should hold the people the longer in exspecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This he did in P. <hi>Martyrs</hi> Iudgment, because he thought it a great indignity, to offer sacrifice to the Lord, upon the Altar of <hi>Baal.</hi> Whereupon, <note n="y" place="margin">comm. in illum locum</note> 
                  <hi>Martyr</hi> reprehendeth those who in admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string the true Supper of the Lord, <hi>uti velint Papisticis vestibus &amp; instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis.</hi> Further we have the example of <hi>Iehu,</hi> who is commanded for the destroying of <hi>Baal</hi> out of Israëll, with his image, his house, and his very vestments. Read, 2. <hi>Kings,</hi> 10. from the 22. <hi>Verse</hi> to the 28. And what example more considerable, then that of <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi> who not only abolished such monuments of Idolatry, as at their first institution were but mens inventions, but brake downe also the Brazen serpent (though originally set up at Gods owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,) when once he saw it abused to Idolatry? 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 4. This deed of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> Pope <note n="z" place="margin">apud wolphium com. in 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 18. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Steven</hi> doth greatly praise, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth that it is set before us for our imitation, that when our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors have wrought some things, which might have beene with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fault in their time, and afterward they are converted into error and superstition, they may be quickly destroyed by us who come after them. <note n="a" place="margin">Io.

                  <hi>Farellus</hi> saith, that Princes &amp; Magistrates should learne by this example of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> what they should doe with those significant rites of mens devising which have turned to superstition. Yea, the <note n="b" place="margin">serm. on <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 10</note> B. of <hi>Wincester</hi> aknowledgeth, that whatsoever is taken up at the injunction of men, when it is drawne to superstition, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth under the compasse of the Brazen serpent, and is to be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished. And he excepteth nothing from this example, but only things of Gods owne prescribing, Moreover, we have the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of good <hi>Iosiah, 2 Kings</hi> 23. for he did not only destroy the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and the high-places of <hi>Baal, vers.</hi> 19. but his vessels also, <hi>vers.</hi> 4. and his grove, <hi>vers</hi> 6. 14. and his Altars, <hi>vers.</hi> 12. yea the horses and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets, which had beene given to the Sun, <hi>vers.</hi> 11.

Lastly, we have the example of <hi>Daniel,</hi> who would not defile himself with the portion of the Kings meate, <hi>Dan.</hi> 1. 8, because saith <note n="c" place="margin">com. in locum illum</note> 
                  <hi>Iunius,</hi> it was converted in <hi>usum idolola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricum,</hi> for at the banquets of the <hi>Babylonians</hi> and other Gentiles, <hi>erant

               <p>Fiftly, our proposition is backed with a twofold reason, for things which have beene notoriously abused to Idolatry, should be <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> abolished, 1. <hi>quia monent, 2. quia movent:</hi> first then, they are moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, &amp; preserve the memory of Idolls, <hi>monumentum</hi> in good things, is both <hi>monimentum</hi> &amp; <hi>munimentum,</hi> but <hi>monumentum</hi> in evill things, (such as Idolatry,) is only <hi>monimentum,</hi> which <hi>monet mentem</hi> to remember upon such things as ought not to be once named amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g Saincts, but should lye buried in the eternall darknesse of silent oblivion.

                  <hi>Wolphius</hi> rightly saith,) are to be quite defaced and destroyed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they serve to honour the memory of cursed Idolls. God <note n="f" place="margin">Exod. 23. 13. Deut. 12. 3.

Reade we not that the Lord, who knewe what was in man, &amp; saw how propense he was to Idolatry, did not only remove out of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples way, all such things as might any way allure or induce them to Idolatry, (even to the cutting of the names of the Idolls out of the land, <hi>Zecbar.</hi> 13. 2.) but also hedge up their way with thornes, that they might not find their paths, nor overtake their Idol-Gods, when they should seeke after them, <hi>Hos.</hi> 2. 6. 7? And shall we by the very contrary course, not only not hedge up the way of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry with thornes, which may stop and stay such as have an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation aiming forward, but also lay before them, the inciting and entising occasions, which adde to their owne propension, such delectation as spurreth forward with a swift facility?</p>
               <p>Thus having both explained and confirmed the proposition <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> of our present argument, I will make me next for the confutation of the answeres, which our opposites devise to elude it. And first, they tell us, that it is needlesse to abolish utterly, things and Rites which the Papists have abused to Idolatry and superstition, and that it is enough to purge them from the abuse; and to restore them again to their right use. Hence <note n="b" place="margin">N fratri &amp; amico art. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Saravia</hi> will not have <hi>pium crucis usum</hi> to be abolished <hi>cum abusu,</hi> but holds it enough that the abuse and superstition be taken away. <note n="c" place="margin">Iren. lib. 1. cap. 7. 9. 6.</note> Dr <hi>Forbesse</hi> his answere is, that not only things instituted by God, are not to be taken away for the abuse of them, but further, <hi>neque res mediae ab hominibus prudenter introductae, propter sequentem abusum semper tollendae sunt.

                  <hi>Calvine</hi> answering that which <hi>Cassander</hi> alledged out of an Italian writer, <hi>abusu non tolli bonum usum;</hi> he admits it only to be true, in things which are institute by God himself: not so in things ordained by men: for the very use of such things, or rites, as have no necessary use in Gods worship, and which men have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised, only at their owne pleasure, is taken away by Idolatrous abuse. <hi>Pars tutior</hi> here, is to put them wholly away, and there is by a great deale more danger in retaining; then in removing them. 2. The proofs which I have produced for the proposition, about which now we debate, doe not only inferre that things and Rites, which have beene notoriously abused to Idolatry, should be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, in case they be not restored to a right use, but simply and absolutely that in any wise they are to be abolished. <hi>e</hi> God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <note place="margin">(b) Isa. 30. 22.</note> to say to the coverings, and the ornaments of Idolls <hi>get you hence.</hi> It is not enough they be purged from the abuse, but <hi>simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> they themselves must pack them, and be gone. How did <hi>Iacob</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:3270:71"/>
with the eare rings of the Idolls; <hi>Elijah</hi> with <hi>Baals</hi> Altar; <hi>Iehu</hi> with his vestments; <hi>Iosiah</hi> with his houses; <hi>Manasseh</hi> with his Altars; <hi>Moses</hi> with the golden Calfe; <hi>Iosua</hi> with the Temples of <hi>Canaan; Hezekiah</hi> with the Brazen Serpent? did they retaine the things themselves, and only purge them from the abuse? belike if these our Opposites had beene their counsellers, they had advised them to be contented with such a moderation: yet we see they were better counselled, when they destroyed utterly the things themselves: whereby we know, that they were of the same mind with us, and thought that things abused to Idolatry, if they have no necessary use, are farre better away then aplace. Did <hi>Daniel</hi> refuse <hi>Bels</hi> meate, because it was not restored to the right use? Nay, if that had beene all, it might have beene quickly helped, and the meate sanctified by the word of God and prayer. Finally, were the Churches of <hi>Perga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi> and <hi>Theatyra,</hi> reprooved, because they did not restore things sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed to Idolls, to their right use? or, were they not rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooved for having any thing at all a doe with the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?</p>
               <p n="3">3. As for that which D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Forbesse</hi> objecteth to us, we answere, that <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label> Temples, places of Prayer, Chaires, Veshells, and Bells, are of a necessary use, by the light and guidance of nature it selfe, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimoniall benediction is necessary by Gods institution, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 28. So that all those examples doe except themselves from the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in hand. But <note n="f" place="margin">ubi supra</note> the Dr. intendeth to bring those things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the category of things indifferent, and to this purpose he alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, that it is indifferent to use this, or that place, for a Temple, or a place of prayer: also to use these Veshells, and Bells, or others; And of Matrimoniall benediction to be performed by a Pastor, he saith, there is nothing commanded in scripture. <hi>Ans.</hi> Though it be indifferent to choose this place, or that place, &amp;c. also to use these Veshells, or other Veshells, &amp;c. yet the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> (I trust) will not denie that Temples, houses of prayer, Veshels, and Bells are of a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary use, (which exeemeth them from the touch of our present ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument:) whereas beside, that it is not necessary to kneele in the communion in this place, more then in that place, neither to keep the feasts of Christs Nativity, Passion, &amp;c. upon these dayes more then upon other dayes, &amp;c. the things themselves are not necessary in their kinde, and it is not necessary to keep any festuall day, nor to kneel at all in the act of receiving the communion. There is also another respect which hindereth Temples, Veshells, &amp;c. from comming within the compasse of this our argument: but neither doth it agree to the controverted Ceremonies. Temples, houses of Prayer, Veshells for the ministration of the Sacraments, and Bells, are not used by us in Divine worship, as things Sacred; or as holier then other houses, Veshells, and Bells; But we use them only for
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:3270:71"/>
naturall necessity, partly for that common decency, which hath no lesse place in the actions of Civill, then of sacred assemblies: yea in some cases, they may be applied to Civill uses, as <note n="g" place="margin">supra cap. 1. sect. 11.</note> hath been said. Whereas the controverted Ceremonies are respected &amp; used, as sacred Rites, and as holier then any circumstance, which is alike common to civill and sacred actions, neither are they used at all, out of the case of worship. We see now a double respect, wherefore our argument inferreth not the necessity of abolishing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying such Temples, Veshells and Bells, as have been abused to Idolatry, viz. because it can neither be said, that they are not things necessary, nor yet that they are things sacred.</p>
               <p>Neverthelesse (to add this by the way) howbeit for those reasons, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label> the retaining and using of Temples which have been polluted with Idolls, be not in it selfe unlawfull, yet the retaining of every such Temple is not ever necessary, but sometimes it is expedient for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extirpation of superstition, to demolish and destroy some such Temples, as have been horribly abused to Idolatry, as <note n="h" place="margin">Com. in <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Calvine</hi> also and <note n="i" place="margin">In 4. praec. Col. 709.</note> 
                  <hi>Zanchius</hi> doe plainly insinuate. Whereby I meane to defend (though not as in it selfe necessary, yet as expedient <hi>pro tunc,</hi> that which the Reformators of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> did in casting downe some of those Churches, which had been consecrate to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Idolls, and of a long time polluted with Idolatrous worship. As on the one part the Reformators (not without great probability) feared, that so long as these Churches were not made even with the ground, the memory of that superstition, whereunto they had been employed and accustomed, should have been in them preserved, and with some sort of respect, recognized: so on the other parte they saw it expedient to demolish them, for strengthening the hands of such as adhered to the Reformation, for putting Papists out of all hope of the reentry of Popery, and for hedging up the way with thornes, that the Idolatrously minded, might not find their pathes. And since the pulling downe of those Churches wanted neither this pious intent, nor happy event, I must say, that the bitter invectives given forth against it, by some who carry a favourable eye to the pompous bravery of the Romish whoore, and have deformed to much of that which was by them reformed, are to be detested by all such, as wish the eternall exile of Idolatrous monuments, out of the Lords land: yet let these <hi>Momus-</hi>like spirits understand, that their censorius verdicts doe also reflexe upon those auncient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians <note n="k" place="margin">Magdeb.

And they have farre better looked to piety who have taken care, to have Popish Images, statues, and ornaments, utterly cut off, for as we read in the Ecclesiasticall Histories, Constantine the great, after he had given his name to Christ, by an edict provided and tooke order, that the Temples of the Idolls might be closed and shut up. But because they did still remaine, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian the Apostate did easily open and unlock them, and thereafter did prostitute the Idolls of old superstition to be worshipped in them: which Theodosius the best and commended Prince, animadverting, commanded to pull them downe, lest they should againe any more be restored.</hi> But because I suppose no so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber spirit will denie that sometimes and in some cases, it may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to rase and pull downe some Temples polluted with Idolls, where other Temples may be had to serve sufficiently the assemblies of Christian congregations, (which is all I plead for:) Therefore I leave this purpose, and returne to D. <hi>Forbesse.</hi>

blessing of the people, was not commanded in the Law as a thing peculiar and proper to the Leviticall Priesthood, but as a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall &amp; perpetuall duty, belonging to the Lords Ministers for ever. Wherefore notwithstanding of any abuse of Matrimoniall benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction among Papists, yet forasmuch as it hath a necessary use in the Church, and may not (as the controverted Ceremonies may) be wel spared; It is manifest, that it commeth not under the respect and account of those things, whereof our Argument speaketh.</p>

               <p>Secondly, our Opposites answer us, that beside the purging of things and Rites abused by Idolators, from their Idolatrous pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the restoring of them to a right use, preaching and teaching against the superstition, and abuse which hath followed upon them, is another means to avoid that harme, which we feare to ensue upon the retaining of them. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1.

that they abuse not these Ceremonies, and that the abolishing of the Ceremonies themselves were not necessary.

               <p>Thirdly, we are told, that if these answers which our Opposites <label type="milestone">

Beside these answeres which are common in our adversaries <label type="milestone">

For example, the abuse of kneeling in ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, &amp;c. proceeded not only from the opinion of the agent, but from the nature of the action which is idolatrous and superstitious, &amp;c. and therefore both the action, and gesture ought to be abolished. But the Sacrament of the Supper, being an action instituted by God, and kneeling beeing of the owne nature an holy and religious Ceremony, it can never receive contagion of ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry from it, but only from the opinion of the agent: then remove the opinion, both the action it selfe may be rightly used, and kneeling therein,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. since he graunteth that a Ceremony dedicated to, and polluted with Idolatry; may (he answereth not the argument which there he propoundeth, except he say <hi>must)</hi> be abolished, if it be of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Institution: he must graunt from this ground, if there were no more, that the Crosse, Surplice, kneeling at the communion, &amp;c. having been so notoriously abused to Idolatry, must be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, because they have no institution except from men only. But, 2. Why saith he, that kneeling is a Ceremony of Divine insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution? Which he pronounceth not of kneeling, as it is actuated by some individuall case, or clothed with certaine perticular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, (for he maketh this kneeling whereof he speaketh, to be found in two most different actions, the one Idolatrous, the other holy,) but of kneeling in the generall, <hi>per se,</hi> and <hi>praecise ab omnibus circumstantijs.</hi> Let him now tell, where kneeling thus considered is commended unto us in Gods word.

                  </gap> should follow, that it commendeth kneeling, only to the Iewes in that particular case: or whether it be taken more generally, to commend kneeling, (though not as necessary, yet as laudable and beseeming,) in the solemne acts of Gods immediat worship, such as that, praise and thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, whereof the beginning of the <hi>Psalme</hi> speaketh, whether I say it be taken in this, or that sence, yet it commendeth not kneeling,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:3270:74"/>
except in a certaine kinde of worship only. And as for kneeling in the generall nature of it, it is not of Divine institution, but in it self indifferent, even as sitting, standing, &amp;c. all which gestures are then only made good, or evill, when <hi>in actu exercito</hi> they are actuated and individualized by particular circumstances. 3. If so be, the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony be abused to Idolatry, it skills not how, for as I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, the reasons and proofs which I have produced for the proposition of our present Argument, hold good against the retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of any thing which hath beene knowne to be abused to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and only such things as have a necessary use are to be excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. 4. The nature of an action, wherein a Ceremony is used, can not be the cause of the abuse of that Ceremony, neither can the abuse of a Ceremony proceed from the nature of the action where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is used, as one effect from the cause, for <note n="d" place="margin">Aquin. 2. 2<hi rend="sup">a</hi>. q. 43. art. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>nihil potest esse homini causa sufficiens peccati,</hi> except only <hi>propria voluntas.</hi> 5. The abuse of kneeling in the Idolatrous action of elevation, proceedeth not from the nature of the action, but from the opinion of the agent, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from his will, <hi>(for principium actionum humanarum,</hi> is not opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but will chosing that which opinion conceiteth to be chosen, or <hi>voluntas praeeunte luce intellectus.)</hi> It is the will of the agent only, which both maketh the action of elevation to be Idolatrous, and likewise kneeling in this action to receive the contagion of Idolatry. For the elevation of the bread <hi>materialiter,</hi> is not Idolatrous, (more then the lifting up of the bread among us by Elders or Deacons, when in taking it off the table, or setting it on, they lift it above the heads of the communicants;) but <hi>formaliter</hi> only, as it is elevated with a will and intention to place it in state of worship. So likewise kneeling to the bread, <hi>materialiter,</hi> is not Idolatry, (else a man were a Idolater, who should be against his will thrust downe, and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by violence kneeling on his knees, when the bread is eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,) but <hi>formaliter,</hi> as it proceedeth from a will and intention in men, to give to the bread elevated, a state in that worship, and out of that respect to kneel before it. 6. What can he gaine by this device, that the abuse of kneeling in the Lords Supper proceeded not from the nature of the action, but from the will of the agent? Can he hereupon inferre, that kneeling in that action is to be retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, notwithstanding of any contagion of Idolatry, which it hath receaved? Nay then, let him say, that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did not rightly, in breaking downe the Brazen Serpent, which was set up at Gods command, and the abuse whereof proceeded not from the thing it self, which had a most lawfull, profitable, and holy use, but only from the perverse opinion and will of them who abused it to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</p>
               <p>But the comparing of kneeling to the Brazen Serpent, is very <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>15</label> unsavory to the B. And wherefore? <hi>The Brazen Serpent</hi> saith he, <hi>in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:3270:74"/>
the time it was abolished, had no use: that ceased with the vertue of the cure, that the Israelites received by looking upon it; the act of kneeling continueth allwise in a necessary use, for the better expressing of our thankfulnesse to God. Ans. 1.</hi> Both kneeling, and all the rest of the Popish Ceremonies, may well be compared to the Brazen Serpent. And Divines doe commonly alledge this example, as most pregnant, to prove that things or rites polluted with I dolls, and abused to Idolatry, may not be retained, if they have no necessary use, and I have cited before the B. of <hi>Winchester,</hi> aknowledging that this argument holdeth good against all things which are taken up, not at Gods prescription, but at mens injunction. <note n="e" place="margin">Confer. vvith 1. Hart cap. 8. divis. 4. pag. 509.</note> I. <hi>Rainoldes</hi> argumenteth, from <hi>Hezekiah</hi> his breaking downe of the Brazen Serpent, to the plucking downe of the signe of the Crosse. 2. Why saith he, that the Brasen Serpent in the time it was abolished had no use? the use of it ceased not with the cure, but it was still kept for a most pious and profitable use, even to be a monument of that mercy, which the Israelites received in the wildernesse, and it served for the better expressing of their thankefulnesse to God, which the B. here calleth a necessary use. 3. When he saith that kneeling continueth alwayes in a necessary use, we must understand him to speake of kneeling in the act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Communion, else he runnes at randone, for it is not kneeling in the generall, but kneeling in this particular case vvhich is compared to the Brazen Serpent. Now to say, that this gesture in this action is necessary, for our better expressing of our thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to God, importeth that the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Churches in Europe, for so many yeares, have omitted that vvhich vvas necessary, for the better expressing of their thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to God, and that they have not vvell enough expressed it. And moreover, if kneeling be necessary in the Lords Supper, for our better expressing of our thankfulnesse to God, then is it also neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary at our owne common tables. Though we be bound to be more thankfull at the Lords Table, and that because vve receive a benefit of infinit more vvorth. Yet we are bound to be <hi>tam grati,</hi> as vvell thankfull, at our owne tables, albeit not <hi>tanta gratitudine.</hi> If then the same kind of thankfulnesse be required of us at our owne Tables, (for <hi>intentio &amp; remissio graduum secundum magis &amp; minus, non va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant speciem rei;)</hi> that vvhich is necessary for expressing of our thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, at the Lords Table, must be necessary also for the expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of it, at our ovvne. When I see the B. sitting at his Table, I shall tell him, that he omitteth that gesture vvhich is necessary, for the expressing of his thankfulnesse to God. 4. Did not the Apostles receiving this Sacrament from Christ himself, vvell enough expresse their thankfulnesse to God? yet they kneeled not, but sate, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and shall be aftervvards prooven against them vvho contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict every thing vvhich crosseth them. 5. God vvill never take a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:3270:75"/>
Ceremony of mens devising, for a better expressing of our thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, then a gesture vvhich is commended to us by the example of his ovvne Sonne and his Apostles, together vvith the Celebration of this Sacrament in all points according to his institution. 6. Hovv shall vve knovv vvhere vve have the B. and his fellovves? it seemes they know not where they have themselvs: for sometimes they tell us, that it is indifferent to take the Communion sitting, or standing, or passing, or kneeling, yet here the B. tells, that kneeling is necessary. 7. I see the B. perceiveth, that no answere can take kneeling at the Communion, out of the compasse of the Brazen Serpent, except to say, it hath a necessary use, this is the dead lift, which yet helpeth not, as I have shewed. All things then which are not necessary, (where of kneeling is one,) being notoriously abused to Idolatry, fall under the Brazen Serpen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If there were a needfull use of them in Gods worship: 2 In case they were so alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and disposed, as that they tended not to the honour of the Idoll, and his damnable worship, 3. If they were without certaine danger, of insnaring people into Idolatry. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Either he requires all these conditiones, in every Idolothyte and Idolatrous appurtenance which may be retained, or else he thinkes, that any one of them sufficeth: If he require all these, the last two are superfluous; for that which hath a needfull use in Gods worship, can neither tend to the honour of the Idoll, nor yet can have in it any danger of insnaring people into Idolatry: If he thinke any one of those conditions enough, then let us goe through them. The first I admit, but it will not helpe his cause, for while the world standeth, they shall never prove that kneeling in the act of receiving the Communion, &amp; the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted Ceremonies, have either a needfull, or a profitable, or a lawfull use in Gods worship. As for his secound condition, it is all one with that which <note n="g" place="margin">supra sect. 9.</note> I have already confuted: namely, that things abused to Idolatry may be kept, if they be purged from their abuse, and restored to the right use. But he alledgeth for it a passage of <hi>Parker,</hi> of the Crosse, <hi>cap. 1. sect. 7. pag. 10.</hi> Where he sheweth out of <hi>Augustine,</hi> that an Idolothyte may not be kept for privat use, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept 1. <hi>Omnis honor Idoli, cum apertissima destructione subvertatur.</hi> 2 That not only his honour be despoysed, but also all shew thereof. How doth this place (now would I know,) make any thing for <hi>Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body?</hi> Doe they keepe kneeling for privat use? Doe they destroy most openly all honour of the Idoll, to which kneeling was dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? Hath their kneeling not so much as any shew of the breaden-Gods honour? who will say so? and if any will say it, who will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3270:75"/>
it? who knoweth not that kneeling is kept for a publike, and not for a private use, and that the breaden Idoll receiveth very great shew of honour from it? He was scarce of warrants, when he had no better, then <hi>Parker</hi> could affoorde him. His third condition rests, and touching it I aske, what if those Idolatrous appurtenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, be not without apparent danger of insnaring people into Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry? are we not commanded to abstaine from all appearance of evill? Will he correct the Apostle, and teach us, that we need not care for apparent, but for certain dangers? What more apparent danger of insnaring people into Idolatry, then unnecessarie Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, which have been dedicated to, and polluted with Idolls, and which being retained, doe both admonish us to remember upon old Idolatry, and move us to returne to the same, as I have <note n="h" place="margin">supr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>17</label> be but evident, to any who will not harden their mindes against the light of the truth, that the Ceremonies in question, have been most notoriously abused to Idolatry and superstition, and withall, that they have no necessary use to make us retaine them. I say, they have been notoriously abused to Idolatry. 1. Because they have been dedicated and consecrated to the service of Idolls. 2.

                     </gap> turned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to God</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. As for the decree of <hi>Honorius,</hi> I have all ready answered with <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> that it had reference specially to the receiving. 2. When Cleargie men are appointed in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <hi>Rituall,</hi> to receive the Sacrament at the Altar kneeling, this was not for veneration of the Altar, to which they did reverence at all times when they approched to it, but this was required particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in their receiving of the Sacrament, for adoration of it Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there mention made of the Altar, as conferring any thing to their kneeling in receiving the Sacrament, for the Sacrament was not used the more reverently, because it stood upon the Altar, but by the contrary, for the Sacraments sake reverence was done to the Altar, which was esteemed the Seat of the body of Christ. It appeareth therefore, that the Altar is mentioned, not as concerning the kneeling of the Cleargie men in their communicating, but sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply as concerning their communicating, because none but they were wont to communicate at the Altar, according to that received <note n="x" place="margin">Concil. Laodicaen. can. 19. See also Conc. Tolet. 4. can. 17.</note> Canon. <hi>Solis autem Ministris Altaris liceat ingredi ad Altare, &amp; ibidem communicare.</hi> The one of the Doctors owne conjectures, is, that they kneeled for reverence of that which stood upon the Altar. But I would know what that was, which standing upon the Altar, made them to kneele in the participation; if it was not the Hoste it self? Now whereas he denies, as touching custome, that people did ever intend the adoration of the species: I answer. 1. How knowes he what people in the Romane Church did intend in their mindes? 2. What warrant hath he for this, that they did not in the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:3270:77"/>
adore the Hoste, which was then put into their mouths? 3. Though this which he saith, were true, he gaineth nothing by it; for put the case they did not intend the adoration of the species, dare he say, that they intended not the adoration of that which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the species? I trow not. Now that which was under the species, though in their conceit it was Christs body, yet it was indeed Bread. So that in the very participation, they were worshipping the Bread. But, 4. What needeth any more? he maketh himself a lyar, and saith <note n="y" place="margin">ubi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra pag. 71.</note> plainly, that after transubstantiation was embraced, and when all the substance of the visible Creature was held to be gone, they did intend the adoration of the visible things, as if there had been now no substance of any creature left therein. Whereby he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyeth all which he hath said, of their not intending the adoration of the species.</p>
               <p>Last of all, for the other part of my assumption, that the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>20</label> have no necessary use in Gods Worship, I need no other proof, then the common by word of Formalists, which saith, they are things indifferent.

                  </gap> bravery, and chosed rather to say any thing against us, then nothing. They spare not to answer, that kneeling hath a necessary use. They are most certainly speaking of kneeling in the act of receiving the Communion; for they, and their Opposites in those places, are disputing of no other kneeling, but this onely. Now we may easily perceive, they are in a evill taking, when they are driven to such an unadvised and desperate answer. For. 1. If kneeling in the act of receiving the Lords Supper be necessary, why have themselves two, written so much for the indifferency of it? O desultorious levity, that knows not where to hold it self! 2. If it be necessary, what makes it to be so? what law? what example? what reason? 3. If it be necessary, not onely many reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and many auncient too; but Christ himself and his Apostles, have in this Sacrament omitted something that was necessary. 4. If it be necessary, why doe many of their owne Disciples take the Communion, sitting in places where sitting is used? what need I to say more? In the first part of this dispute, I have proven that the Ceremonies are not necessary, in respect of the Churches ordinance, howbeit if it were answered in this place, that they are in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect necessary, it helpeth not, since the Argument proceedeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all things notoriously abused to Idolatry, which neither God nor nature hath made necessary. And for any necessity of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies in themselves, either our Opposites must repudiat, what hath unadvisedly fallen from their pennes hereanent, or else forsake their beaten ground of indifferency, and say plainly, that the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies are urged by them, to be observed with an opinion of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, as worship of God, and as things in themselvs necessary.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> why God forbade his people Israëll the use of such rites &amp; customes, as were among the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> was not because it behoved his people to be framed of set purpose, to an utter dissimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude with those Nations, but his meaning was to barre Israell, from similitude with those Nations, in such things as were repugnant to his ordinances and lawes. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Let it be so: he hath said enough against himself. For we have the same reason to make us abstaine from all the Rites &amp; Customes of Idolaters, that we may be barred from similitude with them in such things, as are flatly repugnant to Gods word, because dissimilitude in Ceremonies, is a barre to stop similitude in substance, and on the contrary, similitude in Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:3270:78"/>
openeth a way to similitude in greater substance. 2. His answer is but a begging of that which is in question, for as much as we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge those lawes and prohibitions, to prove that all the Rites and Customes of those Nations, were repugnant to the Ordinances and Lawes of God, and that Israel was simply forbidden to use them. 3. Yet this was not a framing of Israel of set purpose to an utter dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>similitude with those Nations, for Israel used food &amp; raiment, sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and reaping, sitting, standing, lying, walking, talking, trading, lawes, governement, &amp;c: notwithstanding that the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and <hi>Canaanites</hi> used so. They were only forbidden to be like those Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in such unnecessary Rites and Customes, as had neither insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution from God nor nature, but were the inventions and devices of men only. In things and rites of this kind alone, it is, that we plead for dissimilitude with the Idolatrous Papists. For the Ceremonies in controversy are not only proven to be under the compasse of such, but are besides made by the Papists, badges and markes of their religion, as we shall see afterwards.</p>

All the Rites and Customes of Idolaters, which have neither institution from God nor nature, are to be reckoned among those sinnes, wherein we may not partake with them, for they are the improfitable workes of darknesse, all which <note n="e" place="margin">com in illum locum.</note> 
                  <hi>Calvin</hi> judgeth to be in that place generally forbidden, before the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle descend particularly, to forbid partaking with them in their Idolatry. As for the prohibition of divers mixtures, <note n="f" place="margin">ubi supra.</note> 
                  <hi>Paybody</hi> saith, the Iewes were taught thereby to make no mixture of true and false worship. <hi>Ans</hi> 1. According to his Tenets, it followeth upon this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, that no mixture is to be made betwixt holy, and Idolatrous Ceremonies, for he calleth kneeling, <hi>a bodily worship,</hi> and <hi>a worship gesture</hi> more then once or twice. And we have seene before, how <hi>Dr. Burgesse</hi> calleth the Ceremonies, <hi>worship of God.</hi> 2. If mixture of true and false worship be not lawfull, then for as much as the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Gods ordinance, namely, the Sacraments of the New Tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:3270:79"/>
are true worship. And the Ceremonies of Popery, namely Crosse, Kneeling, Holy-dayes, &amp;c. are false worship, therefore there ought to be no mixture of them togither. 3. If the Iewes were taught to make no mixture of true and false worship, then by the self same instruction, if there had beene no more, they were taught also to shunne all such occasions as might any way produce such a mixture, and by consequence all symbolizing with Idolaters in their Rites and Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>As touching these Lawes which forbade the Israelites to make round the corners of their heads, or to marre the corners of their <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> beards, or to make any cuttings in their flesh, or to make any balde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse betweene! their eyes, <note n="g" place="margin">Eccl. pol. lib. 4. s. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Hooker</hi> answereth, that the cutting round of the corners of the head, and the tearing of the tufts of the beard, howbeit they were in themselves indifferent, yet they are not indifferent being used as signes of immoderat and hopelesse lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for the dead; in which sence it is, that the law forbiddeth them. To the same purpose saith <note n="h" place="margin">ubi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra</note> 
                  <hi>Paybody,</hi> that the Lord did not forbid his people, to marre and abuse their heads and beards for the dead, because the Heathen did so, but because the practise doth not agree to the Faith and Hope of a Christian, if the Heathen had never used it. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. How much surer and sounder is <note n="i" place="margin">com. in <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 27. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>Calvines Iudgment, non aliud fuisse Dei concilium, quam ut interposito obstaculo populum suum à pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanis Gentibus dirimeret?</hi> for albeit the cutting of the haire be a thing in it self indifferent, yet because the Gentiles did use it superstitious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, therefore saith <hi>Calvin,</hi> albeit it was <hi>per se medium, Deus tamen no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luit populo suo liberum esse, ut tanquam pueri diseerent ex parvis rudimentis, se non aliter Deo fore gratos, nisi exteris &amp; praeputiatis essent prorsus dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miles, ac longissime abessent ab eorum exemplis, praesertim vero ritus omnes fugerent, quibus testata fuerit religio.</hi> So that from this law, it doth most manifestly appeare, that we may not be like Idolaters, no not in things which are in themselves indifferent, when we know that they doe use them superstitiously. 2. What warrant is there for this glosse, that the Law forbiddeth the cutting round of the corners of the head, and the marring of the corners of the beard, to be used as signes of immoderat and hopelesse lamentation for the dead, and that in no other sence, they are forbidden? Albeit the cutting of the flesh may be expounded, to proceed from immoderat grief, and to be a signe of hopelesse Lamentation, yet this can not be said of roun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the haire, marring the beard, and making of baldenesse: which might have beene used in moderat and hopefull lamentation, as wel as our putting on of mourning apparrel for the dead. The law saith nothing of the immoderat use of these things, but simply forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to round the head, or marre the beard for the dead; and that because this was one of the Rites, which the Idolatrous and supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Gentiles did use, concerning whom the Lord commmanded
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:3270:79"/>
his people, that they should not doe like them, because he had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen them to be a holy and peculiar people, above all people upon the earth. So that the thing which was fordidden, if the Gentiles had not used it, should have beene otherwise lawfull enough to Gods people, as we have seene out of <hi>Calvines</hi> commentary.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we have reason for that which we say, for by parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> with Idolaters in their Rites and Ceremonies, we are made to partake with them in their Religion too. For, <hi>Ceremoniae omnes sunt quaedam protestationes fidei,</hi> saith <note n="k" place="margin">2. 2. q. 103. art 4.</note>

                  <hi>Dr. Fulk</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that the Apostle in that place, doth compare our Sacraments with the Altars, Hostes. Sacrifices or immolations of the Iewes, and Gentiles, <hi>in that point which is common to all Ceremonies, to declare them that use them, to be pertakers of that religion, whereof they be Ceremonies.</hi> If then <note n="p" place="margin">apud Gratian. decr. part. 1. dist. 37. c. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Isidore</hi> thought it unlawfull for Christians to take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in the fables of Heathen Poets, because <hi>non solum thura offerendo Daemonibus immolatur, sed etiam corum dicta libentius capiendo;</hi> much more have we reason to think, that by taking part in the Ceremonies of Idolaters, we doe but offer to Divells, and joyne our selvs to the service of Idolls.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as by Scripture, and reason, so by Antiquity we strengthen our Argument. Of old, Christians did so shunne to be like the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> that in the dayes of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> it was thought that Christians might not weare a Garland because thereby they had beene made conforme to the Pagans. Hence <note n="q" place="margin">de Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona militis</note>

                  <hi>Dr. Mortone</hi> himself alledgeth another cafe out of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> which maketh to this purpose, namely, that Christian Proselytes did distinguish them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs from Roman Pagans, by casting away their gownes and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of cloakes. But these things we are not to urge, because we plead not for dissimilitude with the Papists, in civill fashions, but in Sacred and Religious Ceremonies. For this point then at which we hold us, we alledge <note n="s" place="margin">Magd. cent. 3. cap. 6. Col 147.</note> that which is marked in the third Centurie out of <hi>Origen,</hi> namely, that it was held unlawfull for Christians, to observe the feasts and Solemnities, either of the Iewes, or of the Gentiles.

Because the Pagans used so to doe? Last of all, read we not, in <note n="b" place="margin">Magd. cent 4. cap. 6. col. 458.</note> the fourth century of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall history, that the frame of Christians in that age, was such, that <hi>nec cum haereticis commune quicquam habere voluerunt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One would think that nothing could be answered to any of these things, by such as pretend no lesse, then that they have devoted <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label> themselves to bend all their wishes &amp; labours for procuring the imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of venerable antiquity. Yet <note n="c" place="margin">eccl. pol. lib. 4. s. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Hooker</hi> can coyne a conjecture, to frustrate all which we alleadge. <q>In things (saith he) of their owne nature indifferent, if either Councells, or particular men, have at any time with sound Iudgment misliked conformity betweene the Church of God and Infidells, the cause thereof hath not beene affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, of dissimilitude, but some special accident which the Church not beeing alwayes subject unto, hath not still cause to doe the like. For example (saith he) in the dangerous dayes of triall, wherein there was no way for the trueth of Iesus Christ to triumph over infidelity, but through the constancy of his Saincts, whom yet a naturall desire to save themselves from the flame, might peradve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture cause to joyne with the Pagans in externall Customes, too farre using the same as a cloak to conceale themselves in, and a mist to darken the eyes of Infidels withall; for remedy hereof, it might be, those lawes were provided.</q> 
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This answer is altogither doubtfull, and conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, made up of <hi>If,</hi> and <hi>peradventure,</hi> and <hi>it might be.</hi> Neither is any thing found which can make such a conjecture probable. 2. The true reason, why Christians were forbidden to use the Rites and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes of Pagans, was neither a bare affectation of dissimilitude, nor yet any speciall accident which the Church is not alwayes sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto; but because it was held unlawfull, to symbolize with I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters in the use of such rites, as they placed any religion in. For in the Fathers &amp; Councells, which we have cited to this purpose, there is no other reason mentioned, why it behoved Christians to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:3270:80"/>
from those forbidden customes, but only because the Pagans and Infidels used so. 3. And what if <hi>Hookers</hi> divination shall have place? doth it not agree to us, so as it should make us unlike the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists? yes sure, and more properly. For put the case, that those aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Christians had not avoided conformity with Pagans, in those Rites and Customes, which we reade to have beene forbidden them, yet for all that, there had beene remaining betwixt them and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, by a great deale more difference, then will remaine betwixt us and the Papists, if we avoide not conformity with them in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted Ceremonies: for the Pagans had not the Word, Sacraments, &amp;c. which the Papists doe retaine, so that we may farre more easily use the Ceremonies, as a mist to darken the eyes of the Papists, then they could have used those forbidden Rites, as a mist to darken the eyes of Pagans. Much more then, Protestants should not be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forme themselves unto Papists, in Rites &amp; Ceremonies, lest in the dangerous dayes of triall (which some Reformed Churches in <hi>Europe</hi> doe presently feele, and which seeme to be faster approaching to our selves, then the most part are aware of,) they joyne themselves to Papists in these externall things, too farre using the same as a cloake to conceale themselves in, &amp;c. 4. We find that the reason, why the fourth Councell of <hi>Toledo,</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Can. 5.</note> forbade the Ceremony of thrise dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in water to be used in baptisme, was, lest Christians should seeme to assent to Heretikes who divide the Trinity. And the reason why the same Councell <note n="e" place="margin">Can. 40.</note> forbade Cleargie men to conforme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unto the custome of Heretikes, in the sheaving of the haire of their head, is mentioned to have beene, the removing of conformity with the Custome of Heretikes, from the Churches of <hi>Spaine,</hi> as beeing a great dishonour unto the same. And we have heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that <hi>Augustine</hi> condemneth conformity with the <hi>Manichees,</hi> in fasting upon the Lords day, as scandalous. And whereas afterwards the Councell of <hi>Caesaraugusta</hi> forbade fasting upon the Lords day, <note n="f" place="margin">Sims. hist. of the Church. lib. 4. cent. 6.</note> a grave Writer layeth out the reason of this prohibition, thus, <hi>It would appeare that this Councell had a desire to abolish the Rites and Customes of the Manichean Heretikes, who were accustomed to fast upon the Lords day.</hi> Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we have seene from <hi>Constantines</hi> Epistle to the Churches, that dissimilitude with the Iewes was one (though not the only one) rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why it was not thought beseeming to keep Easter upon the fourteenth day of the moneth. Who then can thinke that any such speciall accident, as <hi>Hooker</hi> imagineth, was the reason why the Rites and Customes of Pagans were forbidden to Christians? Were not the Customes of the Pagans to be held unbeseeming for Christians, as well as the Customes of the Iewes? Nay, if Conformity with He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes (whom <note n="g" place="margin">eccl pol. lib. 3. s. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Hooker</hi> aknowledgeth to be a part of the visible Church,) in their Customes and Ceremonies, was condemned as a scandall, a dishonour to the Church, and an assenting unto their He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:3270:81"/>
might he not have much more thought, that conformity with the Customes of Pagans was forbidden as a greater scandall, and dishonour to the Church, and as an assenting to the Paganisme and Idolatry of those that were without?</p>
               <p>But to proceed. In the fourth place, the Canon Law it self spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <label type="milestone">

Some of them (as I touched before) are not ashamed to professe, that we should come as neare to the Papists as we can, and therefore should conforme our selves to them in their Ceremonies, (onely purging away the superstition) because if we doe otherwise, we exasperate the Papists, and alienate them the more from our Religion and Reformation. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. <note n="n" place="margin">Elencis.

So say some, that by the signe of the Crosse they are not ranked with Papists, because they use not the materiall Crosse, which is the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish one, but the aeriall onely.

But, good man, he seeks a knot in the Bulrush. For, 1.

And as touching kneeling in the Sacrament, it shall be proven in the next Chapter, that they doe kneel to the Signe, even as the Papists doe. In the meane while it may be questioned, whether the B. meant some such matter, even here where professedly he maketh a difference betwixt the Papists their kneeling, and ours. His words wherein I apprehend this much, are these: <hi>The Papists in prayer kneel to an Idoll, and in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament they kneel to the Signe, we kneel in our prayer to God, and by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to the thing signified.</hi> The Analogy of the Antithesis required him to say, that we kneel <hi>in the Sacrament</hi> to the thing signified: but changing his Phrase, he saith, that we kneel <hi>by the Sacrament</hi> to the thing signified. Now if we kneel <hi>by the Sacrament to Christ,</hi> then we adore the Sacrament as <hi>objectum materialè,</hi> and Christ as <hi>objectum for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malè.</hi> Iust so the Papists adore their Images, because <hi>per imaginem</hi> they adore <hi>prototypon.</hi> 2. What if we should yeeld to the B. that Knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and Holy-dayes, are with us applied to another Service, and used with another meaning, then they are with the Papists? doth that excuse our conformity with Papists in the externall use of these Ceremonies? If so <note n="u" place="margin">I. Rain. confer. with 1. Hart cap. 8. divis. 4. pag. 496.</note> 
                  <hi>I.

For it was given them to betoken that holinesse, and traine them up unto it, which Christ by his grace should bring to the faithfull. And Peter knew that Christ had do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

this in trueth, and taken away that Figure, yea the whole yoke of the Law of Moses: which point he taught the Gentiles also Wherefore although your Church doe keepe the Iewish Rites, with another meaning then God ordained them for the Iewes, &amp;c. yet this of Peter sheweth, that the thing is Iewish, and you to Iudaize who keepe them.</hi> By the very same reasons prove we, that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malists doe Romanize, by keeping the Popish Ceremonies, though with another meaning, and to another use then the Romanists doe. The very externall use therefore, of any sacred Ceremony of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Institution, is not to be suffered in the matter of worship, when in respect of this externall use, we are sorted with Idolaters. 3. If conformity with Idolaters in the externall use of their Ceremonies be lawfull, if so be there be a difference in the substance of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and Object whereunto they are applied, then why were Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians forbidden of old, (as vve have heard before) to keep the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lends of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> and the first day of every moneth, forasmuch as the Pagans used so? Why was trin-immersion in Baptisme, and fasting upon the Lords day forbidden, for that the Heretikes did so?

The B. must say, there was no need of shunning conformity with Pagans, Iewes, Heretikes, in the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall use of their Rites and Customes, and that a difference ought to have been made, onely in the Object and use, whereunto the same was applied. Nay, why did God forbid Israell, to cut their haire as the Gentiles did? had it not been enough, not to apply this Rite to a superstitious use, as <note n="y" place="margin">1<hi rend="sup">a</hi>. 2<hi rend="sup">a</hi>. q. 102. art. 6. resp. ad 11 Sect. 14.</note>

I have shewed in the first Part of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, how conscience is sought to be bound by the Law of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, and here by the way, no lesse may be drawne from <hi>Hals</hi> words, which now I examine. For he implieth in them, that we are bound to obey the Statutes about the Ceremonies, merely for their Auctorities sake who command us, though there be no other thing in the Ceremonies themselves, which can commend them to us. But I have also proven before, that humane Lawes doe not bind to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, but onely in this case, when the things which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe, doe agree and serve to those things which Gods Law pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth: so that, as humane Lawes, they bind not, neither have they any force to bind, but onely by Participation with Gods Law.

                  <hi>Hall</hi> himselfe calleth it superstition to make any more sinnes, then the ten com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements. Either then, let it be shewed out of Gods word, that Nonconformity &amp; the refusing of the English Popish Ceremonies, is a fault, or else let us not be thought bound by mens lawes, where Gods Law hath left us free. Yet we deale more liberally with our Opposites, for if we prove not the unlawfulnesse of the Ceremonies, both by Gods Word, and sound reason, let us be then bound to use them for Ordinances sake. 3. His comparisons are farre wide: they are so farre from running upon foure feet, that they have indeed no feet at all: whether we consider the commandements, or the breach of them, he is altogither extravagant.

                  <hi>Adam</hi> to eate the Apple, which he forbade him to eate, and so the eating of it had been good, the not eating of it evill: whereas the Will &amp; Commandement of men is not <hi>regula regulans,</hi> but <hi>regula re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulata.</hi> Neither can they make good or evill, beseeming or not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming, what they list, but their commandements are to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by a higher rule.

                  <hi>B. Lindsey</hi> teacheth plainly, that it is Idolatry to set before the eyes of our mindes, or bodies, any Image as a meane or motive of adoration, even though the worship should be abstracted from the Image and not given unto it. Well then: will it please him to let us see, that kneeling before the actuall Images of Christs body and bloud in the Sacrament, even though these Images should bee no otherwise considered in the act of adoration, but as active objects, motives, and occasions which stirre up the mind of the kneeler to worship Christ, (for this is the best face which himself puts upon kneeling, thoug falsely, as we shall se afterward,) is not so great Idolatry as the other. All the difference which <note n="k" place="margin">ubi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra.</note> he maketh, is, <hi>that no true worship can be properly occasioned by an Image, which is a Doctor of lyes teaching nothing of God, but falshood and vanities: but the blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being instituted by Christ, to call to our remembrance his death, &amp;c. gives us, so oft as we receive it, a most powerfull and pregnant occasion of thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and praise.</hi>

to be no will-worship, yet doeth it noth any whit availe to shew, that adoration before them is no Idolatry. May I not commit Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry with Images of Gods institution, no lesse then with those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by men, when <hi>(Caeteris paribus)</hi> there is no other difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, considered as objects of adoration, but that of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance and institution which they have? What if I fall downe at the hearing of a Sermon, and religiously adore before the Pastor, as the Vicarius signe of Christ himself, who stands there <note n="m" place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 20.</note> in Christs stead, referring my adoration to Christ onely, yet in or by that Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassad out who stands in Christs stead? If this my adoration should be called so great Idolatry, as if I should fall downe before a graven Image, to worship God in or by it, (for it is indeed as great every way,) our kneelers I perceive would permit me to answere for my self, that my worshipping of God by the minister, can not be called Idolatrous, by this reason, (because the worshipping of God by a graven Image, is such, therefore also the worshipping of him by a living Image, is no other,) since Images of Gods institution must not bee paralelled with those of mens invention. As to the secound difference, I answere, 1. Though the B. muttereth here, that no true worship can bee occasioned by an Image, yet belike he and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes will not stand to it, for many of them allow the historicall use of Images, and the B. hath not denied this though his Antagonist, objecteth it. <note n="n" place="margin">g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Whereas he saith, that the blessed Sacrament is instituted by Christ to call to our rememberance his death, this inferreth not that it is an occasion of thanksgiving and praise in the verie act of receiving, as we shall see afterward.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:3270:88"/>
the making up of Idolatry, neither of which is found in their knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. First, they say, except there be an intention in the worshipper, to adore the creature which is before his eyes, his kneeling before it is no Idolatry. <hi>What shall I say,</hi> saith <note n="q" place="margin">part. 3. cap. 3. sect. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>Paybody? What need I say in this place, but to professe and likewise avouch, that we intend onely to worship the Lord our God, when we kneele in the act of receiving? we worship not the Bread and Wine, we intend not our adoring and kneeling unto them. Give us leave to avouch our sincerity in this matter, and it will take away the respect of Idolatry in Gods worship. Answ.</hi> I shewed before, that <hi>Paybody</hi> defendeth <hi>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone</hi> his adoration, which he calleth relative from the Signe to Christ: yet let it be so, as here he pretendeth, that no adoration is intended to the Signe; will this save their kneeling from Idolatry? Nay then, the three Children should not have beene Idolaters, if they had kneeled before <hi>Nebuchadnezars</hi> image, intending their worship to God only, and not to the Image.

               </p>
               <p>The other thing which our kneelers require to the making up of Idolatry, is, that the creature before which we adore, be a passive object of the adoration; whereas <note n="u" place="margin">Lindsey ubi supra pag. 81.</note> say they, the Sacramentall Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are <hi>no manner of way the passive object of our adoration, but the active onely of that adoration, which at the Sacrament is given to Christ, that is, such an Object and Signe as moves us upon the sight, or by the signification thereof, to lift up our hearts, and adore the onely Object of our faith, the Lord Iesus: such as the holy Word of God, his workes, and benefites are, by meditation and consideration whereof, we are moved and stirred up to adore him. Answ.</hi> 1. That which he affirmeth is false, and out of one page of his owne booke I draw an Argument, which destroyeth it, thus: If the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Elements, were onely the active object of their adoration who kneele before them in the receiving, then their reall presence should be but accidentall to the kneelers. But the reall presence of the Elements, in the act of receiving, is not accidentall to the knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The proposition I drawe from his owne words: <hi>We can
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:3270:89"/>
neither</hi> (saith <note n="x" place="margin">Ibid. pag. 92.</note> he) <hi>pray to God, nor thanke him nor praise him, but ever there must be, before the eyes of our minds at least, something of his Workes, Word, or Sacraments, if not before our externall sences.</hi> He confesseth it will be enough, that these active objects of worship, be before the eyes of our mindes, and that their reall presence before our external sences is not necessary, but accidentall to us whose minds are by their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes stirred up to worship. And so it is indeed. For <hi>esse scibile</hi> or <hi>reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morativum</hi> of an active object of adoration, is that which stirreth up the minde to worship, so that the reall presence of such an object is but accidentall to the worshipper. The assumption I likewise draw out of the Bishops owne words. For <note n="y" place="margin">Ibid.</note> he saith, that we kneel before the Elements, <hi>having them in our sight, or object to our sences, as ordinary Signes, meanes, and memorialls, to stirre us up, to worship,</hi> &amp;c. Now if we have them in our sight, and before our sences, for this purpose, that they may be meanes, signes, &amp; memorialls to stirre us up to worship, then (sure) their beeing really before our sences, is not accidentall to us when we kneele. Since <note n="z" place="margin">Of the lawf. of kneell. cap. 32. pag. 115.</note> 
                  <hi>Dr. Burgesse</hi> hath beene so dull and sottish, as to write that <hi>the Signes are but accidentally before the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants, when they receive,</hi> he is to be ignominiously exsibilat; for making the Sacred Sacramentall Signes to bee no otherwise present, then the walls of the Church, the nailes and timber of the materiall Table whereupon the Elements are set, or any thing else accidentally before the Communicants.

                  <hi>Norunt in Imaginibus nihil Deitatis inesse, meras autem esse rerum absentium repraesentationes, &amp;c.</hi> And what if neither Heathens, nor Papists had been of this Opinion, that Images are but Active Objects of worship? yet I have before observed, that the B. himselfe aknowledgeth, it were Idolatry to set before us an Image, as the Active Object of our Adoration: though the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship should be abstracted from the Image.</p>
               <p>Finally, to shut up this point, it is to be noted, that the using of <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>12</label> the Sacramentall Elements as active objects of Worship onely, can not make kneeling before them in the receiving, to be no Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry? for then might we lawfully, &amp; without Idolatry, kneel before every active object, which stirreth up our mindes to worship God. All the workes of God are such active objects, as the B. also resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in the words before cited. Yet may we not at the sight of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of Gods workes, kneele downe and adore, whiles the eyes both of body and minde are fixed upon it, as the meanes and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion which stirreth us up to worship God. The B. indeed holdeth we may: onely <note n="g" place="margin">ubi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra pag. 88.</note> he saith, this is not necessary, because when by the sight of the Creatures of God, we are moved privately to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, our externall Gesture of Adoration is Arbitrary, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times no Gesture at all is required. But in the ordinary Ministery, when the workes of God, or his benefits are propounded, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied publikely, to stirre us up to worship in the Assemblies of the Church, then our Gesture ceaseth to be Arbitrary: for it must be such as is prescribed and received in the Church where we worship. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. He shuffeleth the point deceitfully, for when he speaks of being moved to worship at the sight of any Creature, he means of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:3270:90"/>
inward worship, as is evident by these words, <hi>sometime no Gesture at all is required;</hi> but when he speakes of being moved to worship in the Assemblies of the Church, by the benefites of God propounded publikely, (for example, by the blessed Sacrament,) then he means of outward worship, as is evident by his requiring necessarily a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture. He should have spoken of one kinde of worship in both cases, namely, of that which is outward, for of no other doe we dispute. When we are moved by the Sacrament to adore God in the act of receiving, this can be no other but that which is inward, and thus we adore God by Faith, Hope, and Love, though neither the heart be praying, nor the body kneeling. That which we deny (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of himselfe could not be ignorant,) is, that the Sacramentall Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be to us, in the receiving, active objects of outward a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration? or because they move us to worship inwardly, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we should adore outwardly. 2. Whereas he teacheth, that knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling before any Creature, when thereby we are moved to worship privately, is lawfull, but kneeling before the Sacramentall Elements, when thereby we are moved to worship in the Assemblies of the Church, is necessary; that we may kneel there, but we must kneel here: he knew; or else he made himselfe ignorant, that both these should be denied by us. Why then did he not make them good? kneeling before those active objects, which stirre up our hearts to worship, if it be necessary in the Church, it must first be proven lawfull, both in the Church, and out of it. Now, if a man meeting his L. riding up the street upon his blake Horse, have his heart stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up to worship God, by something which he seeth either in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe or his Horse, should fall downe and kneele before him, or his Horse, as the active object of his worship: I marvell, whether the B. would give the man leave to kneele, and stand still as the active ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, before the mans sences? As for us, wee holde, that we may not kneele before every Creature, which stirreth up our hearts to worship God, kneele I say, whiles the eyes both of body and minde are fastened upon it as the active object of our Adoration.</p>
               <p>The fourth Reason, whereby I prove the kneeling in question, to be Idolatry, proceedeth thus. Kneeling in the act of receiving, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>13</label> for reverence to the Sacrament, is Idolatry. But the kneeling in question is such. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Proposition is necessary. For if they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite Divine Adoration (such as their kneeling is confessed to be,) for reverence of the Sacrament, they doe not onely give, but also intend to give Divine Adoration to the same. This is so undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that it dasheth <note n="h" place="margin">ubi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra pag 69.</note> 
                  <hi>B. Lindsey,</hi> and makes him give a broad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, that it is Idolatry to kneele at the Sacrament, for reverence to the Elements. The Assumption I prove from the Confession of Formalists. King <hi>Edwards</hi> Booke of common Prayer teacheth, that kneeling at the Communion is injoyned for this purpose, that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:3270:90"/>
the Sacrament might not be prophaned, but held in a reverent and holy estimation. So doth <note n="i" place="margin">partic. def. cap 3. sect. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Dr. Mortone</hi> tell us, that the reason wherefore the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath institute kneeling in the act of receiving the Sacrament, is, that thereby we might testify our due estimation of such holy Rites. <note n="k" place="margin">part 3. cap. 3. sect. 45.</note> 
                  <hi>Paybody</hi> makes one of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects of kneeling, to be the reverent handling and using of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. The <note n="l" place="margin">Serm. on <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 74 p. 991.</note> B. of <hi>Winchester</hi> exclaimeth against such as doe not kneel, for not regarding the Table of the Lord, which hath ever been thought of all holies the most holy, and for denying reverence to the holy Symboles, and pretious memorials of our greatest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery, even that reverence which is given to Prayer. Where, by the way I observe, that, when we kneel at Prayer, it is not to give reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Prayer, but to God whom then most immediately we adore, so that kneeling for reverence of the Sacrament, receiveth no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from kneeling at Prayer. The act of <hi>Perth</hi> about kneeling, when <hi>B. Lindsey</hi> had pollished and refined it as well as he could, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained us to kneele at the Sacrament, in due regard of so Divine a Mistery. And what think we is understood by this Mistery, for reverence whereof we are commanded to kneele? The <note n="m" place="margin">ubi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra pag. 72. 73.</note> B. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth this Mistery, to be the receiving of the body and blood of Christ. But here, he either meanes the spirituall receiving of the body and blood of Christ, or the Sacramentall. If the spirituall: why did not the Synod ordaine us to kneele in hearing the Gospell? for therein we receive spiritually the body and blood of Christ, and that as truly and really as in the Sacrament. Whereupon the <note n="n" place="margin">Ans. to the chall. of the reall pres. pag. 50. 51</note> Archbishop of <hi>Armagh</hi> sheweth, that the spirituall &amp; inward fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon the body and blood of Christ, is to be found out of the Sacrament, and that diverse of the Fathers doe applie the sixth of <hi>Iohn,</hi> to the hearing of the Word also; as <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus, Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen, Eusebius Caesariensis,</hi> &amp; others. <note n="o" place="margin">Epist. 141. ad Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarian.</note>

Now, the Sacramentall receiving of the body and blood of Christ, is the receiving of the Sacramentall Signes of his body and blood. And as the <note n="p" place="margin">ubi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra pag. 55.</note> Archbishop of <hi>Armagh</hi> also observeth, the substance which is outwardly delivered in the Sacrament, is not really the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and blood of Christ.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:3270:91"/>
soules. It remaineth therefore, that kneeling in due regard of the Sacramentall receiving of the body and blood of Christ, must be expounded to be kneeling in reverence of the Sacramentall Signes of Christs body and blood. And so <hi>Perths</hi> Canon, and the Bishops Commentary upon it, fall in with the rest of those Formalists ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before, avouching and defending kneeling for reverence to the Sacrament.</p>

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:3270:91"/>
are not in the usage of them, to take to our selves so much Scope and Liberty, as otherwise we may lawfully allow to our selves, in medling with such things, as are not merely, but mixedly Divine, and which are not from God so immediately as the other, but more by the intervention of means. And thus a higher degree of Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is due to the Sacrament, then to the Word preached, not by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ought from the Word, but by adding more respect to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament then the Word hath. The reason hereof is <note n="c" place="margin">Dido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clav. ubt su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra pag. 808.</note> given to be this, because when we come to the Sacrament, <hi>nihil hic humanum, sed Divina omnia,</hi> for Christs owne Words are, or at least should be spoken to us, when we receive the Sacrament, and the Elements also are by Christs owne Institution, holy Symboles of his blessed body and blood. Whereas the Word preached to us, is but mixedly and mediately Divine, and because of this intervention of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery of men, and mixture of their conceptions with the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures of God, we are bidden try the Spirits, and are required af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Example of the <hi>Baereans</hi> to search the Scriptures daily, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther these things which we heare preached, be so or not. Now wee are not in like sorte to try the Elements, and the Words of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, whether they be of God or not, because this is sure to all, who know out of Scripture the first Principles of the Oracles of God. The consideration hereof warneth us, that the Sacrament gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven according to Christs Institution, is more merely and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately Divine then is the Word preached. But others (I heare) object, that if a man should uncover his Head at the sight of a Graven Image, we would account this to be an adoring of the Image; and why then shall not we call our uncovering at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Adoration also? <hi>Ans.</hi> Though Veneration and Adoration be distinguished in holy things, to shew that Adoration given to them is Idolatry, but Veneration given to them is not Idolatry, yet in prophane things, such as Images are, Veneration given to them is Idolatry, as well as Adoration: and we are Idolaters for doing so much, as to respect and reverence them, as things sacred or holy. For as I touched before, and as <note n="d" place="margin">Lib. 1. de viti. ext. cult. oppos. Col. 504. 505.</note> 
                  <hi>Zanchius</hi> evidenceth by sundry instances, Idolatry is committed, when more estimation is had of any thing, more dignity and excellency placed in it, and more regard had to it, then God alloweth, or then can stand with Gods revealed will. For a thing thus regarded, though it be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, <hi>ut Deus simpliciter,</hi> yet it is set up, <hi>tanquam Deus ex parte.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now fiftly, if the kneeling in question be not Idolatrously refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Sacrament, I demand, whereunto is it specially intended? <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>15</label> we have heard the confession of some of our Opposites, (and those not of the smallest note,) avouching kneeling for reverence of the Sacrament. Neither can the Mistery spoken of in the Act of <hi>Perth</hi> (in due regard whereof, we are ordained to kneel,) be any other nor

the Sacrament. Yet because B. <hi>Lindsey,</hi> and some of his kynd, who desire to hide the foule shape of their Idolatry, with the trimmest fairding they can; will not take with kneeling in reverence of the Sacrament: let them shew us, which is the object, which they doe specially adore, when they kneele in the receiving of the same, for this their kneeling at this time, ariseth from another respect, then that which they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider in other parts of Gods worship, let two of our Prelats tell it out? The <note n="e" place="margin">Serm. at Perth As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semb.</note> Archbishop of <hi>Sainctandrewes</hi> would teach us out of <hi>Mouline,</hi> that we ought to adore the flesh of Iesus Christ in the Eucharist. The <note n="f" place="margin">ubi supra pag. 142.</note> B. of <hi>Edinbrugh</hi> also, will have us to worship the flesh and bloud of Christ in the Sacrament, because the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Christ is there present, beeing ever and every where joyned with the Divinity. But a twofold Idolatry may be here deprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. 1. In that they worship the flesh and bloud of Christ. 2. In that they worship the same in the Sacrament. As touching the first, albeit we may and should adore the man Christ with Divine worship, yet we may not adore his manhood, or his flesh and bloud. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause though the man Christ be God, yet his manhood is not God, and by consequence can not be honoured with Divine worship. 2. If adorability agree to the humanity of Christ, then may his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity help and save us: Idolaters are mocket by the spirit of God, for worshipping things which can not helpe nor save them. But the humanity of Christ, can not save us nor helpe us, because <hi>omnis actio est suppositi:</hi> whereas the humane nature of Christ is not <hi>suppositum.</hi> 3. None of those who defend the adoring of the humanity of Christ with Divine worship, doe well and warrantably expresse their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. First, some of the <note n="g" place="margin">Aquin. 3. q. 25. art. 2.</note> Schoolmen have found no other respect, wherefore the manhood of Christ can be said to be adored, except this, that the flesh of Christ is adored by him who adores the word incarnate, even as the Kings cloaths are adored by him who adores the King. And thus they make the flesh of Christ to be adored onely <hi>per accidens. Ego vero,</hi> saith the <note n="h" place="margin">De rep.

Clara ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos. artic. confess.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:3270:92"/>
is assumed into the unity of the person of the Sonne of God. (for otherwise if they meane, that the manhood is made a person, they are <hi>Nestorians,)</hi> that which they say, can not warrant the worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the manhood with Divine worship: because the manhood even after this assumption and hypostaticall union, &amp; being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered by us as now assumed into this personall union, is still for all that, a creature &amp; a distinct nature from the Godhead. (except we will be <hi>Eutychians;)</hi> so that it cannot yet be said to be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with Divine worship. <note n="k" place="margin">Of the Church lib. 5. cap. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Dr. Field</hi> layeth out a third way. For whiles he admitteh the phrase of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> who say not only concretively, that the man Christ is omnipresent but the humanity also; he forgeth a strange distinction. <hi>When we speake,</hi> saith he, <hi>of the humanity of Christ, sometimes we understand only that humane created essence of a man that was in him; sometimes all that, that is implied in the beeing of a man, as well subsistence as essence.</hi> By the same distinction would <hi>Field</hi> defend the attributing of the other Divine properties (and adorability among the rest) to the humane nature. But this distinction is no better, then if a man should say: by blacknesse sometimes we understand blacknesse, and sometimes whytenesse. Who ever confounded <hi>abstractum</hi> and <hi>Concretum,</hi> before that in <hi>Fields</hi> field they were made to stand for one? It is the Tenet of the Schoole, that though in God <hi>Concretum</hi> and <hi>abstractum</hi> differ not, because <hi>Deus</hi> and <hi>Deit as</hi> are the same, yet in creatures (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the manhood of Christ, is one,) they are realy differenced. For <note n="l" place="margin">Aquin. 1. q 13. art. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Concretum</hi> signifieth <hi>aliquid completum subsistens,</hi> and <hi>abstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum</hi> (such as humanity,) signifieth something, <hi>non ut subsistens, sed ut quo aliquid est,</hi> as whitenesse doth not signify that thing which is white, but that whereby it is white. How comes it then, that <hi>Field</hi> makes humanity in the abstract to have a subsistence. <note n="m" place="margin">Cent. Flosc. Tur. disput. Flosc. 26.</note>

               <p>There is yet a fourth sence remaining, which is <hi>Augustines,</hi> and theirs who speake with him. His sentence which our Opposites cite for them, is, that it is sinne not to adore the flesh of Christ: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit very erroneously he groundeth that which he saith upon those words of the <hi>Psalme, worship at his footstoole,</hi> taking this footstoole to be the flesh of Christ: Yet that his meaning was better then his expression &amp; that he meant not that adoration should be given to the flesh of Christ, but to the Godhead, whose footstoole the flesh is; it is plaine from those words which <hi>Burgesse</hi> 
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Of the lawf. of kneel. cap. 23 p. 88.</note> himself citeth out of him. <hi>To whatsoever earth</hi> i. e. <hi>flesh of Christ, thou bowest and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratest thy self: looke not on it as earth,</hi> i. e <hi>as flesh, but looke at that holy one whose footstoole it is that thou doest adore,</hi> i. e. <hi>looke to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:3270:93"/>
of Christ, whose flesh thou doest adore in the misteries.</hi> Wherefore if we would give any sound sence to their words, who say that the flesh of Christ is to be adored, we must note with <note n="o" place="margin">Synt. l. 6. c. 16. col. 125.</note> 
                  <hi>A.

               <p n="1">1. That though this forme of speaking, which saith that the flesh of Christ is to be adored, being thus expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, receiveth a sound sence, yet the expression is very bad, and violence is done to the phrase, when such a meaning is drawne out of it. For how can we by the flesh of Christ understand his Godhead? the communion of properties, admitteth us to put the man Christ for God, but not his manhood. And <note n="p" place="margin">Eccl. pol. lib. 5. s. 55.</note> 
                  <hi>Hooker</hi> teacheth rightly, <hi>that by force of union, the properties of both natures</hi> (and by consequence, adorability, which is a propertie of the Divine nature,) <hi>are imputed to the person only, in whom they are, and not what belongeth to the one nature, really conveyed or translated into the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet our Kneelers who say they adore the flesh of Christ in the Sacrament, have no such Orthodox (though forced) meaning, whereby to expound themselves. For <note n="q" place="margin">Vbi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra.</note> 
                  <hi>B. Lindsey</hi> will have us in receiving the Sacrament, to bow our knees &amp; adore the humanity of Christ, by reason of the personall union that it hath with the Godhead. <hi>Ergo,</hi> he meanes that we should, &amp; may adore with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worship, that which is personally united with the Godhead. And what is that? not the Godhead sure: but the created nature of the manhood: (which not being God, but a creature only, can not without I dolatry be worshipped with Divine worship.) I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore, that by the flesh of Christ, which he will have to be adored in the Sacrament, he understands not the Godhead, as <hi>Augustine</hi> doth, but that created nature which is united with the Godhead.</p>
               <p>But 2. as we have seene what is to be thought of worshipping the flesh of Christ, so let us next consider, what may be thought <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>XVI</label> of worshipping his flesh in the Sacrament; for this was the other head which I proposed. Now, they who worship the flesh of Christ in the Sacrament, must either consider it, as present in the Sacrament, &amp; in that respect to be there adored, because of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall union of it with the Word, or else because of the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall union of it with the outward Signe, which is a respect super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to that of the ubiquity of it in the person of the Word. First then, touching the former of those respects, the personal union of the flesh with the word, can neither inferre the presence of the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:3270:93"/>
flesh in the Sacrament, to those who worthily receive; nor yet can it make any thing for the adoration of the flesh. Not the former; for in respect of the ubiquity of the flesh in the person of the word, it is ever and alike present with the Communicants, whether they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive worthily, or not, &amp; with the Bread &amp; Wine, whether they be consecrated to be signes of his body and bloud or not. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Divines rightly hold <note n="r" place="margin">Zanch. tom. 8. col. 521.</note> 
                  <hi>presentiam corporis Christi in coena, non ab ubiquitate, sed a verbis Christi pendere.</hi> Not the latter neither; for (as I have shewed already) notwithstanding of the personall union, yet the flesh of Christ remaineth a creature, and is not God, and so can not at all bee worshipped with Divine worship. And if his flesh could be at all so worshipped, <note n="*" place="margin">We adore Christ as well in the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Gospell and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baptisme, as in the Sacrament of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, <hi>saith Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright on 1.

For ever and alwayes, is the flesh of Christ personally united with the Word, &amp; in that respect present to us. There remaineth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nothing but that other respect of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall union of the flesh of Christ with the Sacramentall Signe, which they can have for worshipping his flesh in the Sacrament. Whereas <note n="s" place="margin">Vbi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra.</note> 
                  <hi>B. Lindsey</hi> saith, <hi>that it is no errour, to beleeve the spirituall powerfull &amp; personall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Christs body at the Sacrament, and in that respect to worship his flesh &amp; bloud there.</hi> He meanes (sure) some speciall respect, for which it may be said, that Christs body is present at the Sacrament, (so as it is not present out of the Sacrament,) and in that respect to be there adored. Now Christs body is spiritually and powerfully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to us in the Word (as I shewed before,) yea as often as looking by faith upon his body broken, and bloud shed for us, we receive the sence &amp; assurance of the remission of our sinnes through his merites: and as for this personall presence of Christs body, which he speaketh of, I have shewed also, that the adoring of the flesh of Christ in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, can not be inferred upon it; Wherefore he can tell us nothing, which may be thought to inferre the presence of Christs flesh in the Sacrament, and the adoration of it in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, save onely the Sacramentall union of it with the outwarde Signe. Now adoration in this respect &amp; for this reason, must sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the bodily presence of Christs flesh in the Sacrament.

               <p>Further, it is to be remembered (which I have also before <note n="x" place="margin">Supra Sect. 13.</note> noted out of Dr. <hi>Vsher)</hi> that the Sacramentall presence of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ, or that presence of it which is inferred upon the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall union which is betwixt it and the outward Signe, is not the reall or spirituall presence of it, (for in this maner, it is present to us out of the Sacrament, even as oft as by faith we apprehend it and the vertue thereof,) but it is figuratively only so called, the sence beeing this, that the body of Christ is present and given to us in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, meaning by his body the Signe of his body. These things being so, whosoever worshippeth Christs body in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist, &amp; that in respect of the Sacramentall presence of it in the same, can not choose but hold that Christs body is bodily and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally under the species of the bread, and so fall into the Idolatry of bread-worship; or else <note n="y" place="margin">Zanch. lib. 1. de viti. ext. cult. oppos. col. 504.</note> our Divines have not rightly convinced the Papists, as Idolatrous worishppers of the bread in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist, for as much as they attribute to it, that which it is not, nor hath not, to wit, that under the accidents thereof is contained substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially the true &amp; living body of Christ, joyned and united to his Godhead. What can <hi>B. Lindsey</hi> now answer for himselfe, except he say with <note n="z" place="margin">Marc Ant. de Dom. oste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. error Fr.

Why should I blot paper with such a vanity, which implyeth a contradiction, bodily and not bodily, spiritually and not spiritually?</p>
               <p>The sixt and last Argument, whereby I prove the kneeling in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion to be Idolatry, is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the nature &amp; kind of the worship <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>17</label> wherein it is used. For the receiving of the Sacrament being a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate worship of God, wherein the Elements come between God &amp; us, in such sort, that they belong to the substance of the worship, (for without the Elements, the Sacrament is not a Sacrament,) and withall are susceptive of coadoration, for as much as in the act of receiving, both our mindes, and our externall sences, are and should be fastened upon them: hereby we evince the Idolatry of kneeling in the receiving. For in every mediate worship, wherein some crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is purposely set betweene God &amp; us to have state in the same, it
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:3270:94"/>
is Idolatry to kneel before such a creature, whiles both our minds &amp; sences are fastened upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it. Our Opposites have raked many things together, to infringe this Argument. First <note n="a" place="margin">Burg. of the lawf. of kneel. cap. 32. p. 113.

                  <hi>B. Lindsey</hi> indeed would prove from 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 6. 12, 13, and <hi>Mic.</hi> 6, 6. that the people bowed before the Altar and the Offering. But the first of those places, speakes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of kneeling before the Altar, but only of kneeling before the Congregation, that is, in sight of the Congregation. And if <hi>Solomon</hi> had then kneeled before the Altar, yet the Altar had beene but occasionally and accidentally before him in his adoration, for to what end &amp; use could he have purposely set the Altar before him, whiles he was kneeling and praying? The place of <hi>Micah</hi> can not prove, that Gods people did kneel before the offerings at all, (for it speakes only of bowing before God,) farre lesse, that they kneeled before them in the very act of offering, and that with their minds and sences fixed upon them, as we kneel in the very act of receiving the Sacrament, and at that instant when our minds and sences are fastened upon the signes, that we may discerne the things signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by them, for the exercising of our hearts in a thankfull medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the Lords death. 2. As for the other examples here alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, God was immediatly present, in and-with the Arke, the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the holy Mountaine, the Bush, the Cloud, and the Fire which came from Heaven, speaking and manifesting himself to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by his owne immediate voice, and miraculous extraordinary presence: So that worshipping before these things had the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son which makes <note n="c" place="margin">Apoc. 4. 10.</note> the 24 Elders in Heaven worship before the Throne. For in these things, God did immediatly manifest his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, as well as in heaven. Though there be a difference in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of the immediate manifestation of his presence in Earth, and in Heaven, yet <hi>magn &amp; minus non variant speciem.</hi> Now God is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in the Sacrament, not extraordinarily, but in the way of an ordinary dispensation, not immediatly but mediatly. They must therefore alledge some commendable examples of such a kneeling as we dispute about, in a mediate and ordinary worship, else they say nothing to the point.</p>
               <p>Yet to no better purpose <note n="d" place="margin">B. Linds. ubi supra, pag. 76.</note> they tell us, that when God spake, <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>Abraham</hi> fell on his face. And when the fire came downe at <hi>Elijas</hi> prayen, the people fell on their faces. What is this to the purpose? And how shall kneeling in a mediat and ordinary worship, be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by kneeling in the hearing of Gods owne immediate voice, or in seeing the miraculous signes of his extraordinary presence?
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:3270:95"/>
Howbeit it can not be proved, neither, that the people fell on their faces in the very act of seeing the fire fall, (when their eyes and their mindes were fastened upon it,) but that after they had seene the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle wrought, they so considered of it, as to fall downe and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God.</p>
               <p>But further, it is objected, <note n="e" place="margin">Ibid. pag. 91.</note> 
                  <hi>that a poenitentiary kneels to God pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely before the Congregation, and with a respect to the Congregation, &amp;c. When we come to our common Tables before we eate, tither fitting with our heads discovered, or standing, or kneeling, we give thanks and blesse, with a respect to the meate, which is purposely set on Table, &amp;c. The Pastor when he begins the holy action, hath the bread and the cup set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, purposely, upon the Table, and with respect to them, hee gives thankes, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Though a poenitentiary kneele to God purposely in the presence and sight of the congregation, that he may make knowne to them his repentance for the sinne whereby he hath scandalized them; yet is the confessing of his sinne to God kneeling there upon his knees, a immediate worship, neither doth the Congregation come betwixt him and God, as belonging to the substance of this worship, for he kneeleth to God, as well, and maketh confession of his sinne, when the Congregation is not before him. But I suppose our kneelers themselves will confesse, that the Elements come so betwixt God and them, when they kneele, that they belong to the essence of the worship in hand, and that they would not, nor could not worship the flesh and bloud of Christ in the Sacrament, if the Elements were not before them.</p>
               <p>To be short, the case of a poenitentiary standeth thus, that not in his kneeling <hi>simpliciter,</hi> but in his kneeling publikely and in sight of the Congregation, he setteth them before him, purposely, and with a respect to them: Whereas our kneelers doe kneele in such sort, that their kneeling <hi>simpliciter,</hi> and without an adjection or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct, hath a respect to the Elements purposely set before them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would they at all kneele, for that end and purpose for which they doe kneele, namely, <note n="f" place="margin">Vbi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra, sect. 15.</note> for worshipping the flesh and bloud of Christ in the Sacrament, except the Elements were before the eyes both of their mindes and bodies; as the poenitentiary doth kneele, for making confession of his sinne to God, when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation is not before him.</p>
               <p>And if one would say, that in kneeling at the Sacrament he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippeth not the flesh and bloud of Christ, but the Lord his God only, yet is the same difference to be put betwixt his kneeling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Elements, &amp; the kneeling of a poenitentiary before the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation: For the very kneeling it self (simply considered) before the Elements, respecteth them as then purposely set in our sight, that we may kneele before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: whereas in the case of the poenitentiary,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:3270:95"/>
it is not his kneeling to confesse his sinne to God, which hath a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the Congregation as set in his sight for that purpose; But some cirumstances of his kneeling only, to wit, <hi>When?</hi> At that time when the Congregation is assembled; And <hi>where?</hi> Publikely in sight of the Congregation. In regard of these circumstances, he hath the Congregation purposely in his sight, &amp; so respecteth them; But in regard of the kneeling it self simply, the presence of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is but accidentall to him who kneeleth, &amp; confesseth his sinne before God. As touching giving thankes before the meate set on our common Tables, though a man should doe it kneeling, yet this speaketh not home to the point now in controversy, except a man so kneele before his meat, that he have a religious respect to it, as a thing separated from a common use and made holy, and likewise have both his minde &amp; his externall sences of seeing, touching, &amp; tasting fastened upon it in the act of his kneeling. And if a man should thus kneele before his meate, he were an Idolater.</p>
               <p>Lastly, giving thankes before the Elements of Bread &amp; Wine, in the beginning of the holy action, is as farre from the purpose: For this giving of thanks, is an immediate worship of God, wherein we have our minds &amp; sences not upon the Bread &amp; Wine, as upon things which have a state in that worshippe of the Lords Supper, &amp; belong to the substance of the same, (for the very consecration of them to this use, is but then <hi>in fieri,)</hi> but we worship God imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by prayer and giving of thankes: Which is all otherwise in the act of receiving.</p>
               <p>Moreover <note n="g" place="margin">Paybody part. 3. cap. 3. Sect. 4.</note> it is objected out of <hi>Levit. 9. 24. 2. Chron.</hi> 7. 3. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>XIX</label> 
                  <hi>Mie. 6. 6. 2 Chron.</hi> 29. 28. 29. 30. that all the people fell on their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, before the legall Sacrifices, when the fire consumed the burnt-offering.</p>
               <p>Whereunto it may be answered, that the fire which came from God, and consumed the burnt offerings, was one of the miraculous Signes of Gods extraordinary and immediate presence, (as I have said before,) and therefore kneeling before the same, hath nothing to doe with the present purpose.</p>
               <p>But if we will particularly consider all these places, we finde in the first two, that beside the fire, the glory of the Lord did also ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in a more miraculous &amp; extraordinary maner, <hi>Levit. 9. 23. The glory of the Lord appeared to all the people. 2 Chron. 7. 1. 12. The glory of the Lord filled the house.</hi> They are therefore running at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, who take hold of those places, to drawout of them the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of kneeling in a mediate and ordinary worship.</p>
               <p>The place of <hi>Micah</hi> I have answered before: And here I adde, that though it could be proved from that place, (as it cannot,) that the people both bowed before the offerings, &amp; that in the very act of offering, yet how shall it be proved, that in the act of their kneeling,
<pb facs="tcp:3270:96"/>
they had the offerings purposely before them, and their minds &amp; sences fixed upon them, in the very instant of their worshipping.</p>
               <p>This I make clearer by the last place, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. out of which no more can be drawne, but that the people worshipped, whiles the Priests were yet offering the burnt-offering. Now the burnt-offering was but accidentally before the people in their worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and only because it was offered at the same time when the song of the Lord was soung. <hi>Vers.</hi> 27. Such was the foreward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of zeale in restoring Religion, &amp; in purging the Temple, that it admitted no stay, but eagerly prosecuted the worke, till it was perfected, therefore the thing was done suddenly, <hi>Vers.</hi> 36. Since then the Song and the Sacrifice were performed at the same time, we must note that the people worshipped at that time, not because of the Sacrifice which was a mediate worship, but because of the Song of the Lord, which was an immediat worship. Now we all commend kneeling in an immediat worship. But this can not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our Opposites, they will needs have it lawfull to kneel in the hearing of the Word, purposely and with a respect to the Word preached, (though this be a mediat worship only. <note n="h" place="margin">Paybo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ibid. Sect. 5.</note> Their warrants are taken out of <hi>Exod. 4. 30. 31. Exod. 12. 27. 2 Chron. 20. 18. Matth.</hi> 17. 6. From the first three places no more can be inferred, but that these hearers bowed their heads &amp; worshipped, after that they had heard the Word of the Lord; Neither shall they ever warrant bowing and worshipping in the act of hearing.</p>
               <p>In the fourth place we reade, that the Disciples fell on their faces when they heard Gods owne immediate voice out of the Cloud: What maketh this for falling downe to worship at the hearing of the Word preached by men? How long shall our Opposites not distinguish betwixt mediate and immediate worship?</p>

                     </gap>t. 2 cap. 1. Sect. 7.</note> it is alledged, that God in his Word allowes not only kneeling at Prayer, but also at Circumcision, Passeover, &amp; Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme. The reason of this assertion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is given to be this, that a bodily gesture being necessary, God not determining man upon any one, leaves him at plaine liberty. <hi>Ans</hi> Whether we be left at plaine liberty in all things which being in the generall necessary, &amp; are not parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly determined in Gods Word; it shall betreated of else-where in this Dispute. In the meane time, whatsoever liberty God leaves man in bodily gestures, he leaves him no liberty of an unlawfull and Idolatrous gesture, such as kneeling in the instant of receiving a Sacrament, when not only we have the outward Signe purposely before us, &amp; our mindes and sences fastened upon it, for discerning the signification thereof, &amp; the Analogie betwixt it and the thing signified; but also looke upon it as an Image of Christ, or as a vica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious signe standing there in Christs stead. The Indifferency of such a gesture, in such a mediate worship, should have beene proved,

before such a rule (as this here given us for a reason,) had been applied to it.</p>
               <p>But the kneelers would yet make more adoe to us, and be still <label type="milestone">

                     </gap> Iren. lib. 1. cap. 1.</note> one of our Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours objecteth, that we lift up our eyes and our hands to heaven, and worship God, yet doe not worship the heaven: that a man going to bed, prayeth before his bed: that <hi>David,</hi> offered the Sacrifices of thanksgiving, in the presence of all the people, <hi>Psal.</hi> 116. that <hi>Paul</hi> having taken bread gave thankes, before all them who were in the ship <hi>Act.</hi> 27. 35. that the Israelits worshipped before <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Exod.</hi> 4, 31. Hereupon <note n="l" place="margin">Ios. Hall. Apol. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Brown Sect. 36.</note> another Dr. harping on the same string, tells us, that when we kneel in the act of receiving the Sacrament, <hi>We kneel no more to bread, then to the pulpit, when we joyne our prayers with the ministers.</hi> Oh, unworthy instances, and reproachfull to Doctours! All these things were and are acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally present to the worshippers, and not purposely before them, not respected as hauing a religious state in the worship. What? doe we worship before the bread in the Sacrament, even as before a Pulpit, a bed, &amp;c? Nay, graduate men should understand better what they speake off.</p>
               <p>Another objection is, <note n="m" place="margin">D. Forb. ubi supra.</note> what a man who is admitted to the office of a Pastor, and receiveth in position of hands, kneeleth still on his knees, till the ordination be ended the rest about him being standing or sitting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Kneeling in receiving imposition of hands, which is joyned with prayer and invocation, hath nothing adoe with kneeling in a mediate worship, for in this case a man kneels, because of the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate worship of invocation: But when there is no prayer, I suppose no man will kneel religiously, and with a religious respect to those persons or things which are before him, as there purposely in his sight, that before them he may adore, which is the kind of kneeling now in Question,) or if any did so, there were more need to give him instruction then ordination.</p>
               <p>It is further told us, that <note n="n" place="margin">D.

But how long shall simple ones love simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or rather, scorners hate knowledge?

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:3270:97"/>
consideration of that which is signified, and of the representation thereof by the signe: Our sences by seeing, handling, breaking, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, eating, drinking?</p>
               <p>Thus we see that in all these examples alledged by our Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites, there is nothing to prove the lawfullnesse of kneeling, in such <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>21</label> a mediate worship, wherein something belonging to the substance of the worship comes between God and us, and is not accidentally but purposely before us, upon which also our minds and sences in the action of worship are fast fixed. Howbeit there is another respect, wherefore none of these examples can make ought for kneeling in the act of receiving the Sacrament, (which I haue shewed before,) namely, that in the instant of receiving the Sacrament, the Elements are actually Images and vicarious Signes standing in Christs stead. But belike our kneelers have not satisfied themselves with the rouing table of these impertinent allegations, which they have produced to prove the lawfullnesse of kneeling in a mediate worship, they have prepared another refuge for themselves, which had been needlesse, if they had not feared, that the former ground should faile them.</p>
               <p>What then will they say next to us? Forsooth, that when they kneel in the act of receiving they are praying and praising, and so worshipping God immediately. And if we would know, what a man doth then pray for, it is told us, <note n="s" place="margin">Dr. Forb. ubi supra.</note> that he is praying and earnestly crying to God <hi>vt eum faciat dignum convivam.</hi> To us it seemes very strange how a man when he is actually a banqueter, and at the instant of his communicating, can be made in any other sort a ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queter, then he is, <hi>for quicquid est, dum est non potest non esse.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if a man in the instant of his receiving, be an vnworthy ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queter, he can not at that instant, be made any other then he is.</p>
               <p>The truth is, we can not lawfully be either praying or praising in the very act of receiving, because our hearts and mindes should <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>22</label> then be exercised in meditating vpon Christs death, and the inaestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble benefites which comes to us thereby. 1. <hi>Cor. 11. 24. Doe this in remembrance of me.</hi>

               <p>This remembrance is described <hi>vers. 26.

And by the contrary, if meditation be entertained, as it should be, it admitteth not prayer to have place at that time. For it is wel <note n="x" place="margin">Didect. Alt.

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Why did he not prove his proposition? Thought he his bare assertion should suffice? Gods Word is a spirituall benefit, which we should receive with spirituall hunger and thirst, yet the B. will not say, that we should be praying all the while we are hearing and receiving it, for then could not our minds be attentive. His proposition therefore is false. For though prayer should goe before the receiving of such a spirituall benefit as the Word or the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet we should not pray in the act of receiving. For how can the heart attend by serious consideration, what we heare in the Word, or what is signified and given to us in the Sacrament, if in the actions of hearing the Word, and receiving the Sacrament, it should be elevated out of the world by prayer?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Why saith he, that prayer is nothing else but a Spirituall appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite or desire? He thought hereby to strengthen his proposition, but we deny all. <note n="z" place="margin">Ibid. p. 101.</note> He said before, that every prayer is a meditation and here he saith, that prayer is nothing else but a spirituall desire. These are vncouth descriptions of Prayer. Prayer is not meditation, because meditation is a communing with our owne soules, Prayer a communing with God: Nor yet can it be said, that Prayer is nothing else; but a spirituall desire; for Prayer is the sending up of our desires to God, being put in order.</p>
               <p>He speeds no better in proving that we should receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>24</label> with thanksgiving. <hi>Whatsoever benefit;</hi> saith he, <hi>we should receive by extolling and preaching, and magnifying and praising the inaestimable worth and excellency thereof, the same we ought to receive with thanksgiving. But in the Sacrament we</hi> should receive the bloud of Christ with <hi>extolling and preaching, &amp;c.</hi> The assumption he confirmes by the words of our Saviour: <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me.</hi> And by the words of S. <hi>Paul: So</hi> oft as ye <hi>shall eate this Bread and drinke this Cup, ye shall declare, that is extell, magnify, and praise the Lords death, till he come againe.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:3270:98"/>
Answ.</hi> His assumption is false, neither can his proofs make it true.</p>
               <p>First, we remember Christ in the act of receiving, by meditation, and not by praise.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We shew forth the Lords death in the act of receiving, by using the Signes and Symboles of his body broken and his bloud shed for us, and by meditating vpon his death thereby repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We deny not that by praise we shew forth the Lords death also, but this is not in the act of receiving. It is to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with <note n="a" place="margin">Vbi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>Pareus,</hi> that the shewing forth of the Lords death, must not be restricted to the act of receiving the Sacrament, because we doe also shew forth his death, by the preaching of the Gospell, and by private and publike celebration of it, yea by a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall study of sanctification and thankfullnesse. So that the shewing forth of the Lords death, by extolling, preaching, magnifying and praising the same, according to the 23. <hi>Sect. Of the Confession of faith,</hi> to which his Argument hath reference, may not be expounded of the very act of receiving the Sacrament. Neither doe the words of the Institution refuse, but easily admit another shewing forth of the Lords death, then that which is in the very act of receiving. For the word is not <hi>quando,</hi> but <hi>quoties.</hi> It is only sayd, <hi>as often as ye eat this breed and drinke this cup ye doe shewe &amp;c.</hi> Which words can not be taken, only of the instant of eating and drinking.</p>

               </p>
               <p>To these words the D. gives this sence; That many withdrew themselves, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they came to the celebration of the Supper, because the body of our Lord, that is, the Sacramentall Bread, beeing taken of the Ministers hand, the station. i. e. standing must be dissolved and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Which can have no reason but this, that taking the holy things at the Table standing, yet they used not to partake them. i. e. eate the Bread or drinke the Wine, in any other gesture, then what was on the Station dayes then forbidden, kneeling: And that <hi>Tertullian</hi> wishes them to come, though they might not then kneele, and to take the Bread in publike, standing at the Table, and reserve it, and carry it away with them, and receive it at their owne howses, as they desired, kneeling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The D. by this glosse puts a weapon in our hands against himself, for if when they had taken the Bread of the Ministers hand, their standing was to be left and dissolved, and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending to them another gesture in eating of the Bread, not stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, then whether vrgeth he that other gesture to be used in the publicke eating of the bread, or in the private? Not in the private: for his advice of reserving and eating it in private, commeth after, and is only put for a remedy or next best, in case they would not condeseend to this course in publicke, <hi>quod statio Solvenda sit accepto corpore Domini.</hi> Needs then, it must be understood of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicke. Now, if in the publicke eating of the bread, Standing was to be left; Which gesture was to come in place of it? Not Kneeling.</p>
               <p>For 1. <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith <note n="e" place="margin">De coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na militis.</note> elsewhere: <hi>Diebus dominicis Iejunare nefas ducimus, vel de geniculis adorare: eadem immunitate a die Paschae ad Pentecosten usque gaudemus.</hi>

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:3270:99"/>
well, the D. hath unhappily raised this spirit, to disquiet himself: let him bethinke how to lay him againe. If he can not, J wil assay to make some help, and to lay him in this fashion. The station dayes were not the Lords dayes, together with those 50 betwixt Easter and Pentecost, (on which both fasting and kneeling were forbidden,) as the D. thinketh, but they were certaine set dayes of fasting. For they appointed the fourth and fixt day of the weeke, (that is wednesday and fryday) for their Stations, as <note n="f" place="margin">de Iejun. cap. 2. &amp; 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Tertulian</hi> saith: whose words we may understand, by another place of <note n="g" place="margin">Haeres. 75.</note> 
                  <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> who writeth that the Fast of the fourth, and the sixt day, was kept throughout all the Churches, and held to be an Apostolicall constitution. Howbeit herein they did erre: for to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a certaine time of fasting to be kept by the wholle Church, agreeth not with Christian liberty, and wanteth the example of Christ and his Apostles, as <note n="h" place="margin">hist. eccl. cent. 4. lib. 2 cap. 22. p. 150.</note> 
                  <hi>Osiander</hi> noteth. Alwayes we see, what was meant by Station dayes, to wit, their set dayes of 150 fasting, which were called Station dayes, by a speech borrowed from a military custome, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> teacheth. For as Souldiers kept those times and places, which were appointed for their wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and fasted all the while they continued in these watches: so did Christians upon their station dayes, resort and meet in the place appointed, and there remained falting till their station dissolved. The Dr. taketh upon him to confute those, who understand by the Station dayes set dayes of fasting. But all which he alledgeth to the contrary, is that he findeth some where in <hi>Tertullian, Statio</hi> and <hi>Iejunia</hi> put for different things. Now this helpeth him not, except he could find that <hi>Statio,</hi> and <hi>Stata Iejunia</hi> are put for different things. For no man taketh the Stations to have beene occasionall, but only set fasts. Touching the meaning then of the words alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the D. (to give him his owne reading of them, howbeit some read otherwise,) thus we take it. There were many who came not to the Sacrament upon the Station dayes, because (in their opin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) the receiving thereof should break the Station i. e. the service of the day, and that because it should breake their Fast, a principall duty of the same. <hi>Tertullian</hi> sheweth, they were in an errour, because their partaking of the Sacrament should not breake their Station, but make it the more solemne and remarkable. But if they could not be drawne from that false persuasion of theirs, that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should breake their Fast, yet he wisheth them at least to come, and stand at the Table, and receive the Sacrament into their hands, and take it away to eate it after, (for permitting whereof he had no warrant,) So should they both partake the Sacrament, and also (according to their mind, and to their full contentment,) keep their Stations; which were often prorogated <note n="i" place="margin">Magd. cent. 3. cap. 6. col. 135.</note> till even, but ever and at least <note n="k" place="margin">Epiphan. vbi supra.</note> till the ninth houre. Finally from this place, which the D. perverteth for kneeling, it appeareth that the gesture
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:3270:99"/>
or posture in receiving the Sacrament, used in that place, where <hi>Tertullian</hi> lived, was standing because speaking of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Sacrament, he saith, <hi>si &amp; ad aram Dei Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the rest of the testimonies, <note n="l" place="margin">Vbi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra cap. 22 &amp; 23.</note> 
                  <hi>D. Burgesse</hi> produceth out of <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>27</label> the Fathers for kneeling, I need not insist upon them; For either they speake of the inward adoration of the heart, which we ought to direct unto Christ, when we receive the Sacrament, (and this none of us denieth,) or else they speake of adoring the Sacrament: where by the word <hi>Adoration,</hi> we may not understand any Divine worship, inward or outward, but a reverence of another nature, called <hi>Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> That this (which we denie not neither,) and no more is meant by the Fathers, when they speake of the adoration of the Sacrament. <note n="m" place="margin">Rep.

                  <hi>Antonius de Dominis</hi> sheweth more copiously. And thus we have suffered the impetuous current of the Doctours audacious promises, backed with a verball discourse, to goe softly by us <hi>Quid dignum tanto tulit hic promissor hiatu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, if any be curious to know what gesture the auncient Church did use in the receiving of the Eucharist. To such I say, first <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>28</label> of all, that <note n="n" place="margin">Alt. Da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. p. 784.</note> Didoclavius maintaineth, that which none of our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posites are able to infringe, namely, that no testimony can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced which may evince, that ever kneeling was used before the time of <hi>Honorius</hi> the 3. neither is it lesse truely observed by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of <note n="o" place="margin">Lib. 1. cap. 1.</note> the History of the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> that bowing of the knees before the Hoste, was then only enjoyned, when the opinion of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation got place.</p>
               <p>Next I say, the auncient gesture, where of we read most frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, was standing. <note n="p" place="margin">In Eph. 1 Serm. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Chrysostome</hi> complaining of few communicants, saith: <hi>Frustra habetur quotidiana oblatio: Frustra stamus ad altare: nemo est qui simul participet.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, I say, since we all know, that the Primitive Christians did take the holy Communion, mixedly and together with their <hi>Love-Feasts,</hi> 
                  <note n="s" place="margin">Paréus in 1 Cor. 11. 21. &amp; Calb. ibid.</note> in imitation of Christ, who whileas he did eate his other Supper, did also institute the Eucharist. And since (as <note n="t" place="margin">Cartwr. in 1. Cor. 11. Sect. 6</note> it is observed from 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 21. 33.) there was a twofold abuse in the <hi>Church of Corinth: One in their Love-Feasts, whileas that which should have served for the knitting of the knot of love, was used to out the cords there of, in that every one (as him best liked) made choice of such as he would have to sit at Table with him (the other either not
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:3270:100"/>
tarried for, or shut out when they came, especially the Poore,) The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abuse (pulled in by the former,) was, for that those which were companions at one Table in the common Feast, communicated also in the sacred, with the same separation, and severally from the rest of the Church (and the poore especially,) which was in their former Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since also we reade; that the same custome of joyning the Lords-Supper together with common Feasts continued long after. For <note n="o" place="margin">Lib. 5. cap. 22.</note>

(Of which things I am to speake afterward;) What doth hinder us to gather in like maner, that for as much as those Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Christians, did take the Lords Supper, whiles they did eate their owne Love-Feasts, therefore they sate at the one as well as at the other?

Eccl. lib. 5. cap. num. 48.</note> Our Opposites defend that <note place="margin">c Apol. for kneel. part. 3. cap. 2. sect. 15.</note> the Church hath pover to ordaine such Ceremonies, as by admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing men of their duty, and by expressing such spirituall and heavenly affections, dispositions, motions, or desires, as should be in men, doe thereby stirre them up to greater fervor &amp; devotion.</p>
               <p>But against the lawfullnesse of such misticall and significant Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, thus we dispute, first, a cheif part of the nature of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is given unto those Ceremonies, when they are in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner appointed to teach by their signification. This reason being alledged by the abridgment of the <hi>Lincolne</hi> Ministers, <note n="e" place="margin">4 pol. part 3. cap. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Paybody</hi> answereth, that it is not a bare signification that makes a thing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate of the Sacraments nature, but such a signification as is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall, both in what is signified and how. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This is but to begge the question, for what other thing is alledged by us, but that a Sacramentall signification is placed in those Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies we speake of? 2. What calls he a Sacramentall signification, if a misticall resemblance and representation of some spirituall grace which God hath promised in his Word, be not it. And that such a signification as this is placed in the Ceremonies, I have allready made it plaine; from the testimonies of our Opposites. This (sure) makes those Ceremonies, so to encroach upon the confines and <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> praecincts of the nature and quality of Sacraments, that they usurpe something more then any Rites which are not appointed by God himself can rightly doe. And if they be not Sacraments, yet saith <note n="f" place="margin">Eccl pol. lib. 4. sect. 1.</note>

               </p>
               <p>And here, beside that which <hi>Ames</hi> hath said against him, J adde that these two things, 1. That this distinction can not be conceived, which the Dr. maketh betwixt the Signes of Divine things, and the Signes of Holy things.</p>
               <p>2. That his other distinction can as little be conceived, which impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that the name of Sacraments, belongeth to Divine things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, and to all Signes of Holy things unproperly.</p>
               <p>Lastly, if we call to mind that which hath been evinced before, namely, that the Ceremonies are not only thought, to be mistically significant, for setting forth and expressing certaine spirituall gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but also operative and availeable to the begetting of those gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in us, if not by the worke wrought, at least by the worke of the worker; for example that the Signe of the Crosse, is not only thought by our Opposites, to signify that at no time we should be ashamed of the ignominy of Christ, but is also esteemed <note n="h" place="margin">Supra cap. 4. Sect. 4.</note> to be a meane to worke our preservation from shame, and a most effectual teacher, to avoid that which may deservedly procure shame: And that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopping is not only thought, to be a Signe for certifying young children of Gods favour, and good will towards them; but also an exhibitive Signe, whereby <note n="i" place="margin">Ibid. Sect. 5.</note> they receive strength against sinne and tentation, and are assisted in all vertue.</p>
               <p>If these things, I say, we call to mind, it will be more manifest, that the Ceremonies are given out for sacred Signes of the verie same nature that Sacraments are off. For the Sacraments are called by Divines, commemorative, representative, and exhibitive Signes; and such Signes are also the Ceremonies we have spoken of in the opinion of Formalites.</p>
               <p>Misticall and significant Ceremonies, (to proceed to a second reason) ordained by men, can be no other but meere delusions, and <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> serve only to feed mens minds with vaine conceits. For to what other purpose doe <hi>Signa instituta</hi> serve, if it be not in the power of him who gives them institution, to give, or to worke that which is signified by them?</p>
               <p>Now, it is not in the power of Prelats, nor of any man living, to give us these graces, or to worke them in us, which they will have to be signified by their Misticall and Symbolicall Ceremonies.

               <p>Thirdly, to introduce significant sacred Ceremonies into the <label type="milestone">

               </p>
               <p>Lastly, we will consider the purpose of Christ, whiles he said to the Pharises, <note n="q" place="margin">Luc. 16. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>The Law and the Prophets were vntill Iohn: from that time the Kingdome of God is preached.</hi> He had in the Parable of the unjust Steward, and in the application of the same, spoken somewhat contemptibly of riches: Which when the Pharises heard, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided him, and that for this pretended reason (as is evident from the answer which is returned unto them,) because the Law promises the worlds goods, as rewards and blessings to the people of God, that by the temporall things, which are set forth for types and shaddowes of aeternall things, they might be instructed, helped and ledde as it were by the hand, to the contemplation, desire and exspectation of those heavenly and aeternall things, which are not seene. Now, Christ did not only rip up the hypocrisy of their hearts, <hi>Vers.</hi> 15. but also gave a formall answer to their praetended reason, by shewing them how the Law is by him perfected, <hi>Vers.</hi> 16. yet not destroyed, <hi>Vers.</hi> 17. Then, will we observe how he teacheth, that the Law and the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:3270:102"/>
Prophets are perfected, and so our point shall be plaine. <hi>The Law and the Prophets were untill John.</hi> i. e. they did typifie and prophesie concerning the things of the Kingdome of God until <hi>John,</hi> for before that time the faithfull only saw those things afarre off, and by types, shaddowes, and figures, and the rudiments of the world were taught to know them; <hi>But from that time the Kingdome of God is preached.</hi> i. e. the people of God are no lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger to be instructed co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the things of the Kingdome of God, by outward Signes, or visible shaddowes and figure, but only by the plaine Word of the Gospell, for now the Kingdome of God <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is not typified as before, but plainly preached, as a thing exhibited to us, and present with us. Thus we see, that to us, in the dayes of the Gospell, the word only is appointed, to teach the things belonging to the Kingdome of God.</p>
               <p>If any man reply, that though after the comming of Christ, we <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> are liberate from the Iewish and typicall significant Ceremonies, yet ought we to embrace those Ceremonies, wherein the Church of the New Testament placeth some Spirituall signification.</p>
               <p>I answer. 1. That which hath been said in this Argument, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth good against significant Ceremonies in generall. Otherwise when we reade of the abrogation of the Ceremoniall Law, we should only understand the abrogation of those particular ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which <hi>Moses</hi> delivered to the Iewes, concerning the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that were to endure to the comming of Christ; and so not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all this, the Church should still have power to set up new Ceremoniall Lawes in stead of the old, even which &amp; how many she listeth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What can be answered to <note n="r" place="margin">Ames fresh suite Pag. 266.</note> that which the <hi>Abridgement</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth touching this matter? <hi>It is much lesse Lawfull,</hi> (say those Ministers,) <hi>for man to bring significant Ceremonies into Gods worship, now, then it was under the Law. For God hath abrogateth his owne (not only such as prefigured Christ, but such also as served by their signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, to teach morall duties,) so as now (without great sinne) none of them can be continued in the Church, no not for signification.</hi> Whereupon they inferre: <hi>If those Ceremonies which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe ordained, to teach his Church by their signification, may not now be used, much lesse may those which man hath devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, sacred significant Ceremonies devised by man, are to <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> be reckoned among those Images forbidden in the second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. <note n="s" place="margin">Synt. Theol. lib. 6. cap. 10. pag. 58. 59</note> 
                  <hi>Polanus</hi> saith, that <hi>omnis figura illicita</hi> is forbidden in the second Commandement. <note n="t" place="margin">Synop. pur.

               <p>I have shewed <note n="v" place="margin">Supra cap. 4. Sect. 9.</note> else-where, that both in the writings of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:3270:102"/>
and of Formalists themselves, Sacraments get the name of Images; and why then are not all significant and holy Ceromonies to be accounted Images? Now, the 2. Commandement forbiddeth Images made by the Lust of man (that I may use <note n="x" place="margin">Of the lawf. of kneel. pag. 116.</note> 
                  <hi>Dr. Burgesse</hi> his phrase,) therefore it forbiddeth also, all religious similitudes, which are homogeneal unto them. This is the inference of the <hi>Abridgement;</hi> whereat <note n="y" place="margin">Apol. Part. 3. cap. 2. Sect. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Paybody</hi> starteth, &amp; replieth that the gestures which the people of God used in circumcision and Baptisme, the renting of the garment used in humiliation and prayer <hi>Ezra. 9. 5. 2 Kings 22. 19. Ier.</hi> 36. 24. lifting up the hands, kneeling with the knees, uncovering the head in the Sacrament, standing and sitting at the Sacrament; were and are significant in worshipping, yet are not forbidden by the 2. Commandement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> There are three sorts of Signes here to be distinguished. 1. Naturall Signes: so smoake is a signe of fire, and the dawning of the day a signe of the rising of the Sunne. 2. Customable signes, and so the uncovering of the head, which of old was a signe of preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, hath through custome become a signe of subjection. 3. Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary signes, which are called <hi>Signa instituta;</hi> these are either Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred or Civill. To appoint Sacred Signes of heavenly misteries or spirituall graces, is Gods owne peculiar, and of this kynd are the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacraments. Civill Signes for civill and morall uses, may be and are commendably appointed by men, both in Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and thus the colling of a Bell, is a signe given for as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling, and hath the same signification both in Ecclesiasticall and Secular assemblings. Now, besides the Sacred Signes of Gods owne institution, we know that naturall Signes have also place in Divine worship; thus kneeling in time of Prayer signifieth the submission of our hearts &amp; mindes, the lifting up of our eyes and hands, signifieth the elevation of our affections, the renting of the garments signified the renting of the heart by sorrow, standing with a religious respect to that which is before us, signifieth veneration or reverence, sitting at table signifieth familiarity &amp; fellowship. <hi>For which of you,</hi> 
                  <note n="z" place="margin">Luc. 17. 7.</note> saith our Master, <hi>having a servant plowing or feeding cattell, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, goe and sit downe to meate.</hi> All these signes have their significations from nature. And if it be said that howbeit sitting at our common-tables be a signe naturall, to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify familiarity amongst us, yet nature hath not given such a signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to sitting at the Lords-Table; I answer, that fitting is a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall signe of familiarity, at what Table soever it be used. At the Heavenly Table in the Kingdome of Glory, familiarly is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed and signifyed by sitting <hi>Math 8. 11. Many shall come from the East and West, and shall sit downe with Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. Much more then at the Spirituall Table in the Kingdome of Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:3270:103"/>
The difference betwixt other common tables, &amp; the Lords Table, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inferre no more, but that with great humility we ought to addresse our selves unto it: yet still we are to make vse of our familiarity with Christ <hi>ut tanquam in eodem toro accumbentes,</hi> as saith <note n="a" place="margin">Homil. 27. in 1. Cor.</note> 
                  <hi>Chrysostome.</hi> Wherefore we doe not there so looke to Christ, in his Princely Throne and glorious Majesty, exalted farre above all principalities and powers, as to forget that he is our loving and kinde Banqueter, who hath admitted us to that familiar fellowship with him which is signifyed by our sitting at his table.</p>
               <p>Secondly, customable Signes have likewise place in Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, for so a man comming into one of our Churches, in time of publike Worship, if he see the hearers covered, he knowes by this customeable signe, that Sermon is begunne.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, civill or morall Signes instituted by men, for that common order and decency, which is, respect both in civill and sacred actions, have also place in the acts of Gods worship. Thus a Basen and a Lauer set before a Pulpit, are signes of Baptisme to be ministred: but common decencie teacheth us to make the same use of Basen and a Lauer in civility, which a minister maketh of them in the action of Baptising. All our Question is about Sacred Mysticall Signes. Every Signe of this kinde, which is not ordained of God, we referre to the Imagerie forbidden in the 2. Commaundement. So that in the tossing of this Argument <hi>Paybody</hi> is twise nought: neither hath he said ought, for evincing the lawfullnesse of sac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ed significant Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies ordained of men, which we impugne.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, the significancy and teaching office of mysticall Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies invented by men, must be drawne under those Doctrines of men <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> condemned in the Gospell. Wherefore was it that the diverse wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Pharises were rejected by Christ, as a vaine worship? Was it not, because they were appointed for Doctrines? <hi>In vaine,</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Mark. 7. 7.</note> saith he, <hi>doe they worship me teaching for Doctrines, the Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The diverse washings commaunded in the Law were foresigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying to the people, and for teaching them, what true and inward holinesse God required of them. Now, the Pharises when they multiplied their washings of Hands, of Cups and Pots, Brasen Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells and Tables, had the same respect of significancy before their eyes. <hi>Neque enim alio spectabant</hi> (that I may use the words <note n="c" place="margin">Camer. praelect. Tom. 3. p. 37.</note> of a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malist) <hi>quam ut se sanctitatis studios<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>s hoc externo ritu probarent.</hi> Neither have we any warrant to thinke that they had another res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect then this. But the errour was in their addition to the Law, and in that they made their owne Ceremoniall washings, which were only the commaundements of men, to serve for Doctrines, Instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Significations. For those washings, as they were signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant and taught what holinesse or cleannesse should be among the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:3270:103"/>
people of God, they are called by the name of worship: and as they were such significant Ceremonies as were only commanded by men, they are reckoned for vaine worship.</p>
               <p>And further I demand, why are the <hi>Colossians</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Col. 2. 20. 21. 22.</note> rebuked, for subjecting themselves to those ordinances, <hi>Touch not, Taste not, Handle not?</hi> We see that those ordinances were not bare co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but commandements vnder the coulour of Doctrines; To wit, as the law commanded a difference of meats, for signifying that holinesse which God would have his people formed vnto: so these false teachers would have the same to be signified and taught by that difference of meats &amp; abstinence, which they of themselves &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the commandement of God, had ordanied.</p>
               <p>Moreover, if we consider how that the Word of God is given vnto us, <note n="e" place="margin">2. Tim. 3 16. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>for doctrine, for reproofe, for correction, for instruction in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works:</hi> It can not but be evident, how superfluously, how superstitiously, the office of sacred teaching and misticall signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, is given to dumbe and lifelesse Ceremonies, ordained of men, and consequently how justly they are taxed as vaine worship. We hold therefore with the worthiest <note n="f" place="margin">I. Calv. in Matth. 21. 25. Sect. 8.</note> of our Divines, <hi>nullam Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam, nullum saorum signum debere inter pios admitti, nisi a Deo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecta esse constet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To these reasons, which I haue put in order against mens signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Ceremonies, I will adde a pretty History before I goe further.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Hist. of the Church of Scotl. l. 1. p. 157. 158. 159.</note> When the Superior of the Abbey of <hi>Saint Andrewes</hi> was disputing with <hi>John Knox,</hi> about the lawfullnesse of Ceremonies devised by the Church, to decore the Sacraments and other service of God: <hi>Knox</hi> answered, <hi>The Church ought to doe nothing but in faith, and ought not to goe before, but is bound to follow the voice of the true Pastour.</hi> The Superior replied, that <hi>every one of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies hath a Godly signification, and therefore they both proceed from faith, and are done in faith. Knox replyeth, it is not enough, that man invent a Ceremony, and then give it a signification according to his pleasure; for so might the Ceremonies of the Gentiles and this day the Ceremonies of Mahomet be maintained. But if that any thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from faith, it must have the Word of God for the assurance,</hi> &amp;c. The Superior answereth, <hi>will ye bind us so strait, that we may doe nothing without the expresse Word of God. What and I aske drinke? thinke ye that I sinne? and yet I have not Gods Word for me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Knox</hi> here telleth him, first, that if he should either eate or drinke without the assurance of Gods Word, he sinned, <hi>for saith not the Apostle, speaking even of meate and drinke, that the creatures are sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified vnto men by the Word and Prayer? The Word is this: all things are cleane to the cleane: Now let me heare thus much of your Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and</hi> I <hi>shall give you the argument?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:3270:104"/>
But secondly, he tells him that he compared indiscreetly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prophane things with Holy, and that the Question was not of meate and drinke, wherein the Kingdome of God consisteth not, but of matters of religion, and that we may not take the same free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in the vsing of Christs Sacraments, that we may doe in eating and drinking, because <hi>Moses</hi> commanded, <hi>all that the Lord thy God commandeth thee to doe, that doe thou to the Lord thy God; adde nothing to it, diminish nothing from it.</hi> The Supprior now saith, that he was dry, and thereupon desireth the gray friar <hi>Arbugkill</hi> to follow the Argument. But he was so pressed with the same, that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded in himself, and the Supprior ashamed of him.

               <p>As for the examples alledged by our Opposites out of Scripture, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label> for Iustifying their significant Ceremonies; they have been by our Propugners of Evangelicall simplicity, so often &amp; so fully answered, that here I need doe no more but point at the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Of the days of <hi>Purim,</hi> and Feast of Dedication I am to speake afterward. In the meane while, our Opposites can not by these examples, strengthen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selves in this present Argument, except they could prove that the feast of Dedication was lawfully instituted, &amp; that the dayes of <hi>Purim</hi> were appointed for a religious festivity, and that vpon no such extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary warrant as the Church hath not ever and allwayes. The rite which <hi>Abraham</hi> commanded his servant to vse, when he sware to him namely the putting of his hand vnder his thigh, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 2. maketh them as litle help: for it was but a morall signe of that civill subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, reverence, and fidelity, which Inferiors owe unto Superiors, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the judgment of <hi>Calvine, Iunius, Pareus,</hi> and <hi>Tremellius,</hi> all vpon that place. That Altar which was built by the <hi>Reubenites Gadites,</hi> &amp; halfe Tribe of <hi>Manassch, Ios.</hi> 22. had (as some thinke) not a religious, but a morall vse, and was not a sacred, but a civill signe to witnesse that those two Tribes and the halfe, were of the stocke and linage of Israell: which if it were once called in question, then, their feare (deducing the connexion of causes and consequents,) led them in end to forecast this issue, <hi>Jn time to come, your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren might speake vnto our children, saying, what have you to doe with the Lord God of Jsraell, for the Lord hath made Jordan a border betwixt vs and you, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore to prevent all apparent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of such doolfull events, they erected the patterne of the Lords Altar, <note n="h" place="margin">Calv. in Ios. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>vt vinculum sit fraternae conjunctionis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And besides all this, there is nothing which can vrge vs to say, that the two Tribes and the halfe, did commendably, in the erecting of this Altar <note n="i" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>Calvine</hi> finds 2 faults in their proceeding. 1. In that they attempted such a notable &amp; important innovation, without advising with their brethren of the other Tribes, &amp; especially without enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the will of God by the high Priest. 2. Where as the Law of God
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:3270:104"/>
commaunded only to make one Altar, forasmuchas God would be worshipped only in one place; they did inordinatly, scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalously, and with appearance of evill, erect another Altar, for every one who should looke upon it, could not but presently thinke, that they had forsaken the Law, and were setting up a strange and degenerate Rite. Whether also, that Altar which they set up for a patterne of the Lords Altar, was one of the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges forbidden in the. 2. Commandement, I leave it to the Iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reader, to ruminate upon. But if one would gather from <hi>vers.</hi> 33. that the Priest, and the Princes, and the children of Israel, did allowe of that which the two Tribes and the halfe had done, because it is said, <hi>the thing pleased the children of Israel, and the children of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to goe up against them in battell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answere, the Hebrew text hath it thus. <hi>And the word was good in the eyes of the children of Israell &amp;c.</hi> That is, the children of Israel blessed God, for the word which <hi>Phinehas</hi> and the ten Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces brought to them, because thereby they understood that the two Tribes and the halfe, had not turned away from following the Lord, nor made them an Altar for burnt offerings or Sacrifice; which was enough to make them (the nine Trybes and a halfe) desist from their purpose, of going up to warre against their bretheren, to shedde their bloud. Againe when <hi>Phinehas</hi> and the ten Princes say to the <hi>Reubenites, Gadites,</hi> and the halfe Tribe of <hi>Manasseh;</hi> this day we perceive that the Lord is among us, <hi>because ye have not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted this trespasse against the Lord, vers.</hi> 31. they doe not exempt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from all preuarication; only they say <hi>signanter, this trespasse, to wit of turning</hi> away from the Lord, and building an Altar for Sacrifice, whereof they were accused. Thus we see, that no approbation of that which the two Tribes and the halfe did, in erecting the Altar, can be drawne from the text.</p>
               <p>But to proceed our Opposites alleadge for another example a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>10</label> us, a new Altar built by <hi>Solomon 1. Kings.</hi> 8. 64. In which place there is no such thing to be found, as a new Altar built by <hi>Solomon:</hi> but only that he sanctified the pavement of the inner Court, that the wholle Court might be as an Altar, necessity so requiring, because the Brazen Altar of the Lord was notable to containe so many Sacrifices, as then were offered. The building of Synagougs can make as litle against us.</p>
               <p>For. 1. After the Tribes were setled in the land of promise, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagougs were built, in the case of an urgent necessity, because all Israel could not come every Sabbath day, to the reading and expounding of the Law, in the place which God had chosen, that his Name might dwell there. what hath that case to doe with the addition of our unnecessary Ceremonies?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:3270:105"/>
2. Jf Formalists will make any advantage of the building of Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogus they must prove that they were founded, not upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary warrant of Prophets, but upon that ordinary power which the Church retaineth still. As for the Love-feasts used in the primitive Church. 1. They had no religious state in Divine worship, but were used only as morall signes of mutuall Charity. <note n="k" place="margin">On. 1.

                  <hi>or Love-feasts, not by the name of the Lords Supper: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could one without Sacriledge give so holy a name to a common Feast, which never had ground out of the Word, and which after for just cause was thrust out by the word of God.</hi> 2. If it be thought, that they were used as Sacred Signes of Christian Charity, because they were eaten in the Church. I answere, the eating of them in the Church is forbidden by <note n="l" place="margin">1.

                  <hi>non ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buit.</hi> Concerning the kisse of charity used in those times, 2. <hi>Cor</hi> 13, 22. we say in like maner, that it was but a morall signe of that reconciliation, friendship, and amity, which shew it self as well at holy assemblies, as other meetings, in that kynd and courtisie, but with all chaste salutation, which was then in use.</p>
               <p>As for the vails wherewith the Apostle would have women covered <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>11</label> whileas they were praying (that is in their hearts following the publike and common prayer) or prophecying (that is singing. 1. <hi>Sam. 10. 10. 1. Chron.</hi> 25. 1.) they are worthy to be covered with shame as with a garment, who alleadge this example for sacred significant Ceremonies of humane Institution. This covering was a morall signe, for that comely and orderly distinction of men and women, which civill decency required in all their meetings: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that distinction of habits, which they used for decency and comlinesse in their common behaviour and conversation, the Apostle will have them, for the same decencie and comelinesse, still to retaine, in their holy Assemblies. And further the Apostle sheweth, that it is also a naturall signe, and that nature it self tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet it: therefore he urgeth it both by the inferiority or subjection of the woman <hi>vers.</hi> 3. 8. 9. (For covering was then a signe of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,) and by the long haire which nature gives to a woman <hi>vers.</hi> 15. Where he would have the artificiall covering, to be fas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hioned in imitation of the naturall. What need we any more?
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:3270:105"/>
Let vs see natures institution, or the Apostles recommendation for the controverted Ceremonies, (as we have seen them for vvomens vails) and we yeeld the Argument.</p>
               <p>Last of all, the signe of imposition of hands, helpeth not the cause of our Opposites, because it the example of Christ, and the Apostles, and their disciples, which our Ceremonies have not: yet we thinke not imposition of hands to be any sacred or misticall signe, but only a morall, for designation of a person: let them who thinke more highly or honorably of it, looke to their Warrants.</p>
               <p>Thus have I thought it enough to take a passing view of these ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected instances, without marking narrowly all the impertinencies and falshoods, which here we find in the reasoning of our Opposites. One word more, and so an end, <hi>(n) D. Burgesse</hi> would comprehend the significancy of sacred Ecclesiasticall Ceremonies, for stirring men up to the rememberance of some mysterie of piety or duty to God, under that edification which is required in things that concerne order and decency by all Divines.</p>
               <p>Alas! what a sorie conceit is this? Divines indeed doe rightly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, that those alterable Circumstances of Divine worship, which are left to the determination of the Church, be so ordered and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, as they may be profitable to this edification. But this edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they speake of, is no other then that which is common to all our actions and speaches: are we not required to doe all things unto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difying, yea so to speak as that our speach may be profitable unto edifying? Now, such significations, as we have shewed to be given to the Ceremonies in Question, as namely, to certify a child of Gods favour and good will towards him; To betoken that at no time Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians should be ashamed of the ignominy of Christ; to signify the purenesse that ought to be in the Minister of God: To expresse the the humble and gratefull acknowledgement of the benefites of Christ, &amp;c. belong not to that edification; Which Diuines require in things prescribed by the Church concerning order and decency; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of every private and ordinary action, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <argument>
                  <p>That the lavvfulnesse of the Ceremonies is falsely grounded vpon the holy Scripture: vvhere such places as are alleadged by our Opposites, either for all the Ceremonies in generall, or for any one of them in particular, are vindicated from them.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT remaineth now, to examine the warrants which our Opposites pretend for the lawfullnesse of the Ceremonies. But I perceive <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>1</label> they know not well what ground to take hold on. For Instance whereof; <note n="o" place="margin">Eccl. Pol. lib. 5. S. 69.</note> 
                  <hi>Hooker</hi> defendeth the lawfulnesse of Festivall dayes, by the law of nature. <note n="p" place="margin">On praec. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>D. Douname</hi> groundeth the lawfulnesse of them on the law of God, making the observation of the Sabbaths of rest appointed by the Church, such as the Feasts of Christs Nativity, Passion, &amp;c. to be a duty commanded in the Law of God, and the not observing of them, to be a thing forbidden by the same Law. But <note n="q" place="margin">Epist. to the past. of the Church of Scotl.</note> B. <hi>Lindsey</hi> proveth the lawfulnes of those Holy dayes, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the power of the Church to make lawes in such matters. <hi>As for the Lords day</hi> saith he, <hi>which hath succeeded to the Iewish Sabbath, albeit God hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to sanctify it, yet neither is the whole publike worship nor any part of it appropriated to that time, but lawfully the same may be performed vpon any other convenient day of the weeke, of the moneth, or of the yeare, as the Church shall think expedient. Vpon this ground Zanchius affirmed: Ecclesiae Christi liberum esse quos velit preter domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicos dies sibi sanctificandos deligere. And by this warrant did the Primitive Church sanctify these five anniversary dayes of Christs Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Nay, let us observe, how one of them wavereth from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, in seeking here some ground to rest upon. <hi>Paybody</hi> groundeth the lawfulnesse of kneeling at the Sacrament, on nature, <hi>part. 2. cap. 4, Sect. 1.</hi> On the act of Parliament, <hi>part. 3. cap. 1. Sect. 31.</hi> On an Ecclesiasticall Canon, <hi>part. 3. cap. 1. Sect. 33.</hi> On the Kings soveraigne authority, <hi>part. 3. cap. 1. Sect. 36.</hi> Yet againe he saith, that this knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is grounded upon the commandement of God, <hi>part. 3. cap. 3. Sect. 11.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well. I see our Opposites sometimes warrant the lawfulnesse of the Ceremonies from the Law of God, sometimes from the Law of Man, and sometimes from the Law of Nature. But I will prove that
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:3270:106"/>
the lawfullnesse of those Ceremonies we speake of, can neither be grounded upon the Law of God, nor the Law of Man, nor the Law of Nature, and by consequence that they are not lawfull at all: So that besides the answering of what our Opposites alleadge for the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of them, we shall have a new Argument to prove them unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
               <p>I beginne with the Law of God. And first, let us see what is allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <label type="milestone">

               <p>Now let all these things, and every other action of Gods worship Ceremonies and all be done decently and in order. <hi>Licet ergo, Paulus, &amp;c, Albeit therefore</hi> saith <note n="b" place="margin">In prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fat. elench. relig. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistic.</note> 
                  <hi>Ioh. Bastwick, Paul hath committed to the Church, the judging both of decency and order, yet hat he not graunted any liberty of such misticall Ceremonies, as by their more inward signification doe teach the duty of piety: For since the whole liberty of the Church in the matter of Divine worship, is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised only in order and decency; it followeth that they doe impudently scorne both God and the Scriptures, who doe extend this liberty to greater things, and such as are placed above us. Most certaine it is, that Christ the Doctour of the Church hath by his owne written and sealed Word, aboundantly expounded unto us the will of God; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there further need of any Ceremonies, which by a secret vertue may instruct us: neither is it lesse evident, that order consisteth not its the institution or use of new things, but only in the right placing of things which have been instituted before. Decency,</hi> saith <note n="c" place="margin">De cas. consc. lib. 4. cap. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Baldwine, is opposed to levitie, and order to confusion. Spectat autem hic ordo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tissimum ad Ritus Ecclesia in officijs Sacris in quibus nullum debet esse scand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Then, in his Iudgment, order is not to the Rites of the Church a generall kynd, but only a concomitant circumstance; neither are the Rites of the Church comprehended under order, as parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars under the generall kynd to which they belong, but order belongeth to the Rites of the Church, as an adjunct to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. And I pray, must not the Rites of the Church be managed with decency and order? If so; then must our Opposites either say, that order is managed with order, which is to speake nonsence, or else that the Rites of the Church are not comprehended under order. But if not; then it followeth that the Rites of the Church are to be managed with levity; confusion, and scandall, for every action that is not done indecently and in order, must needs be done scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously and confusedly. 2. Order and decency, whether taken <hi>largo,</hi> or <hi>stricto sensu,</hi> allwayes signify such a thing as ought to be in all humane actions, as well civill as sacred; for will any man say that the civill actions of men are not to be done decently and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? <note n="d" place="margin">Ames.

                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alledgeth for the Crosse the same two places. But for answer to the first, we say that neither the signe whereof we read in that place, nor yet the use of it can make ought for them. As for the signe itselfe. Albeit the Ancients did interprete this signe of the letter <hi>Tau,</hi> to have been the signe of the Crosse, yet saith <note n="f" place="margin">Com. in illum lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.</note> 
                  <hi>Junius, Bona illorum venia; T quidem Graecorum, latinorumque majuscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, crucis qoudammodo signum videtur effingere, verum hoc ad lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram Haebreorum</hi> Tau <hi>non potest pertinere.

                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:3270:108"/>
Whereupon dissenting from the Auncients, he delivers his owne Iudgement, that <hi>Tau</hi> in this place is taken <hi>Technikos,</hi> for that signe or marke of the le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ter wherewith the Lord commanded to marke the elect for their safety and preservation. And so there was no mistery to be sought in that letter more then in any other. As for the use of that marke, wherewith the elect in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> were at hat time sealed, it was only for distinction and separation. It had the same use which that sprinkling of the posts of the doores had, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 7. only the foreheads of men and women, and not the posts of doores were here marked, because only the remnant according to election, and not whole families promiscously were at this time to be spared, as <hi>Iunius</hi> noteth.</p>
               <p>But the use of the signe of the Crosse pretended by Formalists, is not to separate us in the time of Iudgement, but to teach that at no time we ought to be ashamed of the ignominy of Christ.</p>
               <p>Shortly, the signe wherewith they in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> were marked, was for preservation from Iudgement, but the signe of the Crosse is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for preservation from sinne. Thus we see, that neither the signe nor the use of it, had any affinity with the Crosse. Now, the surest interpreation of that place <hi>Ezech.</hi> 9 4. is to take <hi>Tau</hi> for an apella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive noune, signifying generally and indefinitly a <hi>Marke</hi> or a <hi>Signe,</hi> so that there is no make determined by this word: only there was a commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t given te set a certaine marke, some signe or other, upon the foreheads of the elect.

               <p>Jf we will make the text agree well with it self, how can we but take both these for one? But proceed we with the Bishop.

               <p>Answ. there is no word in the text of religion. our English tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation reads it, <hi>all such as joyned them selves unto them. Montanus, omnes adjunctos.

any adjection, <hi>adhaesit,</hi> or <hi>adjunxit se.</hi> But let it be so, that the text meaneth only such as were to adjoyne themselves to the religion of the Iewes; yet why might not the Iewes have taken upon them a matter of civility, not only for themselves, but for such also as were to be joyned with them in religion? Could there be nothing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised for Proselytes but only a matter of religion?</p>
               <p>Alas! Is this our Antagonists great <hi>Achilles,</hi> who is thus falling downe and succumbing to me a silly Stripling. Yet let us see, if there be any more force in the remnant of his reasons.</p>
               <p>For a third, he tells us, that it is expressely tearmed a <hi>Rite</hi> and a <hi>Ceremony,</hi> at the 23. and 28. <hi>Verses,</hi> as the Fathers read them.</p>
               <p>

               <p>The 28. <hi>Vers.</hi> calls not this Feast a <hi>Rite,</hi> but only <hi>dies memorati,</hi> or <hi>celebres.</hi> And what if we graunt that this Feast was a rite? might it not, for all that, be meerely civill?

               <p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The latine version, which the B. followeth, and whereupon he buildeth this reason, readeth the 31. <hi>Verse</hi> very corruptly, and no wayes according to the originall, as will easily appeare to any who can compare them together. Wherefore the best interpreters take the fasting and prayer spoken of <hi>Vers.</hi> 31. to be meant of the time before their delivery. Now, after they were delivered, they decreed that the matters of their fasting and crying, should be remembered upon the dayes of <hi>Purim;</hi> which were to solemnize that preservation, <hi>quam Iejunio &amp; precibus fuerant a Deo consequuti,</hi> as saith <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mellius.</hi>

               <p>I have answered already, that their fasting and praying are not to be referred to the dayes of <hi>Purim,</hi> which were memorialls of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:3270:110"/>
their delivery, but to the time past, when by the meanes of fasting and prayer they did impetrate their delivery, before ever the dayes of <hi>Purim</hi> were heard of: and as touching almes, it can make no holy day; because much almes may be, and hath been given upon dayes of civill joy and solemnity.</p>
               <p>If the B. help not himselfe with his sixt reason<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>, he is like to come off with no great credit. May we then know what that is?</p>
               <p>Lastly, saith he, as a holy day the Iewes ever kept it, have a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar set service for it in their <hi>Seders;</hi> set Psalmes to sing, set lesson, to read, set prayers to say, good and godly all: None, but as they have used from all antiquity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The B. could not have made this word good, that the Iewes did ever &amp; from all antiquity keep the dayes of <hi>Purim,</hi> in this fashion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This maner of holding that Feast, whensoever it beganne, had no warrant from the first institution, but was (as many other things) taken up by the Iewes in after ages: and so the B. proveth not the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>nt which he taketh in hand, namely, that the dayes spoken of in this text were enacted or appointed to be kept as holy dayes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The service which the Iewes in latter times use upon the dayes of <hi>Purim,</hi> is not much to be regarded. For as <note n="r" place="margin">Mos. and Aaron, lib. 3. cap. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Godwyn</hi> noteth out of <hi>Hospinian,</hi> they reade the history of <hi>Esther</hi> in their Synagogues, and so often as they here mention of <hi>Haman,</hi> they doe with their fists and hammers beat upon the benches and boords, as if they did knock upon <hi>Hamans</hi> head.</p>
               <p>When thus they have behaued themselves, in the very time of their Lyturgie, like furious and drunken people, the rest of the day they passe over in outragious revelling. And here I take leave of the Bishop.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Thus much we understand from the Sacred Storie, that the Iewes had the direction of a Prophet for the dayes of <hi>Purim;</hi> and that was a warrant more then ordinary, because Prophets were the extraordinary Ministers of God.</p>

                  <hi>B.

And that is enough by vertue of this text;</hi> (meaning. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 16.) And after he saith, that we are taught by the Apostles example <hi>in points of this nature, of Ceremony or Circumstance, ever to pitch upon habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, or non habemus talem consuetudinem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The text gives him no ground for this doctrine, that in matters of Ceremony we are to pitch upon <hi>habemus or non habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus talem consuetudinem,</hi> so that he is wide away while as he spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the greatest part of his Sermon, in the pressing of this point, that the custome of the Church should be enough to us in matters of Ceremony, and particularly in the keeping of Easter: for the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the Church there spoken of, is not concerning a point of circumstance, but concerning a very substantiall and necessary point, namely, not to be contentious: neither doth the Apostle urge those orders of the mens praying uncovered, and the womens praying veiled, from this ground, because so was the Churches custome, (as the B. Would have it.) but only he is warning the <hi>Corinthians</hi> not to be contentious about those matters, because the Churches have no such custome as to be contentious. So is the place expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Chrysostome, Ambrose, Calvine, Martyr, Bullinger. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorat, Beza, Fulcke, Cartwright, Pareus,</hi> and our owne Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bischop of <hi>Sainct Andrews</hi> in his sermon upon that text. And for this exposition it maketh, that the Apostle in the praeceding part of the Chapter hath given sufficient reasons for that order of covering or veiling the women: wherefore if any would contend about the matter, he tells them they must contend with themselves, for
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:3270:112"/>
they not the Churches of God would not contend with them, they had no such custome. But if we admit <hi>B. Andrewes</hi> glosse, then why doth the Apostle, after he hath given good reasons for the veiling of Women, subjoyne, <hi>If any man seeme to be contentious,</hi> &amp;c. The B. resolveth us, that the Apostle saw that a wrangling wit would elude these reasons which he had given, and he had no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to give, therefore he resolves all into the Churches practice, enough of it self to suffice any that will be wise to fobriety.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ</hi> If any man seeme to be blasphemous, we have no such cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, neither the Churches of God. What? shall a wrangling wit elude the reasons given by the Spirit of God, in such sort, that he must give some other more sufficient proofe for that which he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth?

               <p>We will beginne with Lawes Ecclesiasticall: where first of all, it must be considered well, what power the Church hath to make lawes about things pertaining to Religion &amp; the Worship of God, and how farre the same doth extend it self. <hi>D. Fields</hi> resolution, touching this Question, is as followeth. <hi>Thus,</hi> saith <note n="e" place="margin">Of the Church, lib. 4. cap. 31.</note> he, <hi>we see our Adversaries cannot prove that the Church hath power to annex unto such Ceremonies and observations as she deviseth, the remission of sinnes, and the working of other Spirituall and supernaturall effects, which is the only thing questioned between them and us about the power of the Church. So that all the power the Church hath, more then by her power to publish the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of Christ the Sonne of God, and by her censures to punish the offenders against the same, is only in prescribing things that pertaine to come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse and order. Comelinesse requireth that not only that gravity and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty doe appeare in the performance of the works of Gods service, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemeth actions of that nature, but also that such Rites and Ceremonies bee used, as may cause a due respect unto and regard of the things performed, and thereby stirre men up to greater fervour and devotion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And after: <hi>Order requireth that there be set houres for prayer, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and ministring the Sacraments, that there be silence &amp; attention when the things are performed, that Women be silent in the Church, that all things be administrate according to the rules of Discipline.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This his discourse is but a bundle of incongruities: For. 1. he saith, that the Churches power to annex unto the Ceremonies which she deviseth the working of Spirituall and supernaturall effects, is the onely thing questioned between our adversaries and us, about the power of Church. Now, our Adversaries contend with us also about the power of the Church to make new Articles of Faith; and her power to make Lawes binding the conscience: both which controversies are touched by <note n="f" place="margin">lib. 4. cap. 6. &amp; cap. 34.</note> himselfe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He isath, that comelinesse requireth the use of such Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:3270:114"/>
as may cause a due respect unto, and regard of the works of Gods service, and thereby stirre men up to greater fervour and devotion. But it hath been already shewed, that <note n="g" place="margin">Supra cap. 6. sect. 3</note> the comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse which the Apostle requireth in the Church and service of God, cannot comprehend such Ceremonies under it, and that it is no other then that very common externall decency, which is beseeming for all the Assemblies of men, as well civill as sacred.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whileas he is discoursing of the Churches power to prescribe things pertaining to order, contra-distinguished from her power which she hath to publish the Commandements of Christ, he rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons forth, among his other examples, Womens silence in the Church, as if the Church did prescribe this as a matter of order left to her determination, and not publish it as the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christ in his Word.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whereas he saith, that the Church hath power to prescribe such Rites &amp; Ceremonies, as may cause a due respect unto, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the workes of Gods service, and thereby stirre men up to greater fervour and devotion: by his owne words shall he be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. For a little before, he reprehendeth the Romanists for maintaining that the Church hath power to annex unto the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies which she deviseth, the working of Spirituall and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall effects. And a litle after, he saith, that the Church hath no power to ordaine such Ceremonies as serve to signify, assure and convey unto men, such benefites of sauing grace, as God in Christ is pleased to bestow on them. Now, to cause a regard of, and a respect unto the works of Gods service, and thereby to stirre up men to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ervour and devotion, what is it but the working of a Spirituall &amp; supernaturall effect, &amp; the conveying unto men such a benefit of saving grace, as God in Christ is pleased to bestow on them? In like manner, whereas he holdeth, that the Church hath power to ordaine such Ceremonies, as serve to expresse those Spirituall and Heavenly affections, dispositions, motions or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, which are or should be in men; In the very same place he confuteth himselfe, whileas he affirmeth that the Church hath no power to ordaine such Ceremonies as serve to signifie unto men those benefites of saving grace, which God in Christ is pleased to bestow on them. Now, to expresse such Heavenly &amp; Spirituall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, dispositions, motions, or desires, as should be in men; is (I suppose) to signify unto men such benefites of saving grace, as God in Christ is pleased to bestow on them.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> whereof we dispute, is, that power is given unto her to <hi>determine the circumstances, which are in the generall necessary to be used in Divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, but not defined particularly in the Word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:3270:114"/>
I know the Church can determine nothing, which is not of this kynd and quality. But the Prelats meaning (as may be seene in that same Epistle of his,) is, that whatsoever the Church determineth, if it be such a circumstance as is in the generall necessary, but not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly defined in the word, then we can not say, that the Church had no power to determine &amp; enioyne the same, nor be led by the judgement of our owne consciences, Iudging it not expedient, but that in this case we must take the Churches Law to be the rule of our consciences. Now, by this ground which the Prelat holdeth, the Church may prescribe to the Ministers of the Gospell, the whole habit &amp; apparel of the Leviticall high Priest, (which were to Iudaize.) For apparrell is a circumstance in the generall necessary, yet it is not particularly defined in the Word. By this ground, the Church may determine that I should ever pray with my face to the East, preach kneeling on my knees, sing the Psalmes lying on my backe, and heare Sermon standing only upon one foot. For in all these actions a gesture is necessary; but there is no gesture par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly defined in the Word, to which wee are adstricted in any of these exercises.</p>
               <p>And further, because <hi>uno absurdo dato, mille sequuntur:</hi> By this ground the Prelate must say, that the Church hath power to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine three or foure holy dayes every weeke, (which ordinance, as he himselfe hath told us, could not stand with charity, the inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable companion of piety) for time is a circumstance in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall necessary in divine worship: yet in his Iudgement wee are not bound by the Word to any particular time, for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the duties of Gods worship.</p>
               <p>By this ground we were to say, that Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third held him within the bounds of Ecclesiasticall power, when in the great <hi>Lateran</hi> Councell, <hi>Anno</hi> 1215, he made a Decree, that all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of both sexes should once in the yeare atleast, to wit, upon Easter-day, receive the Sacrament of the Eucharist. From whence it hath come to passe, that the common people in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> receive the Sacrament only upon Easter. Now, the time of receiving the Sacrament is a circumstance in the generall necssary, for a time it must have, but it is not particularly defined in the Word, It is left indefinite 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26. yet the Church hath no power to determine Easter-day, either as the onely time, or as the fittest time, for all the faithfull of both sexes to receive the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist. What if faithfull men and women cannot have time to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare themselves (as becommeth,) being avocated &amp; distracted by the no lesse necessary then honest adoes of their perticular callings?</p>
               <p>What if they can not have the Sacrament upon that day ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministered according to our Lords institution? What if they see Papists confirming themselves in their Easter-superstition, by
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:3270:115"/>
our unnecessary practice? Shall they swallow these and such like soule destroying Camels, and all for straining out the gnate of communicating precisely upon Easter day? But since time is a necessary circumstance, and no time is particularly defined, the B. must say more also, that the Church may determine Easter day, for the onely day whereupon wee may receive the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p>Last of all, if the Church have power to determine all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances in the generall necessary, but not particularly defined in the Word, what could bee said against that auncient order of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne baptising onely at the holy dayes of Easter and Pentecost, (whereby it came to passe, that very many died unbaptised, as <note n="i" place="margin">Lib. 5. cap. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> writeth?) Or what shall be said against <note n="k" place="margin">Lib. de Baptismo.</note> 
                  <hi>Tertullian</hi> his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which alloweth laymen, yea women, to baptise. May the Churches determination make all this good, for asmuch as these circumstances of the time when, and the persons by whom bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme should be ministred, are in the generall necessary, but not particularly defined in the Word? <hi>Ite leves nugae.</hi>

                  <hi>Camero,</hi> as learned a Formalist as any of the former, expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> his Iudgement copiously touching our present Question. He saith, that there are two sorts of things which the Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, to wit, either such as belong to Faith &amp; manners; or such as doe conduce to Faith and manners: that both are in Gods Word prescribed <hi>exserte</hi> plainly, but not one way, because such things as pertaine unto Faith and manners, are in the Word of God particularly commanded, whereas those things which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to Faith and manners are but generally commended unto us. Of things that pertaine to Faith and manners, he saith, that they are most constant and certaine, and such as can admit no change, but as for things conducing to Faith and manners, hee saith, that they depend upon the circumstances of persons, place and time, which beeing almost infinite, there could not be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular precepts delivered unto us concerning such things. Onely this is from God commended unto the Church, that whatsoever is done publikely, bee done with order; and what privately, be decent.</p>
               <p>These things he so applieth to his purpose, that he determineth, in neither of these kindes the Church hath power to make Lawes, because in things pertaining to Faith and manners, the Law of our Lord Iesus Christ is plainely expressed: and in those things, wherein neither Faith nor manners are placed, but which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to Faith and manners, we have indeed a generall Law, not having further any particular Law, for that reason alleadged, namely, because this depends upon the circumstances.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:3270:115"/>
Thereafter he addeth. <hi>Quid sit fides, quid sit pietas, quid sit charitas, verbo Dei demonstratur. Quid ad haec conducat, seu reputando rem in uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versum, seu reputando rem quatenus singulis competit, pendet ex cognitione circumstantiarum. Iam id definire Deus voluit esse penes Ecclesiam, hac ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men lege, ut quod definit Ecclesia conveniat generall definitioni Dei.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The matter he illustrates with this one Example: Gods Word doth define in the generall, that we are to fast, and that publikely, But in the particular wee could not have the definition of the Word, because there are infinite occasions of a publike Fast, as it is said in the Schooles <hi>individua esse infinita:</hi> so that it is the Churches part, to looke to the occasion, &amp; this depends upon the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the circumstances. This discourse of his cannot satisfy the attentive Reader, but deserveth certaine animadversions.</p>
               <p>First then, it is to be observed, how he is drawne into a manifest <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>IV</label> contradiction: for whereas he saith, that Gods Word doth <hi>exserte</hi> &amp; <hi>diserte</hi> commend unto us <hi>generatim,</hi> such things as conduce to Faith and maners, &amp; that concerning things of this nature we have a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Law in Scripture, how can this stand with that which he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, namely, that it is in the Churches power to define what things doe conduce to faith, piety, &amp; charity, even <hi>reputando rem in uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versum?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas he saith, that the Church hath no power to make Lawes, neither in things belonging to faith and maners, nor in things conducing to the same; I would also see how this agreeth with that other position, namely, that it is in the power of the Church to define what things conduce to faith, piety and charity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What meanes he by his application of order to publike, &amp; decency to private actions? As if the Apostle did not require both these in the publike workes of Gods service, performed in the Church.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whereas he saith, that such things as conduce to Faith and maners, doe depend upon the circumstances, and so could not be particularly defined in the Word, either he speakes of those things, as they are defined in the generall, or as they are defined in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. Not the first, for as they are defined in the generall, they cannot depend upon changeable circumstances, and that because according to his owne tenet, the Word defines them in the general, &amp; this definition of the Word is most certaine &amp; constant, neither can any change happen unto it. Wherefore (without doubt) he must pronounce this, of the definition of such things in the particular. Now to say, that things conducing to faith &amp; maners, as they are particularly defined, doe depend upon circumstan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>, is as much as to say that circumstances depend upon circumstances. For things conducing to Faith and manners, which the Church hath
<pb facs="tcp:3270:116"/>
power to determine particularly, what are they other then circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances? Surely, he who taketh not <hi>Cameroes</hi> Iudgement to be, that the Church hath power to determine somewhat more then the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances (and by consequence a part of the substance) of Gods worship, shall give no sence to his words. Yet if one would take his meaning so, I see not how he can be saved from contradicting himself; for as much as he holdeth, that such things as pertaine to Faith &amp; manners are particularly defined in the Word. To say no more, I smell such a thing in <hi>Cameroes</hi> opinion as can neither stand with reason nor with himselfe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Gods Word doth not onely define things pertaining to Faith and manners, but also things conducing to the same, and that not onely generally but in some respects, and sometimes particularly. And we take for example his owne Instance of fasting. For the Scripture defineth very many occasions of fasting, <hi>Ezra 8. 21. 2 Chron. 20. Iona 3. Ioel 2. Act. 13. 3. Ios. 7. 6. Iud. 20. 16. Esther 4. 16. Ezra 9. &amp; 10. Zach. 7.</hi> From which places we gather, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture defineth fasting to be used.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For Supplication, when we want some necessary or expedient good thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For Deprecation, when we feare some evill.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For Humiliation, when by our sinnes we have provoked Gods wrath. Neither can there be any occasion of fasting, whereof I may not say that either it is particularly defined in Scripture, or else that it may be by necessary consequence defined out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or lastly, that it is of that sort of things which were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminable by Scripture, because circumstances are infinite, as <hi>Camero</hi> hath told us.</p>

               <p>Three conditions I finde necessarily requisite, in such a thing as the Church hath power to prescribe by her Lawes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It must be onely a circumstance of Divine Worship, no sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall part of it, no sacred significant and efficacious Ceremonie.

                  <hi>B Andreues</hi> avoucheth, that Ceremonies pertaine to the Church only and to the service of God, not to civill solemnities. But so much (I trust) he would not have said of circumstances, which have place in all morall actions, and that to the same end and purpose, for which they serve in religious actions, namely, for beautifying them with that decent demeanour which the very light and law of natural reason requireth, as a thing beseeming all humane actions. For the Church of Christ being a society of men and women, must either ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve order &amp; decency in all the circumstances of their holy actions, time, place, person, forme, &amp;c. or else be deformed with that mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and and confusion, which common reason and civility abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.

                  </gap>e objected, that some things are convenient to be done, therefore because they are prescribed by the Church, and for no other reason. For example, in two things which are alike lawfull and convenient in themselves, I am bound to doe the one and not the other, because of the Churches prescription. So that in such cases it seemeth there can be no other reason given for the ordinance of the Church, but only her owne power and authority, to put order to things of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>s nature.</p>
               <p>I answer, that even in such a case as this the conveniency of the thing itself is anterior to the Churches determination, anterior I say <hi>de congruo,</hi> though not <hi>de facto,</hi> that is to say, before ever the Church pre scribe it, it is such a thing as (when it falleth out to be done at all) may be done conveniently; though it be not (before the Churches prescribing of it,) such a thing as should and ought to be done as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient. Which being so, we doe still hold, that the conveniency of a thing must alwayes goe before the Churches prescribing of it, goe before I meane, at least <hi>de congruo.</hi> Neither can the Church pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe any thing lawfully, which she sheweth not to have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, even before her determination.</p>
               <p>These things being permitted, I come to extract my projection, &amp; to make it evident, that the lawfulnes of the controverted Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, can not be warranted by any Ecclesiasticall Law. And this I prove by three Arguments.</p>
               <p>First, those conditions which I have shewed to be required in that thing which the Church may lawfully prescribe by a Law, are not
<pb facs="tcp:3270:118"/>
quadrant nor competent to the Crosse, Kneeling, Surplice, Holy-dayes, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For 1. they are not meere circumstances, such as have place in all morall actions, but sacred, misticall, significant, efficacious Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, as hath been aboundantly shewed in this dispute already. For example: <note n="a" place="margin">Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, pag. 37.</note> 
                  <hi>D. Burgesse</hi> calleth the Surplice a religious or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Ceremony. And againe, <note n="b" place="margin">Of the kawf. of 5 neel. pag. 2.</note> he placeth in it a misticall signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the purenesse of the minister of God. Wherefore <note n="c" place="margin">Cap. 1.</note> the replier to <hi>D. Mortons</hi> particular defence saith well, that there is great difference betwixt a grave civill habite and a misticall garment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It cannot be said, that thes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> Ceremonies are of that kynd of things, which were not determinab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> by Scripture: neither will our Opposites, for very shame, adventure to say, that things of this kynd to which Crosse, Kneeling, &amp;c. doe belong, viz. sacred significant Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies left (in their Iudgement) to the definition of the Church, are almost infinite, and therefore could not be well and easily deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in Scripture.</p>
               <p>Since then, such things as are not meere circumstances of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, can neither be many nor various (as I said before,) it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest that all such things were easily determinable in Scripture.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Our Ceremoniall Lawes are not backed with such grounds &amp; reasons, as might be for the satisfying and quieting of tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, but we are borne downe with will and authority: whereof I have said enough <note n="d" place="margin">Supra part. 1. cap. 4. &amp; 6</note> else-where.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the Ceremonies be lawfull to us, because the Law and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance <label type="milestone">

               <p>If they take them, (as needs they must,) to the latter part, then let them either say, that the Ceremonies are lawfull unto us, because the Church judgeth them to be agreable to the Law of God &amp; nature, or because the Church proveth unto us by evident reasons, that they are indeed agreeable to these Lawes.

               <p>And further, if any such reasons be to be given forth for the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, why are they so long kept up from us? But if they hold them at the former, thereupon it will follow, that it shall be lawfull for us to doe every thing which the Church shall Iudge to be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Law of God and nature, and consequently to use all the Iewish, Popish and Heathnish Ceremonies, yea to worship Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; If it happen that the Church judge these things to be agreeable to the Law of God and nature.</p>
               <p>It will be answered (I know) that if the Church command any thing repugnant to Gods Word, we are not bound to doe it, nor to receive it as lawfull, though the Church judge so of it: But other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, if that which the Church judgeth to be agreeable to the Law of God and nature, (and in that respect prescribeth) be not repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Word of God, but in itself indifferent, then are we to embrace it as convenient, and consonant to the Law of God and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, neither ought we to call in Question the lawfulnesse of it.</p>
               <p>But I reply, that either we must judge a thing to be repugnant or not repugnant to the Word, to be indifferent or not indiffere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>t in itself, because the Church judgeth so of it, or else because the Church proveth unto us by an evident reason that it is so. If the latter; we have what we would. If the former; we are just where we were; The argument is still set a foot: then we must receive every thing (be it never so bad,) as indifferent, if only the Church happen so to judge of it. For <hi>quod competit alicui qua tali, &amp;c.</hi> So that if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any thing as indifferent, for this respect, because the Church judgeth it to be so, then shall we receive every thing for indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; which the Church shall so judge of.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Church is forbidden to adde any thing to the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <label type="milestone">

               <p>Our Opposites have no other distinctions, which they make any use of against this argument, but the very same which Papists use in defence of their unwritten dogmaticall traditions; namely, that <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio corrumpens</hi> is forbidden, but not <hi>additio perficiens:</hi> that there is not alike reason of the Christian Church, and of the Iewish: that the Church may not adde to the essentiall parts of Gods worship, but to the accidentary she may adde.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:3270:119"/>
To the first of those distinctions we Answer, 1. That the distinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion itself is an addition to the word, and so doth but begge the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is blasphemous, for it argueth, that the commandements of God are imperfect, and that by addition they are made perfect.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Since our Opposites will speake in this dialect, let them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve us, whether the washings of the Pharises, condemned by Christ, were corrupting or perfecting additions. They cannot say, they were corrupting; for there was no commandement of God, which those washings did corrupt or destroy, except that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which forbiddeth mens additions. But for this respect, our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posites dare not call them corrupting additions, for so they should condemne all additions whatsoever. Except therefore, they can shew us that those washings were not added by the Pharises, for perfecting, but for corrupting the Law of God, let them consider how they ranke their owne Ceremoniall additions, with those of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises. We reade of no other reason wherefore Christ co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but because they were Doctrines, which had no other warrant then the commandements of men. <hi>Math.</hi> 15. 9. For as the Law ordained diverse washings, for teaching and signifying that true holinesse and cleanesse, which ought to be among Gods people; so the Pharises would have per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>To the second distinction, we say that the Christian Church hath <label type="milestone">

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:3270:121"/>
And if they meant to justify them by the Lawes &amp; Constitutions of the Church, why did they not study to an orderly peaceable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, and to have things concluded in a lawfull Nationall Synode, after free reasoning and mature advisement? Why did they carry matters so factiously and violently? The truth is, they would have us to acquiesce and to say no more against the Ceremonies, when once we heare that they are enjoyned by his Majestie, our only su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Governour. What I am here to say, shall not derogate any thing from his Highnesse Supremacy, because it includeth no such thing as a nomotheticall power, to prescribe and appoint such sacred and significant Ceremonies as he shall thinke good.</p>
               <p>The Arch-Bishop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> in his Speach which he delivered concerning the Kings Supremacy, (for which King <hi>Iames</hi> returned him in a Letter his Princely and gratious thankes, for that he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended his just &amp; lawfull power, with so much learning and reason,) whiles he treateth of the Supremacy, and expoundeth that Title of <hi>The only Supreme Governour of all his Highnes Dominions and Countries, as well in all spirituall or Ecclesiasticall things or causes, as temporall;</hi> mentioneth no such thing, as any power to dispose by his Lawes and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, of things externall in the worship of God. Neither yet shall this following Discourse tend to the cooling &amp; abating of that care and zeale which Princes owe to the oversight &amp; promotion of Religion. For alas! the corruptions which have stept into Religion, and the decayes which it hath felt since Princes beganne to take small thought of it, and to leave the care of it to Popes, Bishops, Monkes, &amp;c. can never be enough bewailed. <hi>Nihil enim, &amp;c. For there is nothing</hi> (saith <note n="c" place="margin">In 4. praec. col. 791.</note> 
                  <hi>Zanchius) more pernitious, either to the Commonwealth or to the Church, then if a Prince doe all things by the judgement of others, and he himself understand not those things which are propounded to bee done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor lastly, are we to sound an alarum of Rebellion. For to say that Subjects are not bound to obey such Lawes and Statutes of their Prince, as impose upon them a Yoke of Ceremonies, which hee hath no power to impose, is one thing; and to say, that they are not bound to subject themselves unto him faithfully and loyally, is another thing. <hi>Recte Gerson; Qui abusui potestatis resistit, non resistit divinae ordinationi,</hi> saith <note n="d" place="margin">DeIud. controv. cap. 14. p. 76</note> the Bishop of <hi>Sarisburie.

binde themselves to be faithfull to their Prince. And we take the judge of all flesh to witnesse, before whose dreadfull Tribunall we must stand at that great day, how free we are of thoughts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, &amp; how uprightly we meane to be his Majesties most true and loy all Subjects to the end of our lives, and to devote our selves, our bodies, lives, goods and estates, and all that we have in the world, to his Highnesse service, and to the honour of his Royal Crowne.</p>
               <p>Now for the purpose in hand, we will first examine what the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Spalato</hi> saith, for he discourseth much of the jurisdiction <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> and Office of Princes, in things and causes Ecclesiasticall. The Title of the first Chapter of his sixt Booke <hi>de Rep Eccl.</hi> holdeth; That it is the duty of Princes <hi>super Ecclesiastica invigilare.</hi> But in the body of the Chapter, he laboureth to prove, that the power of governing Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall things belongeth to Princes (which is farre more then to watch carefully over them.) This the Reader will easily perceive. Nay, he himselfe, <hi>Num.</hi> 115. &amp; 174. professeth he hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that Divine and Ecclesiasticall things, are to be ruled and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the authority &amp; Lawes of Princes. The Title prefixed to the sixt Chapter of that same Booke, is this: <hi>Legibus &amp; edictis Principum Laicorum, &amp; Ecclesiastica &amp; Ecclesiasticos gubernari.</hi> So that in both Chapters, he treateth of one and the same office of Princes about things Ecclesiasticall.</p>
               <p>Now, if we would learne what he meanes by those <hi>Ecclesiastica,</hi> which he will have to be governed by Princes, <note n="g" place="margin">Lib 6. Cap. 5. num. 3. &amp; 17.</note> he resolves us that he meanes not things internall, such as the deciding of controversies in matters of faith, feeding with the Word of God, binding &amp; loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and ministring of the Sacraments: (for <hi>in pure spiritualibus,</hi> (as he speaketh <hi>in Summa Cap.</hi> 5.) he yeeldeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not the power of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and defining:) but onely things externall, which pertaine to the externall worship of God, or which concerne externall Ecclesiastical Discipline. Such things <note n="h" place="margin">Ostens. error. Fr. Suarez. Cap. 3. Nmu. 23. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3.</note> he acknowledgeth to be <hi>res Spirituales.</hi> But <hi>vera Spiritualia,</hi> he will have to comprehend onely things inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, which hee removeth from the power of Princes. Thus wee have his judgement as plaine as himselfe hath delivered it unto us.</p>
               <p>But I demaund, 1. Why yeeldeth he the same power to Princes in governing <hi>Ecclesiastica,</hi> which he yeldeth them in governing <hi>Ecclesias<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticos?</hi> For Ecclesiasticall Persons, being members of the common-wealth no lesse then Laickes, have the same King and Governour with them. For which reason it is (as <note n="i" place="margin">De Rep. Eccl. Cap. 6. Num. 38.</note> the B. himself sheweth out of <hi>Molina)</hi> that they are bound to be subject to their Princes Lawes, which pertaine to the whole common-wealth. But the like cannot be alleadged for the power of Princes to governe <hi>Ecclesiastica:</hi> for the B. (I trust) would not have said, that things Ecclesiasticall and things civill doe equally and alike belong to their power and Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:3270:122"/>
2. Why confoundeth he the governing of things and causes Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall, with watching over and taking care for the same? Let us only call to mind the native signification of the word: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Guberno</hi> signifieth properly to rule or governe the course of a S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>p: And in a Ship there may be many watchfull and carefull eyes over her course, and yet but one Governour directing the same.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Why holdeth he, that things externall in the worship of God are not <hi>vera spiritualia?</hi> For if they be Ecclesiasticall and sacred Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies (not fleshly and wordly) why will he not also acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them for true spirituall things? And if they be not <hi>vera spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualia,</hi> why calls he them <hi>res spirituales?</hi> For are not <hi>Res</hi> and <hi>Verum</hi> reciprocall, as wel as <hi>Ens</hi> and <hi>Verum?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Even as a Prince in his Sea-voyage is supreme Governour of all which are in the Ship with him, end by consequence of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, who directs her course, yet doth he not governe the action of governing or directing the course of the Ship: So though a Prince be the only supreme Governour of all his Dominions, &amp; by consequence of Ecclesiasticall persons in his Dominions, yet he can not be said to Governe all their Ecclesiasticall actions &amp; causes. And as the Governour of a Ship acknowledgeth his Prince for his only supreme Governour, even then whiles he is governing &amp; directing the course of the ship, (otherwise whiles he is governing her course, he should not be his Princes Subject) yet he doth not thereby ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that his Prince governeth his action of directing the course of the Ship, (for then should the Prince be the Pilot:) So when one hath acknowledged the Prince to be the only supreme Governour upon Earth, of all Ecclesiasticall persons in his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, even whiles they are ordering and determining Ecclesiasticall causes; yet he hath not thereby acknowledged that the Prince go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneth the Ecclesiasticall causes. Wherefore whiles <note n="k" place="margin">Ostens. error Fr. Suarez. Cap. 3. n. 23.</note> the B. taketh the English Oath of Supremacy, to acknowledge the same which he teacheth touching the Princes power, he giveth it another sence then the words of it can beare. For it saith not that the Kings Majestie is the only supreme Governour of all his Highnes Dominions, and OF all things and causes therein, as well Ecclesiasticall or Spirituall, as Temporall. But it saith, that he is the only Supreame Governour of all his Highnes Dominions IN all things or causes, &amp;c. Now, the spirituall Guides of the Church substituted by Christ, as Deputies in his stead, who is the most supreame Governour of his own Church, and <note n="l" place="margin">Isa. 96.</note> on whose shoulder the Governement resteth as his Royall prorogative; even then whiles they are governing and putting or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Ecclesiasticall or spirituall causes, they acknowledge their Prince to be their only supreme Governour upon Earth: yet hereby they implie not that he governeth their Governing of Ecclesiasticall causes, as hath been shewed by that <hi>Simele</hi> of governing a Ship.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:3270:123"/>
5. Whereas the B. leaveth all things externall, which pertaine to the worship of God, to be governed by Princes, I object that the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> of the holy Scripture out of Hebrew and Grèeke into the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar tongue, is an externall thing, belonging to the worship of God, yet it cannot be governed by a Prince who is not learned in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall tounges.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Whereas he yeeldeth to Princes the power of governing <hi>in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualibus,</hi> but not in <hi>pure spiritualibus,</hi> I cannot comprehend this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction. All sacred and Ecclesiasticall things belonging to the worship of God are spirituall things.</p>
               <p>What then understands he by things purely spirituall? If he meane things which are in such sort spirituall, that they have nothing earthly not externall in them; in this sence the Sacraments are not purely spirituall, because they consist of two parts; one earthly, and another heavenly, as <hi>Ireneus</hi> saith of the Eucharist. And so the Sacraments not being things purely spirituall, shall be left to the power and government of Princes. If it be said, that by things pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely spirituall, he meanes things which concerne our Spirits onely, and not the outward man; I still urge the same Instance: For the Sacraments are not in this sence spirituall, because a part of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, to wit, the Sacramentall Signes or Elements, concerne our externall &amp; bodily sences of seeing, touching, and tasting.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The B. also contradicteth himselfe unawares: For in <note n="m" place="margin">Lib. 6. cap. 5. n. 174.</note> one place hee reserveth and excepteth from the power of Princes, the judging and deciding of controversies and questions of faith. Yet in <note n="n" place="margin">Ibid. num. 177.</note> another place hee exhorteth Kings and Princes, to compell the Divines of both sides (of the Roman and Reformed Churches) to come to a free conference, and to debate the matters controverted betwixt them; in which conference, hee requireth the Princes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to bee Iudges.</p>
               <p>It remaineth to trie what force of reason the B. hath to backe his opinion. As for the ragged rabble of humane Testimonies, which <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> he taketh together, I should but weary my Reader, and spend paper and Inke in vaine, if I should insist to answer them one by one. Only thus much I say of all those Sentences of the Fathers, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of Princes and Emperours about things Ecclesiasticall, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Histories, of the submission of some Ecclesiasticall causes to Emperours; Let him who pleaseth read them; And it shall appeare,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That some of those things whereunto the power of Princes was applied, were unlawfull.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There were many of them things Temporall or Civill, not Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall or Spirituall, nor such as pertaine to the worshippe of God.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:3270:123"/>
3. There were some of them Ecclesiasticall or spirituall things, but then Princes did only ratify that which had beene determined by Councells, and punish with the civill sword such as did stubbornly disobey the Churches lawfull constitutions. Neither were Princes allowed to doe any more.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Sometimes they interposed their authority and medled in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses spirituall or Ecclesiasticall, even before the definition of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells: yet did they not judge nor decide those matters, but did only convocate Councells, and urge the Cleargie to see to the misor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and troubled estate of the Church, and by their wholesome Lawes &amp; ordinances to provide the best remedies for the same which they could.</p>
               <p n="5">5. At other times Princes have done somewhat more in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall matters: but this was only in extraordinary cases, when the Cleargy was so corrupted, that either through ignorance they were unable, or through malice and perversnesse unwilling to doe their duty in deciding of controversies, making of Canons, using the keyes, and managing of other Ecclesiasticall matters: in which case Princes might and did by their coactive temporall Iurisdiction, avoid dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, errour and superstition, and cause a Reformation of the Church.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Princes have likewise in rightly constituted and well reformed Churches, by their owne Regall authority, straitly injoyned things pertaining to the worship of God: but those things were the very same which Gods owne written Word had expressely commanded.</p>
               <p n="7">7. When Princes went beyond these limits and bounds, they tooke upon them to judge and command more then God hath put within the compasse of their power</p>
               <p>But as touching the passages of holy Sripture whichthe B. allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, <label type="milestone">

Chap. 17. vers.</hi> 19. where the King was appointed to have the Booke of the Law of God with him, that he might learne to feare the Lord his God, and to keep all the words of this Law and these Statutes to doe them. What Logicke (I pray) can from this place inferre that Princes have the supreme power of governing all Ecclesiasticall causes? Next, the B. tells us of <hi>Davids</hi> appointing of the offices of the Levites, and dividing of their courses, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. and his commending of the same to <hi>Solomon, 1. Chron</hi> 28. But he might have observed, that <hi>David</hi> did not this as a King, but as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet or man of God. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 8. 14. yea those orders and courses of the Levites, were also commanded by other Prophets of the Lord. 2. <hi>Chron</hi> 29. 25. As touching <hi>Solomons</hi> appointing of the courses and charges of the Priests, Levites, &amp; Porters, he did it not of himselfe, nor by his owne Princely authority, but because <hi>David</hi> the man of God had so commanded, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 8 14. For <hi>Solomon</hi> received
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:3270:124"/>
from <hi>David,</hi> a patterne for all that which he was to doe in the worke of the house of the Lord, and also for the courses of the Priests and Levites, 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 11. 12 13.</p>
               <p>The B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>comes on and tells us that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did applie his Regall <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> power to the Reformation of the Levites, and of the worship of God in their hands; <note n="o" place="margin">2. Chro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 29. 5.</note> saying: <hi>Heare me yee Levites, sanctify now your sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves and sanctify the house of the Lord God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthinesse out of the holy place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> He exhorted them to no more then Gods Law required of them. For the Law ordained them to sanctify themselves, and to doe the service of the house of the Lord, <hi>Num.</hi> 8. 6. 11. 15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18. 32. So that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did here constitute nothing by his owne arbitrement and authority, but plainly sheweth his warrant, <hi>vers.</hi> 11. <hi>The Lord hath chosen you to stand before him, to serve him, and that you should minister unto him.</hi> But the B, further alleadgeth out of 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 31. that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> appointed the courses of the Priests and Levites, every man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his service.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> He might have read 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 25. that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did all this according to the commandement of <hi>David &amp; of God the Kings Seer, and Nathan the Prophet: for so was the commandement of the Lord by his Prophets.</hi> And who doubteth but Kings may command such things as God hath commanded before them.</p>
               <p>The next example which the B. alleadgeth, is out of 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label> where we read that <hi>Iosias</hi> did set the Priests and Levites againe in their charges. Which example cannot prove that Kings have the supreme power of governing Ecclesiasticall causes, unlesse it be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that <hi>Iosias</hi> changed those orders and courses of the Levites &amp; Priests, which the Lord had commanded by his Prophets 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 25. and that he did institute other orders by his owne Regall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Whereas the contrary is manifest from the Text. For <hi>Iosias</hi> did only set the Priests and Levites those charges and courses, which had been assigned unto them after the writing of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon vers.</hi> 4. and by the commandement of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Asaph,</hi> and <hi>Heman,</hi> and <hi>Ieduthun</hi> the Kings Seer, <hi>vers</hi> 15. Neither did <hi>Iosias</hi> command the Priests and Levites, any other service then that which was wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the booke of <hi>Moses vers.</hi> 12. So that from his example it only followeth, that when Princes see the state of Ecclesiasticall persons corrupted, they ought to interpose their authority for reducing them to those orders and functions, which Gods Word comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the B. objecteth the example of <hi>Ioash:</hi> who, while he <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label> yet did right in the dayes of <hi>Iehojada</hi> the Priest, <note n="p" place="margin">2.

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:3270:124"/>
the Keeper of the holy money, did both prescribe how it was to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>eboursed, and likewise take from good <hi>Iehojada</hi> the Preist the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of the same. Now, where he hath read that <hi>Ioash</hi> made himselfe the keeper of the money and prescribed how it should be deboursed, also that he tooke the administration <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>rom <hi>Iehojada;</hi> I can not guesse, or the Text hath no such thing in it, but the contrary, viz. that the Kings Scri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e, and the High Preists Officer, keeped the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and deboursed the same, as the King and <hi>Iehojada</hi> prescribed unto them. As to that which he truly alleadgeth out of the holy Text, I answer, 1. The collection for repairing the house of the Lord was no humane ordinance, for <hi>Ioash</hi> sheweth the Commandement of <hi>Moses</hi> for it, <hi>Vers.</hi> 6. having reference to <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 12. 13. 14. No other collections did <hi>Ioash</hi> impose, <note n="q" place="margin">
                     <hi>I.</hi> Wolph. in 2. Reg. 12.</note> but those <hi>quae divino sure debebantur.</hi> 2. As for the taking of the charge of this collection from the Priests, he behooved to doe so, because they had still ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected the worke, when the three &amp; twentie yeare of his raigne was come. And so say we, that when the ministers of the Church faile to doe their duty, in providing that which is necessary for the service of God, Princes ought by some other meanes to cause these things be redressed. 3. <hi>Joash did nothing with these money<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>s without Iehojada, but</hi> 
                  <note n="r" place="margin">Id. I. bid.</note> 
                  <hi>Pontifex eas primum laborantibus tribuit, tum in aedis s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>.</hi> 4. And what if he had done this by himselfe? I suppose no man will reckon the hiring of Masons and Carpenters, with such as wrought Iron and Brasse, or the gathering of money for this purpose, among spirituall things or causes. 5. And if these employments about <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple were not to be called Spirituall or Ecclesiasticall, farre lesse about our materiall Churches, which are not holy nor consecrated as <hi>Solomons</hi> was for a typicall use. Wherefore without all prejudice to our cause, we may and doe commend the building and repairing of Churches by Christian Princes.</p>
               <p>But the B. returneth to another Example in <hi>Solemon,</hi> which is the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>10</label> putting of <hi>Abjathar</hi> the chief Priest from his Office, and surrogating of another in his place. <hi>Answ. Abjathar</hi> was civilly dead, as the Lawyers use to speake, and it was only by accident or by consequent that <hi>Solomon</hi> put him from his Office: he sent him away to <hi>Anathoth,</hi> because of his treasonable following and aiding of <hi>Adonijah,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon necessarily followed his falling away from the honour, dignity and Office of the High-Priest: whence it only followeth, that if a Minister be found guilty of <hi>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>se Majesty,</hi> the King may punish him either with banishment or proscription, or some such civill punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereupon by consequence will follow his falling from his Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall office and dignity. 2. As for <hi>Solomons</hi> putting of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dok</hi> in the roome of <hi>Abjathar,</hi> it maketh as litle against us, for <hi>Zadok</hi> did fall to the place <hi>jure divino.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:3270:125"/>
The honour and office of the High-Priesthood was given to <hi>Elia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer</hi> the Elder Sonne of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and was to remaine in his family. How it came to passe that it was transferred to <hi>Eli,</hi> who was of the family of <hi>Ithamar,</hi> we read not. Alwayes after that <hi>Abjathar,</hi> who was of the family of <hi>Ithamar,</hi> and descended of <hi>Eli,</hi> had by a capitall crime fallen from it, it did of very right belong to <hi>Zadoke,</hi> who was the chiefe of the family of <hi>Eliazer.</hi> And so all this flowed, not from <hi>Solomons,</hi> but from Gods owne authority.</p>
               <p>The B. remembreth another example in <hi>Hezekiah</hi> to, telling us <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>11</label> that he removed the high places, and brake the Images, and cut downe the groves, and brake in peeces the brazen serpent, when the children of Israel did burne incense vnto it. Now, we wish from our hearts, that from this example all Christian Kings may learne to remove and destroy the monuments of Idolatry out of their Dominions. And if it be said that in so doing, Kings take vpon them to governe by their Princely authority, an Ecclesiasticall or spirituall cause; It is easily answered that when they destroy Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous monuments, they doe nothing by their owne authority, but by the authority of Gods Law, <note n="s" place="margin">Exod. 33 13. &amp; 34. 13. 14. Deut 7 5. Isa. 30. 22.</note> which commandeth to abolish such monuments, and to root out the very names of Idolls: which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement is to be executed by the coaction of temporall power.</p>
               <p>Finally, saith the B. the Kings of the Iewes <note n="t" place="margin">1. Kings 23. &amp; 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> True it is, <hi>Iosias</hi> did reade the Law of the Lord to the people in the Temple, and made a covenant before the Lord, but 1. He prescribed nothing at his owne pleasure, only he required of the people to walke after the Lord, and to keepe his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Neither yet did he this worke by himselfe, but did convocate a Counsell of the Prophets Priests and Elders of Israel, for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of that reformation, 2. <hi>Kings.</hi> 23. 1.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And if he had done it by himselfe, yet we are to remember that the reformation of a Church generally and greatly corrupted, craveth the more immediate intermedling of Princes, and a great deale more then can be ordinarily and orderly done by them, in a Church already reformed. The slaying of the Idolatrous Priests had also the warrant and authority of the Law of God, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a capitall punishment for blasphemers, <note n="a" place="margin">Zanch. in 3. praec. 575. 576. 577. 578.</note> or such as in

contempt of God, and to rub some ignominie upon his name, did traduce his doctrine and religion, and either detract from him and attribute to Idolls that which appertained properly unto him, or else attributed unto him either by enunciation or imprecation, such things as could not stand with the glory of the Godhead. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the abolishing of Idolatry and all the reliques thereof, we have answered that it was commaunded by God. The keeping of the passeover was also commaunded in the Law: so that when <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> enjoyned it, he did but publish Gods owne expresse ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
               <p>Last of all touching the two remanent examples. 1. The Feast of the Dedication was not ordained by the sole authority of <hi>Iudas,</hi> but <note n="b" place="margin">1. Mac. 4. 59.</note> by his brethren and by the whole Congregation of Israel: and the dayes of <hi>Purim</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Est. 9. 20. 21.</note> were established by <hi>Mordecai</hi> a Prophet.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We have else-where made it evident, that the dayes of <hi>Purim</hi> by their first Institution were only dayes of civill joy and solemnity: and that the Feast of the Dedication was not lawfully institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. <note place="margin">d Supra Cap. 6.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thus having dismissed the B. we will make us for clearing the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in hand. But before we come to shew particularly what Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <label type="milestone">

But I find my self a little digressed, after the roving absurdities <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>15</label> of some opposites. Now, therefore to returne, the second Proposition which I am here to lay downe, before I speak particularly of the pow er of Princes, is this, whatsoeuer Princes can commendably either do by themselves, or command to be done by others, in such matters as any way pertaine to the externall worship of God, must be both law ful in the nature of it, and expedient in the use of it, which conditions if they be wanting, their commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts cannot bind to obedience.</p>
               <p>For <note n="s" place="margin">Pareus in Rom. 13. 4.</note> 1. The very ground and reason wherefore we ought to obey the Magistrate, is, for that he is the Minister of God, or a Deputie set in Gods stead to us. Now, he is the Minister of God, only for our good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13 4. Neither were he Gods Minister, but his owne Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, if he should rule at his pleasure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>, and command things which serve not for the good of the Subjects. Since therefore the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements of Princes bind only so farre as they are the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of God for our good: and Gods Ministers they are not, in commanding such things as are either in their nature unlawfull, or in their use inconvenient: it followeth that such commaundements of theirs cannot bind.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Princes cannot claime any greater power in matters Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, then the Apostle Paul had, or the Church her selfe yet hath: that is to say, Princes may not by any Temporall or Regall Iurisdiction urge any Ceremony or forme of Ecclesiasticall Policy, which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle once might not, and the Church yet may not urge by a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Jurisdiction. But neither had the Apostle of old, nor hath the Church now power to urge either a Ceremony or any thing else, which is not profitable for edifying. Paul could doe nothing against the truth but for the truth, and his power was given him to edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and not to destruction, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 8 10. Neither shall Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call persons to the worlds end receive any other power, beside that which is for the perfecting of the Saints, and for the edifying of the body of Christ. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 12. Therefore as <note n="s" place="margin">D. Forb. Iren. lib 2 cap 4s. 10.</note> the Churches power is only to prescribe that which may edify, so the power of Princes is in like sort given to them for edification, and not for destruction, neither can they doe ought against the truth, but only for the truth.</p>

               <p>A third Proposition I premit, which is this. Since the power <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>16</label> of Princes to make Lawes about things Ecclesiasticall, is not absolute, but bound and adstricted vnto things lawfull and expedient, which sort of things, and no other, we are allowed to doe for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements: and since Princes many times may and doe not only transgresse those bounds and limits, but likewise pretend that they are within the same, when indeed they are without them, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne things vnlawfull and in convenient, vnder the name, title, and shew of things lawfull and convenient: Therefore it is most necessary as well for Princes to permit, as for Subjects to take liberty to trie and examine by the judgement of discretion, everie thing which auctority enjoyneth whether it be agreeable or repuguant to the rules of the word, and if after triall it be found repugnant to abstaine from the doing of the same.</p>
               <p>For 1. The word teacheth us, that the spirituall man judgeth all things 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 15. trieth the things that are different. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 10. hath his sences exercised to discerne both good and evill. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 5. 14. and that every one who wold hold fast that which is good, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine from all appearance of evill, must first prove all things. 1. <hi>Thessal.</hi> 5. 21.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whatsoever is not of faith is sinne Rom. 14. 23.

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Everie one of vs shall give account of himself to God.</hi> But as we cannot give an account to God of those actions which wee have done in obedience to our Prince, except we have examined<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But the Law of a Prince (if we should without triall and examination take it for our rule,) cannot be such a stable and sure rule.

Except this Iudgement of discretion which we plead for, be permitted unto us, it will follow that in the point of obedience we ought to give no lesse, but as much honour unto Princes, as unto God himselfe: For when God publisheth his Commandements unto us, what greater honour could we give him by our obedience, then to doe that which he commandeth, for his owne sole will and authority, without making further enquiry for any other reason.</p>

But (goodmen) will they tell us, how wee shall know, whether the things which the King, or the Church (as they speake) doe injoyne, are lawfull or unlawfull, indifferent, or not indifferent; and so we shall be at a point. Dare they say, that we must judge those things indifferent which our Superiours judge to be such, and those unlawfull, which our Superiours so judge of? Nay, then they should deliver their distinction in other tearmes, and say thus: If our Superiours injoyne any thing which they judge to be unlawfull, and which they command us so to account of, then we ought to obey God rather then men: but if they injoyne such things as they judge to be indifferent, and which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us so to account of, then we ought to obey their Ordinance. Which distinction me thinks, would have made <hi>Heraclitus</hi> himselfe to fall a lauging with <hi>Democritus.</hi> What then remaineth? Surely our Opposites must either say nothing, or else say with us, that it is not onely a Liberty but a duty of Inferiours, not to receive for a thing lawfull that which is injoyned by Superiours, because they account it and call it such, but by the judgement of their owne discretion following the rules of the Word, to trie and examine, whether the same be lawfull or unlawfull.</p>
               <p>These <hi>Praecognita</hi> beeing now made good, come wee to speake <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>XVIII</label> more particularly of the Power of Princes to make Lawes and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances about things which concerne the Worship of God. The purpose we will unfold in three distinctions, 1. of things. 2. of times 3. of ties. First, let us distinguish two sorts of things in the Worship of God, viz. things substantiall, &amp; things circumstantiall. To things substantiall we referre as well sacred and significant Ceremonies as the more necessary and essentiall parts of Worship, and in a word, all things which are not mere externall circumstances such as were not particularly determinable within those bounds which it pleased God to set to his written Word, and the right ordering whereof, as it is common to all humane societies whether civill or sacred, so it is investigable by the very light and guidance of naturall reason. That
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:3270:129"/>
among this kind of mere circumstances, sacred signifiant Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies can not be reckoned, we have otherwhere made it evident. Now therefore of things pertaining to the substance of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, whether they be sacred Ceremonies, or greater and more neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary duties, we say that Princes have not power to injoyne any thing of this kynd, which hath not the plaine and particular Institution of God himself in Scripture. They may indeed and ought to publish Gods owne ordinances and commandements, and by their coactive temporall power urge and inforce the observation of the same. Notwithstanding it is a Princes duty, <note n="c" place="margin">Danaus pol. Chryst. lib. 6. Cap. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>that in the worship of God, whether internall or externall, he move nothing, he prescribe nothing, except that which is expressely delivered in Gods owne written Word.</hi> We must beware we confound not things which have the plaine warrant of Gods Word, with things devised by the will of man. <hi>David, Iehosaphat, Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah, Iosiah,</hi> and other Kings among the people of God, did as well laudably as lawfully, injoyne and command that worship and for me of Religion, which God in his Law and by his Prophets commanded; and forbid, avoid, and abolish such corruptions, as God had for bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den before them, and appointed to be abobished: whence it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not that Kings may in joyne things which want the warrant of the word, but only this much, which we all commend, viz. <note n="d" place="margin">Zanch. in 4. praec. col. 791. Polan. synt. lib. 10. cap. 65.</note> 
                  <hi>That a Christian Princes office in Religion, is diligently to take care that in his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or kingdome, Religion out of the pure word of God, expounded by the word of God it self, and understood according to the first Principles of faith (which others call the analogy of faith) either be instituted; or beeing instituted be kept pure; or beeing corrupted be restored and reformed: that false doctrines, abuses, Idolls, and superstitions, be taken away to the glory of God, and to his owne and his Subjects salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in all the Scripture Princes have neither a commendable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>XIX</label> not any other warrant, for the making of any innovation in Religion, or for the prescribing of sacred significant Ceremonies of mens devising. <hi>Ieroboam</hi> caused a change to be made in the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and forme of Gods worship.

Whereas God ordained the sonnes of <hi>Aaron</hi> onely to be his Priests, <hi>Ieroboam</hi> made Priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sonnes of <hi>Levi.</hi> Whereas God ordained the feast of Tabernacles to be kept on the fifteenth day of the seaventh moneth, <hi>Ieroboam</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:3270:130"/>
it on the sisteenth day of the eight moneth. Now, if any Prince in the world might have faire pretences for the making of such innovations in Religion. <hi>Ieroboam</hi> much more. He might alledge for his changing of the signes of Gods presence, and of the place of worship, that since <hi>Rehoboams</hi> wrath was incensed against him, and against the ten Tribes which adhered vnto him, (as appeareth by <note n="f" place="margin">2. Chron. 13. 6.</note> the accounting of them to be rebells, and by <note n="g" place="margin">2. Chron 11. 1.</note> the gathering of a huge armie, for bringing the kingdome againe to <hi>Rehoboam)</hi> it was no longer safe for his subjects to goe up to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to worsh p, in which case God who required mercy more then sacrifice, would beare with their changing of a fewe Ceremonies, for the safety of mens lives. For his putting downe of the Priests and Levites, and his ordaining of other Priests which were not of the sonnes of <hi>Levi:</hi> he might pretend that they were rebellious to him, in that <note n="h" place="margin">Martir. in 1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 8. 31.</note> hey would not assent vnto his new ordinances, which he had enacted for the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and security of his Subjects, and that they did not only simply refuse obedience to these his ordinances, but in their refusall shew themselves so stedfastly minded, that they wolud refuse and with stand even to the suffering of deprivation and deposition; and not only so, but likewy se <note n="i" place="margin">2. Chron. 11. 16.</note> drew after them many others of the rest of the Tribes, to be of their judgement, and to adhere to that manner of worship which was retained in <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Lastly, for the change which he made about the season of the feast of Tabernacles, he might have this pretence, that as it was expedient for the strengthening of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <note n="k" place="margin">Martir. in 1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 8. 32.</note> to drawe and allure as many as could be had, to associat and joyne themselves with him in his forme of worship, (which could not be done if he should keep that feast, at the same time when it was keeped at <hi>Ierusalem;)</hi> so there was no lesse (if not more) order and decency in keeping it in the eight moneth, <note n="l" place="margin">Id. ibid.</note> when the fruits of the ground were perfectly gathered in (for thankefull remembrance whereof, that feast was celebrated) then in the seaventh, when they were not so fully collected.</p>
               <p>These pretences he might have made yet more plausible, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing and avouching, that he intended to worship no Idolls, but the Lord only; that he had not fallen from any thing which was funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall and essentiall in divine Faith and Religion; that the changes which he had made, were only about some alterable Ceremonies, which were not essentiall to the worship of God; and that even in these Ceremonies he had not made any change for his owne will and pleasure, but for important reasons which concerned the good of his Kingdome and saffety of his Subjects. Notwithstanding of all this, the innovations which he made about these Ceremonies of sacred Signes, sacred Places, sacred Persons, sacred Times, are condemned for this very reason, because <note n="m" place="margin">1. Kings 22. 33.</note> he devised them of his owne heart,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:3270:130"/>
which was enough to convince him of horrible impiety in making Israel to sinne. Moreover, when king <hi>Ahaz</hi> tooke a patterne of the Altar of <hi>Damascus</hi> and sent it to <hi>Vrijah</hi> the Priest, though we can not gather from the Text, that he either intended or pretended any other respect beside <note n="n" place="margin">2. Kings 16. 10. 18.</note> the honouring and pleasuring of his Patrone and Protectour the king of <hi>Assyria,</hi> (for of his appointing that new altar, for his owne and all the peoples sacrifices, there was nothing heard till after his returne from <hi>Damascus,</hi> at which time he beganne to fall backe, from one degree of defection to a greater:) yet this very innovation of taking the patterne of an Altar from Idolaters, is marked as a sinne and a snare. Last of all, whereas many of the kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Israel,</hi> did either themselves worship in the groves and the high places, or else at least suffer the people to doe so: hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever <note n="o" place="margin">Hospin. de orig Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pl. lib. 1.

From all which examples, we learne how higly God was and is displeased with men, <note n="p" place="margin">Hospin. ibid. pag. 3.</note> for adding any other sacred Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies to those which he himselfe hath appointed.</p>
               <p>Now as touching the other sort of things which we consider in <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>XX</label> the Worship of God, namely, things merely circumstantiall, and such as have the very same use and respect in civill, which they have in sacred actions; we hold, that whensoever it happeneth to be the duty and part of a Prince, to institute and injoyne any order or policy in these circumstances of Gods Worship, then he may onely injoyne such an order, as may stand with the observing and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Rules of the Word, whereunto wee are tied in the use and practice of things which are in their generall nature indifferent.</p>
               <p>Of these Rules I am to speake in the fourth part of the Dispute. And here I say no more but this: Since the Word commandeth us <note n="q" place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 31.</note> to doe all things to the Glory of God, <note n="r" place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 26.</note> to doe all things to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, &amp; <note n="s" place="margin">Rom. 14. 5. 23.</note> to doe all things in Faith, &amp; full persuasion of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of that which we doe: therefore there is no Prince in the world who hath Power to command his Subjects, to doe that which should either dishonour God, or not honour him; or that which should either offend their brother, or not edify him, or lastly, that
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:3270:131"/>
which their conscience either condemneth, or doubteth of. For how may a Prince command that which his Subjects may not doe? But a wonder it were, if any man should so farre refuse to be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that he would dare to say, we are not bound to order whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we doe according to these Rules of the Word, but onely such matters of private action, wherein we are lest at full liberty, there beeing no Ordinance of Superiours to determine our practi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>; and that it such an Ordinance be published and propounded unto us, we should take it alone for our Rule, and no longer thinke to examine and order ourpractise by the Rules of the Word.</p>
               <p>For, 1. This were as much as to say, that in the circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stances of Gods Worship, we are bound to take heed unto Gods Rules, then onely and in that case, when men give us none of their Rules, which if they doe, Gods Rules must give place to mens Rules, and not theirs to his.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If it were so, then we should never make reckoning to God, whether that which wee have done in obedience to Superiours, was right or wrong, good or bad: and we should onely make recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of such things done by us, as were not determined by a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Law.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

Can they commaund their Subjects to doe any thing in the circumstances of Divine Worship, which is not for the Glory of God, which is not profitable for edifying, and which they can not doe in Faith? Nay, that all the Princes in the world have not such Power as this, will easily appeare to him who attendeth unto the reasons, which wee have propounded. And because men doe easily and ordinarily pretend, that their constitutions are accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Rules of the Word, when they are indeed repugnant to the same, therefore we have also proven, that Inferiours may &amp; must trie and examine every ordinance of their Superiours, and that by the judgement of private discretion, following the Rules of the Word. I say, <hi>following the Rules of the Word,</hi> because wee will never allowe a man to follow Anabaptisticall or Swenckfeldian-like en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thysiasmes and inspirations.</p>
               <p>Touching the application of what hath been said, unto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>XXII</label> Ceremonies, there needs nothing now to be added. For that they belong not to that sort of things which may be applied to civill uses, with the same respect and account which they have, being applied to religious uses, the account I meane of mere circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, serving onely for that common order and decency, which is and should be observed in civill, no lesse then in sacred actions; but that they belong to the substance of Worship, as beeing sacred significant Ceremonies, wherein both holinesse and necessity are placed, and which may not without high sacriledge be used out of the compasse of Worship, wee have elsewhere plainly evinced. And this kinde of things, whensoever they are mens devices, and not Gods Ordinances, can not be lawfully injoyned by Princes, as hath been shewed.</p>
               <p>But if any man will needs have these Ceremonies in question, to goe under the name of mere circumstances, let us put the case they were no other, yet our conforming unto them, which is urged, can not stand with the Rules of the Word.</p>
               <p>It could not be for the Glory of God, not onely for that it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive to many of Christs litle ones, but likewise for that it mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streth occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme; to Atheists, because by these naughty observances they see the Commandements of God made of litle or no effect, and many godly both Persons &amp; Purposes despised and depressed, whereat they laugh in their sleeve, and say, Aha, so would we have it; to Papists, because as by this our Conformity, they confirme themselves in sundry of their errors and superstitions, so perceiving us so litle to abhorre the Pompe &amp; Bravery of their Mother of Harlots, that we care not to borrow from her some of her meretricious trinckets, they promise to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that in the end we shall take as great a draught of the Cup of the Wine of her Fornications, as they themselves</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:3270:132"/>
Neither yet can our conforming unto the Ceremonies pressed on us, be profitable for edifying, for we have given sufficient demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of manifold hurts and inconveniences ensuing thereo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Nor lastly can we conforme to them in Faith, for as our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences can not finde, so the Word can not afford any warrant for them. Of all which things now I onely make mention, because I have spoken of them enough otherwhere.</p>
               <p>The second distinction, which may help our light in this ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <label type="milestone">

When <note n="a" place="margin">of the Church. lib. 5. cap. 53.</note> D. <hi>Field</hi> speaketh of the Power of Princes, to prescribe <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>XXIV</label> and make Lawes about things spirituall or Ecclesiasticall, he saith, That the Prince may with the advice and direction of his Cleargie, command things pertaining to Gods Worship and Service, both for Profession of Faith, Ministration of the Sacraments, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation fitting to Christians in generall, or men of Ecclesiasticall order in particular, under the paines of Death, Imprisonement, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, Confiscation of goods, and the like: and by his Princely Power establish things formerly defined and decreed against what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever error, and contrary ill custome and observation. In all this the D. saith very right: but I demaund further these two things. 1. What if the thing have not been decreed before? and what if the free assent of the Cleargie be not had for it? would the D. have said, that in such a case, the Prince hath not Power by himselfe &amp; by his owne sole Auctority, to injoyne it, and to establish a Law concerning it. For example, that K. <hi>Iames</hi> had not Power by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to impose the controverted Ceremonies upon the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> at that time, when as no free assent (much lesse the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) of the Cleargie, was had for them, so neither had they been formerly decreed, but Lawes and Decrees were formerly made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. If the D. would have answered affirmatively, that he had this Power, then why did he in a scornefull dissimulation, so circumscribe and limit the Power of Princes, by requiring a former decree, and the free assent of the Cleargie? If he would have answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red negatively, that he had not such Power, wee should have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him thankes for his answer. 2. Whether may the Cleargie make any lawes about things pertaining to the Service of GOD which the Prince may not as well by himselfe and without them, constitute and authorize? If the affirmative part bee graunted unto us, we gladly take it. But we suppose D. <hi>Field</hi> did, and our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posites yet doe hold the negative. Whereupon it followeth, that the Prince hath as much, yea the very same Power of making lawes in all Ecclesiasticall things which the Cleargie themselves have when they are conveened in a lawfull and free Assembly, yet I guesse from the D. words, what hee would have replied, namely, that the difference is great betwixt the Power of making Lawes about things Ecclesiasticall, in the Prince, and the same Power in the Cleargie as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled togither: for he describeth the making of a Law, to be the prescribing of something, under some paine or punishment, which he that so prescribeth hath Power to inflict. Whereby hee would make it appeare, that he yeeldeth not unto Princes, the same power of Spirituall Iurisdiction, in making of Ecclesiasticall Lawes, which agreeth to the Cleargie: because whereas a Councell of the Cleargie may frame Canons about things which concerne the Worship of God, and prescribe them under the paine of excommunication and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:3270:133"/>
other Ecclesiasticall censures, the Ordinance of Princes about such matters, is onely under the paine of some externall or bodily pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. But I answer <hi>Potestas</hi>

When the making of a Law is joyned either with the intention, or with the commination of a Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in case of transgression, this is but accidentall and adventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to the Law, not naturally or necessarily belonging to the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the same.

Good reason have our Writers to holde against Papists, that Laymen ought to have place in Councells, wherein things which concerne the whole Church are to be deliberated upon. 2.

For the more full explanation of which distinction, I liken the Prince to the will of man: the Ministers of the Church, to mans par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular sences: a Synod of the Church, to that internall sence which is called <hi>Sensus communis,</hi> the fontaine &amp; originall of all the externall: things and actions Ecclesiasticall, or such as concerne the worship of God, to the objects and actions of the particular sences: and the power of making Ecclesiasticall lawes, to that power and vertue of the common sence, whereby it perceiveth, discerneth, and judgeth of the objects and actions of all the particular sences. Now as the will commandeth the common sence to discerne and judge of the actions and objects of all the particular sences, thereafter commandeth the eye to see, the eare to heare, the nose to smell, &amp;c yet it hath not power by it selfe to exercice or bring forth any of these actions; for the will can neither see, nor yet judge of the object and action of sight, &amp;c. So the Prince may command a Synode of the Church, to judge of Ecclesiasticall things and actions, and to define what order and forme of policy is most convenient to be observed, in things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to divine worship, and thereafter he may command the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Ministers of the Church to exercise the workes of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, and to applie themselves unto that forme of Church regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and policy, which the Synode hath prescribed, yet he may not by himselfe define and direct such matters, nor make any lawes thereanent.</p>

For example, Prayers; the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:3270:134"/>
administration of the Word and Sacraments, Ecclesiasticall censure; are things necessary, and essentially belonging to the Communion of Saincts: but set dayes, set houres, set places, fasts, and if there be any such like, they belong to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and order of the Church: without which the Church can not be well edified, nor any particular member thereof rightly fashioned, and fitly set in the body. But humane things, we call, such duties as touch the life, the body, goods, and good name, as they are expounded in the seconde table of the Decalogue: for these are the things in which the wholle civill administration standeth.</hi> Behold, how the very circumstances, which pertaine to Ecclesiasticall order and decency, are exempted from the compasse of civill governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

So Phisitions judge, which meat is whollesome, which noysome: Lawyers declare, what is just, what unjust: and in all Arts and Sciences, they who professedly place their labour and study in the polishing and practising of the same, both use and ought to direct the judgements of others.</hi> Since therefore <note n="o" place="margin">Gerard. locor. theol. tom. 6. pag. 840.</note> the Ministers of the Church are those <hi>quibus Ecclesiae cura incumbit vel maxime;</hi> since they doe above and before the civill Magistrate, devote themselves to the care and knowledge of things pertaining to God &amp; his worship, where about they professe to bestow their ordinary study and painefull travell; were it not most repugnant to the law of naturall reason, to say, that they ought not to direct, but be directed by the Magistrate in such matters?</p>

Since therefore the making of Lawes, about such things without which the worship of God can not be orderly nor decently (and so not rightly) performed, concerneth the spirituall good and benefit of the whole Church, and of all the members thereof; it followeth, that Christ hath committed the power of judging, defin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and making lawes about those matters, not to Magistrats, but to the Ministers of the Church.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <note n="q" place="margin">Hebr. 13. 17.</note> The Apostle speaking of the Church Ministers, saith, <hi>Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit your selves: for they watch for your soules as they that must give account.</hi> Whence we gather, that in things pertaining to God, &amp; which touch the spirituall benefit of the soule, the Ministers of the Church ought to give direction, &amp; to be obeyed, as those who in things of this nature have the rule over all others in the Church, (and by consequence over Princes also,) so that it bee in the Lord.

They watch for your soules saith he, not only by preaching &amp; war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning every one, and by offering up their earnest prayers to God for you, but likewise by taking such care of Ecclesiasticall discipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, order, and policy, that they must provide and procure whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever shall be expedient for your spirituall good, and direct you in what convenient and beseeming manner, you are to performe the workes of Gods worship, as also to avoid and shunne every scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall and inconveniency, which may hinder your spirituall good. And of these things, whether they have done them or not, they must make account before the judgement seat of the great Bishop of your soules. Surely, if it belong to Princes to define and ordaine, what order &amp; policy should be observed in the Church, what formes and fashiones should be used, for the orderly and right managing of the exercises of Gods worship, how scandalls and misorders are to be shunned, how the Church may be most edified, and the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall good of the Saincts best helped and advanced, by whollesome &amp; profitable lawes, concerning things which pertaine to Religion; then must Princes take also upon them a great part of that charge of Pastors, to watch for the soules of men, and must liberat them from beeing lieable to a reckoning for the same.</p>

As actions are discerned by the objects, so are powers by the actions: If therefore Kings doe commendably by themselves make lawes, about things pertaining to Gods worship, which is an spirituall action, then have they also a spirituall power in the Church. But if they have no spirituall power, that is, no power of spirituall jurisdiction, how can they actually exerce spirituall jurisdiction? That the making of Lawes about things pertaining to Gods worship, is an action of spirituall jurisdiction, it needeth not great demonstration. For, 1. When a Synod of the Church maketh Lawes, about such things, all men know that this is an action of spirituall jur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>. And how then can the Princes making of such lawes, be called an action of civill, not of spirituall jurisdiction? I see not what can be answered, except it be said, that the making of those lawes by a Synod is an action of spirituall jurisdiction, because they are made and published with the commination of spirituall and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall punishments, in case of transgression; but the making of them by the Prince, is an action of civill jurisdiction only, because he prescribeth and commandeth, under the paine of some temporall losse or punishment.

Actions take their species or kynd from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and the end, when other circumstances hinder not. Now a Prince his making of Lawes about things pertaining to Religion, is such an action of Iurisdiction, as hath both a spirituall end, which is the edification of the Church and spirituall good of Christians, and likewise a spirituall object, for that all things pertaining to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worship, even the very externall circumstances of the same, are rightly called things spirituall and divine, not civill or human, our Opposites can not denie, except they say, not only that such things touch the lives, bodies, estates, or names of men, and are not ordained for the spirituall benefit of their soules, but also that the Synod of the Church, whose power reacheth only to things spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, not civill or human, can never make Lawes about those cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
<pb facs="tcp:3270:136"/>
which are applied unto and used in the worship of God. And as the Prince his making of Lawes about things of this nature, is in respect of the object and end, an action of spirituall jurisdiction, so there is no circumstance at all, which varieth the kind, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it an action of civill jurisdiction only. If it be said that the circumstance of the person changeth the kynd of the action, so that the making of Lawes about things pertaining to Religion, if they be made by Ecclesiasticall persons, is an action of spirituall juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, but if by the civill Magistrat, an action of civill jurisdiction: this were a most extreamely unadvised distinction: for so might <note n="z" place="margin">2.

                  <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mero</hi> saith, that it is the part of a Prince to take care for the health of mens soules, even as he doth for the health of their bodies, and that as he provideth not for the curing or preventing of bodily deseases directly and by himself, but indirectly and by the Phisitions, so he should not by himself prescribe cures &amp; remedies for mens spirituall maladies. <hi>Perinde Principis est curare salutem animarum, ac ejusdem est sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luti corporum prospicere: non est autem Principis providere ne morbi grassentur directe, esset enim Medicus, at in directe tamen Princeps id sludere debet.</hi> Whence it followeth, that even as when some bodily sicknesse sprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, a Princes part is not to prescribe a cure, but to command the Phisitions to doe it: just so, when any abuse, misorder, confusion, or scandall in the Church, requireth or maketh it neecssary that a mutation be made of some rite or order in the same, &amp; that whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Lawes be enacted, which may serve for the order, decency, &amp; edification of the Church, a Prince may not doe this by himself, but may only command the Pastors and Guides of the Church, who watch for the soules of men, as they who must give account, to see to the exigency of the present state of matters Ecclesiasticall, and to provide such Lawes as they beeing met togither in the name of the Lord, shall after due and free deliberation, find to be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, and which being once prescribed by them, hee shall by his royall auctority confirme, establish, and presse.</p>
               <p>Needs now it must be manifest, that the lawfullnesse of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming unto the Ceremonies in question, can be no way warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>XXIX</label> by any ordinance of the Supreame Magistrat, or any power which he hath in things spirituall or Ecclesiasticall. And if our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posites would ponder the reasons we have given, they should be quickely quieted, understanding that before the Princes ordinance about the Ceremonies can be said to bind us, it must first be shewed that they have beene lawfully prescribed by a Synod of the Church. So that they must retire and hold them at the Churches ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. And what needeth any more? let us once see any lawfull or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of the Synod or Church representative for them we shall without any more adoe aknowledge it to be out of all doubt, that his Majesty may well urge Conformity unto the same.</p>
               <p>Now of the Churches power we have spoken in the former Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter. And if we had not, yet that which hath beene said in this Chapter, maketh out our point. For it hath beene proven, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther King nor Church hath power to command any thing, which is not according to the rules of the Word, that is, which serveth not for the glory of God, which is not profitable for edifying, &amp; which
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:3270:137"/>
may not be done in faith, unto which rules whether the things which are commanded us, be agreeable or not, we must trie and examine by the privat judgement of Christian discretion, following the light of Gods Word.</p>
               <p>Resteth the third distinction, whereof I promised to speake, &amp; that <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>XXX</label> was of Ties or Bonds. <hi>Quaedam obligatio, &amp;c. Some bond</hi> (saith <note n="e" place="margin">locor. theol. tom. 6. p. 963.</note> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard) <hi>is absolute, when the Lavv bindeth the conscience simply, so that in no respect, nor in no case, without the offence of God, and vvound of conscience, one may depart from the prescript thereof: but another bond is hypotheticall, vvhen it bindeth not simply, but under a condition, to vvit, if the transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Lavv be done of contempt; if for the cause of lucre or some other vitious end; if it have scandall joyned vvith it.</hi> The former way he saith that the Law of God and Nature bindeth, and that the Law of the civill Magistrat bindeth the latter way. And with him we hold, that whatsoever a Prince commandeth his Subjects in things any way pertaining to Religion, it bindeth only this latter way; and that hee hath never power to make Lawes, binding the former way. For confirmation wherefore wee say,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Lawes of an Ecclesiasticall Synod, to the obedience where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in things belonging to the worship of God, we are farre more strictly tied, then to the obedience of any Prince in the world, who (as hath beene shewed) in this sort of things, hath not such a voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion nor power to make Lawes: the Lawes (I say) of a Synod can not bind absolutely, but only conditionally, or in case they can not be transgressed without violating the Law of Charity, by contempt shewed, or scandall given. Which as I have made good in the first part of this Dispute; so let me now produce for it a plaine testimony of <note n="f" place="margin">de Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce controv. c. 16. pag. 86. 87.</note> the Bishop of <hi>Sarisburie,</hi> who holdeth that the Churches rites and ordinances, doe only bind in such sort, <hi>ut si extra, &amp;c. That if out of the case of scandall or contempt, through imprudence, oblivion, or some rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable cause inforcing, they be omitted, no mortall sinne is incurred before God. For as touching these constitutions, I judge the opinion of</hi> Gerson <hi>to be most true, to vvit, that they remaine unviolated, so long as the Lavv of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is not by men violated about the same.</hi> Much lesse then, can the Lawes of Princes about things Spirituall or Ecclesiasticall, bind absolutely, and out of the case of violating the Law of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. If we be not bound to receive and aknowledge the Lawes of Princes as good and equitable, except only in so farre, as they are warranted by the Law of God and Nature, then we are not bound in conscience to obey them, except only conditionally, in case the violating of them include the violating of the Law of God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But the former is true. Therefore the latter. It is Gods pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar soveraignety, that his will is a rule ruling but not ruled, and that therefore a thing is good, because God will have it to be good.
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:3270:138"/>
Mans will is only such a rule, as is ruled by higher rules, and it must be knowne to be <hi>norma recta,</hi> before it can be to us <hi>norma recti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. If we be bound te trie and examine by the judgement of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion (following the rules of the Word,) whether the things which Princes command be right, and such as ought to be done, and if we find them not to be such, to neglect them; then their Lawes can not bind absolutely and by themselves, (else what need were there of such triall and examination?) but only conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and in case they can not be neglected without violating some other Law, which is of a superior bond. But the former wee have proven by strong reasons. Therefore the latter standeth sure.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If neither Princes may command, nor wee doe any thing, which is not lawfull and expedient, and according to the other rules of the Word, then the Lawes of Princes bind not absolutely, but only in case the neglecting of them can not stand with the Law of Charity, and the rules of the Word. But the former hath beene evinced and made good. Therefore the latter necessarily follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If the Lawes of Princes could bind absolutely and simply, so that in no case without offending God &amp; wounding our conscience, we could neglect them, this bond should arise either from their owne auctority, or from the matter and thing it self which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. But from neither of these it can arise. Therefore from nothing. It can not arise from any auctority which they have, for if by their auctority we meane their Princely preeminence &amp; dignity, they are Princes, when they command things unlawfull, as well, as when they command things lawfull, and so if because of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence their Lawes doe bind, then their unlawfull ordinances doe bind, no lesse then if they were lawfull: but if by their auctority, we meane the power which they have of God to make Lawes, this power is not absolute, (as hath beene said,) but limited: therefore from it no absolute bond can arise, but this much at the most, that <note n="g" place="margin">Perkins on <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Kings on earth must be obeyed, so farre as they command in Christ.</hi> Neither yet can the bond be absolute in respect of the thing it self which is commanded.</p>
               <p>When Princes publish the commandements of God, the things them selves binde, whether they should command them or not: but we speake of such things as Gods Word hath left in their nature indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, &amp; of such things we say, that if being injoyned by Princes they did absolutely binde, then they should be in themselves immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly necessary, even secluding, as well the Lawes of Princes which injoyne them, as the end of order, decency, and edification, where unto they are referred. To say no more, hath not <note n="h" place="margin">Iren. lib. 2. cap. 4. §. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>D For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>besse</hi>

told us in <hi>Calvines</hi> words, <hi>Notatu dignum, &amp;c. It is vvorthy of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation that human Lavves, vvhether they be made by the Magistrat or by the Church, hovvsoever they be necessary to be observed,</hi> (I <hi>speake of such as are good &amp; just,) yet they doe not therefore by themselves binde the conscience, because the vvhole necessity of observing them, looketh to the generall end, but consisteth not in the things commanded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Whatsoever bond of conscience, is not confirmed and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the Word, is before God no bond at all. But the absolute bond, wherewith conscience is bound to the obedience of the Lawes of Princes, is not confirmed nor warranted by the Word. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Proposition no man can denie who aknowledgeth, that none can have power or dominion over our consciences, but God only, <note n="i" place="margin">Ia. 4. 12.</note> the great Lawgiver, who alone can save and destroy. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth any Writer whom I have seene, hold that Princes have any power over mens consciences, but only that conscience is bound by the Lawes of Princes, for this respect, because God who hath power over our consciences, hath tied us to their Lawes. As to the assum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, he who denieth it, must give instance to the contrary. If <note n="k" place="margin">Rom. 23. 5.</note> those vvords of the Apostle be objected; <hi>Yee must needs be subject, not only for vvrath, but also for conscience sake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The Apostle saith not, that we must obey, but that we must be subject, for conscience sake. And how oft shall we need to tell our Opposites, that subjection is one thing, &amp; obedience another?</p>
               <p n="2">2. If he had said, that we must obey for conscience sake, yet this could not have beene expounded of an absolute bond of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, but only of an hypotheticall bond, in case that which the Magistrat commandeth, can not be omitted, without breaking the Law of Charity. If it be said againe that we are not only bidden be subject, <note n="l" place="margin">Tit. 3. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> but likewise to obey Magistrats. <hi>Ans.</hi> And who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth this? But still I aske, are we absolutely and allwayes bound to obey Magistrats? Nay, but only when they command such things as are according to the rules of the Word, so that either they must be obeyed, or the Law of Charity shall be broken: in this case, and no other, we are bidden obey.</p>
               <p>Thus have we gained a principall point, <hi>Viz,</hi> That the lawes of <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>XXXI</label> Princes bind not absolutely but conditionally, nor <hi>propter se,</hi> but <hi>propter aliud.</hi> Whereupon it followeth, that except the breach of those ceremoniall Ordinances wherewith we are pressed, include the breach of the law of Charity, which is of a superior bond, we are not holden to obey them. Now that it is not the breach, but the obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of those ordinances, which violateth the law of Charity, we have heretofore made manifest, and in this place we will adde only one generall. Whensoever the lawes of Princes about things Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, doe bind the conscience conditionally, &amp; because of some other law of a superior bond, which can not be observed if they be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed;
<pb facs="tcp:3270:139"/>
(which is the only respect for which they bind, when they bind at all;) then the things which they perscribe belong either to the conservation, or purgation of Religion. But the controverted Ceremonies belong to neither of these. Therefore the lawes made thereanent bind not, because of some other law which is of a supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior bond. As to the Proposition, will any man say that Princes have any more power, then that which is expressed in the 25 Article of the Confession of Faith, ratified in the first Parliament of King <hi>Iames</hi> the 6. which saith thus, <hi>Moreover, to Kings, Princes, Rulers, and Magistrats, we a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

His reason is, because they set before our sences such an externall majesty and splendor, whereby they cause the more reverence. This hee alledgeth for the utility of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And I would know, what better reason can be alledged for the utility of ours. But if this be all, we throwe backe the Argument, because the externall majesty and splendor of Ceremonies doth greatly prejudge and obscure the spirit and life of the worship of God, and diverteth the minds of men from adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vnto the same: which we have offered to be tried by common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. <hi>Durand</hi> himself, for as much as he hath written in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Ceremonies, in his unreasonable <hi>Rationale,</hi> yet <note n="s" place="margin">Rat. lib. 1. tit de pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur &amp; cortin.</note> he maketh this plaine confession. <hi>Sane in primitiva Ecclesia, Sacrificium fiebat in vasis ligneis &amp; vestib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb facs="tcp:3270:140"/>
corrupted Church, all men know that purgation standeth in putting some thing away, not in keeping it still, in voiding some what, not in retaining it: so that a Church is not purged, but left unpurged, when the unnecessary monuments of by past superstition are still preserved and kept in the same. And as for the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> least of all could there be any purgation of it intended, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming of those Ceremonies, for such was the most glorious and ever memorable reformation of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that it was farre better purged then any other nighbour Church. And of <hi>Mr. Hookers</hi> jest we may make good earnest, for in very deed as the reformation of <hi>Genevah</hi> did passe the reformation of <hi>Germany,</hi> so the reformation of <hi>Scotland</hi> did passe that of <hi>Genevah.</hi>

Wherefore it is manifest, that beside those two orders of Elders and Deacons, there is no other Ecclesiasticall order which hath any divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne institution, or necessary use in the Church.

There are two things contained in this Proposition. 1. That Princes ought to procure, that the Church never want men quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified and gifted for the worke and service of the holy Ministery, for which end and purpose they ought to provide and mantaine Schooles and Colledges, intrusted and committed to the rule and oversight of orthodoxe, learned, godly, faithfull, and diligent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, that so qualified and able men may be still furnished and sent forth for the Ministery and service of the Church. They ought also to take care that the Ministers of the Church neither want due reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence 1. <hi>Tim. 5. 17. Hebr.</hi> 13. 17.

And further, that due triall may be continually had of the growth or decay of the graces and utterance of every Pastor: it is the part of Princes to injoyne the visitation of particular Churches, and the keeping of other Presbyteriall meetings, likewise the assembling of Provinciall and Nationall Synods, for putting order to such things as have not beene helped in the particular Presbyteries. And as for the other sort of Elders, togither with Deacons, we judge the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient order of this Church, to have beene most convenient for provyding of well qualified men for those functions and offices. For the eight head of the first booke of Discipline, touching the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Elders and Deacons, ordaineth that men of best know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and cleanest life, be nominat to be in Election, and that their names be publikely read to the whole Church by the Minister, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them advertisement, that from among them must be chosen Elders and Deacons: that if any of these nominat be noted with publike infamie, hee ought to be repelled: And that if any man know others of better qualities within the Church, then these that be nominat, they should be put in election, that the Church may have the choice.</p>
                  <p>If these courses whereof we have spoken, be followed by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Princes, they shall by the blessing of God procure, that the Church shall be served with able and fit Ministers.

                     <hi>Cartwright</hi> hath for the same point, other waighty reasons. <hi>It is absurd</hi> (saith he) <hi>to imagine, that the holy Ghost by</hi> Luke, <hi>speaking with the tongues of men, that is to say, to their understanding, should use a word in that signification in which it was never used before his time by any Writer, Holy or Prophane. For how could he then be understood: if using the note and name they used, he should have fled from the signification whereunto they used it? unlesse therefore his purpose was to write that which none should read, it must needs be that as he wrote, so he meant the election by voices. And if</hi> Demosthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes <hi>for knowledge in the tongue would have beene ashamed, to have noted the laying downe of hands by a vvord that signifieth the lifting of them up: they doe the holy Ghost (vvhich taught</hi> Demosthenes <hi>to speake) great injury, in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing this unpropriety and strangenesse of speach unto himself: vvhich is yet more absurd, considering that there vvere both proper vvords to utter the laying on of hands by, &amp; the same also used in the translation of the 70: vvhich</hi> Luke <hi>for the Gentiles sake did as it may seeme (vvhere he conveniently could) most follovve.

to keep the vvords of the 70.

                  </p>
                  <p>But it is objected that Luke saith not of the whole Church, but only of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> that they made them by voices Elders in every citty.</p>

Even as in those places where Princes are elected, the election gives them <hi>jus ad rem</hi> (as they speake) without which, the inauguration can never give them <hi>jus in re:</hi> so a man hath from his election power to bee a Pastor, so farre as concerneth <hi>jus ad rem,</hi> and Ordination only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth him to the actuall exercing of his pastorall office, which Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination ought to be given to him only who is elected, and that because he is elected.

                     <hi>Chemnitius</hi> noteth, that when Christ after he had chosen his twelve Apostles, ordained them to preach the Gospell, to cast out Divells, and to heale diseases, we read of no Ceremony used in this Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but only that Christ gave them power to preach, to heale, and to cast out Divells, and so sent them away to the worke. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever the Church hath for order and decency used some rite in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, yet there is no such rite to be used with opinion of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, or as appointed by Christ or his Apostles. When our Writers prove against Papists, that Order is no Sacrament, this is one of their Arguments, that there is no rite instituted in the new Testament, to to be used in the giving of Orders. Yet because imposition of hands was used in Ordination, not only by the Apostles who had power to give extraordinarly the gifts of the holy Ghost, but likewise by the Presbytery or company of Elders, and <hi>Timothy</hi> did not only receive the gift that was in him, <note n="d" place="margin">2. Tim. 1. 6.</note> by the laying on of <hi>Pauls</hi> hands, as the meane, but also <note n="e" place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 14.</note> with the laying on of the hands of the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as the rite and signe of his Ordination; therefore the Church in the after ages hath still kept and used the same rite in Ordination. Which rite shall with our leave be yet retained in the Church, provyding, 1. It be not used with opinion of necessity, for that the Church hath full liberty either to use any other decent rite (not beeing determined by the Word to any one) or else to use no rite at all, beside a publike declaration, that the person there presented, is called and appointed to serve the Church in the Pastorall office,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:3270:145"/>
togither with exhortation to the said person, and the commending of him to the grace of God, the Church not beeing tied by the Word to use any rite at all in the giving of Ordination. 2. That it be not used as a sacred significant Ceremony to represent and signify, either the delivering to the person ordained, auctority to Preach and to Minister the Sacraments, or the consecration and mancipation of him to the holy Ministery, or lastly Gods bestowing of the gifts of his Spirit upon him, togither with his powerfull protection and gracious preservation in the performing of the workes of his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but only as a morall signe, solemnely to designe and point out the person ordained: which also was one of the ends and uses, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reunto this rite of laying on of hands was applyed by the Apostles themselves, as <note n="f" place="margin">ubi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra</note> 
                     <hi>Chemnitius</hi> sheweth. And so <hi>Ioshua</hi> was designed and knowen to the people of Israel, as the man appointed to be the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor of <hi>Moses,</hi> by that very signe, <note n="g" place="margin">Deut 34.</note> that <hi>Moses</hi> laid his hands on him.</p>
                  <p>As a sacred significant Ceremony we may not use it. 1. Because <note n="h" place="margin">supra cap. 5.</note> it hath beene proven, that men may never at their pleasure ascribe to any rite whatsoever, a holy signification of some mistery of Faith or duty of Piety. The Apostles indeed by the laying on of their hands, did signify their giving of the gift of the holy Ghost: but now as the miracle so the mistery hath ceased, and the Church not having such power to make the signification answere to the signe, if now a sacred or misticall signification be placed in the rite, it is but an emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and void signe, and rather minicall then misticall. 2. All such sacred rites, as have beene notoriously abused to superstition, if they have no necessary use, ought to be abolished, as <note n="i" place="margin">supra cap. 2.</note> we have also proven. Therefore if imposition of hands in Ordination, be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and used as a sacred rite, and as having a sacred signification, (the use of it not beeing necessary,) it becommeth unlawfull, by reason of the by-gone and present superstitious abuse of the same in Poperie.</p>
                  <p>Now the right and power of giving Ordination to the Ministers of the Church, belongeth primarly and wholly to Christ, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth the same with his Bride the Church. Both the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome for his part, and the Bride for her part, have delivered this power of Ordination to the Presbytery <hi>jure</hi> DIVINO. Afterward the Presbytry conferred, <hi>jure humano,</hi> this power upon them, who were specially called Bishops. Whence the tyrannicall usurpation of Bishops, hath in processe of time followed, claiming the proper right and the ordinary possession of that, which at first they had only by free concession. And thus that great Divine <note n="k" place="margin">animad. in Bell. cont. 5. l. 1. cap. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Franciscus Iunius,</hi> deriveth the power of Ordination. All which, that it may be plaine unto us, let us observe foure severall passages.</p>

Therfore he hath also delivered unto the whole Church, power to call &amp; ordaine Ministers for using the keyes: otherwise the promise might be made void, because the Ministers which shee now hath, may faile. 2. Christ hath appointed a certaine and a ordinary way, how the Church may provide her selfe of Ministers, and so may have ever in her selfe the meanes of grace and comfort sufficient to her self, according to that of <note n="m" place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 21. 22.</note> the Apostle, <hi>All things are yours, whether Paul, or Apollo, &amp;c.</hi> But if shee had not the power of ordaining Ministers unto her self, when shee needeth, then might shee some times be deprived of such an ordinary &amp; certaine way of provyding her self. 3.

To the whole Presbitery, made up of those two sorts of Elders, belonged the act of Ordination, which is mission, <note n="z" place="margin">Iun. ubi sup. not. 5. 12. Syn pur.

                     <hi>D. Forbesse</hi> for confuting them. <hi>Quod autem, &amp;c. But whereas</hi> saith hee, <hi>some have expounded the Presbitery in this place, to be a company of Bishops, except by Bishops thou would understand simple Presbiters, it is a violent inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, and a insolent meaning. And whereas others have understood the degree it selfe of Eldership, this can not sinnd, for the degree hath not hands, but hands are mens.</hi> Wherefore the D. himselfe, by the Presbitery whereof the Apostle speaketh, understandeth, (as we doe) <hi>consessus Presbiterorum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But since we can not find in the Apostles times, any other Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biterie or Assembly of Elders, beside that which hath been spoken of, how commeth it, may some say, that the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and other reformed Churches, did appoint two sorts of Presbiteriall Assemblies, one (which here we call Sessions) wherein the Pastor of the Parish, togither with those Elders within the same, whom the Apostle calleth Governements and Presidents, put order to the Governement of that Congregation; another (which here we call Presbiteries) wherein the Pastors of sundry Churches lying neare togither, doe assemble themselves? Which difficulty yet more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth, if it be objected, that neither of these two, doth in all points answer or comforme it self, unto that primitive forme of Presbite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, whereof we spake. <hi>Ans.</hi> The division and multiplication of Parishes, and the appointment of particular Pastors to the peculiar oversight of particular flockes, togither with the Plantation of Churches in Villages, as well as in Cities, hath made it impossible
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:3270:147"/>
for us to be served, with that onely one forme of a Presbitery, which was constitute in the Apostles times. But this difference of the times beeing (as it ought to be) admitted, for a inevitable cause of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the former, both those two formes of Presbyteriall mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings appointed by the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> doe not onely necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily result from that one Apostolicke forme, but likewise (the actions of them both beeing laid togither) doe accomplish all these ordinary Ecclesiasticall functions, which were by it performed.</p>
                  <p>And first, Sessions have a necessary use, because the Pastors and those Elders who assist them in the governing of their Flockes, must as well conjunctly as severally, as well publikely and private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, governe, admonish, rebuke, censure, &amp;c. As for Presbiteries, because the Parishes beeing divided, in most places there is but one Pastor in a Parish, except there should be a meeting of a number of Pastors out of divers Parishes, neither could triall be well had of the groweth or decay of the Gifts, Graces, and utterance of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Pastor, for which purpose the ninth head of the first Booke of Discipline, appointed the Ministers of adjacent Churches, to meet togither at convenient times in Townes and publike places, for the exercise of Prophecying and interpreting of Scripture, according to that forme commended to the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 29. 30. 31. 32. Nor yet could the Churches bee governed by the common counsell and advice of Presbiters, which beeing necessary by Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicke institution, and beeing the foundation and ground of our Presbiteries, it maketh them necessary too.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. After that the golden age of the Apostles was spent and away, Presbyteries finding themselves disturbed with emulations, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and factions; for unities sake, choosed one of their number, to preside among them, and to conferre, in name of the rest, the rite &amp; signe of initiation (which was imposition of hands) on them whom they ordained Ministers. This honour did the Presbytery yeeld to him who was specially and peculiarly called Bishop, <hi>jure humano:</hi> yet the act of Ordination they still reserved in their owne power. And wheresoever the act doth thus remaine in the power of the whole Presbytery, the conferring of the outward signe or rite by one in name of the rest, none of us condemneth, as may be seene in <hi>Beza, Didoclavius,</hi> and <hi>Gersonus Bucerus.</hi> Neither is there any more meant by <note n="c" place="margin">Epist. ad Evagr.</note>

He speaketh only of the custome of that time, and not of any Divine institution: for that the imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hands pertained to the Bishop alone, not by Divine institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but only by Ecclesiasticall custome, <note n="e" place="margin">ibid. nota. 10.</note>

                     <hi>D.

                     <hi>D.

But I would learne, why may not the Presbytery validly Ordaine, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by themselves, or by any one Presbyter with commission and power from them, even where there is a Bishop (and he no Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke) who consenteth not thereto: for <note n="k" place="margin">Ibid. p. 194. 195. 196.</note> the D. acknowledgeth, that not only <hi>quo ad aptitudinem,</hi> but even <hi>quo ad plenariam ordinationis executionem,</hi> the same power pertaineth to the Presbytery <hi>collegialiter,</hi> which he alledgeth, (but proveth not) that the Apostles gave to Bishops <hi>personaliter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now from all these things, Princes may learne how to reforme their owne and the Prelats usurpation, and how to reduce the orders and vocation of Ecclesiasticall persons, unto conformity with the Apostolicke &amp; Primitive patterne, from which if they goe on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to injoyne, or to permit a departing, we leave them to be judged by the King of terrours.</p>

2. The Church is fully committed, (and that directly) to the Ministers whom Christ hath set to rule over the same. Therefore they ought to take care and to provyde for all her necessities, as these who must give a count, &amp; be answerable to God for any hurt which shee receiveth, in things Spirituall or Ecclesiasticall, for which (when they might) they did not provyde a remedie: Which beeing so, it followeth, that when Princes will neither convocat Synods, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the convocating of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet if the convocating of a Synod, be a necessary meane for healing of the Churches hurt, and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall Persons be able, (through the happy occasion of a fit op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,) synodically to assemble themselves, in that case they ought by themselves to come togither, unlesse one would say, that Princes alone, and not Pastors, must give a count to God, how it hath gone with the Church, in matters Spirituall and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall.</p>

For because the Church can works by her censures and deprive them who refuse of her Communion, if they come not; yet they shall not therefore come to the Councell if they contemne the censure Therefore that no man may be able to resist, it is necessary that they be called by a coactive auctority, which can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine them who gainestand both with banishments, and bodily punishments, &amp; compell the Bishops, not onely of one Province, but also of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or Empire, to conveene.</hi> 3. In the maine and substantiall respects, the convocation of Councels pertaineth to the Ministers of the Church, that is, as Councels are Ecclesiasticall meetings, for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting order to Ecclesiasticall matters, they ought to be assembled by the Spirituall Power of the Ministers, whose part it is, to espie and note all the misorders and abuses in the Church, which must bee

righted. But because Councels are such meetings, as must have a certaine place designed for them, in the Dommions and Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Princes, needing further, for their safe assembling, a certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of their Princely protection; and finally, it beeing expedient for the better successe of Councels, that Christian Princes be present therein, either personally, or by their Commissioners, that they may understand the Councels, Conclusions, and Decrees, &amp; assenting unto the same, ratify and establish them by their Regall and Royall Auctority; because of these circumstances it is, that the consent and auctority of Christian Princes, is, and ought to be sought and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected for the assembling of Synods.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is a twofold judgement which discerneth and judgeth of Faith. The one absolute, whereby the most high God, whose supreme Auctority alone, bindeth us to beleeve whatsoever he propoundeth to be believed by us, hath in his written Word pronounced, declared, and established; what he would have us to believe concerning himself, or his worship. The other limited and subordinate: which is either publike or private. That which is publike, is either ordinary or extraordinary. The Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall or subordinate publike judgement, which I call ordinary, is the judgement of every Pastor or Doctor; who by reason of his publike vocation and office, ought by his publike Ministery to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and instruct the judgments of other men, in matters of Faith.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:3270:149"/>
Which judgement of Pastors and Doctors, is limited and restricted to the plaine warrants and testimonies of Holy Scripture, <note n="x" place="margin">Iun. cont, 1. lib. 3. cap 4. nota 17.</note> they themselves beeing onely the Ambassadours of the judge, to preach and publish the sentence which he hath established, so that a Pastor is not properly <hi>judex</hi> but <hi>Index.</hi> The subordinate publike judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is extraordinary, is the judgement of a Councell, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled for the more publike and effectuall establishment and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of one or moe points of Faith, and heads of Christian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, &amp; that in Opposition to all contrary heresie, or error, which is broached and set a foot in the Church. <note n="y" place="margin">M. Ant. de Dom. de rep. Eccl. lib. 7. c. 3. n. 32.</note> From which Councell, no Christian man who is learned in the Scriptures, may be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but ought to be admitted to utter his judgement in the same. For in the indagation or searching out of a matter of Faith, they are not the persons of men, which give auctority to their sayings, but the reasons and documents which every one bringeth for his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The subordinate judgement, which I call private, is the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Discretion, <note n="z" place="margin">Dave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t de jud. controv. cap. 25.

                  <p>Beside these, there is no other kind of judgement, which God hath allowed to men, in matters of Faith. Which beeing first ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, we say next concerning the part of Princes, that when que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions and controversies of Faith, are tossed in the Church, that which pertaineth to them, is, to convocate a Councell for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision of the matter, civilly to moderate the same, by causing such an orderly and peaceable proceeding, as is alike necessary in every grave Assembly, whether of the Church or of the Common-wealth; and finally, by their coactive temporall power, to urge and procure, that the decrees of the Councell be received, and the Faith there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in contained, professed by their subjects.</p>
                  <p>But neither may they, by their owne Auctority, and without a Councell, decide any controverted matter of Faith, nor yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving convocate a Councell, may they take upon them to command, rule, order, and dispose the disputes and deliberations according to their arbitrement; nor lastly, may they, by vertue of their Regall Dignity, claime any power to examine the Decrees concluded in the Councell, otherwise, then by the judgement of private dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, which is common to every Christian.</p>
                  <p>First, I say, they may not by themselves presume, publikely and judicially, to decide and define any matter of Faith, which is questioned in the Church: but this definition they ought to remit unto a lawfull and free Councell. <hi>Ambrose</hi> would not come to the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:3270:150"/>
Court to be judged by the Emperour <hi>Valentinian,</hi> in a matter of Faith, and asked, when ever he heard that Emperours judged Bishops in matters of Faith, seeing, if that were granted, it would follow that Laymen should dispute and deba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e matters, and Bishops heare, yea that Bishops should learne of Laymen.</p>
                  <p>The true ground of which refusall (cleare enough in it selfe) is darkened by <note n="a" place="margin">of the Church lib. 5. cap. 53.</note> 
                     <hi>D. Field,</hi> who alledgeth, 1. That the thing which <hi>Valentinian</hi> tooke on him, was, to judge of a thing already resolved in a generall Councell called by <hi>Constantine,</hi> as if it had been free, and not yet judged of at all. 2. That <hi>Valentinian</hi> was knowen to be partiall; that he was but a Novice; and the other Iudges which he meant to associate to himselfe suspected. But howsoever these cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances might serve the more to justify <hi>Ambrose</hi> his not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, to be judged in a matter of Faith by <hi>Valentinian,</hi> yet the D. toucheth not that which is most considerable, namely, the reason which he alledged for his not compearing, because it hath been at no time heard of, that Emperours judged Bishops in matters of Faith, and if that were granted, it would follow, that Bishops should learne of Laymen. Which reason holdeth ever good, even though the thing hath not beene formerly judged by a Councell.</p>
                  <p>And furthermore, if these (which the D. mentioneth) were the true reasons of his refusing to be judged by <hi>Valentinian,</hi> then why did he pretend another reason, (whereof we have heard) and not rather defend himselfe with the reall and true reasons? Wherefore we gather, that the reason which made <hi>Ambrose</hi> refuse to be judged by him, was no other then this, because he considered, that Princes neither by themselves, nor by any whom they please to choose, may, without a lawfully assembled and free Councell, usurpe a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like judgement and decisive sentence in controversies of Faith: which if they arrogate to themselves, they farre exceed the bounds of their vocation For it is not said of Princes, but of Priests, <note n="b" place="margin">Mal. 2. 7.</note> that their lippes should preserve knowledge, and that they should seeke the Law from their mouthes. And <note n="c" place="margin">2 Chron. 19. 8. 10.</note> the Priests did <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> set in <hi>Ierusalem, for the judgement of the Lord, and for controversies,</hi> and for judging betwixt Law &amp; Commandement, statutes and judgements.</p>
                  <p>In the meane while, we denie not, but that in extraordinary ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, when lawfull Councels can not be had, and when the Cleargie is universally corrupted, through grosse ignorance, perverse affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and incorrigible negligence, in such a case, the Prince not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the defect of the ordinary and regular Iudges, may yet by the Power of he civill sword, represse and punish so many as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish and spread such Doctrines, as both he and other Christians by the judgement of discretion, plainely understand from Scripture, to be hereticall.</p>
                  <p>Next I say, that the Prince having assembled a Councell, may not
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:3270:150"/>
take so much upon him, as imperiously to command what he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth good, in the disputes and deliberations, &amp; to have every thing ordered, disposed, and handled according to his minde. <hi>To debate and define Theologicall controversies, and to teach what is Orthodoxall, what Hereticall, is the office of Divines; yet by a coactive auctority to judge this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxe Faith to be received by all, and Hereticall pravity to be rejected is the office of Kings, or the supreme Magistrates in every Commonwealth,</hi> saith <note n="d" place="margin">de Iud. controv. cap. 16. pag. 92:</note> the Bishop of <hi>Sarisburie.</hi> And <note n="e" place="margin">ibid. cap. 14. p. 75,</note> againe, <hi>in Searching, Directing, Teaching; Divines, ordinarily and by reason of their calling, ought to goe be fore Kings themselves: but in commanding, establishing, compelling; Kings doe farre excell.</hi> Where he sheweth, how in defining of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies of Religion, in one respect Ecclesiasticall persons, and in another respect Kings have the first place.</p>
                  <p>In the debating of a question of Faith, Kings have not, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their Princely vocation, any precedencie or chiefe place, the action beeing meerely Ecclesiasticall. For, howbeit Kings may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate a Councell, preside also and governe the same as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the humane and politicall order, yet saith <note n="f" place="margin">ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mad. in Bell. cont. 4. lib. 1. cap. 12. nota 15</note> 
                     <hi>Iunius, Actiones, deliberationes, &amp; definitiones, ad substantiam rei Ecclesiasticae pertinentes, à Sacerdotio sunt, à caetu servorum Dei, quibus rei suae administrationem man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davit Deus.</hi> And with him the Archb. of <hi>Spalato</hi> saith in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that howbeit Christian Princes have convocated Councels, and civilly governed the same, yet they had no power nor auctority <note place="margin">
                        <hi>(g)</hi> de rep. Eccl. lib 6. cap. 5. num. 8. 30.</note> in the very discussing, handling, and deciding of matters of Faith.</p>
                  <p>What then? In the handling of controversies of Faith, have Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces no place nor power at all, beside that of Politicall governement onely? Surely by vertue of their Princely auctority, they have no other place in the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dling of these matters. Yet, what if they be men of singular learning and understanding in the Scriptures? Then let them propound their owne suffrage, with the grounds and reasons of it, even as other learned men in the Councell doe. But neither as Princes, nor as men singularly learned, may they require that others in the Councell shall dispute and debate matters, and that they themselves shall sit as Iudges having judiciall power of a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative voice. For in a Councell, no mans voice hath any greater strength, then his reasons and probations have. <hi>Non enim admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, &amp;c. For I admit not in a Councell</hi> (saith <note n="h" place="margin">de Rep. num, 33.</note> the same Prelate) <hi>some as Iudges, others as Disputators, for I have shewed that a conciliarie judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, consisteth in the approbation of that sentence, which above others hath been shewed to have most waight, and to which no man could enough oppose. Wherefore no man in the Councell ought to have a judiciarie voice, unlesse he bee withall a Disputator, and assigne a reason wherefore hee adheres to that judgement, and repels another, and that reason, such a one, as is drawen from the Scriptures onely, and from Antiquity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, I hold, that after the definition and decision of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
<pb facs="tcp:3270:151"/>
Princes may not take upon them, by any judiciall power or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike vocation, to examine the same, as if they had auctority to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce yet another decisive sentence, either ratifying or reversing what the Councell hath decreed. Most certaine it is, that before Princes give their Royall assent, unto the Decrees of any Councell whatsoever, and compell men to receive &amp; aknowledge the same, they ought first of all carefully to trie and examine them, whether they agree with the Scriptures or not, and if they find them not to agree with the Scriptures, then to denie their assent and auctority thereto. But all this Princes doe not by any judiciall power, or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike auctority, but onely by that judgement of private discretion, which they have as Christians, and which togither with them is common also to their subjects: for neither may a Master of a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commend, to his children and servants, the profession of that Faith, which is published by the Decrees of a Councell, except in like manner he examine the same by the Scriptures.</p>

It pertaineth to the whole Church, collectively taken, to deny her Christian Communion, to such wicked persons as adde contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie to their disobedience; Therefore it pertaineth to the whole Church to Excommunicat them.

Sure, the sentence of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication is pronounced in vaine, except the whole Church out of the person thus judged, from all communion with her. And the sentence of Absolution is to as litle purpose pronounced, except the whole Church admit one againe to have communion with her. Shortly, the whole Church hath the power of punishing a man, by denying her communion unto him. Therefore the whole Church hath the power of judging, that he ought to be so punished. The whole Church hath the power of remitting this punishment againe.

And this meaning is throughly drawen out of the following verse. For whatsoever ye shall binde on Earth, &amp;c. Therefore the Church ought first to binde him, before he ought to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted by me or thee for one bound, that is, Excommunicat.</hi> Now what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth Christ by the Church, to which he giveth the power of bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and loosing?

<pb facs="tcp:3270:153"/>
of the excommunication was not theirs: for their part in this action proceeded both from auctority &amp; from obedience: from auctority, absolutely: from obedience, in some respect. <hi>De jure,</hi> they had no liberty nor power not to excommunicate him, but were bound to doe that which <hi>Paul</hi> pointed out to be their duty, and in that respect he calleth them obedient: yet absolutely, and <hi>de facto</hi> it was free to them, (notwithstanding of <hi>Pauls</hi> writing to them) ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to excommunicate him, or not to excommunicate him, and if they had not by their auctority excommunicate him, hee had not been at all excommunicate by any vertue of <hi>Pauls</hi> judging of him.</p>

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:3270:157"/>
which negative Excommunication, is not an Ecclesiasticall censure' but either a bare punishment, or a cautell and animadversion; And so saith <note n="s" place="margin">Ib. cap. 9. num. 8.</note> the Archbishop of <hi>Spalato,</hi> not only one brother may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to communicat with another, but a people also may refuse to communicat with their Pastor, which he confirmeth by certaine examples.

                  <p>Now from all this, which hath beene said of the power and aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to excommunicat and absolve, it is manifest how unjustly usurping Prelats doe arrogat &amp; appropriat to themselves this power, which Christ hath committed to every particular Church or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and ordained to be execute by the Ecclesiasticall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistory within the same. Which Episcopall usurpation, as it hath beene shewed to bee most contrary to Divine Institution, so doth it also depart from the manner of the auncient Church: For it may be seene in <note n="x" place="margin">lib. 3. epist. 14. 15. 16. &amp; lib. 5. epist. 12.</note>

                  <p>And thus farre have we demonstrat to Princes, who be they, to whom Christ hath committed the power of Excommunication, that with them they may cause it to remaine, and correct the usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of Prelats, who bereave them of it.

What? Shall the Church draw, and put up againe, the Spirituall Sword, at the pleasure of Princes? Or because Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ces will perhaps cast holy things to Dogges: must others doe so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise? O prodigious licentiousnesse, and hellish misorder, worthy to be drowned in the lake of <hi>Lethè!</hi> But what then is the part of the Prince, after that the Church hath given judgement? Surely, whensoever need is, he ought by the privat judgement of Christian discretion, to trie and examine, whether this Discipline be rightly execute, or not. If he find the execution thereof to be unreprove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:3270:158"/>
and that yet the sinner goeth on in his contumacy, <note n="f" place="margin">Calv. lib. Episto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. col. 169 Gratian. caus. 11. q. 1. c. 20.</note> then by his Civill power he ought further to punish him in his person, or wordly estate, that he may either reforme or represse, such a one as hath not been terrified by the Churches censures. But if after triall, he understand that the sentence given forth is unjust and erroneous, either through the ignorance or the malice of the Ecclesiasticall and regular Iudges, then hee ought to interpone his auctority, and cause a due proceeding, for in such extraordinary cases of the failing of Ecclesiasticall persons, Princes may doe much in things and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses Spirituall, which ordinarily they can not.</p>
                  <p>It remaineth to shew, who have the power of those censures and punishments which are proper to Ecclesiasticall persons. Where first we are to consider, that there are two sorts of faults which make Ecclesiasticall men worthy to be punished, <hi>viz.</hi> either such as vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late sacred, or such as violate civill and humane duties: the one is to be judged by Ecclesiasticall Iudges alone, and that according to the Lawes of God and the Church: the other by civill Iudges alone, and that according to the civill and municipall Lawes of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. This latter sort againe is twofold, for either the fault is such, that though a man be condignely punished for it by the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Magistrate, yet he doth not therefore fall from his Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call office or dignity; of which sort experience sheweth many: or else such as beeing punished according to their quality and demerit, a man by necessary consequence falleth from the Ecclesiasticall fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and dignity which before he had; this was <hi>Abiathars</hi> case, and the case of so many as beeing justly punished by Proscription, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carceration or Banishment, are <hi>secundario &amp; ex consequenti</hi> shut from their bearing office in the Church. If <hi>Abiather had sinned in a sacred matter, the cognition thereof</hi> saith <note n="g" place="margin">contr. 4. lib. 1. e. 20. nota 8.</note> 
                     <hi>Iunius, had pertained to the Priests: but because he sinned against the Common-wealth and the Kings Majesty, it was necessary to deale with him Civilly, and not Ecclesiastically. What? are not Ecclesiasticall men in this time also thought to be lawfully judged by the Civill Magistrate, if at any time they be found guilty of appaired Majesty?</hi> As for the other sorts of saults, whereby (as we have said) Sacred and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall duties are violate, such as the teaching of False and Hereticall Doctrine, neglecting of Discipline, unbeseeming and scandalous conversation, &amp;c. which things (if they be not amended) they who have the execution of Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them, ought to punish by Suspension, Deposition, &amp;c. Now as when one is called to the worke of the Ministery, his fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and qualification for that worke, should be tried and judged by the Cleargie of the adjacent bounds assembled in their Classicall Presbitery, to whom it also pertaineth (after that he is by them tried and approven, and after that he is elected by that Church where he is to serve) to send him out from them with power to exercise the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:3270:159"/>
office of a Pastor: so when there is just cause of Suspending or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving him, it belongeth to the same Presbitery to consider and judge hereof, and according to his offence to give judgement against him. For who should recall him, but they who sent him? Or who should discharge him his Ministeriall function, except they who or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained him to exerce the same? And who may take the power from him, but they who gave the power unto him? That Ordination per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raineth to the whole Presbitery, and not to the Bishop alone, wee have shewed before: and now by the same reason we say, Suspension and Deposition pertaine to the Presbitery also, and are not in the power of the Bishop. And that in the auncient Church, as Bishops gave not Ordination, so neither did they Suspend nor Depose any man without the common Councell, Advice, and concurrence of the Presbitery, yea and sometimes of a Synod, it is cleare from <hi>Cypr. lib. 1. Epist. 9. lib. 3. Epist. 2. &amp; 10. Concil. Carthag. 3. can. 8. Concil. Carthag. 4. can. 22. 23. Concil. African. can 20. Concil. Hispal. 2 can. 6.

Neverthelesse, if any man thinke the sentence of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop and the Presbitery given forth against him, to be unjust, he ought to have liberty of recourse to the Synod, and there to bee heard, according as it was decreed by the fourth Councell of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage Can.</hi> 66.

                  <p>Princes therefore may not suffer Bishops to usurpe the power of Suspending and Depriving at their pleasure, and whensoever they commit any such tyranny in smiting of their fellow servants, it is the part of Princes to cause these things to be redressed, and for this end gratiously to receive the grievances of oppressed Ministers. The Arians of old beeing assembled in a Councell at <hi>Antioch,</hi> 
                     <note n="k" place="margin">Can. 11.</note> decreed, that if any Ecclesiasticall Person, should without the advice and the letters of the Bishops of the Province, and chiefly of the Metropolitan, goe to the Emperour to put up any grievance unto him, he should be cast out, not onely from the holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but from his proper dignity which hee had in the Church.
<pb facs="tcp:3270:159"/>
Whereupon <note n="l" place="margin">Hist. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cl. cent. 4 l. 2. c. 48. p. 242.</note> 
                     <hi>Osiander</hi> hath this observation: <hi>This Canon also was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed against holy Athanasius: for Attanasius beeing expelled by the Arrians, had fled to the Emperour Constantine the younger, and had from him obtained a returne to his owne Church. Now this Canon is very unjust, which forbids that a Bishop or any other Minister of the Church, beeing unjustly oppressed, flee to his godly Civill Magistrate: since it was lawfull to the Apostle Paul to appeale to the Romane Emperour, wicked Nero, as the acts of the Apostles wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. But it may be seen in this place, that Bishops were very soone seeking dominion, yea tyrannie over the Church, and over their Colleags.</hi> Besides all this, there is yet another thing which ought to have a very princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall consideration in the Deposition of a Minister, and that is the consent of the Church and Congregation where he hath served. Let the Magistrate know saith <note n="m" place="margin">loc. Theol. tom. 6. p. 838.</note> 
                     <hi>Gerard, that as the vocation of Ministers pertaineth to the whole Church, so to the same also pertaineth the removing of Ministers, therefore as a Minister ought not to be obtruded upon a unwilling Church, so the Hearers beeing unwilling and striving against it, a fit Minister ought not to be plucked away from them.</hi> The Deposing of a Minister whom the Church loves and willingly heares, <note n="n" place="margin">de cas. consc. l 4. cap. 5. cas. 12.</note>

                  <p>Now there was brought forth in <hi>Scotland, anno</hi> 1610. a certaine Amphibian brood, sprung out of the stem of Neronian tyranny, and in manners like to his nearest Kinsman the Spanish Inquisition. It is armed with a transcendent power, and called by the dreadfull name of the <hi>HIGH COMMISSION.</hi> Among other things, it arrogateth to it selfe, the power of Deposing Ministers. But how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly, thus it appeareth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If those Commissioners have any power at all to depose Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, they have it from the King whose Commissioners they are. But from him they have it not. Therefore they have none at all. The proposition is most certaine: for they sit not in that Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to judge in their owne name, nor by their owne auctority <hi>quum nihil exerceat delegatus nomine proprio,</hi> as <note n="p" place="margin">apud Forb. Iren lib. 2. cap. 11. p. 177.</note> 
                     <hi>Panormitan</hi> saith,) but by vertue onely of the Commission and Delegation which they have of the King. Yea, Bishops themselves exerce not any Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in the High Commission as Bishops, but onely as the Kings Commissioners, as <note n="q" place="margin">Defens. lib. 1. p. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>D. Downame</hi> aknowledgeth. The Assumption is gronnded upon this reason: The King hath not power to depose Ministers. Ergo he can not give this power to others. For <note n="r" place="margin">Bonifae. 8. de regul. Iuris reg. 79.</note> 
                     <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo potest plus juris transferre in alium quam sibi competere dignoscatur.</hi> The King may sometimes inflict such a civill punishment upon Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
<pb facs="tcp:3270:160"/>
whereupon secondarily and accidentally will follow their fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away from their Ecclesiasticall office and function, (in which sence it is said, that <hi>Solomon</hi> deposed <hi>Abiathar,</hi> as we heard before,) but to depose them directly and formally (which the High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission usurpeth to doe) he hath no power, and that because this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position is an act of Ecclesiasticall jurisdiction: Whereas the power of Ecclesiasticall jurisdiction doth no more agree to the King, then the power of Ecclesiasticall order: his power is Civill &amp; Temporall, not Spirituall &amp; Ecclesiasticall. <note n="s" place="margin">of the Church. lib. 5. cap. 53. p. 682.</note> 
                     <hi>D. Field</hi> also confesseth, that none may judicially degrade or put any one lawfully admitted, from his degree and order, but the Spirituall Guides of the Church alone.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The deposing of Ministers pertaineth to Classicall Presbite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or (if the matter be doubtfull and difficille) to Synods, as hath been shewed. And who then can give the High Commission such auctority as to take this power from them, and to assume it unto it selfe. These Commissioners professe, that they have auctority to discharge other Ecclesiasticall Iudicatories within the Kingdome from meddling with the judging of any thing which they shall thinke impertinent for them, and which they shall thinke good to judge &amp; decide by themselves in their Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mission. Which if it be so, then (when it pleaseth them) they may make other Ecclesiasticall Iudicatories to be altogether uselesse and of no effect in the Church.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In this Commission, Ecclesiasticall and Temporall men are joyned togither, and both armed with the same power. Therefore it is not right nor regular, nor in any wise allowable. For even as when a Minister hath offended in a Civill matter, his fault is to bee judged by Civill Iudges according to the Civill Lawes, and by no other: so when he offendeth in an Ecclesiasticall matter, his fault is to be judged onely by Ecclesiasticall persons according to Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall Lawes: and in such a case <note n="t" place="margin">Novell. 83. cap. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Iustinian</hi> forbiddeth Civill men to bee joyned with Ecclesiasticall men in judgement. They are Ecclesiasticall things or causes which are handled and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the High Commission in the processe of deposing Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters: and a shame it is to Ecclesiasticall men, if they can without the help and joyning of Temporall men, judge and decide things of this quality.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As in the matters to be judged, so in the censures and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments to be inflicted, Ecclesiasticall and Civill men have in this Commission alike power and auctority: for Ecclesiasticall men therein have power of Fining, Confining, Warding &amp;c. common to them with the Temporal men: and againe, the Temporall men have power of Excommunication, Suspension, Deprivation, &amp;c. common to them with the Ecclesiasticall men. For they all sit there as the Kings Commissioners, and <hi>co nomine</hi> they exerce this Iurisdiction: which Commission beeing alike discharged by them
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:3270:160"/>
all, it is manifest that both Temporall men take hold of the keyes, and Ecclesiasticall men take hold of the Civill sword. And this monstruous confusion and mixeture, giveth sufficient demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that such a forme of Iudgement is not from the God of order.</p>

               <p>And first we must understand aright, what is meant by the Law of Nature. To wit, that Law <note n="y" place="margin">Zanch. lib. 1. de lege Dei. thes. 8. col. 190.</note> which God writteth and imprinteth <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>II</label> in the Nature of man, so that it is as it were connaturall and borne togither with man.

Pau. explic. ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tech. part. 3. q. 92. pag. 503.</note> other then the Decalogue or the Morall Law. But the Law which we are here to enquire of, is that Law, which after the Fall, God still writteth in the heart of every man: which (we all know) commeth farre short, &amp; wanteth much of that which was written in the heart of man before his fall. That we may understand, what this Law of Nature is, which is written in all mens hearts, since the Fall, we must distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish <hi>jus naturale</hi> from <hi>jus Divinum naturale.</hi> For that Law which is simply called <hi>jus naturale</hi> is <hi>innatum,</hi> and layeth before the minds of men, that way, wherein <note n="a" place="margin">Fr.

they may be ledde to that good, which is in the end proportionat to nature.

               <p>For my part, I take the Law of Nature, and the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>IV</label> to be one and the same. For what is the Law of Nations, but that which Natures light &amp; reason hath taught to all Nations? now this is no other, then the Law of Nature. We thinke therefore, they have well said, <note n="l" place="margin">Rosin. ubi supra. Synops pur. theol disp. 18. thes. 16. Til. synt. part. 1. disp. 35. thes. 16. Iun. de pol.

<pb facs="tcp:3270:161"/>
and wrong, things beseeming and things not beseeming; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the generall conclusions which by necessary consequences are drawen from the said principles. To come to the particulars, there are three sorts of things which the Law of Nature requireth of man, as both <note n="m" place="margin">Aquin. ubi supra q. 94. art. 2.</note> Schoolmen, and <note n="n" place="margin">Zanch. ubi supra. col. 1889 189. Iun. ubi supra. Sharp. curse theol. de lege Dei p. 299.</note> Moderne Doctors have rightly taught. The first, it requireth as he is <hi>Ens;</hi> The second, as he is <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal.</hi> And the third, as he is <hi>Homo ratione praeditus.</hi> First, as he is <hi>Ens,</hi> the Law of Nature requireth him to seeke the conservation of his owne being, and to shunne or repell such things as may destroy the same. For so hath Nature framed, not only all living creaturs, but other things also which are without life, that they seeke their owne conservation, and flee (if they can) from appearant destruction. Let us take one example out of subtile <note n="o" place="margin">de sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til. exerc. 5. dist. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Scaliger,</hi> which is this. If a small quantity of oyle, be poured upon a sound boord, let a burning coale be put in the midst of it, and the oyle will quickly flee back from its enemy, and seeke the conservation of it self. This is therfore the first precept of the Law of Nature, that man seeke his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, and avoyde his owne destruction. Whereupon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion necessarily followeth, that he may repell violence with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Secondly, as man is a living creature, the Law of Nature teacheth him to propagate and to conserve his kynd. Whereupon these conclusions doe followe, <hi>Viz.</hi> the commixtion of Male &amp; Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, the procreation of Children, the educating of them, and provyding for them. This Nature hath taught to man, as a thing common to him with other living creatures.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as man is a creature endued with reason, the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth him, 1. Something concerning God. 2. Something <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>V</label> concerning his Nighbour. 3. Something concerning himselfe. I meane some generall notions concerning good and evill, in respect of Each of these. Whereof the Apostle meaneth, whiles <note n="p" place="margin">Rom. 2. 15.</note> he saith, that the Gentiles <hi>shewe the worke of the Law written in their hearts.</hi> First then, the Law of Nature teacheth man, to know that there is a God, and that this God is to be worshiped. Whereupon it followeth, that man should seeke to know God, and the manner of his worship. Now that which may be knowen of God, is shewed even unto the Gentiles. <note n="q" place="margin">Rom. 1. 19.</note> The Apostle saith <hi>signanter.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, meaning those few and small sparkles of the knowledge of God, which natures imbredde light discovered unto the Gentiles, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them inexcusable, namely, that there is a eternall power and Godhead, which men ought to reverence and to worship. 2. The Law of Nature teacheth man to hold fast friendship and amiti with his Nighbours, for as much as he is <hi>Animal sociale. Violare alterum</hi> saith <note n="r" place="margin">lib. 3. offic.</note> 
                  <hi>Cicero, naturae lege prohibemur.</hi> For the Law of Nature biddeth us <note n="s" place="margin">Luc. 6. 31.</note> doe to others as we wold have them to doe unto us. And from
<pb facs="tcp:3270:162"/>
these precepts it followeth, that we should not offend other men, that vve should keep promises, stand to bargains, give to every man his owne, &amp;c. 3. As touching a mans selfe, the Law of Nature teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him, that he should not live as a reasonlesse creature, but that all his actions should be such, as may be congrous and beseeming for a creature endued with reason. Wherupon it followeth, that he should live honestly and vertuously, that he should observe order &amp; decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in all his actions, &amp;c. Hence <note n="t" place="margin">Cor. 11. 14.</note> the Apostle saith, that nature it self teacheth, that it is a shame for a man to have long haire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is repugnant to that decency and comelinesse which the Law of Nature requireth. For <note n="u" place="margin">Par. com. in il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum locum.</note> among other differences which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath put betwixt men and women, this is one, that it hath given to women thicker and longer haire, then to men, that it might be as a vaile to adorne and cover them. The reason whereof, Nature hath hid in the complexion of a woman, which is more humide then the complexion of a man.

               <p>These things being premitted, I will adde foure reasons to prove, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>VI</label> that neither sacred significant Ceremonies in generall, nor Knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, Holy dayes, &amp;c. in particular, can be warranted unto us by the Law of Nature. 1.

But there was a third part concerning God &amp; his worship: &amp; here must our Opposites seeke a warrant for the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F it seeme to any, that it is a strange Methode to speake now of Indifferency, in the end of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, which ought rather to have been handled in the beginning of it: they may consider, that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode is not ours, but our Opposites. For they have been fleeing upon <hi>Icarus</hi> wings, and soaring so high that their wings could not but melt from them: so have they from necessity fallen downe to expediency; from it to law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse; and from thence to indifferency.</p>
               <p>I knew certaine of them, who after reasoning about the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, with some of our side, required in the end no more, but that they would onely aknowledge the indifferency of the things in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. And so beeing wo'ed &amp; solicitously importuned by our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Arguments against the Ceremonies, they take them to the weaving of <hi>Penelopes</hi> web, thereby to suspend us, and to gaine time against us: this indifferency I meane, which they shall never make out, and which themselves otherwhiles unweave againe. Alwayes, so long as they thinke to get any place for higher notions about the Ceremonies, they speake not so meanly of them, as of things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different. But when all their forces of Arguments, and answers are spent in vaine: then are our eares filled with uncouth outcries and declamations, which tend to make themselves appeare blamelesse for receiving, and us blameworthy for refusing matters of Rite and indifferency.</p>

               <p>But <note n="d" place="margin">Iren. lib. 1. cap. 13. §. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>D. Forbesse</hi> liketh to speake in another language. He will have that which is indifferent, to be opponed to that which is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary: and a thing indifferent he taketh to be such a thing, as is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther necessarily to be done, nor yet necessarily to be omitted, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of any necessity of the commandement of God: or such a thing as is neither remunerable with eternall life, &amp; commendeth a man unto the reward of God, nor yet is punishable with eternall death, and polluteth a man with guiltinesse. Now because he knew, that Divines define a thing indifferent to be that which is neither good nor evill. <note n="e" place="margin">Ibid. §. 10.</note> He therefore distinguisheth a twofold goodnesse of an individuall action. The one he calleth <hi>bonitas generalis, concomitans, &amp; sine qua non.</hi> By which goodnesse is meant the doing of an action
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3270:164"/>
in Faith, and the doing of it for the right end, as hee expoundeth himselfe. This goodnesse, hee saith, is necessary to every humane action, and hindreth not an action to be indifferent. The other he calleth <hi>bonitas specialis, causans, &amp; propter quam.</hi> This goodnesse hee calleth legall, and saith, that it maketh an action necessary; In which respect indifferent actions are not good, but those onely which God in his Law hath commanded, and which are remunerable with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life.</p>
               <p>But that we may have the vanity of these quiddities discovered to <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>II</label> us, let us onely consider how falsly he supposeth, that there are some things which we doe, neither laudably nor culpably, and for which we shall neither bee rewarded (it is his owne phrase which I use) nor yet punished by God. I thought we had learned from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that we must all compeare before the judgment seat of Christ, to give an account of every word which we speake, and of every deed which we doe in the flesh, and accordingly to receive either a reward or a punishment. What? could the D. say that those good actions which he calleth indifferent, and of which he saith, that they are done in Faith, and for the right end are not laudable nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munerable? Nay, but he <note n="f" place="margin">ubi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra.</note> saith, that the generall goodnesse which accompanieth the action, is remunerable, because it is necessary; but the action it selfe is not necessary, because that generall good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse may be had as well in the omission of it, or in the doing of the contrary, as in the doing of it. Whereupon he would have it to follow, that the action it selfe is not remunerable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The D. had done well to have remembred, that he is spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king onely of individuall actions, and that <hi>actus individuatur à cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantiis &amp; adjecto modo:</hi> so that whiles all that he saith, turneth to this, that one action considered in it selfe, without the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and concomitant goodnesse, is not remunerable, he maketh not out his point: for he saith no more in effect, but that <hi>actus quo ad spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciem,</hi> is not remunerable, which none of us denieth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An individuall good action of that kind, which the D. calleth necessary, is no otherwise remunerable and laudable, then an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduall good action of that kinde which he calleth indifferent, for example; when I goe to heare Gods Word upon the Lords-day; let this action of mine be considered <hi>quo ad individuum:</hi> is it any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise remunerable, then in respect of the goodnesse which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panieth it? whence it is, that the hearing of Hypocrites, not beeing accompanied with such goodnesse, is not remunerable: yet the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Word is an action necessary, because commanded. Now may we know wherein standeth the difference betwixt the remune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable good of this action of hearing, and the remunerable good of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3270:165"/>
one of those actions which the D. calleth indifferent; for example, a womans action of marrying?</p>
               <p>I perceave what the D. would answer. For he <note n="g" place="margin">ubi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra cap. 13. §. 7.</note> saith; if a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man marry in the Lord, this action is good <hi>respectu adjecti modi, quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis in se sit media &amp; libera, etiam quo ad individuum.</hi> Implying, that if on the other part an individuall action be necessary, (as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the action of hearing the Word,) then it is in it selfe good, <hi>etiam quo ad individuum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I reply, what meanes he by these words, <hi>in se?</hi> meanes he the individuall nature of the action? Nay; then the sence shall bee no other then this, <hi>quo ad individuum, etiam quo ad individuum,</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the D. can not define to us, any other nature in a individuall thing, then the nature of the species or kinde.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>III</label> he would or could have said. There is no difference which can here be imagined, except this: that the individuall action of hearing the Word, (when one heareth aright) is good and remunerable, in a double respect, namely, because it is both good in it self<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>quo ad speciem,</hi> and likewise <hi>respectu adjecti modi:</hi> whereas a womans action of marrying (when she marrieth in the Lord) is onely good and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munerable in the last respect, namely, <hi>respectu modi,</hi> for, <hi>in se,</hi> or, <hi>quo ad speciem;</hi> it hath no remunerable goodnesse in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> What doe we heare of any difference betwixt these actions <hi>quo ad speciem?</hi> That which we crave, is, that a difference may be shewed betwixt the remunerable goodnesse of the one, and of the other, both beeing considered <hi>quo ad individuum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That whereby the D. either was deceived, or would deceive, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth to be this; that he taketh every thing which agreeth to a in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuall thing, to agree to it <hi>quo ad individuum:</hi> as if to speake of <hi>Peter quatenus est homo;</hi> and to speake of him <hi>quatenus est individuum sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natum,</hi> or, <hi>res singularis sub specie hominis,</hi> were all one thing. Even so, to say of my individuall action of hearing the Word, that it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary because of the commandement of God, (and in that respect remunerable;) is not to speake of it <hi>quo ad individuum;</hi> but as the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cificall nature of that action of hearing the Word,) which God
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3270:165"/>
hath commanded,) is found in it. For if we speake of this indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall action, <hi>quo ad individuum,</hi> we can not consider it otherwise then <hi>respectu adjecti modi:</hi> because in morall actions, <hi>modus adjectus</hi> is <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium individuationis,</hi> and nothing else, doth individualize a morall action.</p>
               <p>Thus shall my Position stand good, namely, that those individuall <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>IV</label> actions which the D. calleth necessary, because their species is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of God, and those individuall actions which he calleth indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, because their <hi>species</hi> is not commanded, both being conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>quo ad inviduum;</hi> the former hath no other remunerable good in them, then the latter; and the whole renumerable good which is in either of them, standeth only <hi>in adjecto modo.</hi> Which beeing so, it is all one, when we speake of any individuall morall action <hi>quo ad individuum,</hi> whether we say that it is good, or that it is remunerable and laudable, both are one. For as is well said by <note n="h" place="margin">1<hi rend="sup">a</hi>. 2<hi rend="sup">a</hi>. q. 21. art. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Aquinas, necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium est omnem actum hominis, ut bonum vel malum, culpabilis vel laudabilis rationem habere.</hi> And againe. <hi>Nihil enim est aliud laudari vel culpari, quam imputari alicui malitiam vel bonitatem sui actus.</hi> Wherefore that distinction of a twofold goodnesse, <hi>causans</hi> and <hi>concomitans,</hi> which the D. hath given us, hath no use in this question, because every ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is laudable and remunerable, which is morally good, whether it be necessary or not. Now morall goodnesse <note n="i" place="margin">de subtil. exerc. 307. dist. 27.</note> saith <hi>Scaliger, est per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio actus cum recta ratione.</hi> Humane morall actions are called good or evill, <hi>in ordine ad rationem, quae est proprium principium humanorum actuum,</hi> saith <note n="k" place="margin">1<hi rend="sup">a</hi>. 2<hi rend="sup">a</hi>. q. 100. art. 1.</note>

Since then, those actions are laudable and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munerable, which are morally good; and those are morally good which are agreeable to right reason: it followeth, that forasmuch as those actions which the D. calleth indifferent, are agreeable to right reason, they are therefore not only morally good, but also lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and remunerable, &amp; so not indifferent. Yea those actions which he calleth necessary, beeing considered <hi>quo ad individuum,</hi> are no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise laudable and remunerable, then those which he calleth indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, being considered in like manner <hi>quo ad individuum,</hi> as hath been shewed.</p>

               <p>The first circumstance which maketh an action good or bad, is, <hi>Quis,</hi> which designeth the person: If a Magistrate put to death a malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, the action is good, but if a privat person put him to death, it is evill.</p>
               <p>The second is, <hi>Quid,</hi> which noteth the quality or condition of the object: If a man take <hi>sua,</hi> the action is good; If <hi>aliena,</hi> it is evill.</p>
               <p>The third is, <hi>Vbi:</hi> If men banquet in their owne houses, the action is good: If in the Church, it is evill.</p>
               <p>The fourth is, <hi>Quibus auxiliis:</hi> If men seek health by lawfull meanes, the action is good; If by the Divill, or his instruments, it is evill.</p>
               <p>The fifth is, <hi>Cur:</hi> If I rebuke my brother for his fault, out of my love to him, and desire to reclaine him, the action is good: If out of hatred and spl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The sixt is, <hi>Quomodo:</hi> for he who doth the worke of the Lord care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully doth well, but he who doth it negligently, doth evill.</p>
               <p>The seaventh is, <hi>Quando:</hi> To doe servile worke upon the sixe dayes of labour, is good: but to doe it upon the Lords Sabbath, is evill.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is another consideration which followeth upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>II</label> and it is this. The goodnesse or badnesse of a humane action, may be considered two wayes, <hi>viz.</hi> either <hi>in actu signato,</hi> and, <hi>quo ad speciem;</hi> or <hi>in actu exercito,</hi> and <hi>quo ad individuum.</hi> For an action is said to be specificated by its object, and individuated by its circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. So that when an action is good or evill in respect of the object of it, then it is called good or evill <hi>quo ad speciem.</hi> When it is good or evill in respect of the circumstances of it, then it is said to be good or evill <hi>quo ad individuum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 Humane actions whether considered <hi>quo ad speciem,</hi> or <hi>quo ad indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duum,</hi> are either such as proceed from the deliberation of reason, or
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3270:167"/>
from bare imagination onely. To this latter kinde wee referre such actions, as are done through incogitancy, whiles the mind is taken up with other thoughts; for example, to clawe the head, to handle the beard, to move the foot, &amp;c. which sort of things proceed only from a certaine stirring or fleeting of the imagination.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let it be remembred, that those things we call morally good, which agree to right reason: those morally evill, which disagree from right reason: and those indifferent, which include nothing belonging to the order of reason, and so are neither consonant unto nor disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant from the same.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When we speake of the indifferency of an individuall action, it may be conceived two wayes, either <hi>absolute &amp; sine respectu ad aliud,</hi> or, <hi>comparate &amp; cum respectu ad aliud.</hi> In the free will offrings, if so be a man offered according as God had blessed &amp; prospered his estaite, it was indifferent to offer either a bullocke, or a sheep, or a goate; but if he choosed to offer any of them, his action of offering could not be indifferent, but either good or evill. When we speake of the indifferency of an action <hi>comparate,</hi> the sence is only this, that it is neither better not worse then an other action, and that there is no reason to make us choose to doe it, more then another thing. But when we speake of the indifferency of an action, considered abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and by it self, the simple meaning is whether it be either good or evill, and whether the doing of the same must needs be either sinne or evill doing.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Every thing which is indifferent in the nature of it, is not by &amp; by indifferent in the use of it. But the use of a thing indifferent ought evermore to be either choosed or refused, followed or forsaken, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to these three rules, delivered to us in Gods Word. 1. The rule of Pietie. 2. The rule of Charity. 3. The rule of Purity.</p>
               <p>The first of these rules we finde 1. <hi>Cor. 10. 31. Whether therefore ye eat, or drinke, or whatsoever ye doe, doe all to the glory of God.</hi> And <hi>Rom. 14. 7. 8. For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself. For whether we live, we live unto the Lord, and whether we die, we die unto the Lord.</hi> Where the Apostle (as <note n="y" place="margin">com. in illum locum.</note> 
                  <hi>Calvine</hi> noteth) reasoneth from the whole to the part. Our whole life, and by consequence all the particular actions of it ought to be referred to Gods glory, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered according to his will. Againe, <hi>Col. 3. 17. And whatsoever ye doe in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Iesus.</hi> In the expounding of which words. <hi>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Davenant</hi> saith well, that <hi>Etiam illae actiones quae sunt sua natura adiaphorae, debent tamen a Christianis fieri in nomine Christi, hoc est, juxta voluntatem Christi, &amp; ad gloriam Christi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The seconde rule is the rule of Charity: which teacheth us, not to use any thing indifferent, when scandall riseth out of it. <hi>Rom. 14. 21. It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drinke wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or made weake;</hi> yea, though it doe not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3270:167"/>
weaken, if it be not expedient for edifying our brother, be it never so lawfull or indifferent in it's owne nature, the Law of Charity bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth us to abstaine from it. <hi>Rom. 14. 19. Let us therefore followe after the things which make for peace, and the things wherewith one may edify ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Rom. 15. 2. Let every one of us please his nighbour for his good to edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, 1. Cor. 10. 23. All things are lawfull for me, but all things are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient: All things are lawfull for me, but all things edify not.</hi> Where the Apostle teacheth <note n="z" place="margin">Pareus com. in il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum locum.</note> that, <hi>In cibo, &amp;c. In meat, drinke, and the whole kind of things indifferent, it is not enough to looke whether they be lawfull: but that further, we are to looke, whether to doe or omit the same, be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient and may edify.</hi> The Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> preaching upon <hi>Ioh. 16. 7. I tell you the trueth, it is expedient for you that I goe away, &amp;c.</hi> marketh, that Christ would not goe away, without acquanting his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples with the reason of it: and that reason was, because it was for their good. Whereupon he inferreth, 1. That we should avoide <note n="a" place="margin">1. Sam. 2. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Hophni's non vult enim,</hi> and make our <hi>vult</hi> our <hi>enim:</hi> that is, that we should not give our will for a reason, but a reason for our will. 2. That we should not with the <note n="b" place="margin">Cor. 6. 13. &amp; 10. 23.</note>

                  </gap>d say, that we are borne, partly for God, partly for our Country, partly for our friends, &amp;c. How much more ought Christians to understand, that we are not borne for our selves, but for Christ and his Church? And as in the whole course of our life, so especially in the policy of the Church, we may doe nothing (be it never so indifferent in it self) which is not profitable for edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, 1. <hi>Cor. 13. 26. Let all things be done to edifying.</hi> From which precept <hi>Pareus</hi> inferreth, that nothing ought to be done in the Church, which doth not manifestly make for the utility of all and every one: and that therefore not only unknowen toungs, but colde Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and idle gestures should be exploded out of the Church.</p>
               <p>The third Rule is the rule of Purity, which respecteth our peace and plerophorie of conscience, without which any thing is uncleane to us, though it be cleane &amp; lawfull in it's owne nature. <hi>Rom. 14. 14. To him that esteemeth any thing to be uncleane, to him it is uncleane.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note n="d" place="margin">Calv. com. in il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum locum.</note> 
                  <hi>Si quis aliquam in cibo immunditiem imaginetur, eo libere uti non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test.</hi> Whatsoever indifferent thing a man judgeth in his conscience to be unlawfull, he may not lawfully doe it. <hi>Rom. 14. 5. Let every man be fully perswaded in his owne minde.</hi> And <hi>vers. 23. He that doubteth is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, if he eate, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sinne. Nefas est omnino</hi> faith <note n="e" place="margin">
                     <hi>In</hi> Rom. 14. 7. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Calvine, quippiam aggredi quod putes illi (do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino) displicere, imo quod non persuasus sis illi placere.</hi> Now, if a thing indifferent be used according to these three rules, the use of it is not

only lawfull, but expedient also. But if it be not used according to these rules, the use of it is altogither unlawfull.</p>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3270:169"/>
without his masters leave, let the learned give their judgement. Howsoever, it can not be denied, <note n="u" place="margin">Ames. lib 3 de consc. cap. 8. q. 5.</note> that such actions may be and are of en evill <hi>quo ad individuum,</hi> or in respect of the circumstances, which shew forth in them reproveable temerity, incogitancy, levity, and undecency. But such actions belong not to our purpose.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for those actions which proceed from the deliberation of reason, howbeit many of them be indifferent <hi>quo ad speciem,</hi> yet none of them is, nor can be indifferent <hi>quo ad individuum.</hi> The reason of this difference and distinction is, <note n="x" place="margin">Aquin. 1a. 2a. q. 18. art 8.</note> because every action hath it's species or kinde from the object; and a humane morall action, hath it's species or kind, from the object referred to the originall of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane actions, which is reason. Whereupon it commeth, that if the object of the action include something that agreeth to the order of reason, it shall be a good action, according to it's kind: for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to give almes to an indigent man. But if it include something that is repugnant to the order of reason, it shall be an evill action according to it's kind; as, to steale or take away another mans goods. Now sometimes it happeneth, that the object of an action doth not include something that belongeth to the order of reason; as, to lift a strave from the ground, to goe to the field &amp;c. such actions are indifferent, according to their kinde. But we must pronounce farre otherwise of them, when wee speake of them <hi>quo ad individuum,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause as they are individuated by their circumstances, so in their individuall beeing, they have their goodnesse or badnesse from the same circumstances, as hath been shewed. So that no such action as is deliberated upon, can bee indifferent <hi>quo ad individuum;</hi> because <hi>oportet</hi> saith <note n="y" place="margin">ibid. art. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Thomas quod quilibet individualis actus habeat aliquam cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantiam, per quam trahetur ad bonum, vel malum, ad minus ex parte in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionis finis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Friar <hi>Ambrosius Catarinus,</hi> following the Doctrine of <hi>Thomas,</hi> 
                  <note n="z" place="margin">Hist. of the counc. of Trent. lib. 2 p. 196.</note> maintained in the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> that to doe a good worke, the concurrance of all circumstances is necessary, but the want of one onely is sufficient for an evill: so that howsoever among the workes considered in generall, some are indifferent, yet in the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, there is no <hi>medium</hi> between having all the circumstances and wantimg some; therefore every particular action is good or evill. And because among the circumstances, the end is one, all workes referred to a bad end are infected. He further alledged <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> that it is sinne not onely to referre the action to a bad end, but also not to referre it to a good end. Thus spake the learned <hi>Friar</hi> very appositly. And the same is the judgment of our owne Divines. <hi>De his rebus indifferentibus</hi> saith <note n="a" place="margin">Com. in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Martyr, statuendum est, quod tantummodo ex genere atque natura sua. indifferentiam habeant, sed qnando ad electio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem descenditur nihil est indifferens.</hi> And so saith <note n="b" place="margin">in <hi>Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> 14. dub. 1.</note>

               <p n="1">1. Our question is onely of individuall actions, considered both in respect of their originall, which is deliberation and election, and in respect of all their circumstances, none excepted. When <note n="d" place="margin">In <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. dub. 1.</note>

If then every action, which is done to the notice of other men, either edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy or scandalize them, and every one of our actions (without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) either edify or scandalize our selves, that is, either make us the better or the worse, it must needs follow, that there is not one of our actions indifferent, but either good or evill, in respect of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Now all that the D. hath said, evinceth no more but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency of some actions considered onely in respect of the worke, not in respect of all the circumstances, (and by consequence, not <hi>quo ad individuum.)</hi> If hee had considered <hi>Sempronia,</hi> her act of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying, either in respect of the originall of it, or in respect of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of it, (much more if he had (as he ought to have) considered it in both these respects) he might easily have seen, that it can not bee called indifferent, because it either proceedeth from a good election and intention, or from a bad; and it hath either a good effect or a bad, I meane, it either edifyeth or scandalizeth. In which two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects (we see) neither it nor any action is indifferent, in <hi>Pareus</hi> his judgement.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our question is of the indifferency of things considered abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>VII</label> &amp; by themselves, not comparatively and in relation to other things, (as we shew before.) If we speake of comparatives, there is no question, but there may be an action, which is neither better nor worse, then some other action. But if we hold us at positives, wee truly maintaine, that every action considered by it self, is either good or evill, and none indifferent. Now the D. onely compareth <hi>Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pronia</hi> her marrying, with her living a single life, and her marrying of <hi>Titius,</hi> with her marrying of <hi>Caius</hi> or <hi>Pomponius.</hi> But if he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered any one of all these things absolutely and by it self, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it to be in that respect indifferent, he had said something to the purpose. Nothing followeth upon that which he hath said, but that (these things beeing compared among themselves) <hi>Sempronia</hi> her marrying of <hi>Titius,</hi> is neither better nor worse, then her marrying
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3270:170"/>
of <hi>Caius</hi> or <hi>Pomponius.</hi> Yet for all that, if shee marry any of them, her act of marrying that man, shall be either according to the rules of the Word, or not, &amp; so either good or evill, not ind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p n="3">3. Though <hi>in genere naturae</hi> a man hath liberty of contradiction, to <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>VIII</label> use things which are in their owne nature indifferent, or not to use them, and liberty of contrariety to use either this or that; yet <hi>in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re moris,</hi> it is otherwise: a man hath not such morall liberty in the use of things, which are in their nature indifferent, as the D. alledgeth. For those things which are in their nature indifferent, are never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different in their use; and that because the use of them, is either ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rules of the Word, and then it is expedient; or not; and then it is unlawfull. The D. distinguisheth not betwixt the nature of things indifferent and the use of them: but so he reasoneth as if every thing indifferent in the nature of it, were also indifferent in the use of it. Which how false it is, men of lower degree then Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors can easily judge.</p>
               <p>Goe to then; let us see how the D. reasoneth. He saith, it is indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent &amp; free to the widowe <hi>Sempronia</hi> either to marry or not to marry; and if she marry, she hath liberty to marry either this man or that man: and that because none of all these things is either commanded or forbidden of God. Iust so, might the strong among the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Corinthians,</hi> have reasoned against <hi>Paul.</hi> Why doe you goe about to adstrict or limite our use of such things, as God hath neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded nor forbidden? it is indifferent and free to us, either to eat flesh or not to eat flesh, and if we eat flesh, either to eat this kind, or that. Nay, but the Apostle will not have the indifferency of the thing it self, in its owne nature, to be ground enough for the use of it: but he will have their practise and use of it, to be ever either expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient or unlawfull, in respect of the circumstances, and according as these rules of Pietie, Charity, &amp; Purity (which Gods Word gives concerning the use of things indifferent,) are observed or not obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. And so doe we answeare the D. That if a widowes act of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying be according to the rules of the Word, that is, if it tend to Gods glory, if it be expedient for edifying, &amp; if shee be rightly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded in her conscience that shee hath a warrant from the Word for that which shee doth, (of whioh rules, I have said enough before) then is it good, not indifferent. If it be not according to these rules, then is it evill, not indifferent.</p>
               <p>More plainly; her act of marrying, is either according to the rules
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:3270:171"/>
of the Word, or not. If it be according to the rules, then it is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient that she marry, therefore not indifferent; If it be not according to the rules, then it is unlawfull, therfore not indifferent. If it be said that the best man who lives tieth not himself to these rules, in the use of every indifferent thing, but oftimes useth or omitteth a thing of that nature, at his owne pleasure. I answere, <note n="g" place="margin">Ia. 3. 2.</note>

                  <hi>who can understand his errors?</hi> But in the meane time, the rules of the Word limit us so strictly, that we may never use a thing in it's owne nature indifferent, at our arbitrement and pleasure, and that the use of it is never lawfull to us, except it be done piously for Gods glory, profitably for mans edification, and purely with full assurance that that which we doe is approved of God. And as all this hath beene proven from Scripture heretofore, so now let us trie whether we can make it to follow upon that which the D. himself hath said.</p>

But I pray, doeth the Word underprope or approve the use of any thing indifferent, if it be not used according to the foresaid rules, and by consequence conveniently and profitably?</p>
               <p>The D. thinkes it enough, that in the use of a thing indifferent, <label type="milestone">

But for answere hereunto, we say,</p>
               <p n="1">1. We have sufficiently proven, that it is never lawfull for us to doe any thing which is in the nature of it indifferent, except we be
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3270:171"/>
perswaded not only of the lawfullnesse of the thing, but of the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency of doing it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Of his comparing of things indifferent togither, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering them positively &amp; by themselves, we have also said enough before.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The doing of a thing in faith, inferreth the expediency and profit of doing it; and that is enough to take away the indifferency of doing it; for since every indifferent thing is either expedient to be done, or else unlawfull to be done, (as hath beene shewed,) it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that either it ought to be done, or else it ought to be left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done: therefore it is never indifferent nor free to us, to doe it, or leave it undone, at our pleasure.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Because the D. (I perceive) sticketh upon the tearme of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity; and will have every thing which is not necessary to be indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: therefore to remove this scruple, beside that <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> &amp; the Author of the interlineary glosse upon <hi>Math.</hi> 18. 7. take the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of those words, <hi>It must needs be that offences come,</hi> to be this, <hi>It is profitable that offences come.</hi> Which glosse, though it be not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, yet as <note n="p" place="margin">prael.

And (because <hi>de paribus idem est judicium)</hi> whensoever the use of any indifferent thing is according to the rules of the Word, that is, when it is profitable for Gods glory and mans edification, &amp; the doer is perswaded of so much, I say, putting this case, then (for so much as not only it may, but ought to be done,) the use of it is not only lawfull, but necessary: and (for so much as not only it needs not, but ought not to be omitted,) the omission of it is not only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary, but also unlawfull.</p>
               <p>Againe, put the case, that the use of a thing indifferent be either against, or not according to the said rules, then (for so much as not only it may, but ought to be omitted, the omission of it is not only lawfull but necessary: and (for so much as not only it needs not, but may not, neither ought to be done) the doing of it, is not only unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, but also unlawfull.

               <p>The Apostle sheweth that that measure of liberality whereunto hee exhorteth the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> was not by any Divine commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment necessary, yet he adviseth it as a thing expedient. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8, 8. 10.

               <p>As touching the scope of all this Dispute, which is the indiffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of the controverted Ceremonies, we shall heare sundry rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>X</label> against it afterward. For the present I say no more but this. As in every case, so most especially when we meddle with the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, or any appurtenance thereof, the rules of the Word tie us so straitly, that that which is in it's owne nature indifferent, ought either to be done, or to be left undone, according as it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther agreeable or not agreeable to these rules, and so is never left free to us, to be done or omitted at our pleasure. For if at all we be (as certainely we are) abridged of our Liberty, chiefly it is in things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to Divine worship.</p>
               <p>But I marvell, why <hi>D: Forbesse,</hi> discourseth so much for the indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency of the Ceremonies, for lib. 1. cap. 7.

Sure, if he stand to that which he hath there writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, he can not choose but say, that it is unlawfull both for us, and for all Christians any where, to omit the controverted Ceremonies, and that all such as have at any time omitted them, have thereby sinned in leaving that undone which they ought to have done: for the conveniency and necessity of them which he pretendeth, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall and universall.</p>

                  <hi>lay downe this ground, that they be such, and they onely, which Gods Word hath left free unto us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now these things which Gods Word leaveth free and indifferent (in respect of their nature and kind) are such things as it neither shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be good nor evill. Where we are further to consider, that the Word of God sheweth unto us the lawfulnesse or unlawfulnesse, goodnesse or badnesse of things, not onely by precepts and prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions, but sometimes also, and more plainly by examples. So that not onely from the precepts and prohibitions of the Word, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise from the examples recorded in the same, we may finde out that goodnesse or badnesse of humane actions, which taketh away the indifferency of them.</p>
               <p>And as for those who will have such things called indifferent, as are neither commanded nor forbidden in the Word of Cod, I aske of them, whether they speake of plaine and particular precepts and prohibitions, or of generall onely? If they speake of particular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and prohibitions, then by their rule; the baptising of young children; the taking of water for the Element of Baptisme; A lectors publike reading of Scripture in the Church upon the Sabbath day; the assembling of Synods for putting order to the confusions of the Church; the writing and publication of the decrees of the same; and sundry other things which the Word hath commended unto us by examples, should all be things indifferent, because there are not in the Word of God, either particular precepts for them, or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular prohibitions against them. But if they speake of generall precepts and prohibitions, then are those things commanded in the Word of God, for which we have the allowed and commended ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of such as we ought to follow, (for in the generall wee are commanded to be followers of such examples, <hi>Phil. 4. 8. 9. 1 Cor. 11. 1. Eph.</hi> 5. 1.) Though there bee no particular precept for the things themselves thus examplified.</p>
               <p>To come therefore to the ground which shall give us here some <label type="milestone">

It's long since the <hi>Abridgment</hi> confirmed and strengthened it, out of these places of Scripture. <hi>Eph. 5. 1, Be ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore followers of God. as deare children. 1 Cor. 11, 1.

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Beside the common blessing of the Elements in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the action, we give thankes also in the severall actions of distribution, saying after this or the like manner. <hi>The Lord Iesus, the same night he was betrayed, tooke Bread<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when he had given thanks (as we also give thanks to God who gave his Sonne to die for us) he breake it &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In like manner also after Supper, he tooke the Cup, and when he had given thankes (as we also give thankes to God who gave his Sonne to shed his blood for us) he gave it, &amp;c.</hi> Which forme (we conceive) may be construed to be an imitation of the example of Chrict.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though we did not observe such a forme, yet there were two reasons to move Christ to give thankes severally both at the giving of the Bread, and at the giving of the Cup, neither of which concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Eucharisticall Supper was one continued action with the other Supper which went before it, for it is said, <hi>That whiles they di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule which the Bishop holdeth, we sinne in imitating Christ and his Apostles in those things, for as much as they are not exemplary, nor left to be imitated of us.</p>

Our first inference is this: That it is not indifferent for a Minister to give the Sacramentall Elements of Bread and Wine, out of his owne hand, to every communicant; for as much as our Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Apostles to divide the Cup among them, that is, to reach it one to another, <hi>Luk</hi> 22. 17.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>II</label> and tels us, that if all the Disciples did drinke, howbeit they did not deliver the Cup one to another, but received it severally from Christs owne hand, they divided the same among them: because when eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one takes his part of that which is parted, they divide the whole among them. Alas that I should blot paper with the confutation of such foolleries. I beleeve, when his Majesty hath distributed and divided so many lands and revenues among the Prelates of <hi>Scotland,</hi> every one of them takes his part, but dare not say (though) that they have divided these lands and revenues among themselves. Cane 20. or 40. beggars, when an almes is distributed among them, because every one of them getteth his part, say therefore that they themselves have parted it among them: what then shall be said of the distributer, who giveth to every one his part feverally and by himselfe? That a man who required, <note n="e" place="margin">Luk. 12. 13.</note> that his brother should divide the inheritance with him, did not (I trow) desire Christ to cause his brother to take his owne part of the inheritance: (there was no feare, that he would not take his part) but he desired, that his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther might give to him his part. So that to divide any thing among men, is not to take it, but to give it. And who did ever confound parting and partaking, dividing a Cup and drinking a Cup, which differ as much as giving and rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>iving: Thus we conclude, that when Christ commanded the Apostles to divide the Cup among them, the meaning of the words can be no other then this, that they should give the Cup one to another, which is so plaine, that <note n="f" place="margin">Maldon. ubi supra.</note> a Iesuite also maketh it to follow upon this command, that Christ did reach the Cup, <hi>non singulis sed uni, qui proximo, proximus sequenti, &amp; deinceps daret.</hi> Hence it is that <note n="g" place="margin">de re Sacram. lib. 2. pag. 31.</note>

               <p>First, they tell us, that it is not certaine that the Apostles were sitting when they received this Sacrament from Christ, and that <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huc sub Iudice lis est.</hi> Yet let us see, what they have to say against the certainty hereof.</p>
               <p>B. <hi>Lindsey</hi> objecteth, that betweene their eating of the Paschall Supper, and the administration of the Sacrament to the Disciples, five acts interveened. 1. The taking of the Bread. 2. The Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving. 3. The Breaking. 4. The Precept, <hi>Take yee, eat yee.</hi>

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The Worde, whereby the Element was made the Sacrament. In which time (saith hee) the gesture of sitting might have beene changed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It is first of all to bee noted, that the Apostles were sitting, at that instant when Christ tooke the Bread: for it is said, that hee tooke Bread, whiles they did eat, that is (as <note n="h" place="margin">com. in <hi>Math.</hi> 26. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>Maldonat</hi> rightly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth it) <hi>Antequam surgerent, antequam mensae &amp; ciborum reliquiae re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moverentun:</hi> and so wee use to say, that men are dyning or supping, so long as they sit at Table, and the meat is not removed from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. To Christs ministring of the Eucharisticall Supper to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the preceeding Supper, Christians had respect when they celebrated the Lords Supper together with the Love-Feasts. <hi>Probabile est eos ad Christi exemplum respexisse, qui Eucharistiam inter cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandum instituit</hi> (saith <note n="i" place="margin">com. in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Pareus.)</hi> But of this wee need say no more, for the B. himselfe hath here acknowledged no lesse, then that they were sitting at that time when Christ tooke the Bread. Onely hee saith, that there were five acts which interveened before the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of the Sacrament to the Disciples (whereof the taking of the Bread was the first) and that in this while the gesture of sitting might have beene changed: which is as much as to say; when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e tooke the Bread they were sitting, but they might have changed this gesture, either in the time of taking the bread, or in the time of thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, or in the time of breaking the Bread, or whiles he said, Take
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:3270:175"/>
ye, eat ye, or lastly, in the time of pronouncing those words; <hi>This is my body.</hi> (for this is the Word w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ereby (in the Bishops judgment) the Element was made the Sacrament, as we shall see afterward.)</p>
               <p>Now but by his leave, we will reduce his fyve acts to three: for thus soeaketh the <note n="k" place="margin">Math. 26. 26. Marke 14. 22.</note> text. <hi>And as they did eat. Iesus tooke bread and blessed it and brake it, and gave it to the Disciples, and said, take, eate, this is my body.</hi> Whence it is manifest, that the giving of the Bread to the Disciples, which no man (I suppose) will deny to have beene the administration of it, went before the two last acts, which the B. reckoneth out. Nothing therefore is left to him, but to say, that their gesture of Sitting might have beene changed, either in the taking, or in the blessing, or in the breaking, or else betweene the taking and the blessing, or betweene the blessing and the breaking; yet doth the text knit all the three togither by such a contiguity and connexion, as sheweth unto us, that they all did make up but one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued action, which could not admit any interruption.</p>
               <p>I saw a Prelate sit doune to his breakefast, and as he did eate, he <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>II</label> tooke some cups, and having called for moe, he said he thanked God that he was never given to his belly: and with that, he made a promise to one in the company, which he brake within two dayes after. Wold any man question whether or not the Prelate was sitting, when he made this promise, forasmuch as betweene his sittintg doune to meate, and the making of the promise, there interveened his taking of some cups, his calling for moe, and his pronouncing of those words, I tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke God that I was never given to my belly. Yet might one farre more easily imagine a change of the Prelats gesture, then any such change of the Apostles gesture, in that holy action wheref we speake. Because the text setteth doune such a continued, entire, unbroken, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ay. He taketh him to another subterfuge, and tels us, that though we read that Christ tooke Bread whiles they did eate, yet can it not be concluded hence, that he tooke Bread whiles they did sit: because saith he, <hi>As they did eate,</hi> is expounded by <note n="u" place="margin">Luke 22. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Luke</hi> and <note n="x" place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul,</hi> to be <hi>After they bad done eating, or after Supper.</hi> Thus is their language di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided. <hi>B. Lindsey</hi> did yeeld to us, that when Christ tooke Bread, they were sitting, and his conjecture was, that this gesture of sitting might have been changed after the taking of the Bread. <hi>Paybody</hi> saw that he had done with the Argument, if he should graunt, that they were sitting when Christ tooke Bread, therefore he calleth that in question. <hi>Vulcans</hi> owne gimmers could not make his answer and the Bishops to sticke togither.</p>
               <p>But let us examine the ground which <hi>Paybody</hi> takes for his opinion. He would prove from <hi>Luke</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> that when <hi>Mathew</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> say, <hi>As they were eating, Iesus tooke Bread:</hi> the meaning is onely this: <hi>After Supper Iesus tooke Bread:</hi> importing, that Christs taking of Bread did not make up one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued action with their eating, &amp; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their gesture of sitting might have been changed between their eating of the preceeding Supper, and his taking of the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Bread.</p>
               <p>Whereunto we answer, that there are two opinions touching the Suppers which Christ did eate with his Disciples, that night wherein he was betrayed: And whichsoever of them the reader please to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, it shall bee most easie to breake all the strength of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which <hi>Paybody</hi> opposeth unto us.</p>
               <p>First then, there are some who think that Christ having kept the Passeover according to the Law, (which is not particularly related, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>IV</label> but supponed by the Evangelists,) did sit downe to an common or ordinary Supper, at which he told the Disciples that one of them should betray him. And of this judgment are <hi>Calvine</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> upon <hi>Math. 26. 20. Pareus</hi> upon <hi>Math. 26. 21. Fulke</hi> and <hi>Cartwright</hi> against the Rhemists upon 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 23.

by Twenties. And if Twentie was often the number of them who conveened to the eating of the same, (which also confirmeth their opinion, who thinke that other men and women in the Inne, did eate both the Paschall and Evangelicall Supper, togither with the Apostles in Christs company:) it is not very likely (say some) that all those were sufficiently satisfied and fedde with one lambe, which after it was eight dayes old, was allowed to be offered for the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, as <note n="z" place="margin">Mos. and Aaron lib. 3. c. 4.</note>

                  <hi>Cartwright</hi> doubts not to call it a carnall Supper; an earthly repast; a Feast for the belly: which lets us know, that the Sacramentall Bread and Wine was ordained, not for feeding their bodies which were already satisfyed by the ordinary and dayly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but for the nourishment of the soule.</p>

               <p n="4">4. That there were two Suppers before the Eucharisticall, they gather from <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. For first, the Paschall Supper was ended <hi>vers.</hi> 2. after which Christ washed his Disciples feet. And thereafter we read <hi>vers.</hi> 12. <note n="g" place="margin">par. ubi supra.</note> 
                  <hi>Resumptis vestibus rursum ad caenam ordinariam consedisse.</hi> The dividing of the Passeover into two services or two Suppers, had no warrant at all from the first institution of that Sacrament: for which cause, they thinke it not likely, that Christ would have thus Dividedit, according to the device &amp; custome of the Iewes in later times; for so much as in Mariage, (and much more in the Pesseover) he did not allow of that which from the beginning was not so. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther seemeth it to them any way probable, that Christ would have interrupted the eating of the Passeover with the washing of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples feet, before the whole Paschall Supper was ended, and they had done eating of it.</p>
               <p>But others (and those very judicious too) are of opinion, that that second course whereunto Christ sate downe after the washing <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>V</label> of his Disciples feet, and at which he told them, that one of them should betray him, was not an ordinary or commone Supper (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Paschall Supper was enough of it self to satisfie them,) but a part of the Paschall Supper. And from the Iewish writters
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3270:176"/>
they prove, that so the custome was, to divide the Passeover into two courses or services. As for that wherein Christ dipped the sop, they take it to have beene the sauce which was used in the Paschall Supper, called <hi>Charoseth:</hi> of which the Hebrewes writ, that it was made of the palme tree branches, or of dry figges, or of raysens, which they stamped and mixed with vinegar, till it was thick as mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard, &amp; made like clay, in memory of the clay wherein they wrought in <hi>Egypt;</hi> and that they used to dip both the unleavened bread &amp; the bitter hearbs into this sauce. And as touching that place <hi>Io.</hi> 13. they expound it by the custome of the Iewes, which was to have two services or two Suppers in the Passeover: And take those words <hi>vers.</hi> 2. <hi>Supper beeing ended,</hi> to be meant of the first service: and sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe againe to Supper <hi>vers.</hi> 12. to be meant of the second service.</p>
               <p>If those two opinions could be reconciled and drawen togither <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>VI</label> into one, by holding that that second course whereunto Christ sate downe after the washing of his Disciples feet, was (for the substance of it) a commone Supper, but yet it hath beene and may be rightly called the second service of the Paschall Supper, for that it was eaten the same night wherein the Paschall lambe was eaten: So should all the difference be taken away. But if the mantainers of these opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions will not be thus agreed, let the Reader consider to which of them he will adhere.</p>
               <p>If the first opinion be followed, then it will be most easily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered to <hi>Paybody,</hi> that <note n="h" place="margin">Iansen. conc. Evang. cap. 131.</note>

But when <hi>Luke</hi> and <hi>Paule</hi> say, that he tooke the Cup after Supper, they speake of the Paschall Supper, which was eaten before the commone Supper.</p>
               <p>Againe, if the reader follow the other opinion, which holdeth that Christ had no other Supper that night before the Evangelicall, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Paschall only; yet sti'l the answere to <hi>Paybody,</hi> shall be easie; for whereas he would prove from those words of <hi>Luke</hi> &amp; <hi>Paul, Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise also the Cup after Supper,</hi> that when <hi>Mathew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> say, <hi>As they did eat, Iesus tooke Breade,</hi> their meaning is only this, <hi>After Supper, Iesus tooke Bread:</hi> he reasoneth very inconsideratly: forasmuch as <hi>Luke</hi> &amp; <hi>Paul</hi> lay not of the Bread, but of the Cup only, that Iesus tooke it after Supper. And will <hi>Paybody</hi> say, that he tooke the Cup so soone as he tooke the Bread? If we will speake with Scripture, we must say, that as they did eat the preceeding Supper, (to which we reade they sate downe,) Iesus tooke Bread: for nothing at all interveened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt their eating of that other preceeding Supper, and his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

               <p>Now therefore, from that which hath beene said, we may well conclude, that our Opposites have no reason which they doe or can object, against the certanty of that received tenet that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles received from Christ the Sacramentall Bread and Wine, whiles they were sitting. <note n="k" place="margin">Iren. lib. 2. pag. 5 5. 361. 362.</note>

                  </gap>ting, which they used in the former Supper; when all this is graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us, yet there is as great difference betwixt our forme of sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and that forme of the Iewes which the Apostles used, as there is betwixt <hi>Sedere</hi> and <hi>Iacere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Put the case it were so, yet it hath beene often answered them, that the Apostles kept the Tablegesture, used in that Nation, and so are we bound herein to followe their example, by keeping the tablegesture used in this Nation. For this keeping of the usuall tablegesture of the Nation wherein we live, is not a forsaking, but a following of the commendable example of the Apostles: even as whereas they dranke the Wine which was drunke in that place, and we drinke the Wine which is drunke in this place, yet doe we not hereby differ from that which they did.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The words used by the Evangelists, signify our forme of sitting, no lesse then the Iewish. <hi>Calepine, Scapula,</hi> and <hi>Thomasius,</hi> in their Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionories, take <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="3">3. There is not so great a difference betwixt our forme of sitting, and that which the Iewes used, as our Opposites alledge. For as <note n="l" place="margin">Alt. dam. pag. 739.</note> 
                  <hi>Didoclavius</hi> sheweth out of <hi>Casaubone;</hi> their sitting at banquets was only with a leaning upon the left arme, and so not lying, but sitting with a certaine inclination.

                  <hi>B. Lindsey</hi> is bold to averre, that the usuall tablegesture

of the Iewes, was lying along: and this he would prove from <hi>Amos</hi> 6. 4. <hi>They lye upon beds of yvorie, they stretch themselves out upon their couches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. If we should yeeld to this Prelate his owne meaning where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he taketh these words, yet how thinks he that the gesture of Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards and Gluttons, which they used when they were pampering themselves in all excesse of riot, and for which also they are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided by the Spirit of God, was either the ordinary table gesture of the Iewes, or the gesture used by Christ and his Apostles in their last Supper?</p>
               <p n="2">2. If any gesture at all be touched in those words, which he Prelate citeth, it was their gesture they used when they lay downe to sleep, and not their table gesture when they did eat. For <hi>Mitta</hi> and <hi>Ngheres,</hi> (the two words which <hi>Amos</hi> useth,) signify a Bed or a Couch wherein a man useth to lay himself downe to sleep. And in this sence we find both these words <hi>Psal.</hi> 6. 7. <hi>All the night make</hi> I <hi>my bed (mittathi) to swimme:</hi> I <hi>water my Couch (Ngharsi) with my teares.</hi> The Shunnamite prepared for <hi>Elisha</hi> a chamber, and there in set for him a bed <hi>(Mitta)</hi> and a Table, and a Stoole, and a Candlesticke, 2. Kings 4. 10. The Stoole or Chaire was for sitting at Table, but <hi>Mitta</hi> the Bed was for lying downe to sleep. Now the Prelate I hope will not say, that the <hi>Lecti tricliniares,</hi> wherein the Iewes used to sit at Table, and which compassed three sides of the same, (as hath beene said,) were their beds wherein they did lye and sleep all night.</p>
               <p>But, 3. the place must be yet more exactly opened up. That word which is turned in our English bookes, <hi>they lie,</hi> commeth from the Radix <hi>Schachav,</hi> which in <hi>Pagnins</hi> Lexic on is turned <hi>dormire.</hi> We find <hi>Ruth</hi> 3. 7. <hi>Lischcav,</hi> which <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> turneth <hi>Ad dormiendum, to sleep</hi> Our owne English translation. 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 9. saith, <hi>Vriah sleept,</hi> where the originall hath <hi>Vajischcav.</hi> And the very same word is put most frequently in the bookes of the <hi>Kings</hi> and the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> where they speake of the death of the Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Israel.

is put for a surplusage or superfluous remainder, <hi>redundans &amp; super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sluum,</hi> as <hi>Tremellius</hi> readeth. Now then, it is evident, that the thing which <hi>Amos</hi> layeth to the charge of those who were at ease in <hi>Zion,</hi> in the words which the Prelat citeth against us, is, that they slept upon beds of yvorie (such was their softnesse and superfluitie,) and swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in excessive pleasures upon their couches. And incontinent this filthie and muddie streame of carnall delicacie and excessive volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse, which defiled their beds, ledde him backe to the uncleane fountaine out of which it ishued, even their riotous pampering of themselves at Table: Therefore he subjoyneth, <hi>And eat the lambes out of the flocke,</hi> &amp;c. For <hi>Ex mensis itur ad cubilia, ex gula in venerem</hi> saith <hi>Cornelius a lapide</hi> commenting upon the same Text. Thus have I clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red he place in such sort, that the B. can not but shoote short of his aimes. Wherefore I goe on to other replies.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If the Apostles when they received the Lords Supper, or the Iewes, when they did eat at Table, were lying all along, how could their mouthes receive drinke unspilt? Or how could they have the use of both their armes? which the B. himself would not (I am sure) gainesay, if he would once trie the matter in his owne person, and assay to eat and drinke, whiles he is lying along.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The words used by <hi>Mathew</hi> 26. 20. <hi>Mark</hi> 14. 18. Where they speake of Christes sitting downe with the twelve, is also used by <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6. 11. where he speaketh of the peoples sitting downe upon the grasse, to eat the loaves and fishes: and will any man thinke that the people did eat lying along upon the grasse, where they might farre better sit upright?</p>
               <p n="6">6. If our Opposites like to speake with others, then let them looke backe upon the Testimonies which I have alledged before. <hi>Iansenius</hi> putteth <hi>discubuisse &amp; sedisse: Martyr, sedentibus aut discumbentibus. Pareus</hi> useth the word <hi>Consedisse.</hi>

                  <hi>D.

It entered not in his minde to guesse any thing of lying. The English Translaters also, say not that Christ lay downe, but that he sate downe.</p>
               <p>Their third answere is, that Christs sitting at the last Supper, is no more examplary and imitable, then the upper chamber, or the night season, or the sexe and number of communicants, &amp;c. <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> As for the sexe and number of communicants, <note n="s" place="margin">annot. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>Dr. Fulke</hi> rightly observeth, that it is not certaine from Scripture, that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3270:178"/>
twelve men onely and no women did communicate (as <note n="t" place="margin">ubi supra p. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>B. Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey</hi> would have us certainly to believe) But put the case it were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, <note n="u" place="margin">See Alt. Da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. p. 742.</note> yet for this and all those other circumstances, which are not examplary; there were speciall reasons either in the urgency of the legall necessity, or in the exigency of present and accidentall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, which doe not concerne us: whereas the gesture of sitting, was freely and purposely chosen, and so intended to be examplary, especially since there was no such reason moving Christ to use this gesture of sitting, as doth not concerne us.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="x" place="margin">ubi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra p. 40.</note> The B. saith, that his sitting, at the former Supper, might have been the reason which moved him to sit at the Eucharisticall Supper. But if Christ had not purposely made choice of the gesture of sitting, as the fittest and most convenient for the Eucharisticall Supper, his sitting at the former Supper, could be no reason to move him, as may appeare by this example. There are some Gentlemen standing in a noble mans waiting roume, and after they have stood a while there, the Noble man commeth forth: they beginne to speake to him, and as they speake, still they stand. Now can any man say, that the reason which moveth them to stand, when they speake to the Noble-man, is, because they were standing before he came to them? So doth the B. come short of giving any speciall reason for Christs sitting, which concerneth not us. He can alledge no more but Christs sitting at the former Supper; which could bee no reason; else he should have also risen from the Eucharisticall Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, to wash the Disciples feet, even as he rose from the former Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, for that effect. Wherefore wee conclude, that Christ did vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily and of set purpose, choose sitting as the fittest and best be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming gesture for that holy Banquet.</p>
               <p>Finally, <note n="y" place="margin">Eccl. Pol. lib. 5 sect. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Hookers</hi> verdict of the gesture of Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles in this Holy Sacrament, is, <hi>That our Lord himselfe did that, which custome and long usage had made fit: we, that which fitnesse and great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency hath made usuall.</hi> In which words, because he importeth, that they have better warrants for their kneeling, then Christ had for his sitting (which is blasphemie) I leave them as not worthy of an answer. Howsoever, let it be noted, that he aknowledgeth, by knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling they depart from the example of Christ.</p>

                  <hi>This is my body,</hi> enunciatively and demonstratively, in the act of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributing the Eucharisticall Bread: and farre lesse is it indifferent, so to omit this demonstrative speech in the distribution, as in place of it to surrogate a Prayer, to preserve the soule and body of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant unto everlasting life.

               <p>The fourth Position, which we draw from the same rule, is, that <label type="milestone">

               <p>Now last of all, we finde yet another point, whereby the <note n="c" place="margin">Ibid.</note> B. departeth from the example and mind of Christ. He saith, that by <label type="milestone">

It remaineth to say somewhat of the maine and generall purpose, which is principally questioned in this last part of our Dispute, namely, whether Crosse, Kneeling, Holy-dayes, Bishopping, and the other controverted Ceremonies, wherewith our Church is pressed this day, be such things as we may use freely and indifferently? The negative (which we hold) is strongly confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by those Arguments, which in the third part of this our Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute wee have put in order, against the lawfulnesse of those Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. Notwithstanding, we have thought fit, to adde somewhat more, in this place. And first we say, whatsoever bee the condition of the Ceremonies in their owne nature, they can not bee indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:3270:180"/>

And this which I say, may be seene in the generall Confession of Faith, sworne and subscribed by his Majesties Father of everlasting memory, <hi>anno</hi> 1580, and by the severall Parochines in the Land, at his Majesties strait command: which also, was renued and sworne againe <hi>anno</hi> 1596. by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Assembly, by provinciall Assemblies, by Presbiteries, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Parish Churches.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans</hi> 1. If the Oath was against the Commandement of God, what dishonour had come to the name of God, though he had not patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized the swearers of it, but hindered them from fulfilling their Oath? If a Christian sweare to kill a Pagan, and hereafter repent of his Oath, and not performe it; can there any dishonour redound thereby to the name of Christ? The D. forsooth must say so.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Where hath he read of the Repentance of the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> which God would not despise?</p>
               <p n="3">3. If an Oath made against the Commandement of God, (the breach of the commandement beeing despenced with,) bindeth so strictly and inviolably, as that Oath of the Princes of Israell did: how much more ought we to thinke our selves strictly and inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly bound, by the solemne Oath of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which was not repugnant, but most consonant to the Word of God, even our Adversaries themselves being judges? for thus speaketh <note n="y" place="margin">D. Forb. ibid. §. 3.</note> one of them. <hi>Quod autem jurarunt nostrates, non erat illicitum, sed a nobic omnibus jure praestari potest ac debet.</hi> So that the D. hath gained no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but loosed much, by that which he saith of the Isralites Oath. He hath even fanged himselfe faster in the snare which he though to escape.</p>
               <p>O! but saith the D. that which they did either in swearing, or in performing their Oath, against the expresse Commandement of God, we may not draw into an ordinary example.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It was against the Commandement of God; no man will say, that we should follow either their swearing or their performing of their Oath. Yet in the meane time the D. is pressed with this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument: that if their unlawfull Oath (in the case of Gods dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) did bind their posterity, much more doth that Oath of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> (which the D. hath aknowledged lawfull and commendable,) bind us this day.</p>
               <p>But, 4. Albeit the D. hath hereby given us scope and advantage <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>IV</label> enough against himselfe. Neverthelesse for the trueths sake, I adde, that it can not be shewed how that Oath of the Princes of Israell was against the expresse Commandement of God: but it rather ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth that it was agreeable to the same. For as <note n="z" place="margin">

                  <hi>Tremellius</hi> hath it noted, that Commandement <hi>Deut</hi> 20. Whereby the Israelites were commanded, to save alive nothing in the Cities of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> was to be onely understood of such Cities among them, as should make warre with them, and bee besieged by them. But the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> were
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:3270:181"/>
not of this sort, for they sought their lives, before the Israelites came to them: and by the same meanes, <note n="a" place="margin">Ios. 2.</note>

                  <hi>Solomon</hi> also, who did not cut off the people that were left of the <hi>Hittites,</hi> and the <hi>Amorites,</hi> but onely made them to pay tribute. That which I say, is further confirmed by <note n="e" place="margin">Ios. 11. 19. 20.</note> another place, where it is said, <hi>There was not a City that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all other they tooke in Battell. For it was of the Lord to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israell in battell, that he might destroy them utterly, and that they might have no favour: but that he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy them, as the Lord commanded Moses.</hi> From which words it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that if the <hi>Canaanites</hi> had made peace with the children of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, they were to shew them favour; and that they were bound by the Commandement of the Lord to destroy them, then onely and in that case, if they would not accept peace, but make warre; whence it commeth, that the cause of the destruction of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to their owne hardnesse and contumacy in not accepting of peace; and not to any Commandement which God had given to Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, for destroying them. In a word, it was <hi>voluntas signi,</hi> which in <note n="f" place="margin">Deut. 20, 10.</note> one place shewed the Israelites, what was their duty, namely to offer peace to all, even to the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and not to cut them off, if they should accept the peace. But it was, <hi>voluntas beneplaciti,</hi> which (as we read in <note n="g" place="margin">Deut. 7. 2.</note> another place) decreed to deliver the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> before the Israelites, that is, to harden their hearts to come against them in B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ttell, and so to overrule the matter by a secret and inscru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table providence, that the Israelites might lawfully and should cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly destroy them, and shew them no mercy. Even as that same God, who by one word shewed unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> what was his duty <note n="h" place="margin">Gen. 22. 2.</note> bidding him offer up his sonne <hi>Isaack,</hi> by another Word signified unto him, what he had decreed to be done, <note n="i" place="margin">Ibid. vers. 12.</note> forbidding him to lay his hand upon the Lad, or to doe any thing unto him. But this (I know,) will be very unsavory language, to many Arminianized Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitans.</p>
               <p>The other law of warre which <hi>Iunius</hi> upon <hi>Deut.</hi> 20. observeth,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:3270:182"/>
prescribed to the Israelites, how they should deale with them who refused their peace. And here onely was the difference made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Cities which were very farre off, and the Cities of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites, Deut.</hi> 20. 15. 16. But the first law was common; as hath been proven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ioseph Hall</hi> seemeth to deny, that the Oath of the Princes of Israel, had any power to bind, but upon another ground then D <hi>Forbesse</hi> tooke to himself. <hi>It would seeme very questionable,</hi> saith <note n="k" place="margin">con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templ. lib. 8. of the Gibeon.</note> 
                  <hi>Hall, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Iosua needed to hold himself bound to this Oath: for fraudulent conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions obliege not: and Israel had put in a direct caveat of their vicinity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I marvell how it could enter in his mind to thinke this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter questionable, since the violation of that Oath <note n="l" place="margin">2. Sam. 21. 1. 2.</note> was afterwards punished with three yeares famine. Yet let us hearken to his reasons. One of them is forged: for the Princes of Israel who sware unto them, put in no caveat at all. <note n="m" place="margin">Ios. 9. 15.</note> The Text saith only in the generall, that they sware unto them. As touching his other reason, it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered by <note n="n" place="margin">com. in <hi>Ios.</hi> 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Calvine. Iurisjurandi religio</hi> saith he, <hi>cousque sancta apud nos esse debet, ne erroris praetextu a pactis discedamus, etiam in quibus fuimus decepti.</hi> Which that it may be made more plaine unto us, let us with the <hi>Casuists</hi> distinguish <note n="o" place="margin">Ames. lib. 4. de consc. cap. 22. q 9.</note> a twofold error in swearing. For if the error be about the very substance of the thing, (as when a man contracts mariage with one particular person, taking her to be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther person,) the oath bindeth not. But if the error be only about some extrinsecall or accidentall circumstance, (such as was the error of the Israelites, taking the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> to dwell a farre off, when they dweit a hand,) the Oath ceaseth not to bind.</p>
               <p>This much beeing said for the binding power of that Oath of the Church of <hi>Scotland:</hi> let us now consider what shifts our Opposits use <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>VI</label> to elude our Argument, which we drawe from the same; where first, there occureth to us one ground which the Bishop of <hi>Edinbrug</hi> doth every where beat upon, in the trace of this Argument: taken out of the 21. Article of the Confession of Faith, wherein we find these words. <hi>Not that we thinke that any Policie and an order in Ceremonies, can be appointed for all ages, times, and places: for as Ceremonies, such as men have devised, are but temporall, so may and ought they to be changed, when they rather foster superstition, then that they edify the Kirke using the same.</hi> Whereu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>on the B. concludeth, <note n="p" place="margin">part. 2. pag. 5.</note> that none who sware the foresaid Article, could without breach of this Oath, sweare that the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of sitting at the receiving of the Sacrament, could be appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for all ages, times, and places.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> None of us denieth that Article, we all stand to it. For that which it pronounceth of Ceremonies, must be understoode of alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:3270:182"/>
circumstances, unto which the name of <hi>Ceremonies</hi> is but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and improperly applied, as we have shewed <note n="q" place="margin">supra part. 3. c. 7. sect. 5.</note> elsewhere. Neither can we, for professing our selves bound by an oath, ever to retaine sitting at the receiving of the Sacrament, in this Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> be therefore thought to transgresse the said Article.</p>
               <p>For, 1. The Article speaketh of Ceremonies devised by men, whereof sitting at the Sacrament is none, being warranted (as hath beene shewed) by Christs owne example, and not by mans device.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Article speaketh of such Ceremonies, as rather foster su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition, then edify the Church using the same: whereas it is well knowen, that sitting at the Communion did never yet foster super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition in this Church. So that the B. did very unadvisedly reckon sitting at the Communion among those Ceremonies whereof the Article speaketh.</p>

                  <hi>D. Forbesse</hi> also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Here is a manifest contradiction, for the B. saith that every man did by this Oath oblige himself, only to obey and defend that Discipline which is unchangeable &amp; commanded in the Word. And yet againe he seemeth to import, (that which <note n="t" place="margin">Ibid. §. 4. &amp; 6.</note> 
                  <hi>D Forbesse</hi> plainely avoucheth,) that every man obliged himself by the same Oath, to obey and defend, all that the Church should afterwards ordaine, though thereby the former constitutions be altered. The B. therefore doth apparently contradict himself, or at the best, hee contradicteth his fellow-pleader for the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That auncient Discipline and policy of this Church, which is contrary to the Articles of <hi>Perth,</hi> and whereunto we a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e bound by the Oath, was well grounded upon Gods Word, and therefore should not have beene ranked among other alterable things.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:3270:183"/>
3. Whereas the B. is of opinion, that a man may by his Oath tie himself to things which a Church shall afterward ordaine: he may consider, that such an oath were unlawfull, because not sworne <hi>in judgement, Ier.</hi> 4. 2. Now this judgement which is required, as one of the inseparable companions of a lawfull Oath, is not <hi>Executio justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,</hi> but <hi>Iudicium discretionis,</hi> as <note n="u" place="margin">2a. 2a. q. 49. art. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Thomas</hi> teacheth, whom <hi>Bullinger</hi> and <hi>Zanchius</hi> 
                  <note n="x" place="margin">Zanch. in 3 um. praec. p. 599.</note> doe herein follow. But there is no judgement of discretion, in his oath who sweares to that he knowes not what, even to that which may fall out as readily wrong as right.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whereas the B. and the D. alledge, that every man who sware to the Discipline of this Church, standeth obliged to obey all that the Church ordained afterward, they greatly deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:</p>
               <p>For, 1. The Discipline spoken of in the promissorie part of the Oath, must be the same which was spoken of in the assertorie part. Now that which is mentioned in the assertorie part, can not be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined to be any other, but that which was then presently used in this Church, at the time of giving the Oath. For <note n="y" place="margin">polan. synt. theol. l 9. cap. 23. pag. 802. Zanch. in 3. um. praec. p. 599.</note> an assertorie Oath is either of that which is past, or of that which is present. And the assertorie part of the Oath whereof we speake, was not of any Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline past and away: <hi>Ergo.</hi> of that which was present. Moreover, <note n="z" place="margin">2a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>a. q. 89. art. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Thomas</hi> doth rightly put this difference betwixt an assertorie and a promissorie Oath; that the matter of a promissorie Oath is a thing to come, which is alterable, as concerning the event. <hi>Materia autem juramenti assertorii quod est de praeterito vel praesenti, in quandam necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem jam transiit, &amp; immutabilis facta est.</hi> Since then the Discip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ine spoken of in the asseriorie part, was no other then that which was used in this Church, when the Oath was sworne: and since the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missorie part is illative upon and relative unto the matter of the asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie part: Therefore we conclude, the Discipline spoken of in the promissory part, could be no other, then that which was then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently used in this Church, at the swearing of the Oath.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Since the doctrine mentioned in that Oath, is said to have beene professed openly by the Kings majesty, and the whole body of this Realme, before the swearing of the same: why should we not likewise understand the Discipline mentioned in the Oath, to be that vvhich vvas practised in this Realme, before the svvearing of the same?</p>
               <p n="3">3. This is further proved by the vvord <hi>Continuing.</hi> We are svvorne to continue in the obedience of the Doctrine and Discipline of this Church: but hovv can men be said to continue in the obedience of any other Discipline, then that vvhich they have already begunne to obey? This the B. seemes to have perceived, for he speakes only of defending and obeying, but not of continuing to obey, vvhich
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:3270:183"/>
is the vvord of the Oath: and vvhich proveth the Discipline there spoken of, and svvorne to, to be no other then that vvhich vvas pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised in this Church, vvhen the Oath vvas svvorne. 4. Whiles vve hold, that he vvho svveareth to the present Discipline of a Church, is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Now as touching the Discipline of this Church which is spoken of in the Oath <note n="d" place="margin">ibid. pag. 12.</note> he questioneth what is meant by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Put the case it were doubtfull and questionable, what is meant by the word <hi>Discipline</hi> in the Oath; yet <hi>pars tutior</hi> were to be chosen; The B. nor no man among us can certainly know, that the Discipline meant and spoken of in the Oath, by those that sware it, comprehendeth not under it those points of Discipline for which we now contend, and which this Church had in use at the swearing of the Oath. Shall we then put the breach of the Oath in a faire hazard? God forbid. For as <note n="e" place="margin">ubi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra.</note> 
                  <hi>Ioseph Hall</hi> noteth from the example of <hi>Iosua</hi> and the Princes, men may not trust to shifts for the eluding of an Oath: Surely the feare of Gods name should make us to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at an Oath, and to bee farre from adventuring upon any such shifts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The B. doth but needlessely question, what is meant by the Discipline whereof the Oath speaketh. For howsoever in Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall use, it signify oftentimes that policy which standeth in the censuring of manners: yet in the Oath, it must be taken in the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest sence, namely, for the wholle policy of the Church. For, 1. <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the name of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Discipline to the rites and policy of the Church and lawes made thereanent. In 4. praec, col. 763.</note> The wholle policy of this Church, did at that time goe under the name of Discipline: and those two bookes wherein this policy is contained, were called, <hi>The bookes of Discipline.</hi> And without all doubt, they who sware the Oath meant by <hi>Discipline</hi> that whole po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of the Church which is contained in those bookes. Howbeit (as the preface of them sheveth) Discipline doth also comprehend other Ecclesiasticall ordinances and constitutions, which are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>d in them. 2. Doctrine and Discipline, in the Oath, doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all that, to which the Church required, and we promised to performe obedience. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the whole policy of the Church was
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:3270:184"/>
meant by <hi>Discipline,</hi> forasmuch as it was not comprehended under Doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">ubi supra pag. 10.</note> The B. objecteth three limitations, whereby he thinketh to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>IX</label> from the matter of the Oath that policy and Discipline vvhich vve plead for.</p>
               <p>First, he saith, that the matter of the Oath is the Doctrine &amp; Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline revealed to the world by the Gospel: and that this limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion excludeth all Ecclesiasticall constitutions, which are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely, or by a necessary consequence contained in the written Word.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the matter of the Oath is the Doctrine and Discipline, which is received, believed, and defended by many notable Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, &amp;c. and that this limitation excludeth all these things, wherein the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> hath not the consent of many notable Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That the Doctrine and Discipline which is the matter of the Oath, is particularly expressed in the Confession of Faith, &amp;c. and that in this Confession of Faith, established by Parliament, there is no mention made of the Articles controverted, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I might here shew how he confoundeth the preaching of the Evangell, with the written Word: likewise, how falsely he affirmeth, that the points of Discipline for which we plead, are neither warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Scripture, nor by the consent of many notable Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. But to the point. These words of the Oath: <hi>We beleeve, &amp;c. that this only is the true Christian Faith and Religion, pleasing God, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing salvation to man, whilk now is by the mercy of God, revealed to the world, by the preaching of the blessed Evangel. and received, believed, and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, by many and sundry notable Kirkes and Realmes, but chiefly by the Kirke of Scotland; the Kings Majesty; and three Estaites., &amp;c. as more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly is expressed in the Confession of our Faith, &amp;c.</hi> are altogither perverted by the B. for there is no Discipline spoken of in these words, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward: why then talkes he of a Discipline revealed to the world by the Gospell, having the consent of many notable Churches, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in the Confession of Faith? And if the B. will have any Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline to be meant of in these words, he must comprehend it under the Christian Faith and Religion, which bringeth Salvation unto man. But this he can not doe, with so much as the least shew of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Thus put we an end to the Argument taken from the Oath of God: wishing every man amongst us, out of the feare of Gods glorious and fearfull name, duly to regard and ponder the same.</p>

                  <p>A recapitulation of sundry other reasons against the Indifferency of the Ceremonies.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat the Ceremonies are not indifferent to us, or such <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>I</label> things as we may freely practise, we prove yet by other reasons.</p>
               <p>For, 1. They who plead for the indifferency of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies must tell us whether they call them indifferent <hi>in actu sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nato,</hi> or <hi>in actu exercito,</hi> or in both these respects. Now <note n="g" place="margin">supra cap. 3.</note> we have proven, that there is no action deliberated upon, and wherein wee proceed with the advise of reason, which can be indifferent <hi>in actu ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercito:</hi> and that because it can not choose, but either have all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances which it should have, (and so be good,) or else want some of them, one or moe, (and so be evill.) And as for the indifferency of the Ceremonies <hi>in actu signato,</hi> though we should acknowledge it, (which we doe not,) yet it could be no warrant for the practise of them: or else the beleeving Gentiles might have freely eaten all meats, notwithstanding of the scandall of the Iewes: for the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of all meats freely was still a thing indifferent <hi>in actu signato.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Ceremonies are not indifferent, <hi>eo ipso</hi> that they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>II</label> and commended unto us as indifferent. For as <note n="h" place="margin">1<hi rend="sup">a</hi>. 2<hi rend="sup">oe</hi>. q. 95. art. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Aquinas</hi> resolveth out of <hi>Isidore,</hi> every humane or positive Law, must be both <hi>necessaria ad remotionem malorum,</hi> and <hi>utilis ad consecutionem bonorum.</hi> The Guides of Gods Church have not power to prescribe any other thing, then that which is good and profitale for edifying. For they are set not as Lords over Christs inheritance, but as Ministers for their good. <hi>It seemed good to the holy Ghost &amp; to us</hi> 
                  <note n="i" place="margin">Act. 15. 28.</note> say the Apostles and Elders to the Churches, <hi>to lay upon you no greater burden then these ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary things.</hi> They would not (you see) have enacted a Canon about those things, howbeit indifferent in their owne nature, had they not found them necessary, for the eshewing of Scandall. And as for the Civill Magistrate, he also hath not power to prescribe any thing which he pleaseth, though it be in it self indifferent: <hi>for he is the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of God unto thee for good,</hi> 
                  <note n="k" place="margin">Rom. 13. 4.</note> saith the Apostle: marke that word <hi>for good.</hi> It lets us see, that the Magistrate hath not power given him, to injoyne any other thing, then that which may be for our good. <hi>Non enim su a causa dominantur</hi> saith <note n="l" place="margin">com. in illum locum.</note> 
                  <hi>Calvine: sed publico bono: neque effraeni potentia praediti sunt, sed quae subditorum saluti sit obstricta.</hi> Now the first and chiefest good, which the Magistrate is bound to see for
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:3270:185"/>
unto the Subjects, is, (as <note n="m" place="margin">com. ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>Pareus</hi> sheweth) <hi>Bonum spirituale.</hi> Let us then, either see the good of the Ceremonies; or else we must account them to be such things, as God never gave Princes nor Pastors power to injoyne. For howsoever they have power to prescribe many things which are indifferent, that is to say, neither good nor evill in their generall nature: yet they may not command us to practise any thing, which in the particular use of it is not necessary or expedient for some good end.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Ceremonies are not indifferent, because notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>Tertullian</hi> taxed, for inducing a necessity in things indifferent. Now with how great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity and coaction the Ceremonies are imposed upon us, we have made it evident <note n="p" place="margin">supra part 1. cap. 3. &amp; 4.</note> elsewhere.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whatsoever be the quality of the Ceremonies in their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they are not indifferent to us, neither may we freely practise <label type="milestone">
