         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THIS Paper would not come addreſſed to you, if I knew
any in your <hi>Houſe,</hi> to whom for all intellectual and
moral Qualities it might more juſtly be inſcribed and
dedicated: Your admirable Knowledg, ſteady Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
unſtained Honour, and unwearied Application, which do
ſo well qualify you at all times, and eſpecially at this <hi>critical</hi>
Juncture, to be an uſeful Member of the Great <hi>Senato,</hi> and
which do ſo ſingularly adapt you to co-operate with ſuch others
there, as are guided by <hi>Love</hi> to their <hi>Couutry,</hi> and the old <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims</hi>
of <hi>Engliſh Policy,</hi> to ſave this <hi>Nation</hi> from menacing and
impending Ruin, to recover it to Honour abroad, and preſerve
it in Peace at home, and to retrieve our Traffick, and render it
ſafe and proſperous, do make you the worthy Object of all
honeſt Mens Love and Eſteem, and do conciliate all thoſe to be
your Servants as well as your Friends, who do either reſpect
themſelves or their Poſterity. Nor could any thing have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled
you to be thus applied unto by an unknown Perſon, ſave
the Opinion which I have of your <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Juſtice;</hi> and that
as you are able to judg of what is here repreſented, that you
will likewiſe do it with an Equity becoming the Merit of the
Cauſe, and not under the Biaſs either of antient Piques, or of
ſuppoſed preſent Emulations between theſe two <hi>Britiſh King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>SIR,</hi> I ſhall not now diſpute, whether the World might
not have been happier by its continuance under Conſinement,
and ſtak'd down to <hi>Agriculture,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Mechanick Arts</hi> that
are needful to the Conveniences of Life, (without purveying
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99143:3"/>
for our Pride and Senſuality) than it is by launching out into
that meaſure and degree of <hi>Mercantile</hi> Commerce which has
excited our Luſts as well as fed them, and given provocation to
Vice by yielding Fewel to it. But ſome Nation having depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the antient ſimplicity of Living concented with the
Productions of their own Countries, and having by Navigation
and Trade, raiſed themſelves to Wealth, Power, and increaſe
of Inhabitants; it thereupon grew neceſſary for other Nations
to fall into the like Methods, leſt otherwiſe they ſhould have been
a Prey, as well as a Deriſion, to them whom <hi>Trade</hi> had rendred
Mighty and Opulent: So that now the Application unto, and
the Encouragement and Protection of <hi>Trade,</hi> is not a Matter of
meer Choice and Diſcretion, but of indiſpenſible <hi>Neceſſity</hi> for
every Kingdom that is qualified by their Situation for it, and
would not be contemned and inſulted, and lie continually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to be conquered by any ambitious and encroaching Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
whom <hi>Trade</hi> hath made Wealthy and Powerful: For as
<hi>Trade</hi> is a richer and more durable <hi>Mine</hi> than any in <hi>Mexico</hi> or
<hi>Peru,</hi> and whence a Nation may conſtantly derive an Increaſe of
<hi>Bullion</hi> and <hi>Coin,</hi> ſo in proportion to its plenty of Money will it
flouriſh at Home, and be terrible Abroad; and anſwerable to
the Meaſures that any Country or Kingdom arriveth at in Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Commerce and Traffick, will it proportionably grow, not
only in <hi>Naval</hi> Strength, but in <hi>Military</hi> Force by Land: Of
which not only the <hi>Phenicians</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians</hi> of old, and long
after them the <hi>Venetians, Genoueſe,</hi> and <hi>Portugueſe</hi> are famous
inſtances; but whereof the <hi>Dutch</hi> are in a ſpecial manner an
amazing and illuſtrious Example; who tho they have narrow
and ſcanty Territories, live under a bad Air, dwell upon a
watery and unhealthy Soil, and have ſcarce any native Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of their own, but are forced to fetch their Bread, their
Drink, their Raiment from elſewhere; yet through the
meer purſuit of, and application to <hi>Trade,</hi> they not only rival
the greateſt Kings and moſt potent Kingdoms in powerful <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies,</hi>
and warlike <hi>Armies,</hi> but they give Laws to ſeveral mighty
Monurchs and States in all the known Parts of the World.
And foraſmuch as Money will always procure Men, they do in
the Virtue thereof ſupply themſelves from time to time with
vaſt Numbers of Souldiers from divers parts of <hi>Europe;</hi> and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99143:3"/>
without imploying any, or at leaſt very few of their own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
they do by their Acquiſitions in way of Trade, muſter and
keep up large Armies, both for their own <hi>Defence</hi> in times of
Peace as well as of War; which their living upon a <hi>Continent</hi>
ſurrounded with Neighbours who envy their Proſperity, and
are jealous of their Power, rendereth neceſſary; and alſo for
the <hi>Offence</hi> of thoſe that ſeek to encroach upon or inſult them.
So that by their meer <hi>Money,</hi> which is the Reſult and Product of
<hi>Trade,</hi> they purchaſe Men to ſhed their Blood, and to loſe their
Lives in defending them againſt, and in the making Conqueſts
for them upon others: And the Nature of War being chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
from what antiently it was, when Courage and Bravour
often decided a Quarrel between States and Kingdoms in
a Day, and ſeldom miſſed putting an End to a War, either
by Victory or Accommodation, within the Circle of one
<hi>Campaign;</hi> the Succeſs of it now is come to depend upon
the largeſt <hi>Purſe,</hi> and not the braveſt <hi>Troops;</hi> and they who
have <hi>moſt Money,</hi> tho not always the <hi>valianteſt Men,</hi> will
have the better in the <hi>War,</hi> though they may ſometimes
have the worſt in a <hi>Battel:</hi> So that no <hi>poor</hi> Nation can in
the way that <hi>War</hi> is now managed, carry an <hi>Offenſive</hi> War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
a <hi>Wealthy,</hi> tho it may poſſibly through ſome Advantages
peculiar to it, be in a condition to maintain a <hi>Defenſive;</hi> as the
<hi>Switzers,</hi> who through plenty of brave Men, and by reaſon of
the ſituation of their Countrey, may continue a Defenſive War,
at leaſt for a time, againſt any Nation that ſhall have the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to attack them. But I do ſay, that no neceſſitous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent
Nation can make an Offenſive War againſt a wealthy
Kingdom or State, unleſs they can make their Enemies Country
the Seat of it, and by the Plenty and Riches thereof both ſubſiſt
and pay their own Army: Whereas the <hi>Dutch,</hi> through their
being <hi>wealthy</hi> by reaſon of <hi>Trade,</hi> have heretofore lived many
Years in War without growing weary of it; and tho they have
ſeldom made great Acquiſitions, yet they have as ſeldom ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained
any conſiderable Loſſes, yea, they have been able by
their Money, which is the Product of their <hi>Commerce,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
upon others to aſſiſt them, when the Subverſion of their
State has been moſt menaced, and their Country in the greateſt
Jeopardy; tho they have alſo (to be reſtored to the free and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99143:4"/>
quiet following of their <hi>Traffick</hi>) purchaſed ſometimes their own
Peace at their Friends Expence, and have abandoned thoſe <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi>
that came in to ſuccour them.</p>
            <p>NOR need I tell you, <hi>Sir,</hi> that <hi>Trade</hi> is like a nice and coy
Miſtreſſ, which you muſt not only induſtriouſly court to get
poſſeſſed of it, but ſedulouſly purſue, and as tenderly cheriſh
if you would preſerve and ſecure it: For the <hi>Dangers</hi> inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
incident to <hi>Trade,</hi> are of that Variety and Number, that
unleſs it be encouraged by <hi>Immunities</hi> from grievous Impoſitions,
few will embark in it, and fewer perſevere to follow it. For
who would expoſe their whole Fortune and Capital to the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
which unavoidably accompany <hi>Navigation</hi> and <hi>Traffick,</hi> if
all that thereby accrues to them be, to bear the chiefeſt Burden
in the ſupporting the Government, and by heavy <hi>Taxes</hi> upon
them to eaſe thoſe from National <hi>Impoſitions,</hi> who either wallow
in Plenty and Luxury, through having Eſtates in <hi>Land,</hi> or who
ſubſiſt comfortably on <hi>Agriculture</hi> and Mechanick Imploys, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being expoſed to the Dangers or running the Hazards which
attend long Voyages and foreign <hi>Commerce?</hi> And as the Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are many and obvious to every one's Obſervations, that is in
any degree acquainted with the <hi>World,</hi> or conversant in <hi>Hiſtory,</hi>
that as <hi>Trade</hi> has always forſook and abandoned thoſe places
where it hath come to be too much loaded and burdened, tho
its Reſidence may have antecedently been fixed there, for Ages
as well as Years: So it is not unworthy of Remark, that Trade
ſeldom, if ever, returned to a Place which it had once forſook;
nor has it been found, that they who by grievous <hi>Impoſitions</hi> have
at any time drove <hi>Trade</hi> away, could be able to recover it again
by any Change of their Conduct, or other Methods which they
have fallen upon. And conſidering the many Advantages that
arrive to Kingdoms in the Increaſe of <hi>Manufactures</hi> and Riſe of
<hi>Rents,</hi> both of <hi>Lands</hi> and <hi>Houſes,</hi> through the Proſperity and
Succeſs of <hi>Trade;</hi> it is a wonder that any People, who have but
Wit to govern themſelves by <hi>Intereſt,</hi> if they will not by the
Meaſures of more refined <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> ſhould burden
and overload <hi>Trade,</hi> which is the Source and Fountain of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and great <hi>Advantages</hi> to them: nor ſhould there be more
needful, both to inform and convince the Nobility and Gentry
of the Benefits ariſing by the Protection and Encouragement of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99143:4"/>
               <hi>Trade,</hi> than that within the Compaſs of little more than a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury
of Years, in which <hi>Trade</hi> began to augment, the <hi>Value of
Lands</hi> in <hi>England</hi> is riſen to a full <hi>Moiety;</hi> and it is as demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrable
as any Problem in <hi>Euclid,</hi> that were our <hi>Tunnage</hi> and
<hi>Poundage</hi> and other Impoſitions on Trade, that ſtarve and crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
it, taken off, or at leaſt abated, both the <hi>Lands</hi> of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
would ſtill riſe <hi>higher</hi> in their <hi>Value,</hi> and the <hi>Manufactures</hi> of
the Kingdom would be more <hi>plentifully exported,</hi> and thereupon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably
<hi>increaſe</hi> and <hi>multiply:</hi> ſo that if <hi>Trade</hi> were more eaſed
and privileged from Impoſitions in times of <hi>Peace,</hi> tho Lands might
thereby come to be the more loaded; yet ſuch a Method would
not only be greatly to the Advantage of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> but would
turn to the Benefit of the <hi>Freeholder</hi> and <hi>Landlord,</hi> in that <hi>Lands</hi>
and <hi>Houſes</hi> would thereupon be both <hi>Lett</hi> and <hi>Sold</hi> at ſuch Rates
and Values (beyond what they now are) as would be more than
an <hi>Equivalent</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Burden.</hi> And would Men allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to think calmly of this Matter, the <hi>Heritor</hi> at the <hi>Rebound</hi>
would ſind his Intereſt as much in the relieving <hi>Trade</hi> from <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions</hi>
and <hi>Taxes</hi> as the <hi>Merchant</hi> would do <hi>immediately:</hi> But
then to continue not only <hi>Burdens</hi> upon <hi>Trade</hi> in time of <hi>War,</hi>
but to increaſe them proportionably to the growth of the Charge
and Expence that the Kingdom is forced to be at, in the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
and defraying it, is ſo irreconcilable to all the Rules
of Wiſdom as well as of Juſtice, that the doing it is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
upon the Underſtandings of People, as well as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
upon their Equity: For the <hi>Hazards</hi> which <hi>Traders</hi> are
then expoſed unto more than other Perſons, and the <hi>Loſſes</hi> which
at ſuch a time they muſt unavoidably meet with, in whatſoever
they either Export or Import, will be found to affect the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant's</hi>
Eſtate and Capital ſo far, that it ought both in Prudence and
Juſtice to be allowed to paſs inſtead of his <hi>Quota</hi> to all publick
<hi>Taxes.</hi> But alas! ſuch have been the <hi>Ways</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> of raiſing
Money for the carrying on the preſent <hi>War,</hi> that the <hi>Merchants</hi>
have not only born a great Share in the whole Charge and Expence
of it at <hi>home</hi> through <hi>Taxes</hi> impoſed upon <hi>Shipping</hi> as well as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Merchandiſe, but they have alſo by reaſon of the neglects
in protecting <hi>Navigation,</hi> had the Misfortune to defray a great
part of the <hi>Enemies</hi> Expence in the War they make upon us, as
you may eaſily comprehend, upon conſidering the vaſt Number of

               <hi>Ships</hi> with their <hi>Cargoes,</hi> which they have taken from us ſince the
Commencement of it; and which (if calculated at the loweſt
Value) muſt amount to ſeveral Millions Sterling. In a word,
the <hi>leſs</hi> the <hi>Impoſitions</hi> are upon <hi>Trade,</hi> the <hi>more</hi> Money the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant</hi>
has to imploy in it, and to apply to the Enlargement of
it; and the more vigorouſly it is carried on, the further it is
enlarged, he more our Manufactures will multiply at home;
and all that we can fabrick will be the better tranſported abroad.
And as the <hi>Trade</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is capable of great <hi>Improvements,</hi>
and of being far extended beyond what it is yet arrived at, and
this both as to the Productions of <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> at <hi>home,</hi> and
as to the enlarging our Commerce in the Commodities of <hi>Foreign</hi>
Countries; ſo nothing has ſo much diſcouraged, crippled and
narrowed it, as the draining thoſe large Sums and vaſt Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Money out of the <hi>Merchant's</hi> Stock and Capital, by his
paying high Impoſitions, Cuſtoms and Taxes, which without
thoſe Burdens upon Trade would have been all applied unto
the Increaſe of his Stock, and imployed in the Enlargement of
Commerce and Traffick. Nor would it derogate from the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of our Legiſlators, if the received Practice and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Poſture of Affairs will not allow them to make this Kingdom
a <hi>free Port;</hi> yet at leaſt to imitate the Dutch, (that know ſo well
how to grow ſtrong and opulent) who tho they have little Land
to <hi>tax</hi> towards the defraying the Charges of their Government,
and who are alſo by Nature precluded from ſeveral other ways
and means of raiſing Money for the Defence of their State,
which lie open and are practicable to us; yet even they do
with ſingular Care and in a moſt ſpecial Manner, cover and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
Trade from all extraordinary and grievous Impoſitions,
and do chuſe rather to raiſe Money for the anſwering the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities
and Exigencies of their Government, in a hundred other
Methods, than to clog <hi>Traffick,</hi> or to make the <hi>Merchant</hi> uneaſy
through large and mortifying <hi>Impoſitions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND, <hi>Sir,</hi> you will readily imagine, that if Trade, in order
to the being preſerved and enlarged, muſt be ſo tenderly che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
and ſo carefully indulged where it is already eſtabliſhed,
and has gained the Eſteem and Affections of a People; it muſt
then be more amorouſly Courted and Addreſſed unto in all the
ways that are Charming, in order to give a beginning unto it,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99143:5"/>
and ſix it a Settlement where it has had little Footing, and
ſcarcely been entertained: And the more enticing muſt the
means be to allure a People to it, and to make them eſpouſe it
with Ardour, where not only the <hi>Genius</hi> and <hi>Inclinations</hi> of a
<hi>Nation</hi> have generally ſtood biaſſed another way, but where
(thro' being habituated to greater Frugality than their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours)
they have for the moſt part ſat down contented with
their own home Productions, as being ſufficient both to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate
all the needful cravings of <hi>Nature,</hi> and to yield Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
for the common conveniencies of <hi>Life;</hi> or they have only
extended their <hi>Trade</hi> to an <hi>intercourſe</hi> with thoſe adjoining Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that could both take off thoſe few Superfluities which their
Country yieldeth, and might furniſh them with all thoſe Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
which modern Vanity, Pride and Luxury have rendered
as it were neceſſary. And if <hi>Penal</hi> Laws have been found ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to withdraw the Native <hi>Iriſh</hi> from their antient rude
Cuſtom of making their Horſes plow and draw by the <hi>Tails;</hi>
you will not wonder if <hi>Beneficial</hi> Laws be thought needful to
turn the Applications of the <hi>Scots</hi> into another Channel, than
that in which moſt of them have hitherto exerciſed their Parts,
and imployed their Induſtry: and by how much any Kingdom
or State findeth that others have been long embarked in Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
before them, by ſo much muſt the Encouragement be the
greater, and the proſpects of Succeſs and Advantage made the
more viſible and morally certain, to obtain their People to ſtart
ſo late, and ſo far behind thoſe intereſted in Trade previously
to them, that they do in a manner ſee the Prize of the Courſe
in which they are ingaging in the Poſſeſſion and Enjoyment of
others, before they can ſet out and begin. Nor is there any
thing more univerſally practiſed by all Nations, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by <hi>England,</hi> than to grant large <hi>Privileges</hi> to the Authors
and Inventors of any thing <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Artificial</hi> that may be
profitable to Makind, and beneficial to the Community: and
various as well as many Inſtances, fall under every Man's Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
and View, how that the Projectors and Authors of
the leaſt thing that hath ſeemed to have a tendency to publick
and National <hi>uſefulneſs,</hi> have had all the Profits that were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for ſeveral Years to accrue from it, veſted in them in the
way of a <hi>Monopoly,</hi> as the Recompence and Reward either of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99143:6"/>
their Skill or of their Induſtry; nor can any be ignorant, who
are converſant either in our <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> or in our <hi>Statute-Book,</hi>
what Conceſſions, Privileges and Immunities have been here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
granted to the <hi>Walloons</hi> and others, to tempt them hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and by them to get poſſeſſion of, and to <hi>eſtabliſh</hi> thoſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<hi>Manufactures,</hi> which have been of ſo much Reputation, as
well as of Advantage to the Kingdom. Yea, while the <hi>Ingeny,</hi>
Vigour and Induſtry of the Natives of <hi>England,</hi> ſpent themſelves
heretofore in other Ways, Exerciſes and Applications, than thoſe
of <hi>Traffick;</hi> what large Favours and <hi>Immunities</hi> were then grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto, and beſtowed upon <hi>Foreigners,</hi> to procure them to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
a <hi>Staple</hi> of <hi>Commerce</hi> here, and to cultivate <hi>Trade?</hi> For
how much ſoever the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have within this laſt Age addicted
themſelves to <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Navigation;</hi> yet before the middle of
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, their Application was not much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
thereunto than that of their Neighbours; and ſo unprovided
was this Kingdom at that Time, both of Ships and Mariners,
and that no leſs for <hi>Traffick</hi> than for <hi>War,</hi> that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was forced to hire the one as well as the other, from the
Hanſe-Towns. 'Tis true, that long before, upon the <hi>Burgundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
having procured of <hi>John Duke</hi> of <hi>Brabant</hi> the <hi>Incorporation</hi> of
a Company of <hi>Merchant Adventurers,</hi> Anno 1248. our Politick
as well as Warlike Prince <hi>Edward</hi> the 3<hi>d,</hi> found means to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure
it hither, and to get it tranſplanted into <hi>England;</hi> where
being eſtabliſhed by him with many and great <hi>Privileges,</hi> it was
likewiſe afterwards confirmed by moſt of the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
that ſucceeded him: But beſides its being fallen in Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Time under ſome decline, had it been in its great
Vigour, it could not have been able to ſupport, extend and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
<hi>Trade</hi> to the Meaſure and Degree which the <hi>Ballance</hi> of
<hi>Europe</hi> at that time, and the growth of <hi>Navigation</hi> and <hi>Traffick</hi>
in other Nations made neceſſary to be attempted here; which
as it occaſioned <hi>Commerce</hi> to be caſt, as it were, into a new
Mould, and to put on a different Face from that in which it
formerly appeared; ſo it procured thoſe <hi>Encouragements</hi> unto
<hi>Trade,</hi> and gained it ſuch <hi>Privileges</hi> as might ſerve to promote
its Propagation and Increaſe, to a Proportion that ſhould not
only equal that of other Nations, but exceed it. Nor is it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable
but that the Proſpect which all People then had of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:99143:6"/>
and <hi>Scotland</hi>'s being likely ſoon after to be united under
<hi>one Soveraign,</hi> might give great Encouragement to this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to apply it to <hi>Navigation</hi> and <hi>Commerce</hi> more than it had
been accuſtomed to do, and that not only upon the hopes of
being delivered from thoſe <hi>Wars</hi> for the future, which had for,
many Ages been too frequent between theſe <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nations,
and conſequently great <hi>Obſtructions</hi> to <hi>Trade;</hi> but 'en that
theſe Kingdoms becoming to be ſo far incorporated, as to be
under <hi>one Monarch, England</hi> ſhould have thence forward little
cauſe of Apprehenſion of <hi>War</hi> with any of its <hi>Foreign Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,</hi>
and eſpecially with <hi>France;</hi> and that partly by reaſon or
the Addition of <hi>Strength,</hi> which this <hi>Conjunction</hi> of the two
Nations would give againſt any Enemy, and partly becauſe the
<hi>Alliance</hi> and <hi>Friendſhip</hi> between <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>France</hi> (which had of<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten rendered the <hi>French</hi> the bolder to make War againſt <hi>England,</hi>
would by this <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> be unavoidably diſſolved. Nor is it needful
that I ſhould expatiate in repreſenting, how that when this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
began to apply it ſelf induſtriouſly and extenſively to <hi>Trade,</hi>
all the Methods imaginable of Kindneſs unto, and Care over
<hi>Merchants</hi> and <hi>Navigation,</hi> were made uſe of by the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to encourage them and cultivate it: For as there was
a <hi>Naval Strength</hi> always in readineſs, and (upon every Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency
and needful Occaſion) imployed to protect it, ſo the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
upon it were extreamly <hi>Moderate,</hi> in compariſon of
what (as appears by the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Rates,</hi> and the ſeveral <hi>Acts</hi> of
<hi>Parliament</hi> which charge <hi>Navigation</hi> and <hi>Trade,</hi> with ſo many
<hi>Duties</hi> and <hi>Impoſts</hi>) they are grown up into ſince: For all the
<hi>Taxes</hi> then exacted of <hi>Merchants,</hi> were rather little <hi>Recognitions</hi>
of their <hi>Dependence</hi> upon the Crown, and ſmall acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Countenance and Defence which they received
from the Government, than any <hi>Burdens</hi> and grievous Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances,
by which <hi>they</hi> might be diſcouraged, and <hi>Traffick</hi> load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
ſo that the whole Carriage of thoſe then in Authority to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Commerce,</hi> and thoſe embarked in it, ſpake an indulgent
<hi>Care</hi> towards it and them, and ſuch a tender regard of both, as
became the <hi>Infancy</hi> of <hi>Trade,</hi> and the <hi>Difficulties</hi> which <hi>Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>
were to encounter with: and particularly as to the <hi>Society</hi>
that was erected to Trade to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> there was all the
Wiſdom and Goodneſs exerciſed towards it that might be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99143:7"/>
to the promoting of it; for upon its firſt <hi>Incorporation,</hi>
Anno 1599. it had not only many <hi>Immunities</hi> granted unto it,
but was <hi>Incorporated</hi> into a <hi>Company</hi> with a Right and Authority
veſted in it, of Trading to the <hi>Indies,</hi> precluſive of all their
Fellow-Subjects that were not of that <hi>Corporation.</hi> For tho it
be inconſiſtent, both with the Wiſdom and the Juſtice of the
Government of <hi>England,</hi> and alſo with the Rights and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the People, to erect all <hi>Traders</hi> into every Place, into
<hi>Companies,</hi> excluſive of other <hi>Engliſh Natives</hi> and Freemen, to
Traffick thither, where the <hi>Trade</hi> may be <hi>effectually</hi> and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageouſly
carried on by <hi>ſingle Dealers,</hi> or by <hi>voluntary</hi> Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations,
ſeeing ſuch <hi>incorporated Societies</hi> would be ſo many <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolies,</hi>
which are <hi>Nuſances</hi> in a Countrey where the Ends of
<hi>Commerce</hi> may be otherwiſe compaſſed and obtained; yet it
hath always been the Prudence of the Government, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
<hi>Trade</hi> unto ſuch Places upon an Incorporated <hi>Company,</hi>
where it could neither be protected nor enlarged, ſave by a
<hi>Society</hi> trading and acting on a <hi>Joint Stock.</hi> And as the <hi>Intereſt</hi>
of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> with reſpect to the Quality of the Place, where
a <hi>Trade</hi> is to be managed, muſt give rules for the <hi>Method,</hi> and
determine the <hi>way</hi> in which it is to be carried on: ſo in that
caſe where it would be to the Loſs and Prejudice of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
to have a <hi>Trade</hi> laid open to whoſoever will be dealing in
it, the <hi>Publick</hi> and <hi>National</hi> Benefit ought to be prefer'd to that of
<hi>particular</hi> Perſons. And as we do know how the Trade of
<hi>England</hi> to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> was in a manner wholly loſt from
the Kingdom, during the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation</hi> of the <hi>Rump Parliament,</hi> and
of <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> by their putting it out of the <hi>Channel</hi> in
which it had been managed by an <hi>Incorporated Society,</hi> and leaving
to every one that pleaſed to venture upon it: So the <hi>Indulgence</hi>
given of late Years to <hi>Interlopers,</hi> has both had fatal Effects upon
that Trade, and has not much commended their care of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
who either allowed or connived at it. For as ſingle Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
will be eaſily tempted at ſo great a Diſtance, to commit
<hi>Depredations</hi> upon the Natives of thoſe Countries, and thereby
provoke them as well to make <hi>Reprizals</hi> upon us, as to renounce
all friendly and amicable <hi>Commerce</hi> with us; ſo no <hi>Dealers</hi> ſave
in the way of an <hi>Incorporated Company</hi> trading upon a <hi>Joint-Stock,</hi>
can erect and maintain <hi>Forts,</hi> eſtabliſh <hi>Factories,</hi> and raiſe, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99143:7"/>
pay that armed <hi>Force</hi> in the Places they have choſen for their
<hi>Reſidence</hi> and the Seat of their <hi>Traffick,</hi> as will either diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
thoſe <hi>Nations</hi> that <hi>rival</hi> us in <hi>Trade</hi> from <hi>ſupplanting</hi> them,
or the <hi>Natives</hi> upon every imagined Offence from <hi>inſulting</hi>
them. To which I crave Liberty to add, that every Nation or
State in <hi>Europe,</hi> which upon Motives of <hi>Intereſt</hi> have eſtabliſhed
a <hi>Society</hi> that might trade to the <hi>Indies,</hi> have at the firſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of ſuch a <hi>Corporation,</hi> granted vaſt <hi>Privileges</hi> unto it
for its <hi>Encouragement;</hi> of which the Dutch are a famous and
inſtructive Example, who tho they had acquired ſome begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of a Trade thither by the Induſtry of private and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Dealers, yet that wiſe People being ſenſible that it could
neither be much enlarged, nor long preſerved in that Method
of Trade, they thereupon in the Year 1602, gave Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to a <hi>Company</hi> that might trade thither, <hi>excluſive</hi> of all
other of their own <hi>Subjects;</hi> and for their <hi>Encouragement</hi> (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all the <hi>Neceſſities</hi> of the State at that time) <hi>excuſed</hi>
them from all <hi>Taxes</hi> and <hi>Impoſitions</hi> upon that <hi>Trade,</hi> for the ſpace
of 21 Years, and only obliged them, in way of an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their Dependence upon the <hi>States General,</hi> to pay in
the whole, within the Compaſs of the firſt <hi>ten</hi> Years, the Sum of
<hi>Five and twenty thouſand Florins,</hi> which amounted to little more
than 2000 <hi>l. Sterling;</hi> and was rather a <hi>Recognition</hi> of whom
they held their right of Trading thither, than a <hi>Burden</hi> upon
that Traffick. So that through the Privileges and Immunities
which were granted into them then, moſt whereof have been
ſtill continued to them ſince, they are become the moſt opulent
and powerful <hi>Trading Society</hi> of the World, and the chief Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
of the <hi>Dutch</hi> State; and tho they be but in the quality of <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
at Home, they are great <hi>Soveraigns</hi> in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and not
only give Laws to many <hi>Eaſterr</hi> Princes, but ingroſs from <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans</hi>
what parts of the <hi>Indian Traffick</hi> they pleaſe. And if ſuch
<hi>Encouragements</hi> have been thought needful towards the giving a
beginning and an increaſe to an <hi>Eaſt-India Trade,</hi> when there
were none, or at leaſt very few of thoſe <hi>Difficulties</hi> and <hi>Dangers</hi>
to be conflicted with, from <hi>Rival</hi> Nations, that are now una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably
to be encountered; and if ſuch <hi>Immunities</hi> were ſit
to be granted at a Seaſon when the <hi>Trade</hi> was not <hi>foreſtalled,</hi>
preoccupied, nor previouſly poſſeſſed to any conſiderable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99143:8"/>
by other Europeans; it is eaſy to imagine how indiſpenſibly
neceſſary it is for thoſe that would now begin a Trade thither,
to give all the <hi>Encouragements</hi> to it that are under the Power,
and within the Circle of a Government and Nation to grant.
And experience in our Neighbouring Kingdoms may teach us,
how weak and ineffectual the Conceſſion of the greateſt <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges</hi>
is towards the eſtabliſhing ſuch a <hi>Trade</hi> to the <hi>Indies,</hi> as
may anſwer the Pains and Coſt in endeavouring it, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it to turn to ſuch an account, as may bear proportion to
the <hi>Expence,</hi> as well as to the <hi>Induſtry</hi> and <hi>Hazards</hi> of attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, after ſo wealthy and potent Nations as <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Holland</hi> have gotten antecedent Poſſeſſion, and will endeavour
to ingroſs that <hi>Trade</hi> to the <hi>Excluſion</hi> of all others: For not
only all the large <hi>Privileges</hi> and <hi>Immunities</hi> granted by the <hi>King</hi>
of <hi>Denmark</hi> and the <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> for the raiſing and
promoting of an <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade, have proved inſignificant
in advancing the End and Deſign which they propoſed, at leaſt,
not to ſuch a Degree as may turn to their own Honour, and
the Profit of their reſpective Countries; but even thoſe vaſt
<hi>Encouragements</hi> given by the great Monarch of <hi>France,</hi> to raiſe
the <hi>Genius</hi> and quicken the <hi>Induſtry</hi> of his People to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
and carrying on of an <hi>Indian</hi> Trade, have proved lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
better than abortive: So that inſtead of blaming the <hi>Scots</hi>
for what we eſteem extravagant Conceſſions, in order to their
<hi>founding</hi> a <hi>Trade</hi> to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> all thoſe <hi>Indulgences</hi> may be
rather look'd upon as means much below, and diſproporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
to what they are aiming at: And they who will judg of
things impartially, will rather judg them to have been <hi>defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi>
than <hi>exceſſive</hi> in the <hi>Privileges</hi> they have granted; for as
ſome other beſides thoſe mentioned in the <hi>Act,</hi> could not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape
falling under their Thoughts and View, ſo the grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them would have been Wiſe and Juſt in it ſelf, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous
to the Undertaking which they would give Being unto.
However, as the offering and granting <hi>leſs</hi> would have left them
under an imputation of <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Weakneſs,</hi> in propoſing to
compaſs <hi>mighty</hi> Ends by <hi>feeble</hi> Means; ſo they will be more
fortunate than others have been, if the <hi>Succeſs</hi> upon thoſe <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements</hi>
do either anſwer the <hi>Wiſhes</hi> they have, or the <hi>Hopes</hi>
they entertain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:99143:8"/>
AND, <hi>Sir,</hi> inſtead of its giving any juſt Occaſion of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
that the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould endeavour at laſt
to excite their People to a Share in <hi>Trade,</hi> ſomewhat propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
to what other Nations have attained unto, it is rather
matter of Aſtoniſhment and Wonder that their Nobility, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
and Burgeſſes who conſtitute their <hi>Senate,</hi> being generally
Men of equal Wit with thoſe of the like Qualities in neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Countries, and being alſo moſt of them ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the World, as to underſtand the Advantages
which redound to Kingdoms by <hi>Traffick;</hi> and that the Figure
which one Nation maketh above another, proceedeth, <hi>caeteris
paribus,</hi> from <hi>Wealth,</hi> which is the Reſult and Product of <hi>Trade;</hi>
they ſhould have ſo long omitted the giving thoſe <hi>Encouragements</hi>
to it, which they might, and which other Nations have done.
For tho the Biaſs of their People ſeems generally to lie another
way, as I have already ſaid; yet that is meerly the effect of
<hi>Cuſtom</hi> and not of <hi>Nature:</hi> and as it would not have been difficult
at any time heretofore to have diverted and turned their Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and Humour from <hi>Souldiery</hi> to <hi>Commerce;</hi> ſo it is not to be
doubted, but that upon their being once brought to apply un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, they would be found as ingenious and diligent in <hi>Trade,</hi>
as they have had the Character to be skilful and brave in <hi>War;</hi>
nor are they worſe qualified by their <hi>Indian</hi> and <hi>African</hi> Traffick
than their Neighbours are: but if any will in that pretend to
an Advantage above another, it indiſputably falls to the Lot of
the <hi>Scots,</hi> in that they have neither long and dangerous <hi>Channels</hi>
to paſs, before they arrive at their <hi>Ports</hi> from an <hi>Indian</hi> or <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi>
Voyage; nor yet a tedious and perillous <hi>Courſe</hi> to run about
the North of <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> but that they may imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
out of the <hi>Ocean</hi> enter into ſafe and convenient <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</hi>
And then as for convenient Numbers of <hi>Men</hi> fit to be
imployed in <hi>Navigation,</hi> they are by reaſon of the Populacy
of their Country, anſwerable to the Dimenſions of it; and that
there are proportionably more of them of the inferiour Rank,
than are elſewhere, as well furniſhed with <hi>Perſons</hi> capable to be
<hi>Mariners,</hi> as any Country whatſoever, and thoſe generally,
who through the Strength of their <hi>Conſtitution</hi> and the Hardineſs
and Frugality of their <hi>Education,</hi> are not only as able as any to
undergo long Voyages, with all the Incidents of Heat, Cold,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99143:9"/>
and ſometimes ſcarcity of Proviſions for Subſiſtence, that do at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
them; and who, through an Obedience they are bred to
from their Youth, are not ſo liable to <hi>mutiny</hi> as ſome others may
be, but who can (equally with, if not better than moſt) endure
Foreign <hi>Climates,</hi> and with leſs deſpondency of Mind, and
fee bleneſs of Body, encounter thoſe Diſeaſes which Strangers
are obnoxious unto, upon their firſt Arrival in <hi>Africa</hi> and the
<hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi> So that conſidering all the natural <hi>Advantages</hi> which
the <hi>Scots</hi> have to encourage their Application to <hi>Trade,</hi> it would
ſtrangely reflect upon the Wiſdom of the <hi>Parliament</hi> of that
<hi>Kingdom,</hi> and greatly detract from the Love which they ought to
bear to their Country, and from the Care as well as Zeal which
they ought to expreſs for the <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Proſperity</hi> of it, in their
having ſo long neglected to eſtabliſh, cultivate and promote
<hi>Trade</hi> with a greater Vigour, and more extenſively than they
have done, were there not ſome <hi>Reaſons</hi> (which tho they may
already lie under the View of a Perſon of your Penetration,
I ſhall nevertheleſs for the ſake of others repreſent them unto
you) that may ſerve in ſome meaſure to <hi>excuſe,</hi> though poſſibly
they may not wholly <hi>juſtify</hi> their Conduct in this matter. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
take this for the firſt; namely, That it is not long ſince the
<hi>African</hi> and <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trades grew into that Reputation in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
of <hi>Profitableneſs,</hi> or came ſo to flouriſh through the <hi>Induſtry</hi>
of theſe <hi>Northern</hi> Nations, as to raiſe Emulation in their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
of obtaining a Share in them: For as 'tis within leſs than
<hi>thirty</hi> or <hi>forty</hi> Years, that this part of the World grew ſo fond
of many of the Productions of thoſe Places, or that trading
<hi>Societies</hi> to them being eſtabliſhed, had outwreſtled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
the <hi>Difficulties</hi> that attend <hi>Beginnings</hi> of that kind, or
had brought them to anſwer the <hi>Dangers</hi> and <hi>Expence,</hi> which
thoſe <hi>Companies</hi> were forced to be at, in laying the Foundations
of their <hi>Traffick</hi> thither, and in rendring it firſt <hi>ſafe</hi> there, and
then advancing it to be <hi>gainful</hi> and <hi>profitable</hi> here: So that it is
no wonder if <hi>Scotland</hi> (that is a Kingdom inferiour to <hi>England</hi>
in <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Opulency</hi>) ſhould ſuſpend and delay Attempts of
endeavouring to ſettle a <hi>Commerce</hi> thither, until they ſhould ſee
what ſucceſs would enſue upon the Care and Induſtry of thoſe
<hi>Engliſh Companies,</hi> which were erected for the Cultivation and
Management of thoſe <hi>two</hi> reſpective <hi>Trades.</hi> Nor did the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99143:9"/>
of <hi>Scotland</hi> in this matter differ much from the Behaviour
of other Kingdoms, and particularly of <hi>France,</hi> with which
<hi>Scotland</hi> pretends not to compare it ſelf in largeneſs of Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories,
numbers of People, or greatneſs of Treaſure: And the
adverſe Fortune which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> long wreſtled with, with the
Difficulties and Loſſes which they encountered to the weakning, if
not almoſt ruining of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertakers,</hi> before they could bring the
<hi>Trade</hi> to <hi>India,</hi> to be either <hi>profitable</hi> to themſelves and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
or <hi>honourable</hi> to the Government, might well diſcourage
the <hi>Scots</hi> from being forward in embarking in a Courſe of Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick,
under the Diſcouragements and Arduouſneſs whereof their
richer and more powerful Neighbours were ready to ſuccumb;
whereas having now ſeen, that the eſtabliſhing and carrying on
of that <hi>Trade</hi> both with <hi>Credit</hi> and vaſt <hi>Profit,</hi> is not only practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable,
but that by reaſon of the Humour that is now grown pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant
in <hi>Europe,</hi> of preferring the Productions of thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
to any of the <hi>Fruits</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> or the <hi>Manufactures</hi> of <hi>Art,</hi>
which Nations nearer home do afford, the <hi>Money</hi> of thoſe
States and Kingdoms, who are not immediately intereſted in
that <hi>Trade,</hi> is drawn away from them, and comes into the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of thoſe, who deal in the <hi>Original</hi> importing of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> firſt into their own Countries, and
then in vending them to other Nations: and the <hi>Scots</hi> being as
ready to run into the Faſhion of the World as other Nations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them are, tho they cannot ſpare ſo much Money to be drawn
out of their Country, as the gratifying their Vanity in Expences
of that kind will require; have therefore found it neceſſary to
erect an <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company, both for ſupplying themſelves,
and thereby keeping their Money at home, and alſo to export
and vend abroad to others, and by that means to draw <hi>Bullion</hi>
and <hi>Caſh</hi> into the Kingdom from thoſe Countries, where their
<hi>Indian</hi> Goods come to be diſpoſed. And they have the more
reaſon to to fall upon all the <hi>Methods,</hi> and to uſe all the <hi>Ways</hi>
they can to increaſe their <hi>Coin,</hi> ſeeing neither <hi>Nations</hi> for <hi>Perſons</hi>
are now valued, as antiently they were, by their <hi>Ingeny, Fortitude</hi>
and moral <hi>Worth,</hi> but according to their <hi>Wealth,</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of <hi>Silver</hi> that they weigh at, in the Scale of <hi>Quantity;</hi>
the Scarcity whereof in <hi>Scotland,</hi> through want of <hi>Trade</hi> (which
in the Source and Fountain of its being any where <hi>plentiful</hi>) has
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99143:10"/>
given occaſion to some of their opulent Neighbours (whom
<hi>Wealth</hi> hath made <hi>haughty</hi> and <hi>diſdainful</hi>) to faſten upon them the
Character of beggarly <hi>Scots;</hi> and the which, as it appears by
their neglect of <hi>Trade,</hi> they have hitherto born with a Tame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
as if they were not aſhamed of the Reproach. And truly
were the <hi>Eſtimate</hi> of Kingdoms and Perſons made now, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
it was wont to be, and as it really ought, <hi>Poverty</hi> (where
it is compenſated by true intrinſick <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Intellectual</hi> Worth)
is not ſuch an <hi>Ignominy</hi> as it is meant, both by thoſe that charge
it upon others, and as it is commonly taken by them, upon
whom it is faſtned; ſeeing as there may be ſound <hi>Kingdoms</hi> that
are <hi>poor</hi> and indigent in <hi>Coin,</hi> which nevertheleſs are <hi>valorous,
noble</hi> and <hi>generous;</hi> and <hi>Nations</hi> (on the contrary) vaſtly <hi>rich,</hi>
who can never emerge from being <hi>Ruſtick</hi> and <hi>Booriſh;</hi> ſo there
is nothing more apparent, tho leſs acknowledged, than that ſome
<hi>Perſons</hi> with a very light <hi>Purſe</hi> may be <hi>genteel, meritorious</hi> and <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,</hi>
while others of <hi>twenty</hi> and <hi>forty thouſand Pound</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital,
do deſerve to be as much reckoned in the Number of the
<hi>Mob,</hi> as they who ſell <hi>Brooms,</hi> or cry <hi>Small Coal.</hi> But then, <hi>Sir,</hi>
allow me to add in the ſecond place, that the <hi>Scots</hi> were for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Years, after the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and they came under <hi>One Soveraign,</hi>
treated with that Equality and Indulgence, with reference to
the <hi>mutual Traffick</hi> of the <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> or at leaſt with that Reſpect
and Fairneſs, that the <hi>Scots</hi> had not that Cauſe and Occaſion
adminiſtred unto them, of eſtabliſhing and purſuing <hi>Trade</hi> upon
a ſeparate and diſtinct <hi>Bottom</hi> of their own, as they have had
for theſe ſeveral late Years, and ſtill have; in that upon the
<hi>two</hi> Nations firſt coming to be the <hi>Subjects</hi> of <hi>one</hi> and the ſame
<hi>King,</hi> beſides the Proſpect which the <hi>Scots</hi> had, and the Hopes
that were given them, that the <hi>two Kingdoms</hi> ſhould be ſo ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
and united, as to become equally intereſted and veſted
in the ſame <hi>civil</hi> and <hi>political</hi> Liberties, Rights and Privileges,
they had in the mean time immediately granted unto them (by
the Conceſſion and Adjuſtment of the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> of both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
who ſoon after King <hi>James</hi> the <hi>Firſt</hi> had attained to the
Crown of <hi>England,</hi> were called and authorized to meet and
ſit about the debating and perfecting a compleat <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> between
the <hi>two</hi> Kingdoms) that the <hi>Scots</hi> ſhould be under <hi>no Reſtrictions</hi>
in matter of <hi>Trade</hi> more than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were, ſave that they
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99143:10"/>
were to ſtand prohibited from the Exportation of <hi>Wool,</hi> and a
few other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Productions. And as this <hi>Privilege</hi> was not
envied, or denied <hi>them</hi> by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> for many Years: So the
<hi>Scots</hi> had no reaſon all that while of complaining, that they
were unkindly or unequally dealth with, or of falling under the
Temptations of erecting Trading <hi>Societies,</hi> with larger <hi>Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities</hi>
than were granted in <hi>England.</hi> But on the contrary, they
lay under all the friendly Obligations imaginable of acquieſcing
in that Share and Proportion of <hi>Traffick,</hi> that was ſo chearfully
allowed them. Nor was the <hi>Trade</hi> of <hi>England</hi> to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi>
and to the <hi>American</hi> Plantations, and much leſs to <hi>Africk,</hi>
(which have ſince proved the Occaſion of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> entering
upon other <hi>Meaſures</hi> of <hi>Commerce,</hi> and of laying thoſe <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints</hi>
and Inhibitions upon the <hi>Scots</hi> in the Matter of <hi>Trade,</hi>
that were not formerly dreamed of) arrived at that Maturity
and Perfection, as to be the <hi>Mine</hi> of <hi>Wealth</hi> for the enriching
thoſe that were licenſed to purſue it; and by Conſequence it
would create no great Emulations, and much leſs Envy or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
between the Kingdoms about being intereſted in it. And
as there was not any conſiderable Alterations made, from what
I have mentioned, through the Conduct of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> towards
the <hi>Scots</hi> in the Buſineſs of <hi>Trade,</hi> during the Reigns of <hi>James</hi> I.
and <hi>Charles</hi> I. So every one knows that theſe <hi>Privileges,</hi> during
the Adminiſtration of the <hi>Parliament</hi> 1641, and of <hi>Oliver Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>'s
Uſurpation, were rather <hi>enlarged</hi> towards the <hi>Scots</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
than any ways <hi>diminiſhed</hi> and <hi>abridged.</hi> So that except
the Diverſion given to the <hi>Scots</hi> from following <hi>Trade</hi> with Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
which the <hi>War</hi> begot, that <hi>Scotland</hi> was for ſeveral
Years engaged in, ſometimes for, and ſometimes againſt <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
they had no Cauſe given them of Offence or Complaint,
by reaſon of thoſe Precluſions, Reſtrictions and Hardſhips which
have been put upon them in Matter of <hi>Trade</hi> ſince the Reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
1660. And I am ſorry to ſay it, conſidering that they had
both ſuffered ſo much for King <hi>Charles,</hi> and cooperated with
General <hi>Monk,</hi> to the Degree they did, towards his Reeſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon his Thrones, that they were ſoon after not only put
out and debarred from all the <hi>Privileges</hi> in <hi>Traffick,</hi> which they
had formerly enjoyed; but were in all Particulars, that reſpect
<hi>Trade,</hi> put into the perfect State and Condition of <hi>Aliens;</hi> tho
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99143:11"/>
the doing ſo, was directly repugnant to all the <hi>Laws</hi> and judged
<hi>Caſes,</hi> relative to the <hi>Poſtnati.</hi> For by ſeveral <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments</hi>
of <hi>England</hi> immediately, or ſoon after the Reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
particularly by that 12 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. ſtiled. <hi>An Act for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
and increaſing Shipping and Navigation;</hi> and by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
15 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. called, <hi>An Act for the Encouragement of Trade;</hi>
the <hi>Scots</hi> are not only treated diſtinguiſhingly worſe than any
other of the Subjects of the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> but they are
placed in the ſame Circumſtances as to <hi>Traffick,</hi> with <hi>French</hi> and
<hi>Hollanders;</hi> which as the <hi>Scots</hi> think, could be deſigned for no
other End, than the putting them into a worſe Condition, than
that both of a <hi>Province,</hi> and a <hi>Conquered</hi> People, which <hi>Ireland</hi>
is; to which they grant the Privileges which they refuſe to
<hi>Scotland.</hi> You will not thereupon be amazed, or think it
ſtrange, if the <hi>Scots</hi> have been endeavouring all along ſince, to
vindicate themſelves from that <hi>Diſhonour,</hi> as well as to relieve
themſelves from that <hi>Loſs</hi> and Damage, by ſettling their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on a <hi>Baſis</hi> and Foot of <hi>Trade,</hi> that may not leave them ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to be ſo eaſily contemned as they have been, nor conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
them expoſed to thoſe <hi>Dependences</hi> upon the <hi>Grace</hi> and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which are meerly <hi>precarious,</hi> and may be
withdrawn and denied when they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>Which leads me to the third Thing which I am to lay before
you, on the Head that I am upon, concerning the <hi>Neglect</hi> which
the <hi>Scots</hi> ſeem guilty of, in their failing to countenance and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
<hi>Trade;</hi> namely, that the <hi>Act</hi> of the late <hi>Seſſion</hi> of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for the Erecting an <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> and <hi>African</hi>
Company, is not the <hi>first,</hi> ſince the Year 1660, (in which the
Foundation of their being diſabled and crippled in <hi>Traffick</hi> was
laid) that they have paſſed and enacted with large <hi>Immunities,</hi>
for the ſettling, encouraging and promoting Trade in their
Country. For beſides the <hi>Act for encouraging a Foreign Trade,</hi>
made by the preſent Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> Anno 1693, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
there are divers <hi>Conceſſions</hi> for the raiſing and quickning the
<hi>Genius</hi> of the Kingdom, to an <hi>Outlandiſh</hi> Traffick) and which
was only deſigned to be preparatory and introductive to this <hi>lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
Act, and to pave the way for it, there were divers <hi>other</hi> Acts,
granting great <hi>Liberties</hi> and <hi>Immunities,</hi> enacted in the firſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of <hi>Charles</hi> II. immediately after the many ſevere <hi>Preclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:99143:11"/>
and <hi>Reſtrictions</hi> laid upon the <hi>Scots</hi> by the Parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
for debarring them from all ſhare in the Trade, which the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> drive either with <hi>Foreigners,</hi> or with the <hi>American</hi> Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.
Among which other Acts and Statutes of the <hi>Scots</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſubſervient hereunto, that Act is in a ſpecial manner wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of Remark, which they paſt in the Year 1661, for <hi>Fiſhings,
and for promoting of the ſame;</hi> in which, as the <hi>Privileges</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities</hi>
vouchſafed by it, are both many and very conſiderable;
ſo they were all granted and ordained to continue for ever:
Whereas the <hi>Conceſſions</hi> of the late <hi>Act,</hi> which do make ſo much
noiſe in World, are confined to a certain Term of Years, ſome
of them being limited to <hi>Tin,</hi> and thoſe of the longeſt Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
circumſcribed to <hi>One</hi> and <hi>Twenty.</hi> And the Reaſons why
that <hi>Act</hi> produced not better Effects, nor more ſignally an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
the End it was deſigned for, are ſo obvious, that they
need not be inſiſted upon, but only to be hinted at, namely,
that the ſaid <hi>Act</hi> was not ſo much deſigned to be put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as it was projected to try what could be procured in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> from the Grace and Favour of our Princes,
and thereby to gain a <hi>Precedent</hi> of their Mercy and Juſtice, in
order to ſomething that might be more conducible in Point of
<hi>Trade,</hi> to the Honour and Intereſt of that Kingdom. To
which may be added, that it was enacted rather to alarm <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and to reduce the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from the unkind and ſevere Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
they were upon towards <hi>Scotland,</hi> than that any firm Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions
were taken by the <hi>Scots</hi> for the purſuing of it. I may
likewiſe ſubjoin, That a main Reaſon of its failing in the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
was the Scarcity of Money then in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to ſupport
and promote it, to the Degree that was neceſſary againſt our
<hi>Holland</hi> Rivals; and the not inviting <hi>Foreigners</hi> to have a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the <hi>Profit,</hi> upon their bearing a Share in the <hi>Expence.</hi>
Nor in the 4<hi>th</hi> place is it improbable but that our Opulent
Neighbours the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who do in a manner wholly ſubſiſt, as
well as gain ſo much by <hi>fiſhing</hi> on our <hi>Seas,</hi> might bribe ſome
one or more great Men, imploy'd in the Head of that Concern,
ſecretly to ſupplant, and clandeſtinely to overthrow it. And
to conclude this <hi>Paragraph,</hi> it may be farther added, That as
the <hi>Genius</hi> of the <hi>Nation</hi> was not ſo much excited towards
<hi>Trade</hi> then, as it is now: So the Buſineſs of <hi>Fiſhery</hi> was not a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99143:12"/>
Game, that a People otherwiſe habituated, could be gained ſo
eaſily to ſly at, nor a <hi>Quarry</hi> they would be prevailed upon ſo
induſtriouſly to dig in, as a <hi>Trade</hi> to the <hi>Indies</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> is;
the proſecution whereof will both bring more Reputation and
Gain, than the catching of <hi>Herring</hi> and <hi>Cod</hi> could be ſuppoſed,
either by Undertakers, Merchants, or Mariners to do.</p>
            <p>But ſuffer me, <hi>Sir,</hi> to add, That upon the unequal <hi>Terms</hi>
which <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> ſtand together, in matter of <hi>Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick,</hi>
it were better for <hi>Scotland</hi> that the <hi>two</hi> Nations ſhould be
under <hi>diſtinct</hi> Kings, as they are <hi>diſtinct</hi> Kingdoms, than that
under <hi>one</hi> and <hi>the ſame</hi> Soveraign their Intereſts in point of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,</hi>
ſhould be made ſo inconſiſtent with, and repugnant to
one another, as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> will have them to be. For were
<hi>Scotland</hi> a Nation ſubdued by the People of <hi>England,</hi> it were
neither prudent nor ſafe for them, to treat the <hi>Scots</hi> with the
Rigour and Severity which they do, by excluding them from all
other Share in the <hi>Commerce</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> or with it, ſave what
they do in a manner allow to all ſorts of <hi>Aliens</hi> and Foreigners.
Nor is it unworthy of Remark, that the <hi>Romans</hi> of old carried
for the moſt part better, and behaved themſelves both more
generouſly and gently to thoſe States and Nations which they
conquered, than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are willing to do to the Kingdom
of <hi>Scotland;</hi> which beſides its being under the ſame King as
they are, is as <hi>free</hi> a Nation as <hi>England</hi> it ſelf, and altogether
<hi>independent</hi> upon it. For whenſoever the <hi>Romans</hi> ſubdued any
People, unleſs they were ſuch as had often revolted from, and
rebelled againſt them, they not only left them in the enjoiment
of all the <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> which they had poſſeſſed before,
but they both commonly enlarged, and increaſed them; and
many times admitted thoſe they had ſubdued, to a Share and
Participation of all the Privileges of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of the Roman
<hi>Republick.</hi> And the more tenacious they found any People to
be of their <hi>Liberty,</hi> and the greater Eſtimate they obſerved them
to ſet upon it, the more <hi>Favour</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> they judged that
People worthy of. Whereof tho it were very eaſy to give a
multitude of Examples, yet for brevity's ſake, I ſhall aſſign on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
but one Inſtance, which is that of their dealing with the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernates,</hi>
whom having upon a Revolt again ſubdued, and
having brought ſome of them into the Senate-Houſe, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99143:12"/>
and hear their Deſtiny; they asked of them in what
manner they would keep Peace with the Romans for the
future, in Caſe they ſhould forgive them? And being
(as <hi>Livy</hi> tells us) anſwered, <hi>Si bonam dederitis, fidam &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuam;
ſi malam, haud diuturnam:</hi> That, <hi>If the Terms were
good, they would perpetually obſerve it; but if they ſhould be bad,
they would in that caſe keep it no longer than they ſhould find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in a Condition with ſecurity to break it.</hi> With which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
ſome of the wiſeſt of the <hi>Roman Senators</hi> were ſo raviſhed,
as well as pleaſed, That they cried out, <hi>Viri, &amp; liberi, vocem
auditam eſſe; nec ullum populum, aut hominem in ea conditione, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus
eum paeniteat, diutius quam neceſſe ſit, manſurum.</hi> That <hi>they
had heard the Language of a brave People, and juſt Valuers of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
adding, that no Nation, or particular Perſon would be willing
to remain longer in any State or Condition that was diſguſtful to them,
than until they were able to reſcue and deliver themſelves.</hi> And if
this was the Opinion of the wiſe <hi>Romans,</hi> in reference to a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
whom they had ſubdued; can any that are Maſters of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Senſe imagine, and believe that a <hi>free, unconquered,</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent</hi>
People will be contented to be depreſſed by a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Nation, without ſeeking to relieve themſelves in all
the juſt and lawful Methods that lie within their Circle? To
which I might add, that there are many and fatal Examples of
the <hi>Diſcords</hi> that have ariſen between <hi>Nations</hi> under the ſame
<hi>Monarch,</hi> when the <hi>one</hi> of them has endeavoured to ingroſs and
monopolize either the <hi>foreign,</hi> or the <hi>home Trade</hi> of that Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign's
Dominions, and to preclude the reſt from having a due
and equal Share in it; witneſs the <hi>Revolt</hi> of <hi>Portugal</hi> from the
Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Caſtilians</hi> debarred them from all
<hi>Share</hi> in their <hi>Trade</hi> to the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> For that was the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Reaſon (tho there were likewiſe ſome others of a different
kind) why the <hi>Portuguiſe</hi> ſtruck off the Government of the King
of <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſet up the Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> to be their King.
Nay, I might alſo ſubjoin how that it hath often come to paſs,
that through a Nation's precluding even <hi>foreign</hi> States and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
from a <hi>Share</hi> in <hi>Traffick</hi> to its own <hi>peculiar Plantations,</hi> there
hath been formed, as it were, an univerſal Conſpiracy of all
thoſe Nations, that have been thus ſhut out and debarred, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the wreſting of that Trade from it, or for making it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99143:13"/>
unprofitable and uſeleſs to it. The <hi>firſt</hi> whereof is verified in
the <hi>Portuguiſe,</hi> who are in a manner wholly beaten out of their
vaſt <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade, through the Provocation they gave to
other Nations by their ſtriving to ingroſs it. And as to the <hi>lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are now ſunk under the Experience of it, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to their Traffick to their own <hi>Weſt-Indies;</hi> whoſe Trade
thither, inſtead of continuing to be <hi>beneficial</hi> to them, is turned
and improved to their <hi>Prejudice,</hi> by thoſe whom they excluded
from all Participation in it. How much leſs then will <hi>free</hi> and
<hi>independent</hi> Nations patiently endure, that one or two Kingdoms
or States ſhould <hi>monopolize</hi> to themſelves <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Trade</hi> to <hi>Africa,
India</hi> and <hi>America;</hi> as likewiſe in effect to ſeveral Places of
<hi>Europe?</hi> Yea ſhould the <hi>Scots</hi> tamely acquieſce in this, all they
would gain by their being under <hi>one</hi> and the ſame <hi>Monarch</hi> with
the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> would be to become involved in all the foreign
Wars and Troubles, in which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> may be at any time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged;
but to have little or no Share in the Bleſſings and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
of <hi>its</hi> Proſperity and Peace. And ſeeing moſt of the <hi>Trade</hi>
of <hi>Scotland</hi> lieth with neighbouring Nations, and eſpecially thoſe
which <hi>England</hi> hath oftneſt Provocation to quarrel with; and
the <hi>Scots</hi> driving very little <hi>Traffick</hi> with Countries far remote;
it conſequently follows that upon the Commencement of a War
with thoſe adjacent States and Kingdoms, the <hi>Scots</hi> do become
in a manner, ſhut out from, and deprived of all <hi>foreign</hi> Trade;
while in the mean time the <hi>Engliſh</hi> do continue to carry on a
vaſt and Beneficial <hi>Trade</hi> to <hi>Turky, Africk</hi> and the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> as
well as to and from their own <hi>American Plantations.</hi> Of which,
as the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> has had oftner than once the woful
Experience, upon any Rupture that hath hapned between the
<hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>England</hi> and the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> with whom, as moſt
of the <hi>Scots Trade</hi> lieth, both as to the <hi>Exportation</hi> of their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities,
and the <hi>Importation</hi> of what they want and need;
ſo the moſt of their <hi>Traffick</hi> hath in thoſe Caſes, been wholly
interrupted and in a manner entirely ceaſed; while at the ſame
time the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have kept up a large and <hi>beneficial Trade</hi> to other
places, in which the <hi>Scots</hi> are by ſeveral <hi>Engliſh Acts</hi> of Parliament
debarred and precluded from all dealing. Yea the preſent War
with <hi>France</hi> doth, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> more affect <hi>Scotland,</hi> in point
of <hi>Traffick,</hi> than it doth <hi>England;</hi> becauſe as thoſe Productions
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99143:13"/>
and Commodities which the <hi>Scots</hi> uſed to export thither, muſt
neceſſarily lie upon their hands, through their having no other
Place, to which to carry them; ſo they muſt be contented to
want thoſe <hi>French</hi> Goods which they were accuſtomed to bring
home in Lieu and Exchange of their own; while in the <hi>interim</hi>
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> make a ſhift both to vend their Productions elſewhere,
and to ſupply themſelves in other Places, with what may anſwer
thoſe Commodities they uſed to import from <hi>France.</hi> To which
may be added, that if <hi>Scotland</hi> remain not only under thoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions,
Limitations and Reſtrictions in matter of <hi>Trade,</hi> to
which it is ſtak'd down and conſined by the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>England,</hi> for <hi>the encouraging and encreaſing of Shipping and
Navigation,</hi> and for <hi>the Encouragement of Trade,</hi> and againſt <hi>the
Importation of foreign Cattel;</hi> but be withal diſcouraged, envied,
depreſſed and counteracted, when (to prevent the Violation of,
and out of reſpect to thoſe <hi>Engliſh Acts</hi>) they apply themſelves to
a new Method and Courſe of <hi>Traffick,</hi> and endeavour to ſettle
themſelves on another <hi>Baſis</hi> and Bottom of <hi>Trade</hi> than they were
formerly accuſtomed to: I ſay (if theſe be the Circumſtances they
muſt abide under) the <hi>Scots</hi> inſtead of being <hi>Gainers,</hi> are great <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers</hi>
by the <hi>two</hi> Kingdoms coming to be <hi>united</hi> under <hi>one</hi> Soveraign.
In reference whereunto, tho I could aſſign <hi>ſeveral</hi> Particulars,
wherein they are thereby come to be endamaged; yet I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
give an Inſtance in one; namely, that by their <hi>Incorporation</hi>
with <hi>England</hi> under <hi>one</hi> and the ſame King, their antient, long
and firm <hi>Alliance</hi> with <hi>France</hi> is entirely <hi>diſſolved,</hi> iſſued and
come to a final Period: Which as it had been many times of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
advantage both to <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> ſo it was of great
Profit, as well as Honour to the <hi>Scots,</hi> through the many ſignal
Privileges ariſing from that Confederacy, which the <hi>Scots,</hi> in
Contradiſtinction from all <hi>other</hi> Nations, peculiarly enjoy'd, but
are now totally loſt to them. Upon which, <hi>Sir,</hi> it were not
difficult to make thoſe juſt and natural Reflections, which would
ſhew that the preſent Conduct of the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Scotland,</hi> is not (if we will take the Opinion of the <hi>Scots</hi>)
ſo temperate, prudent and diſcreet, as might be expected from
a People that are ſo grateful, generous and wiſe, as the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
have been always charactered to be. But to prevent giving Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
I ſhall ſuperſede and wave them all, and ſatisfy my ſelf,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99143:14"/>
in that I have by the bare mention of the laſt Particular, ſtarted
Matter worthy of the matureſt Thoughts of thoſe of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Penetration, either <hi>in</hi> our <hi>Senate</hi> or <hi>out</hi> of it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I ſhall only, on this <hi>Topick</hi> of Diſcourſe, further ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join,
that upon the <hi>Terms</hi> on which the <hi>Scots</hi> ſtand, with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to all the <hi>beneficial Trade</hi> in which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
they are not only in <hi>as bad,</hi> but in a <hi>worſe</hi> Condition than the
Subjects of any <hi>foreign</hi> Prince are; becauſe that as they of a <hi>foreign</hi>
Kingdom or State, may for and upon their being <hi>excluded</hi> from
<hi>Trading</hi> into the <hi>Engliſh American</hi> Plantations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> make <hi>Repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zals</hi>
upon the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in debarring them from the Liberty and
Benefit of <hi>Traffick</hi> to ſuch Places, as are under the Power and
Juriſdiction of thoſe reſpective Kingdoms and States; and from
and with which they drive and purſue their moſt uſeful and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching
<hi>Commerce;</hi> ſo the Subjects of foreign Princes and States
are through the alone Countenance, Conceſſion and Authority
of their own proper and reſpective Soveraigns, always at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to erect and eſtabliſh what <hi>Trade</hi> they pleaſe, to Places ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>unpreocoupied,</hi> or where <hi>freedom</hi> of Commerce is allowed
promiſcuouſly, to thoſe of all Countries that ſhall think fit to
deal with them: Wherein as <hi>Foreigners</hi> fall not under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul
of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> nor are diſcouraged by their Menaces; ſo in
reference to thoſe Princes and Rulers, under whom thoſe Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners
live, there is no room to make impreſſion upon them,
to withdraw from countenancing their own People, by the little
<hi>Arts</hi> and the various means of <hi>Influence</hi> which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are in
a Condition to uſe, and are ſuppoſed ſometimes to practiſe, for
diverting the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Great Britain</hi> from giving that equal En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to the <hi>Scots,</hi> in matter of <hi>Trade,</hi> which the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>England</hi> think they have a Right both to demand and to
expect, and which (through the <hi>Favour</hi> of the <hi>Common Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns</hi>
of both Nations) has been diſtinctively vouchſafed them.
Which leads me to the next thing that I do crave the liberty to
lay unpartially before you.</p>
            <p>Which is, that the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> is as much a free and
independent <hi>Kingdom</hi> as the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is. That it is
neither a <hi>Subdued</hi> nor a <hi>Tributary</hi> Nation, nor in the quality of a
<hi>Province,</hi> peopled by a <hi>Swarm</hi> and <hi>Colony</hi> from hence. For tho
it may and doth acknowledg <hi>England</hi> to be a more large, more
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99143:14"/>
populous, opulent and powerful Kingdom than it ſelf, yet it is far
from owning any Subjection or Inferiority to it. For as to all
the mutual Duties and Offices, which may only argue the Eſteem
and Reſpect which one <hi>Independent</hi> Nation yieldeth to another;
theſe it both confeſſeth to be due, and is ready to pay unto <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
But to receive Laws from it, or yield an Obedience to
its Authority, it neither ought to do it, nor will. And of
how near Affinity and Alliance ſoever the two Kingdoms may
be to one another, with reſpect to Identity of Language, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
of Manners, Analogy of Cuſtoms, and Agreeableneſs
of Eſſential Rights and Liberties, and by reaſon of their being
under one and the ſame King: Yet they do nevertheleſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
and maintain diſtinct and different <hi>Juriſdictions</hi> and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities,
have ſeparate and <hi>independent Parliaments,</hi> and are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by their own proper, peculiar and reſpective Laws, as
if they were the Subjects of ſeveral Kings, and each of them
ruled by a <hi>diſtinct</hi> Monarch. Nor are the <hi>Parliaments</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi>
leſs the <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> of that <hi>Kingdom</hi> and People, or under
leſs Obligations of conſulting for, and promoting the <hi>Welfare</hi>
and Proſperity of their Country, than the <hi>Parliaments</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
are. Neither can the <hi>latter</hi> comptrol or ſuperſede the <hi>Acts</hi>
of the <hi>former,</hi> more than the <hi>former</hi> can the Acts of the <hi>latter:</hi>
For it is not with the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as it is with that
of <hi>Ireland;</hi> in that the Iriſh Parliament have not ſo much as a
<hi>Conſultative</hi> Power about a <hi>Bill,</hi> and much leſs are they cloth'd
with a <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> ſo far to paſs it, as to offer it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
and agreed upon for the Royal Aſſent, unleſs it hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly
received the Approbation of the <hi>Privy Council</hi> of <hi>England,</hi>
and hath been tranſmitted thither, under the Stamp and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of the <hi>Broad-Seal</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> granting them <hi>Liberty</hi>
and <hi>Permiſſion</hi> ſo to do: Whereas the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi>
hath both a full and plenary, as well as the ſole Right of intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing,
moulding, preparing and paſſing whatſoever <hi>Bills</hi> it
judges to be ſubſervient to the King's Honour, adapted to the
preſervation of the Publick Peace, and conducible to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
the Trade and Proſperity of that Kingdom, without
being obliged to have the leaſt antecedent regard to what Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
the Privy Council, or the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> either in
its Great <hi>Senate,</hi> or in its Inferiour <hi>Courts,</hi> may have of thoſe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99143:15"/>
               <hi>Bills</hi> which the <hi>Scots</hi> bring in, debate and vote in order to their
being <hi>enacted</hi> into <hi>Laws.</hi> Nor is the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
leſs Obligation, both by the Duty of his High and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Station, and by his Regal Oath, to ſeek and promote the
Good and Welfare of <hi>Scotland,</hi> than he is bound by the like
Ties, to contrive and purſue the Proſperity and Happineſs of
<hi>England.</hi> And as <hi>England</hi> doth not allow it to fall within the
Circle and Verge of the Royal Authority to ſuperſede, vacate
and diſpenſe with <hi>Laws</hi> once <hi>enacted:</hi> So the <hi>Scots</hi> do no leſs
diſclaim ſuch a <hi>Prerogative</hi> in the <hi>Soveraign,</hi> eſpecially with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to <hi>beneficial</hi> Laws, and ſuch as are of a <hi>civil</hi> and <hi>political</hi>
Nature: Yea, they have as much blamed and withſtood all Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions
of their Monarchs, of <hi>diſpenſing</hi> with <hi>Laws</hi> that are <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi>
and about <hi>Religious</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Matters, as the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
themſelves have done; tho poſſibly they have both withſtood
that Claim of their Kings, as much to their own <hi>Damage,</hi> and
the Prejudice of their true <hi>Intereſts,</hi> as to the <hi>Reſtraint</hi> upon,
and <hi>Diminution</hi> of the <hi>Regal Prerogative.</hi> And then as for that
Right, commonly granted to be reſident in the Kings of <hi>Great
Britain,</hi> and to be an Incident inſeparable from the Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
of putting a <hi>Negative</hi> (whenſoever they judg it neceſſary)
on <hi>Parliamentary Bills,</hi> it is the ſame in whoſoever is King of
theſe two Kingdoms, in reference to <hi>England,</hi> that it is to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
And whatſoever <hi>Limitations</hi> are conceived by the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
to lie upon the <hi>Prerogative</hi> of our <hi>Monarchs,</hi> as to their giving a
<hi>Negative</hi> to <hi>Bills</hi> of <hi>Right,</hi> and ſuch as are of a <hi>National <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tility,</hi>
the <hi>Scots</hi> do plead the ſame <hi>Reſtrictions</hi> to be upon the <hi>Soveraign</hi>
Power, in reference to <hi>Bills,</hi> claiming either the Confirmation
of antient Legal <hi>Privileges,</hi> or containing and making Proviſion
of ſuch greater or leſſer <hi>National Benefits,</hi> which (without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
Prejudice to their publick and general Intereſt) they
cannot be without, nor account themſelves either Happy or
Eaſy, through the want of their paſſing into <hi>Laws.</hi> So that,
<hi>Sir,</hi> this being the Nature, Frame and Conſtitution of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and a true and juſt Account of the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
Power and Authority of the <hi>Parliaments</hi> of that <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi>
I do not ſee why the <hi>Scots</hi> (while they do nothing that
interferes with their <hi>Allegiance</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> or that doth lie in
the leaſt repugnancy to the <hi>two</hi> Kingdoms remaining <hi>united</hi> under
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99143:15"/>
               <hi>one Monarch,</hi> or that importeth ſo much as <hi>Shadow</hi> of <hi>Hoſtility</hi>
againſt <hi>England</hi>) may not conſult, contrive and enact <hi>Laws</hi>
for the promoting their own <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Proſperity,</hi> without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding
whether ſuch Laws do either <hi>immediately,</hi> or in the
remote <hi>Conſequences</hi> of them, leſſen and prove ſomewhat preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
to the <hi>Trade</hi> and Opulency of <hi>England.</hi> Nor can the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> juſtly complain of, or blame this Conduct of the <hi>Scots,</hi>
conſidering what they have ſo often done themſelves, for the
<hi>advancing</hi> their own <hi>Traffick</hi> and <hi>Wealth;</hi> not only without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting
whether the Methods, in which they did it, might not
be <hi>prejudicial</hi> to the <hi>Scots</hi> Nation, but both under an apparent
proſpect that it would infallibly be ſo; and upon the Influence
of thoſe Motives, which directly imported that what they did,
ſhould unavoidably be to the <hi>Damage</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by depreſſing
it, and keeping it impotent and indigent. And ſo <hi>justifiable</hi> as
well as <hi>lawful,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> judged this manner of procedure to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>Scots</hi> to be, that they have adapted it for one of the
<hi>Maxims</hi> of the <hi>Politicks</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> that in order to render
this Kingdom Honourable, Potent and Wealthy, <hi>Scotland</hi> muſt
by all imaginable Means be kept Weak and Poor, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
contemptible. Nor hath this been leſs the <hi>Conſequence</hi> and
<hi>Effect,</hi> than it was the projected and deſigned <hi>End</hi> of thoſe
<hi>Engliſh Laws,</hi> bearing the Titles which I have formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned:
So that upon Suppoſition that the late <hi>Scots Act</hi> was
made not only under View, but out of Intention of <hi>leſſening</hi> and
abridging the <hi>Trade</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> by means of <hi>extending</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging
the <hi>Traffick</hi> of <hi>Scotland;</hi> yet it is no more but meting
to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as they have meaſured to the <hi>Scots;</hi> and it is
but drawing them a <hi>Copy</hi> of what was an <hi>Original</hi> of their own.
To which I ſhall only add on this Head, that there never was a
Nation that was <hi>independent</hi> upon another, (under whatſoever
Incorporations, Confederacies and Unions they might otherwiſe
be) that did ever neglect, depart from, or forbear the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
the Advancement of its own Benefit and Reputation in
the World, meerly becauſe the Conſequence and Effect thereof
might be the leſſening the Profit, and obſtructing the growing
and menacing Power and Opulency of another Nation, by
which it was overſhadowed and depreſſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:99143:16"/>
Which conducteth me, <hi>Sir,</hi> to the next thing, which I ſhall
preſume to lay before you, namely how much, many of your
great People, through denying themſelves liberty to think, as
well as of your <hi>forty thouſand Pound</hi> Men of the <hi>Mob</hi> at <hi>Garra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,</hi>
(to whom God hath given <hi>Riches</hi> for denying them <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding</hi>
and good Nature) are miſtaken, <hi>firſt</hi> in believing
themſelves, and <hi>then</hi> in attempting to impoſe their belief upon
others, that the <hi>Scots Act</hi> for the Erecting of a <hi>Company</hi> to
<hi>trade</hi> to <hi>Africa</hi> and the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> will be of prejudice to the
<hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and to the <hi>Commerce</hi> and <hi>Traffick</hi> thereof.
Whereas upon the Uſe of all the Senſe I have, and after the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
exerciſe of that reaſonable Faculty which God hath given
me, I am ſo far from being of their Mind, that I do judg no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to be more calculated and adapted for the Advantage of
this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> than the <hi>Eſtabliſhment</hi> of that <hi>Company</hi> is; and
that the obſtructing the Execution of that <hi>Scots Act,</hi> will be
of fatal Conſequence to <hi>England,</hi> and eſpecially to their Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
trading to <hi>Africa</hi> and the <hi>Eaſt-Indies;</hi> ſeeing this <hi>Company</hi>
which the <hi>Scots</hi> are eſtabliſhing, is not to drive a <hi>Traffick</hi> with
ſome little <hi>Iſland,</hi> or diminutive Place, where all the <hi>Trade</hi> is
already preoccupy'd, engroſs'd and monopolized, but it is to
carry on a <hi>Commerce</hi> on <hi>two</hi> vaſt <hi>Continents,</hi> and all their adjacent
<hi>Iſlands;</hi> where (beſides what is already entered upon and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
by the <hi>Engliſh</hi>) there are many large <hi>Territories,</hi> for others
to occupy and found a <hi>Traffick</hi> in, and theſe no leſs fertile in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
and Manufactures, fit to be imported into <hi>Europe,</hi> and
there vended and diſpoſed to great Profit, than they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
inclinable and prepared to take of what we can export
unto them, of both Kinds of our own. Indeed were the <hi>Scots
Act</hi> framed and intended to worm and ſupplant the <hi>Engliſh</hi> out
of thoſe Shares of the <hi>Indian</hi> and <hi>African</hi> Trades, of which they
are poſſeſſed, or to drive them from their <hi>Forts</hi> and <hi>Factories,</hi> I
do think he ſhould not have Engliſh Blood in his Veins, who
would not warmly reſent the Deſign, and endeavour not only to
prevent the Execution of it, but to revenge the Attempt upon
thoſe that have projected it. But as the <hi>Scots</hi> have no intention
of making the leaſt Encroachments upon the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in any of
thoſe particular Places where they have eſtabliſhed a <hi>Commerce:</hi>
So it will be both for the <hi>Honour</hi> of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and prove
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:99143:16"/>
exceeding contributory to the <hi>Opulency</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as well as
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to get a larger Share of the <hi>African</hi> and <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>
Trades into their <hi>joint</hi> and <hi>aſſociated</hi> Hands, than the two <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies</hi>
of <hi>England</hi> of thoſe Denominations trading thither, have
been hitherto able to compaſs and obtain, or can be in a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſingly to carry on and ſupport. Seeing as it may be done
without the <hi>one's</hi> encroaching upon, or interfering with the
<hi>other</hi> there; ſo there is <hi>Vent</hi> in <hi>Europe</hi> for more <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Goods
than both the Nations can import and bring from thence, were
the <hi>Stocks</hi> of each of them <hi>larger,</hi> and their <hi>Trades</hi> more flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
than that of the <hi>one</hi> ever was, or than there is any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
that <hi>either</hi> of them will at any time hereafter come to be.
And while ſeveral other <hi>Nations</hi> (betwixt whom and <hi>England</hi>
there are none of the Obligations of Friendſhip, mutual Aid,
and Aſſiſtance which are between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>Scots</hi>) are
endeavouring to eſtabliſh, promote and ſupport <hi>Trades</hi> both to
<hi>Africa</hi> and the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> it is matter of Wonder and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould rather deſire to have the <hi>French,
Danes, Brandenburgers,</hi> &amp;c. become Partakers and Sharers in
thoſe <hi>Trades,</hi> and with as large Privileges and Immunities as any
mentioned in the <hi>Northern Act,</hi> than that the <hi>Scots</hi> ſhould have
any Portion in them; which would provoke ſome, that are not
very ready to entertain Jealouſies, to think that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>two</hi> Kingdoms have been ſo long under <hi>the ſame</hi> Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
and have lived in the mutual Exerciſes of many Offices
which had an exterior ſhew of Friendſhip, that yet after all
there remaineth too much of the antient National <hi>Pique:</hi> And
God grant that it arrive not at laſt to a Rupture, and thereupon
to ſuch an Enmity as uſeth to be the Effect of Strife and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
when thoſe that have been Friends, and ſuppoſed to lie
in one anothers Boſom, come to quarrel and fall out. Nor is it
unworthy of Remark, how that in <hi>Edward the Confeſſor</hi>'s Days,
the <hi>Amity</hi> between theſe <hi>two</hi> Nations was ſo warm and ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
indiſſoluble, that (notwithſtanding their being under diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Monarchs) that good King would not ſuffer the <hi>Scots</hi> to be
ſtiled nor accounted <hi>Aliens,</hi> and much leſs to be treated as ſuch,
(as ſome of late, in Contempt as well as Neglect of their being
under <hi>one</hi> Soveraign, have been endeavouring they ſhould) which
yet ſoon after (upon Motives which I ſhall not now mention)
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99143:17"/>
not only grew cold, but became exchanged into that mutual
Hatred, which many Ages could not allay, nor thoſe Seas of
Blood, ſhed in their Wars againſt one another, totally and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
extinguiſh, until by the Wiſe and Gracious Providence of
God, they became the Subjects of one and the ſame King; and
inſtead of continuing to be diſtinguiſhed by the Titles of the
<hi>Kingdoms</hi> of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> which had been the Badges
of their Variance, they grew ſo far <hi>united</hi> into <hi>one Monarchy,</hi> as
to be denominated by the <hi>ſtile</hi> of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> which is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
applicable unto, and comprehends <hi>both.</hi> To which allow me
to add, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> having already poſſeſſed themſelves of the
moſt <hi>beneficial</hi> Parts of the <hi>African,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>
Trades, and having not only raiſed themſelves to wonderful
Grandure and Opulency in the <hi>Indies,</hi> but attained to that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty
of Power, as both to give Laws to moſt of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of thoſe Eaſtern Dominions, and to make Depredations and
Encroachments upon, and ſubdue and diſpoſſeſs whom they
pleaſe; it is matter of great Amazement, that the Engliſh
ſhould not be willing to admit the <hi>Scots</hi> to eſtabliſh a <hi>Trade</hi> to
the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> if it were but that by their <hi>joining,</hi> and uniting
their <hi>Force</hi> and Power with that of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> may
be reſiſted and withſtood in thoſe Invaſions and Rapines which
they are inclinable enough to commit upon the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> And there
is reaſon to expect that <hi>England,</hi> even through the Advice of
their own <hi>Eaſt-India-Company,</hi> ſhould encourage the Scots in
what they are attempting, rather than to obſtruct and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearten
them, conſidering what the <hi>Dutch,</hi> by <hi>Force</hi> as well as
<hi>Fraud,</hi> have wreſted from and diſpoſſeſſed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of; and
that chiefly through their want of ſufficient Numbers of Men
in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> to protect and defend their <hi>Forts,</hi> Factories
and Plantations, with which <hi>Scotland</hi> can both eaſily and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
furniſh them, if the late <hi>Act</hi> of that Kingdom, for erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company, obtain and have the Succeſs that is
deſigned by it, and meet not with <hi>Oppoſition</hi> from thoſe, whoſe
true <hi>Intereſt</hi> it is to <hi>further</hi> and <hi>promote</hi> it. Concerning which
<hi>Act</hi> and <hi>Company</hi> it was enacted to give an Eſtabliſhment unto, I
will aſſume the liberty further to ſay, that the one ſeems
framed, and the other erected under view, and with an Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of as much <hi>Advantage</hi> to accrue to <hi>England,</hi> as what <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:99143:17"/>
it ſelf propoſeth to gain, or can have any proſpect of. For
as a full <hi>Moiety,</hi> if not <hi>two Thirds,</hi> deſigned to be raiſed upon
the Encouragement and in the Execution of that <hi>Act,</hi> will (or
at leaſt may) be the <hi>Money</hi> of Engliſh-men, continuing to live
and reſide in this Kingdom: So the <hi>Profit</hi> that ariſeth from the
management of the <hi>Scots</hi> Stock, will (in proportion thereunto)
fall to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and become a Part of their <hi>Capital.</hi> So that
beſides the Satisfaction which (by this Means) will be given to
many <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who have been diſcontented, through their want
of <hi>Shares</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company of <hi>England,</hi> and have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
run upon <hi>Interloping,</hi> (which this will alſo put a Period to)
moſt of all the <hi>Gain</hi> ariſing by the <hi>Trade</hi> of the <hi>Scots</hi> Company,
will center in <hi>England,</hi> and in time add greatly to the Treaſure
of this <hi>Kingdom.</hi> Which <hi>Benefit</hi> being <hi>National</hi> and Univerſal,
may be accounted more than a Compenſation for any Damage,
that the <hi>Scots Eaſt-India</hi> Company can be ſuppoſed to do to the
Engliſh Corporation of that Denomination. And foraſmuch as
the <hi>Northern</hi> Society cannot prejudice their <hi>Southern</hi> Neighbours
in the Vent of their Commodities, either as to what the <hi>Scots</hi>
themſelves uſed to take off, nor in what they uſed to diſpoſe
elſewhere; ſeeing that as the greateſt Part, if not the whole
<hi>Indian</hi> Goods that have been conſumed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> were uſually
brought in and imported from <hi>Holland,</hi> where they are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
cheaper than they can be in <hi>England:</hi> So the Engliſh
Company can be no ways prejudiced, in relation to thoſe <hi>Indian</hi>
Commodities which they have hitherto diſpoſed elſewhere in
any Parts of <hi>Europe;</hi> Becauſe that as theſe <hi>Foreign</hi> Countries are
ready to take off and conſume more than both the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and
<hi>Scots</hi> Companies can furniſh them with, it will likewiſe be many
Years before the <hi>Scots Company</hi> (by reaſon both of the vaſt
Charge they muſt be at, in ſettling their <hi>Trade,</hi> and the many
<hi>Difficulties</hi> and Loſſes incident to <hi>Beginners</hi>) can be in a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to under, ſell the Engliſh, which is the only way they can be
imagined to have, of worming the Engliſh out of the <hi>Vent</hi> and
Sale of their Commodities: So that the whole Prejudice which
can be ſuppoſed to befal the Engliſh <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company,
through the Execution of the <hi>Scots Act,</hi> reſolves it ſelf into the
<hi>Immunity</hi> of the <hi>Scots</hi> from paying <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> for 21 Years, while
the Engliſh remain all that while under ſuch a <hi>Tribute, Tax</hi> and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:99143:18"/>
               <hi>Impoſition:</hi> which, <hi>Sir,</hi> ſuffer me to ſay, is not a Matter of
that Importance, as to deſerve all the Noiſe that is made about
the <hi>Scots</hi> Company. And tho I be not ſo much a <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> as
either to ſmile at the ſeeing an <hi>Aſs</hi> eat <hi>Thiſtles,</hi> or at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
a <hi>Gown-man</hi> of 70 reading a <hi>Madrigal</hi> with his <hi>Spectacles</hi>
on; yet I can hardly forbear laughing to find a Nation that is
called <hi>Wiſe,</hi> and which really is ſo, to fill both the <hi>Kingdom,</hi>
and the adjacent Parts of the World, with Clamour and Twat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
becauſe the Engliſh <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company pays <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> for
all it imports from thence, while the <hi>Scots</hi> are for a few Years
to be exempted from it; but who are during that time to be at
the Expence of double the Value of that Impoſition in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<hi>Charges</hi> they muſt be at, in the erecting <hi>Forts</hi> and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing
<hi>Factories,</hi> and towards the ſettling of their Trade, to
make it <hi>practicable</hi> as well as <hi>ſafe:</hi> Which if they prove ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
as to compaſs and effect, they will not only after the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration
of that Term of Years, be contented to be liable to
pay <hi>Cuſtoms;</hi> but that Kingdom may in that time, by the Means
of their acquired and improved <hi>Trade,</hi> be in a Condition to
contribute more, both to the <hi>Support</hi> of the <hi>Civil Government</hi> of
theſe Nations; and to the defraying of the <hi>Charges</hi> of any <hi>War,</hi>
which the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> may come to be engaged in, than they have
hitherto been in a Capacity to do, and thereby leſſen the Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of <hi>England,</hi> greatly beyond what they are for 21 Years to
be <hi>excuſed</hi> from in <hi>Cuſtoms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> before I eaſe you of the Trouble which I have given you, I
ſhould lay under your View the ſeveral <hi>Ways</hi> and <hi>Methods</hi> which
<hi>your Houſe,</hi> as well as the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Peers,</hi> are taking to defeat the
Deſign of the <hi>Scots Act,</hi> and ſhould make thoſe Reflections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them which are juſt and natural, as well as obvious. But the
whole Procedure in that Matter being ſomewhat extraordinary,
I ſhall not venture upon it, ſeeing it cannot be done as it ought,
with that Reſpect and Reverence which is due to ſuch awful
and auguſt Bodies. And therefore all I will ſay, ſhall be only
theſe two Things: <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the <hi>two Houſes</hi> ſeem to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
fully as much to the <hi>Intereſt</hi> and Reputation of the <hi>Scots
Company,</hi> as the <hi>Parliament</hi> of that Kingdom has done in giving
<hi>it being,</hi> by thinking it worthy of ſo much of their Notice, Time
and Debate, as they have beſtowed upon it; eſpecially at this Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99143:18"/>
when their whole Time and utmoſt Abilities are little
enough to be imployed in the <hi>redreſſing</hi> the <hi>Grievances</hi> of their
<hi>own Country,</hi> and in finding out <hi>Ways</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> for carrying
on the <hi>War</hi> againſt <hi>France,</hi> and for enabling the King to touch
that <hi>Foreign</hi> Monarch in the ſenſible Part. For, believe me, <hi>Sir,</hi>
the generality of Mankind have conceived a greater Eſteem for
the <hi>Scots Eaſt-India</hi> Company, and have entertained more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
Thoughts of its Succeſs than otherwiſe they would,
meerly from the <hi>Jealouſies</hi> you have expreſt, and the <hi>Oppoſition</hi>
you are giving unto <hi>it.</hi> And then, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> That all the Ways
and Methods you have hitherto fallen upon for the obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
the Execution of the <hi>Scots Act,</hi> and the giving <hi>Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement</hi>
to their <hi>Trade</hi> to <hi>Africa</hi> and the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
a <hi>Conſpiracy</hi> againſt your ſelves, and the carrying on a
<hi>Plot</hi> to endamage and miſchieve <hi>England:</hi> For do you think, <hi>Sir,</hi>
that by forbidding any of the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> to build Ships
for, or to ſell to the <hi>Scots</hi> ſuch as are built already, you will
diſable and incapacitate them from proceeding in their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking?
ſeeing they may buy of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> as many as they
will, and of what Bulk they pleaſe, and at cheaper Rates than
they could do here. So that this, inſtead of being an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
to the <hi>Scots,</hi> will only injure your ſelves, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
the <hi>Dutch.</hi> And then as for the prohibiting any of the
Subjects of <hi>England</hi> to become Partners in the <hi>Scots Stock;</hi> as
it will tempt many of your wealthy People to leave <hi>England</hi>
and to withdraw to <hi>Scotland,</hi> which few Men (out of meer
fondneſs to their Country) will forbear to do, when their
Intereſt tempts them to it; ſo the <hi>Scots</hi> cannot want enough
of other Nations to become Partners in their Stock and
Trade, upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> declining of it. And as hundreds
of the <hi>Dutch</hi> particularly, will both greedily and thankfully
embrace the Propoſal; ſo I dread to mention the Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which may enſue upon ſuch a Conjunction between the
<hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>them.</hi> Nor will I call over the other Methods you
have been upon for fruſtrating the <hi>Scots</hi> Attempt in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of an <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company, becauſe the very mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them would be to expoſe them, which the great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
that I bear for thoſe <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> will not
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99143:19"/>
admit me to do: And therefore I will here end, and only
aſſure you, that tho I be a Stranger to you, yet the very
taking the liberty to addreſs this Paper to you, ſheweth how
Ambitious I am, and how much I do value my ſelf, upon
the obtaining any Occaſion of teſtifying with what Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
I am,</p>
