            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

there are which in these dayes
bringe no small detriment or

which is abhominable. And these how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
they seeme to differ the one from
the other, yet the one is strengthned and
hardned by the other, and this with a mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
reciprocation:</p>
            <p>Against both these, the holy Ghost applies
a soueraigne remedie: <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 14. <hi>Followe
after peace and holines, without which no man

Of the latter of these, or rather of both,
(for the former oft times proceedeth from
the latter, howsoeuer for a while enuy palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateth

are signified by one Greeke word) I haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

a spectacle for others to beware of rash, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,

            <p>This haue I done (all other peaceable

of mine owne duety both to God and

would neuer be so affected to them as they
are, if they knew their fearefull estate.</p>

that I haue rather endeauoured to

fill vp large volumes, of purpose omitting
many the vilest thinges, partly for offending
chaste eares, partly for sparing them, vnlesse
further occasion be ministred by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues.
And as for the rudenes of the stile, either by

superfluous repetitions, or redundant spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
let the inconuenience both of time &amp;

also many waies distracted about other bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesses.

BRIEFE DISCOVERYE,
of some of the errors and abhominations,
dailye practised and increased, amongst the

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T may seeme strange, that
any, who pretend (aboue all
other) sinceritie in Religion,
and there-vpon forsake their

yet notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, be found
to abound aboue others with
all kinde of debate, malice, adulteries, cousonages,
and such other like enormities: And that so much
the more in the dayes of their banishment and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
pouertie, which outward affliction, doth
euen humble the wicked: And yet so farre from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
that when they are shewed and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1439:5"/>
hide, cloake, reproach and reuile their admonishers

and should be drawn by them through their pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

and vnfruitefull workes of darkenes, &amp;
to runne with them to that fearefull extreamitie in
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demning al other churches &amp; men: I thought it
my duetie according as my leasure (which is small,
&amp; my abilitie which is lesse, would permit) vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
to giue warning to others of their leaders
euil dealing, wherby their people are deuoured.</p>
            <p>And, although I knowe I shall object my selfe
heerein but to the reproach of virulent and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
tongues, yet shall I be content to beare it,
that others may reape benefit thereby. Neither
doe I this, any way to discourage the true vpright
hearted, but rather that all that call vpon the name
of the Lord, may learne to cast fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them the cloake
of hypocrisie, and the leauen of contention
and maliciousnes, and so not in showe, but in deed
departe from jniquitie, least they reape the fruites
thereof as these haue done.</p>
            <p>I haue already written to their leader M. <hi>Fr.
Iohnson,</hi> of his (with the rest of their elders) falshood,

all the churches of Christ that euer haue bin

and in their account must they be no true church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
but the former is true: therefore the latter.</p>
            <p>The proposition is vndeniable from his owne
description.</p>
            <p>The Assumption is as certaine, as will appeare,
in that they account the very using of the Lords
Prayer as a Prayer, to be a false way, which was v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
from the Apostles age,<note place="margin">Tertul: lib. de orat:</note> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith: <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missa

sufficiently: &amp; howsoeuer they seeme to put diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betweene those churches in the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
whome they haue admonished, and those that
they haue not; yet to put the matter out of doubt,
let him tell us if they account it not Apostacy for
one of them, so much as once to heare the word
preached in any congregation Dutch or French in
all the Lowe Countries besides<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Or if he can, let
him name any one church on the face of the earth
now, that holdeth not false wayes, yea euen in their
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1439:8"/>
constitution in their account: Neyther shall he shift
off the matter with his distinction of faultye and
false worshippe, for when hee hath put downe the
difference, whereby he distinguisheth the one from
the other, which yet he hath not done to my reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
then wil I shew him that there is no church
that he can mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> besides themselues, that holdes
not onely faulty, but false waies also in their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
and that in their constitution.</p>
            <p>Are not they then the blasphemers of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
and their churches? Or is not this to robbe
Christ of his honour? Or may not that saying. <hi>Pro.</hi>

            </p>

are as fauourable to others as to themselues, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
themselues be agreeable to their owne descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
after wounding others, they haue turned the

            <p>1. In that they retaine amongst them open of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendors:

M. <hi>A.</hi> and the rest of their elders, defend that hee

because it was not orderly made publique:<note place="margin">Mr. P. I. L. W. N. <hi>and others.</hi>
               </note> and
this before many witnesses: neyther did that <hi>Castle</hi>

            <p>Besides him was not <hi>R B.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Robert Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> (after other moste hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible

for creeping in at a windowe to come to bed to an

this man neuer publiquely dealt withall,<note place="margin">H. C.</note> vntill this

serue not their turne, what will they say to their El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<hi>Daniel Studley?</hi> (who together with his filthines
afore mentioned, in supporting vncleanes in a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
a member of their church) did also refuse to
pray with his owne wife a member likewise of the

thus doing, though he hath beene dealt withall for
it; yea and worse carryage then this, of which his
wife hath often and doth continually complaine,
which though he be not ashamed to commit, yet I
am ashamed to mencyon. I am sure M. <hi>Ih.</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
pretend ignorance heerein, for hee hath beene
tolde oft of his euill dealing though hee durst not,
or would not redresse it. Or if these yet bee not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
you shall haue more (if neede be) as <hi>Iudith
Holder, Canady, Iaacob Iohnson &amp;c.</hi> How are they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
seperate from all open offenders? or are they not
defiled by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating with such? Or shall I say
fitte members for such a fellowshippe? If they say
this is not in their constitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; I answere yes euen in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1439:9"/>
the constitution they holde false waies, which thus
I prooue.</p>
            <p>1. In their constitution they holde. First that the
Lords prayer is not to be vsed as a Praye, rcontra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to christs expresse co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundment, which is ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
against reason nor proportion of faith. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
contrary to the tenor of the words, hauing the
forme of a prayer in all things, as <hi>Our Father, giue
vs,</hi> and <hi>amen</hi> annexed in the end, which shewes
that they arepetitions not positions or rules which
are set downe in another forme. <hi>Math.</hi> 77. 21. 22.
1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 14. Thirdly, contrary to the vse of al chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
that wee reade of, as before out of <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
and others may be alleadged:</p>
            <p>2. They hold also that it is not lawfull for the
innocent partyes, to retaine the offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, as the wife
her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, or the husband his wife, if either party
haue committed adultery, no though the innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
party vpon the others repentance, forgiuing the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
sinne, be desirous still to liue with the other
party in the marriage couenant as before, but haue
exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated the parties innocent for so doing,
as namely <hi>H. C.</hi> &amp; one <hi>Homes his</hi> wife, vpon this, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
of them accused themselues of adulterye, that
so they might be ridde of their wiues, as namely
one <hi>W. Holder</hi> and <hi>Tho: Canady.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. They haue altered many thinges which they
held in their constitution, as among other, that <hi>it
was not lawful for Apostates to beare office,</hi> then must
they confesse that they did hold false waies in their
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1439:10"/>
constitution, and so by consequent, then were no,
true Churches.</p>
            <p>4 But what would it profit them to be free from
false waies in their constitution, if their practise bee
not according to their profession?</p>
            <p>This (to vse their owne wordes) makes their sin
the more greeuous.<note place="margin">Answ: to <hi>M H:</hi>
               </note> And sith their knowledge is
but in part aswell as their loue, are not they as well
as others subiect to erre in constitution as well as
practise? If M. <hi>Fr: Iohnson</hi> with his other helpers
should yet finde out a further shift, &amp; say that their
meaning in their description afore mentioned, is,
that <hi>A true church must be seperate fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all false waies,
which they see,</hi> for the preuenting of them therein,
I answere:</p>
            <p>1. If they had ment onely such false waies, it had
beene needefull in the description to haue imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so much.</p>
            <p>2. Though they haue beene already pressed with
exceptions against this discription, yet haue they
no where as yet taken vp this starting hole that I
can perceiue.</p>
            <p>3. Yet if now they should, they haue stopped it the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
Page. 107. 108. 127. of <hi>his last answere to
M. Iac.</hi> and in other places of their writings.</p>
            <p>4. Let them minde, whether enough hath not
beene shewed them for the clearing of these errors
in their constitution before cited.</p>
            <p>5. Whether they giue not their aduersaries ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage
if they should thus answere:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:1439:10"/>
Besides that there bee false waies, which though
they were held of ignorance, would disanul a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
so gathered, from being Gods Church not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding.</p>
            <p>Thus haue they paued their way with snares, to
entrappe themselues. Had not the simple neede to
take heede how they take vp wares vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Nicholas</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>And heere it shall not be amisse to put downe a

a visible Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Treatise so entituled.</note> 
               <hi>and their practise:</hi> that so the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
may the better perceiue the difference between
their profession &amp; practise, &amp; this onelye in some
few knowne particulars, by this description. First
for the Pastor:</p>
            <p>1. The Pastor must bee indued with much pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
but their Pastor with much impaciencye,
as hath appeared not alone in his dealing with <hi>M.
Ad:</hi> and his Brother G: <hi>I.</hi> and his threatning to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
his owne congregation when he was crossed
of his minde:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Of his booke enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled</hi> A dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com. &amp;c.</note> all which are discouered alreadye by
his brother: Page 126. 143. 144. and knowne to
be true by other witnesses, but also in other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
whereof some shall be after mencioned <hi>An
angry man stirreth vp strife and a furious man aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1439:11"/>
intransgression.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The Pasto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the true Church must be louing
&amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passionate, but their Pastor vnnatural &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful,
&amp; that to his own father, yea for the time
which his Father was with his Brother <hi>G. I.</hi> hee
would not so much as once see him, or relieue his
necessitie,<note place="margin">By M. S.</note> though he were not yet excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> This I heard iustified to his face before
many witnesses,<note place="margin">Pro. 17. 21. &amp; 20. 20.</note> and he could not deny it: <hi>so true it
is, that he that begetteth a foole, begetteth himselfe sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi>
as the wise man speaketh. For the teacher.</p>
            <p>1. The teacher of a true Church is sincere: their
teacher steined with Hypocrisie, as in his dealing
concerning <hi>G. I, M. Sl:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The teacher of a true Church must bee vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooueable:<note place="margin">1. Tim, 3.</note>
but their teacher is spotted againe
and againe with Apostasie in their account as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hath beene noted.</p>
            <p>3, The teacher of the true Church must take di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
care to keepe the Church from errors: their
teacher hath beene a meanes to bring in, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
false Doctrines, as the latter of those two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mencioned and others that may bee alleaged.
For the Elders:</p>
            <p>1. The Elders of a true Church must bee indued
with the spirit of God: their Elder <hi>Da: St:</hi> with the
spirit of vncleanes.</p>
            <p>2. The Elders of a true church must see the lawes
of God kept: their Elder would defend the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressing
of them in himselfe and others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:1439:11"/>
3. The Elders of a true church doe gouerne their
owne houses orderly: but the Elders mencioned
most disorderly as else where is cited.</p>
            <p>4. The Elders aforesaid must bee louing: their
Elder <hi>D: St:</hi> cruell and tyranicall, in so much that
some of their owne me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers haue complained,<note place="margin">Before M. <hi>Powell</hi> and others.</note> that
if they had a matter as cleare as the sunne against
him, yet durst they not deale with him for it.</p>
            <p>5. The elders of a true church, must be vnreproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueable:
but their Elder <hi>St: Mer:</hi> hath (as their teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er)
beene noted for Apostasie. For the Deacons:</p>
            <p>1. The Deacons of the true Church of Christ,
must haue a pure conscience &amp; must not bee giuen
to filthy lucre. But their Deacon <hi>Christoph: Bow:</hi>
for his deceiuing of many poore, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their owne
companye, of halfe that which the Magistrates of
<hi>Narden</hi> had giuen them weekelye, was thereupon
(when it came to light) through widdow <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates</hi>
meanes called <hi>Iudas</hi> the purse-bearer in <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
for so doing: Not to speake of many such like
instances that by him may be giuen. And for the
Elders ioyntly:</p>
            <p>1. The church of Christ doe priuately admonish a
priuate sin of a holy &amp; louing affection: but their
Elders could call, <hi>R: W:</hi> before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the first place,
for a priuate thing: &amp; threate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication
for that which after ward for shame they let fall.</p>
            <p>And for the peoples vncleanes, cousning, disgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
backe-biting, &amp; vndermining one of another
amongst themselues, it is a thing so common and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1439:12"/>
well knowne of them at home and abroad, that
I neede not in this place to speake further of it,
heauen and earth can beare me witnesse against
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in those things: oh that they would apply vnto
themselues and their practise that which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Ieremie</hi> speakes! <hi>Will they steale, murther and
commit adulterie &amp;c. And yet crie the temple of the
Lord, the temple of the Lord?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Are these then this beautifull? yea moste wonderful
church, rauishing the sences to conceiue of it? are these
the Saints then marching in such a heauenly and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
aray, where euery stone hath his beauty, his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
and his order, where no law is wrongfully wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,
or wilfully neglected, no truth hid or peruerted?</hi>
or rather haue they not deluded many poore
soules, with such sweete wordes, who when they

            <p>Certainely this their <hi>description of a visible Church</hi>
is as cleare a testimony, and as pregnant a sentence
of condemnation against themselues and their
practise as may be possible.</p>
            <p>But yet that their hypocrisie may further appeare,
let me giue the reader a taste also of their dealing
in condemning others, euen in those things that
they would and doe practise themselues, &amp; that in
these particulers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:1439:12"/>
1. They condemne others,<note place="margin">Page. 157.</note> for communicating
with open offenders and yet practise it themselues
as is before shewed.</p>
            <p>2. For making men to sweare to accuse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,<note place="margin">

yet <hi>M. Ih.</hi> practised the same to one <hi>I.L,</hi> and
it is moreouer a common practise among them,
both publikely and priuately, so to doe, yet would
their Elder <hi>Dan, Studly</hi> neuer so much as denye
the matter of incest with his wiues Daughter, for
the clearing of himselfe, though hee were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested
for the satisfying of weake Btetheren so to
doe.</p>
            <p>3. They condemne the Dutch churches,<note place="margin">Answ: to <hi>Iun.</hi> let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters page</note> for bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tising
the seede of those that are not members of
their church, and yet <hi>M. Iohnson</hi> with the rest could

and were offended at <hi>G: I:</hi>

and yet he neyther was, nor would ioyne himselfe
as a member vnto them.</p>
            <p>4. In like manner doe they deale with the Dutch
churches of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Consisting of so greate a multitude</note> for hauing but one church
in the Cittie. And yet <hi>M. Iohnson</hi> to vrge others

them would not so doe) could alleadge
that there was no warrant for two seuerall church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
to be in one city in the scriptures.</p>
            <p>5. In the place aboue quoted, they giue the like
sentence against the Dutch and French Churches,
for deciding matters by the elders, without the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the church, and not suffring in this respect
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1439:13"/>
the 18. of <hi>Mat</hi> rightly to be obserued amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst them:
and yet their Elders, viz: <hi>M. Fr: Ih. and his fellowes,</hi>
could decide one <hi>T. Canadyes</hi> matter, who had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
himselfe to be rid of his wife,<note place="margin">Of adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> and this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their knowledge or consent: But the said <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nady</hi>
not resting in the Elders determination,
brought it to their Church, alleadging that he had
iniury done to him,<note place="margin">W. Holder.</note> in that <hi>W, H</hi> could bee seperate
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his wife on his owne accusation of himselfe of
adultery, &amp; he could not. And further to iustify the
bringing of matters in the third place to their El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
(for so they practise before the matter bee
brought to the whole church) they could alleadge
the very same reasons against <hi>M. P.</hi> that they had
before condemned in the Dutch. And for the 18,
<hi>of Mat.</hi> how it is made a matter of partialitie and
enuie, yea a cloake to couer filthines withal at eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
pinch amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst them, would grieue ones heart
to consider.</p>
            <p>6. They condemne the Dutch &amp; French afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
for worshipping God in the Idoll Temples of
Antichrist, yet themselues suffer their poore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the almes of the Dutch, which is a Sacrifice,
<hi>Phil</hi> 4. 18. in the same place: and if they giue tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks
in receiuing their almes (as duety both to God &amp;
man bindes them to doe) Then doe they likewise
worship God in the Idoll Temples: neyther will
it helpe them to say that it is not publique wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,

            <p>7. They witnesse against the Dutch, for vsing
the censure of suspension: And yet themselues,
could suspend M. <hi>S</hi> many moneths together be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his excommunication, a man for learning &amp;
giftes worthy of his preferment among the dutch,
and to good too be of their fellowship.</p>
            <p>They condemne in others nonresidency,<note place="margin">Page. 65. Last answ: to <hi>H. I.</hi>

yet their Deacon <hi>D. Br.</hi> could neere three quarters

            <p>9. Lastly,<note place="margin">M. <hi>Ih.</hi> &amp;c.</note> they passe the like sentence on the
Dutch, for becomming one body, with excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates,
when as they excommunicate their

much as preached amongst the Dutch or French,
yet are they one body with an excommunicate
from the French church themselues. I might heere
also note their like dealing with the Dutch, for
their obseruation of certaine Holy daies: yet
doe these<note n="a" place="margin">M. <hi>Fr: Ih:</hi> and the rest.</note> me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> obserue these holy daies as much as
the Dutch, as well in shutting their shops, as also

Are these things euill in others and good in them?

art thou that condemnest another and doest the

my word in thy mouth &amp; hatest to be reformed?
Or Christ himselfe, hypocrite first cast the beame

thinke that knew not their euill dealing that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
they would snatch vp that to serue their owne
turne, which they condemne in others.</p>
            <p>And heere although I might declare their false
and impertinent allegation of Scripture, as if it
were no sinne to take the name of God in vaine &amp;
make the Scripture serue their fancy; but because
this hath beene done already in part by <hi>G, I.</hi> in his
booke page 85, which yet lyeth on them vnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
and vpon further occasion may be further
manifested: I will pastle by this, as also their false
accusations of whole Chuches, as will appeare
by comparing the 7.<note n="a" place="margin">Neh. 6. 8. Pro. 24. 28. Confess: with <hi>Iun:</hi> let: page. 54</note> accusatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with the practice
of the Duch Churches, and come to the 4. thing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1439:14"/>
that I proposed, namely, to shewe how they haue
drawne the cursse of God on themselues by rash,
vniust and wicked excomunication.</p>
            <p>1 And heere I may speak of 27 or there abouts
euen one halfe of them, at that time, and that of
the elder sorte: which all within a very short
space were cast out for refusing to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sent for, to the meeting of the other part, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they answered, that on the suddaine they
could not come at so short space and warning, for
diuers busines, but would come at any other time
which on both sides should bee thought conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
And although one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>H. A.</hi> was distract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in minde: but they spared none, &amp; this excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
was confirmed by the Pastor <hi>M. Ih.</hi>
Howbeit, afterward was this excommunication
repealed with fasting and prayer, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to be rash and vniust, and all receiued in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and they that withstood their receauing in,
were on the other side excommunicated.<note place="margin">W. A.</note> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
after this againe, because their Past<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
was vrged to acknowledge his sinne by one of
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>C. S.</hi> they were all turned out againe. Such dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying
with the Lords ordnances is fearefull.</p>
            <p>2. As also how they deliuered diuers to Sathan
for hearing the word preached in the Dutch
church, though some were encouraged by their
pastor and teacher so to doe, and promised to bee
borne out in it by themselues, as namely M. <hi>S.</hi> yet
after they brake, promise with him &amp; cast him out.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:1439:15"/>
3. Or what will they say to this? M. <hi>Iohnson</hi>
with diuers others of their leaders, put downe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
vnder their hands, that Apostates might:
not beare office from the Scriptures, and
so practised; yet after that M. <hi>Ainsworthes</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasie
was discouered, to keepe him in office,
they altered their judgement and practise, and
those that would not be brought to their will,<note place="margin">W. A.</note>
they cast out likewise; although they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
answere their owne reasons in writing, in like
sorte as they had set them downe: no nor suffer
their owne reasons to be read in their meeting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
requested thereunto. Is not this to play Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
part to bring men to distruction, and not vse as
good meanes to recouer them out againe? <hi>M. Ad.</hi>
for lesse Apostasie was not suffered to beare an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
office among them.</p>
            <p>Besides,<note place="margin">Willia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plen.</note> they haue cast out <hi>W. A.</hi> for recalling a

stand to that acknowledgement which was vnder
his hand, wherewith all they were satisfied. Of this
I with others haue written to them, but could get
no answere;<note place="margin">Before his departing from them.</note> yet that schisme was for not appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to the Dutch Churches: and if they doe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale,
then hath <hi>M. Ih.</hi> with the rest refused vtterly
to be tryed by them.</p>
            <p>5. Others they haue likewise accursed, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the parties innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t desired to liue with the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
offendors, as man and wife together, as before

answere nor due repentance thereof fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them;
the woman alleaged that <hi>Tymothies</hi> mother was a
faithfull woman, and one that brought vp herson
in the feare of God from his Child-hood, yet did
she not circumcise him: and no other cause menci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
but that his Father was a <hi>Grecian.</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.
6. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Act.</hi> 16, 3. whereunto shee could

<hi>Tymothies</hi> mother was dead, and so he might haue
said of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Prophets too.</p>
            <p>Their Pastor Maister <hi>F. I.</hi> made doubt of that
Scripture, and staid her excommunication, as say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he would not consent to it: yet after the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
had a little vnfoulded his euill dealing, the same
Maister <hi>F. Ih.</hi> at the same time, could change his
note and say, if that none else would, yet would he
be the man that should excommunicate her. And
indeede asterward they so did, and all that would
not yeild to her exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as namely Mistris
<hi>S.</hi> Widdowe Ch: and <hi>R. R.</hi> though the chiefe
<note n="b" place="margin">The head skout.</note> magistrate of the cittie forbid them so to doe. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
other reasons were alleadged about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which we shal haue time to relate, after that we
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1439:16"/>
haue seene their answere to this, if they will be at
leasure so to doe. Now may I not wish that they
had not verified the Orators saying? <hi>He that once
passeth the boundes of modesty, becommeth impudent
out of measure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus doe they abuse the holy ordinance of
God to satisfie their owne reuenging stomacks,<note place="margin">Pol. virg: li: 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>cap.</hi> 12</note>
               <hi>non it a precipitanter in quenquam torquendum.</hi> Is
this the long suffering spirit of meekenes in reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering
and seeking the lost?</p>
            <p>Or doe they not knowe that the curse is not in
vaine, if it cleaues not to them to whome it is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
it lights on the giuer? Are not then their Bulls
of excommunications so many curses on their
owne pates? shall I say to vse their owne allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
out of the Prophet,<note place="margin">Ps. 109. 17. 18.</note> 
               <hi>As he loued cursing so shall it
come vnto him, and as he loued not blessing, so shall it
be farre from him, and as hee cloathed himselfe with
cursing like a rayment, so shall it come into his bowells
like water, and like oyle into his bones?</hi> Surelye God
that will not holde him guiltles that taketh his
name in vaine,<note place="margin">Ex. 20. 7.</note> will neuer such profanation of his
name and ordinance to goe in vaine.</p>
            <p>And for some of them that are by these accursed
I know they haue learned Christ otherwise then
so, as to feare the cursse causeles. The Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to <hi>Abraham</hi> whose children they are, euen
manye which they haue cast out, that hee would
<hi>blesse them that blesse thee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 12. 3. 2. Sam. 16. 12.</note> 
               <hi>and curse them that cursse
thee. &amp;c.</hi> And let them say as <hi>Dauid</hi> of <hi>Shimei, It
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1439:16"/>
may bee the Lord will doe us good for their cursing
this day,</hi> yea, let them acknowledge Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
towards them in drawing them out of their

too much vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, before I perceiued their
fearefull estate. I could cite many other things yet
viler, as their Sauadge and cruell dealing to father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
Children: as namely Maister <hi>P.</hi> and Maister
<hi>B.</hi> his Children, and other such like.</p>
            <p>But I like not now to saile further in this Ocean,
but will content my selfe with the confession of
their owne members,<note place="margin">W. Clerk.</note> 
               <hi>W. C.</hi> I thought (said he) <hi>that

            <p>1. AN expresse commaundement neyther

<pb facs="tcp:1439:18"/>
the forme of Prayer: as, <hi>Our Father, giue vs,
leade vs,</hi> and <hi>amen, annexed in the end: ergo.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
how can they tell, which were Prayers and
which not, if not by their forme of Petition? wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they are distinguished from Doctrines, &amp; rules
proposed in an other forme, as Mat. 7. 7. &amp; 21. 22,
1. Ioh. 5. 14.</p>
            <p>4. In a duety to bee vsed of all, the holy Ghost is
plaine: but if those very words are not to bee vsed
as a Prayer, no christian for 1500. yeares &amp; more,
did vnderstand our Lords meaning.</p>
            <p>But they say that the Apostles neuer vsed those
very wordes in prayer. I answere:</p>
            <p>1. An expresse commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is warrant suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
without example.</p>
            <p>2. There is no example in the whole booke of
Gen: of the obseruation of the Sabaoth for 2369.
yeares space after the institution of it. Gen. 2. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to come nearer, is their any example of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tising,
<hi>in the name of the Father, Sonne and holy
Ghost</hi>) yet is the commaundement of Christ suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
warrant so to doe. Compare Math. 28. 19.
with Act. 10. 28. &amp; 19. 5.</p>
            <p>3. It is the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> reasoning against chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens
baptisme, asking for an example, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
there is sufficient warrant so to doe, yet are
their Pretences as good or better then <hi>M: Iohnsons</hi>
in refusing obedience to our Lords commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for want of an example.</p>
            <p>4. The Prayers mencioned in the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb facs="tcp:1439:18"/>
are such as were poured foorth vpon speciall
occasion as Act. 4. 24. Ioh. 17.</p>
            <p>5. Let them shewe mee an example where euer
the Apostles prayed before their Sermons; if they
can.</p>
