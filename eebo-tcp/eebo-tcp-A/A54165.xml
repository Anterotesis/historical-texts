            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Day of ſmall things bring Salvation?</hi> I ſay, Oh, <hi>Come and ſee</hi>; for we who have believed, have ſeen his Glory to be that of the <hi>only begotten of the Father, full of Grace, and full of Truth:</hi> He is the good <hi>Samaritan,</hi> the <hi>Phyſitian of Value</hi>; he cureth our Diſeaſes, he healeth our Breaches, he leads us in the Waies of Pleaſantneſs, and in the Paths of Peace; There are <hi>Riches</hi> in his <hi>Reproaches,</hi> and a <hi>Crown</hi> in his <hi>Croſs.</hi> Remember who deſired Eternal Life, and what hindred! Therefore give up all when he calls, and follow him fully. Out of him the Enemy is too ſtrong for you, but in him you are too ſtrong for the Enemy: Therefore wait in the Light of Chriſt, and watch againſt him: This is painful to <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> which muſt not inherit the Kingdom; but it brings the Soul into the Liberty of the Sons of God, where the Peace of God, and the Joy of his Salvation flow, as a pure River that is never dry. Oh! that you may have <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> that you may not miſs of your Deſire through the ſubtil working of the Enemy of your Souls, that ſeeks to divert you from the right way of God by many ſtumbling Blocks; but be not offended in him, that he may bleſs you: And remember, <hi>That all things are Poſſible with him with whom we have to do; for all Power in Heaven and Earth is given him that hath enlightned you:</hi> Therefore do not murmur, do not deſpond, do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume; but hearken to his Voice, in whom the Prince of this World hath no part, and he will give you Power to reſiſt him. And remember, <hi>That to them that Overcome, ſhall be given a new Name, and they ſhall have right to eat of the Tree of Life, that ſtands in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God.</hi> My God ſhed abroad his <hi>Love</hi> abundantly in your Hearts, to the love and obedience of the Truth, that you may be ſaved in the day of the Lord, in whoſe viſiting Love I bid you all <hi>Farewel.</hi>
