            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAving yeſterday ſolemnized his <hi>Majeſties Coronation,</hi> here within our <hi>City of Bath,</hi> I thought it an obligation upon me to give you a ſhort accompt thereof, which you may pleaſe to take as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi> Whileſt the morning was uſhered in, and welcomed by the <hi>Bels,</hi> the <hi>Drums</hi> beat, calling to ſuch as <hi>would demonſtrate their good affections to the King, to ſhew themſelves in Arms:</hi> For the Celebrating the day, whereupon all men that had arms fit for that imployment, appeared by this time; (that we might the better <hi>mixt our joys</hi> with <hi>pious contemplations of Prayers and Thanksgiving unto the King of Kings for returning unto us, and Crowning this our unparalleld earthly King)</hi> my <hi>ſelf</hi> and the <hi>Aldermen</hi> in <hi>Scarlet,</hi> attended on by the reſt of our <hi>Corporation</hi> in their Gowns, went to <hi>Church,</hi> the ſtreets being guarded by theſe forementioned perſons in Arms, on both ſides; leaving a paſſage for us to paſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween, and crying out, <hi>God ſave the King,</hi> with great Acclamations of Joy; after us followed, <hi>above foure hundred Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, most in white wastecoats and green petticoats, going two and two, each two bearning aloft in their hands, guilded Crowns and Garlands, made in the forme of Crowns, bedecked with all manner of rare and choiceſt flowers;</hi> Theſe Uſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Miſtreſſe <hi>Mayoreſſe</hi> to the Church, who was attended on by the <hi>Aldermens wives</hi> and <hi>Common Councel mens wives</hi> and diverſe other <hi>Gentlewomen of the City;</hi> Theſe being paſt, the <hi>Souldiers</hi> marched after, and having laid by their Arms, came into the Church, as generally the whole City did: ſo that our Church was never fuller, all perſons <hi>expreſſing as much piety towards God, as Loyalty towards their King.</hi> After Mr. <hi>Maſters</hi> our Miniſter had given us a moſt excellent and learned <hi>Sermon,</hi> Inſtructing us both in our duty <hi>towards God</hi> and <hi>towards the King,</hi> taking his <hi>text out of</hi> Mat. 22. <hi>and 21. verſe.</hi> The <hi>Sermon</hi> being ended, the <hi>Souldiery</hi> again made a guard for us, and we having now the <hi>loud muſick</hi> playing before us, and being followed by the ſaid 400. <hi>
