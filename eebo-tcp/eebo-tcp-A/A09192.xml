            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Rapery (so called of the French word <hi>Drap,</hi> which is cloth) princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pallie consisteth in the true making and folding your garment, giuing to euery folde his proper naturall doubling and shadow; which is a great skil &amp; scarce attained vnto by any of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and ordinary painters: insomuch that if I woulde make triall of a good workman; I would finde him quickly by the folding of a garment, or the shadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a gowne, sheet, or such like: but to auoide fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, you shall see our common painters set foorth their men &amp; women, with lace, fringe, pinckings, &amp;c. which makes as fayre a shew as the best. The Method now to bee obserued in Draperie, is to drawe first the outmost or extreame lines of your garment, as you will, full or narrow, and leaue wide and spare places, where you thinke you shall haue need of folds; drawe your greater foldes alwaies first, not letting any line touch, or directly crosse another, for then shall you bring an irrecouerable confusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into your work: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you haue so done, break your greater folds vnto lesse, which shall be conteined within them: I would giue you an example, but euery print will shew you the like; all your folds consist of two lines and no more, which you may turne with the garment at your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: beginne your maine and greatest folds, from the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:6418:21"/>
skirt vp ward, and the closer the garmentes sitte, the narrower you must make them: for the shadowing of euery seuerall folde, obserue the first rule I gaue you in the Chapter of shadowing, and spare not to shaddowe your foldes, (bee they neuer so cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously contriued) if they fall inwarde from the light, with the double or treble shadow; as you shall see occasion: for the shadow take his place in one and the same manner aswell in folding as without: some haue vsed to drawe the body naked first, and after to haue put on the apparrell, but I holde it as an idle conceipte, and to small pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>

                  <p>Your greater folds must be continued thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole garment, the lesser you may break and shorten at your pleasure.</p>
                  <p>The shadowes of all manner of silkes, and fine linnen are very thick, and fine, so that your foldes must not onely be little, but their shadow or deepning verie light, and rare, which commonly at the most is but a double shadow giuen with a new, and the finest penne.</p>
                  <p>You must not vse much folding where the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ought to sit close or any eminency appeare, as commonly there doth in the brests of a woman, the armes, belly, thighes, legges, &amp;c: but to shewe Arte,

you shall leaue the forme of the brest, leg, &amp;c to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare thorough, which you may doe by shadowing the brest or leg, (after you draw it) on one or either side, leauing it white.</p>
                  <p>As I tolde before of the light, fo must you in your draperie haue a care of the winde and motion of the ayre, for driuing your loose apparell all one waie, which I haue seene well obserued in many excellent peeces.</p>

               <p>I Begin in this Lion my firste stroke at A, bringing it down to B, making the nose, mouth, and nether chap with one line, as you se; there I rest: then fetch I that line forward behind by S: making the compas
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:6418:24"/>
ofhis mane by pricks with my penne (because if I shoulde make a line, I could not make it iagged) then bring I the back down to the taile or D, leauing a little space for it, I continue my line from thence to E, or the heele, where I rest: then begin I again at B, and making the breast with the eminency thereof I stay at F, bringing out his neere fore foote, which I finish: then begin I at G not stirring my hand till I come to the foot or paw at H; wher I finish it quite at E, or the heele. I next draw from his bellie two strokes at I and K: I make the other legge behind, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the right fore foot issuing from the brest: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I finish the tail, clawes, toung, teeth, beard, and last of al the shadowing: which method you shall obserue in all beasts howsoeuer they stand.</p>

a painter had need to be well seene in Naturall Philosophie. The meanest workeman can drawe the ordinary shape of a Lion, when scarce the best of them all know, that his hinder partes are so smal, that there is in a manner a disproportion betweene his forepart and them: so that if I should drawe him in this manner among our ordinarie painters, my work would be condemned as lame, when I deserued most commendation.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer if you aske a Country painter whether he could draw a Crocodile or no, hee will make noe question of it, when as except he trauailed through Aegypt, or met with <hi>Aristotle</hi> in <hi>English,</hi> all the wit he had could not so much as set the chaps right, or giue the future truely in the head to, shew the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his vpper-chap, which no creature in the world mooueth, saue onely he.</p>

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:6418:26"/>
too big: <hi>Van Londerseel's</hi> peeces are much to blame for this fault, for in most of them the heads of all his birds are to great by a third part, neither is that fault proper to him alone, but to many good workemen els. You shall best remedy that by causing a bird to be held or tied in a clouen stick before you, where you shall take with your compasses a true proportion, which afterwards you may conclude into as small a forme as you list: there is not the same reason of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion (it is true) in the heads and bodies of all birds alike, but hereby you shall euer after bee acquainted with a reasonable proportion, which though you hit not iustly, you shall come very neere: hauing drawne the head, bring from vnder the throat, the brest line, downe to the legs; there stay: and begin at the pineon to make the wing, which being ioined with the back line is presently finished: the eie, legs, and traine must be the last, and (as I told you before in beasts) let the farther leg euer be shortest. the feathers as the hayre in beasts, must take their beginning <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

For flowers, flies and such like, I wil leaue them (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things of smal moment) to your own discretion, counselling you at your leasure when you walke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad into the fields, to gather and-keep them in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle boxes vntill you shall haue occasion to vse them. To draw a flower begin it <hi>ab vmbone,</hi> or the bosse in the midst: as in a Rose, there is a yealowe tuft, which being first made, draw your lines equally diuided, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence to the line of your compas, which you are first to giue, and then the worst is past.</p>
                  <p>You may shew your flower, either open and faire in the bud, laden with deawe and wette, wormeaten, the leaues dropt away with ouerripenes &amp;c: and as your flower, so first draw rudely your leaues, making them plaine with your coale or lead, before you giue them their vaines or Iaggednesse.</p>
                  <p>For Butterflies, Brees, wasps, grashoppers, &amp; such like, which wee call <hi>Insecta,</hi> most of them are easie to be drawne, and not hard to be laid in colours: because the colours of many of them are simple, and without composition, as perfect red, black, blew, yellow, &amp;c: which euerye ordinary painter may laie, who if they should bee put (by mixture of many colours) to make that purple of a pigeons neck, or giue the perfect co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour but of a Daw or Iay, you should see them at their wits end.</p>
                  <p>In the moneths of Iune and Iuly, you may gather of all manner of flies, which you may preserue all the yeere, eyther in close boxes, or sticking them with a pinne seuerally vpon small papers: Butterflies are where store of Thistles and Lauender is, your Brees by ponds and Riuers sides</p>

               <p>The best workmanship that may be seene in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land at this daie in glasse, is in K.

on the fire, well couered round about, with coales for the space of an houre: then take it out of the fire, and cast it into the bottom of a candle stick, after that beat it small into powder, and so grind it.</p>
                  <p>Note when as you take your siluer as much as you meane to burne, remember to waie againste it six times as much yealow oaker as it waieth, and seauen times as much of the old earth, that hath been scra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of the annealed worke, as your siluer waieth: which after it is well ground, put altogether into a pot and stir it well, and so vse it, this is the best yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
