            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A MEMENTO TO THE LONDONERS, To put them in minde how neere their deſtruction is, and what meanes is left to prevent it.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T much concernes you (my Brethren) to ſit ſtill one quarter of an houre, and conſider the periſhing condition you are in, for then I perſwade my ſelfe, you will ſee your ſelves ſo ſurrounded with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching miſeries, that you will thinke it more then time that you were all in armes, and no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er indure to remaine in ſo naked and deſpicable condition as you now are in. Will you not bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened till you heare your Enemies are at your Out-workes? cannot the noyſe of dangers on all ſides, and in the midſt of you, rouze you out of that deſtructive Lethargy that hath poſſeſt you; but you will continue dreaming about your Trades, till the outragious hand of your implacable enemies ſeiſe upon you, your Wives and Children? I wrote to you before to this purpoſe, but it made no impreſſion in you, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had thought never to have wrote unto you againe, but that I have ſome hopes left, that now you are ready to periſh, you will looke about you, and heare good Counſell: and aſſure your ſelves that if this Letter be not an alarme to rouze you, it will prove a paſſing Bell, rung before your deſtruction. Never were a People in ſuch neceſſities as you are in. The Kings Forces are growne ſtrong and powerfull, and will in ſhort time, if you prevent it not, be as able to execute their malice upon you as they are willing; from whom you of all the People in the Kingdome, can expect no more favour than from the Turke or Spaniard, were he come amongſt you. The Earle of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> you heare, is unprovided in many reſpects, and what opportunities that will adminiſter to your Enemies, let your feares ſuggeſt. <hi>Hopton</hi> and <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> the Queene and Marqueſſe <hi>Hartford,</hi> are all potent and reſolved to deſtroy you. The hopes they have ſwallowed, and brags they have made of pillaging and ranſacking this City, may ſufficiently informe you what mercy you are like to find when they come amongſt you. The Malignants in <hi>Kent</hi> are in Armes already. A Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation is gone out already, forbidding all Trade and trafficke with the <hi>Londoners.</hi> Have you dangers enough thinke you, or will you ſtay till you are more miſerable? Perhaps you expect to be ſaved by a Miracle. Alas! incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate men! 'Tis true indeed there is nothing too hard for the Omnipotent and Almighty God. But is it to bee expected that his omnipotency ſhould preſerve us, when he hath given us underſtanding, ſtrength and opportunity to preſerve our ſelves, and we out of baſe feare or other poore reſpects dare not ſet about it? Why, what would you have us to doe, you will ſay? Aske your owne hearts what you have to doe; is there any thing elſe to be done, but for every man that is able of body to liſt himſelfe immediately for the warres, and every man contribute to the utmoſt for the maintenance thereof; A Committee of Parliament are appointed you know for the ſervice, and where they fit, ſuch as have beene truſted by thouſands, and approved by thoſe from among whom they were choſen, who will no doubt take care for the choyce of ſuch men onely into Office as are of knowne faithfulneſſe and integrity, not a ſuſpected or unknowne man to be admitted: Your monies ſhall be employed to the proper end you intend them; make uſe of this opportunity to preſerve your ſelves, or expect ſuddenly to be deſtroyed. You doe but ruine your ſelves, your beſt Friends, and chiefe Commanders, by venturing in ſmall bodies to ſubdue your Enemies: what can you hope thereby, but onely a prolongation of the Warre, and deferring your deſtruction for a ſeaſon, when in the meane time you waſte and conſume your ſelves away to nothing? No, you muſt all riſe, or nothing can be done to any purpoſe. The poore will ſhortly want bread, and what their wants will neceſſitate them to, let the rich conſider. You have talked a great while that nothing can preſerve you but a generall riſing, and in private diſcourſes every man concludes that it is the onely thing neceſſary; now ſhew that you are not meere Talkers, the Countries will come in to you, who long to be up and doing, they awaite but your leading them the way, let no ceremonies nor excuſes hinder you, let not your wife and children with-hold you, this is the onely way to preſerve them: I know you may be furniſhed with excuſes, and that they who are unwilling may have much to ſay for themſelves; But thinke all of you what lies at the ſtake, your Religion, Lawes, Liberties, your Lives, Wives, Children, Eſtates, all is loſt if you doe not now beſtirre your ſelves. Be couragious, and God will bleſſe you; Lie ſtill, and periſh.</p>
