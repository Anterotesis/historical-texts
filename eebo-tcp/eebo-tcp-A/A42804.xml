            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A LETTER FROM SAINT OMARS TO A Friend in LONDON.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Should be unworthy of that care and friendſhip which you have expreſſed towards me, if I ſhould not gratefully acknowledge the ſatisfaction I have taken, not onely in your ſeveral Letters from time to time, giving me an account of the Diſcovery of that moſt helliſh and horrid Plot, ſo lately made known in <hi>England,</hi> for the alteration of Religion and ſubverſion of Government, by Maſſacre, War and Fire; but alſo the great pleaſure I have received in the preſent which you ſent me of all the printed and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten papers, publickly made known, and privately diſperſed concerning this Plot. I muſt therefore, after I have acknowledged the favour therein, let you know the ſatisfaction I have taken, how much it has wrought upon my Conſcience, what impreſſions they have made on others, the Objections ſome have made, and the Anſwers I have been enabled to give them, grounded on thoſe publick Trials and Tranſactions which you have ſent me. And as you have truly convinc'd me of the great Errour I was run into; ſo no doubt, by your Argument and Aſſiſtance, I have been able to do the like on this ſide the Water, to many, who erred not wilfully, but were led aſide by the cunning Diſcourſes of the Adverſe Party, and to ſtop the mouths of ſome of the moſt malicious and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Enemies of the Proteſtants in <hi>England,</hi> who here have endeavoured to make us believe there has been no ſuch Plot contrived by the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> or elſe that the Plot is onely of the making and contriving of thoſe you call Sectaries and Fanaticks in <hi>England;</hi> and that all this is wrought through their Cunning and Contrivance, to ſcandalize and extirpate the Catholicks and their Religion in <hi>England:</hi> and other ſtories to the diſcrediting the King's Evidence, as if they had falſely accuſed, and took away the lives of many holy men and Catholicks, innocent and unknowing of any ſuch Plot or Maſſacre, thereby begetting a general Odium and Evil-ſpeaking againſt the Sectaries and Hereticks, as they call them, in <hi>England.</hi> By theſe cunning Artifices and ſedulous Inſinuations, they have been very carefull in theſe parts, to take away the ſcandal and reproach ſo horrid a deſign might lay upon the Catholick Party, and to invalidate, as much as they are able, all reports and proofs thereof; and therefore have endeavoured to ſtop and ſuppreſs all the light thereof, and all Books or Papers that may any way inform the Judgements of the people, who are made to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve quite contrary to what you have made me to ſee. And I queſtion not but that alſo, in ſome meaſure, the ſame skill and artifice of the Jeſuitical Party is uſed amongſt you as well as here, and that by their cunning Inſinuations and Contrivances, they have been able (as you ſeem to intimate) to pervert the minds of many in <hi>England,</hi> and to fix on them a ſtrange blindneſs and disbelief of the Plot, not onely of thoſe of their Religion, and well-affected to their way, but alſo of many of the more moderate and ſimply honeſt of the contrary Party, who have been led aſide by their ſpecious pretences, and ſedulous inſinuations, and diligent aſperſions of the Witneſſes, and ſtartled and confirmed by the pertinacious denying and ſeeming Innocency of thoſe that ſuffer'd for the ſame.</p>
            <p>If then in <hi>England,</hi> where theſe things are tranſacted, they are able to alienate the minds of many, and to keep them in the miſt of ignorance and unbelief, you may be ſure that at this diſtance, and where the power of your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries has more force and ſtrength, and where they have far greater means to ſtifle the breaking forth of the leaſt Ray of the light of Truth, that the people are much more ignorant, and by that means more prejudiced againſt you; though there are none almoſt, to whom I have made known and communicated thoſe Papers and Letters you ſent me, but are either convinc'd, or know not how to raiſe any juſt Argument againſt the Truth of what they aſſert.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:101854:3"/>
It has always been the way of theſe ſedulous Emiſſaries of the Society, to palliate great miſcarriages with ſpecious pretences, and to daub over the moſt notable deformities with an holy paint and religious <hi>fucus,</hi> and to colour their detected Crimes by pious frauds, lies, and perjuries. And it is not now they begin to practice thoſe things you ſeem to hint at in your Letters, as may by ſeveral inſtances and known eveniments be made appear: and which indeed has been a ſcandal to many good Catholicks, and knowing Chriſtians, who have not at all approved of the ways of theſe Jeſuitical Brethren, who have converted Religion to principles of State, and changed Chriſtianity to meer Policy; and by endeavouring to maintain their own greatneſs, and by unjuſt and politick ways ſtriving to attain their ends of Power and Dominion, have loſt much the opinion, not onely of thoſe of the contrary Religion or Reformed, but alſo of many of thoſe who are Roman Catholicks, who have been diſtaſted at their principles and practices. For as there were Roman Catholicks before there were Jeſuits, ſo were that Order not in being, I am apt to believe that their number would not be leſs: for though by their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices and Policies they have made themſelves great, and kept up the power of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and by their inſinuations into all the Courts of the Princes of Chriſtendom made themſelves formidable, and knowing of all affairs; yet on the other hand, by the many miſcarriages and detections of many of their Plots and Contrivances, and their wicked and evil Machinations, they have opened the mouths of the Proteſtants againſt the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks too juſtly, and alſo opened the Eyes to ſee, and alienated the Hearts of many of the Roman Catholicks themſelves from their deteſted ways and abominable courſes, which they have manifeſtly taken to eſtabliſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or as they ſay to <hi>propagate Religion,</hi> and to <hi>extirpate Hereſie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But certainly, Truth does not need the hand of Policy, and eſpecially evil and immoral Maxims, and unver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Contrivances, to defend it: and as it is far from the Doctrine and Method of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles, and their immediate Succeſſours, to propagate his Religion or Chriſtianity by Plots, Maſſacres, Force, or Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, or by any unjuſt way or means; ſo always the attempt thereof has ever prov'd pernicious, and: has raiſed up evil thoughts of Religion in many, making ſome Atheiſts, and others Hereticks and Schiſmaticks; and by that means they have loſt more from the Catholick Cauſe, then ever they have gained thereto by theſe pernicious courſes. For where the dint of Argument cannot prevail, and where the Conſcience cannot be allured, the dint of Sword, Oppreſſion and Perſecution, will never be able to overcome; nor Plots and Contrivances, though never ſo well laid, will prevail, as we have often experimentally found. And though by theſe means any Religion may ſeem for a time to be eſtabliſh'd, yet at laſt it will quickly burſt out into a flame; for it is impoſſible, with the greateſt Tyranny to eſtabliſh the greateſt Truth, unleſs it be received into the Minds and Conſciences of the people.</p>
            <p>I muſt therefore once again acknowledge the great ſatisfaction I have received by thoſe Books, Papers and Letters which you have ſent me, and which have rectified my doubtfull thoughts, and made me very ſenſible, that there has not onely been a very great Conſpiracy, and moſt horrid Plot, but alſo they have made me ſee who were the contrivers and carriers on of the ſame: and now I likewiſe reſt ſatisfied in the puniſhment of ſome of the Offendours, being aſſured that they died not for the Cauſe of Religion, (as they would here make us believe) but as Criminals and Traytors to their King, Country, and Laws.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs, there has nothing more troubled my Conſcience, and made me queſtion the verity of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Faith, in which I was bred, then the laying open of theſe horrid Deſigns, and the conſtant practices of theſe Brothers of <hi>Jeſus</hi> in all parts: and it has ſo far awakened me, that I now make it my reſolution, to ſatisfie all thoſe ſcruples that have ariſen thereupon, and to inform my ſelf farther, and to try if thoſe Arguments that the Proteſtants have uſed to juſtify their Separation, be according to thoſe Rules laid down in the Scriptures or not, and to make a more diligent ſcrutiny into all thoſe differences between us, that I may be no longer in the dark, and grope after uncertainties. And therefore I ſhall deſire ſtill your aſſiſtance and correſpondence, in fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing me with thoſe Books and Writings that may be fit for this intention: for as I am an <hi>Engliſh-</hi>man I have a natural love to my Country, and notwithſtanding any difference in point of Religion, and diſtance at preſent from the ſame, I conſtantly wiſh, as I ought, its proſperity and felicity, as I believe all true <hi>Engliſh</hi> Catholicks not Jeſuited, or perverted by their horrid and deſtructive principles, doe the ſame; and truely hate all theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due and unrighteous ways of propagating Religion, and the Romiſh Faith. And I cannot but take notice of that cruel and deteſtable malice of the Brothers of the Society, who would have cut off <hi>Berry</hi> a Prieſt, for writing in favour of the Oaths of Allegeance and Supremacy, which I think any true Catholick may take, without any wrong to his Conſcience; and for that end (as I find in your Depoſitions) they offer'd 10 <hi>li.</hi> as a reward to the ſaid Deponent to kill the ſaid <hi>Berry.</hi> I cannot therefore blame my Countrymen, if after all theſe doings, which have appeared ſo horridly unjuſt, cruel and bloudy in all reſpects, they are grown ſevere and bitter againſt all Romiſh Catholicks; and many thouſands, though innocent, muſt ſuffer in your thoughts and opinions, for the ſake of theſe wicked wretches. And the Plot hath now appeared ſo general and univerſal through the Nation, and not onely there, but in <hi>France, Flanders, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> that I cannot but wonder at the extent thereof, and admire at the great and abundant mercy of God, that has almoſt miraculouſly brought it to light, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented it, when even ready to be effected, and even in the height of their ſecurity. And this certainly ſhews, that God does not own ſuch wicked and undue ways and practices, as to bring in any Religion whatſoever by Bloud, Plots, Murthers, and Deſigns.</p>
            <p>And I muſt here take notice and acknowledge, that long before the diſcovery of this Plot, I have obſerved in diſcourſe with many on this ſide the Water, that there was a more then uſual expectation of ſomething to be done in <hi>England;</hi> and ſometimes they would darkly intimate, that e're long we ſhould ſee the true Catholick Religion flouriſh again in that Kingdom as much or more then ever: ſo that no doubt, many more here knew of this ſecret, and had great expectations, beſides thoſe who were intruſted in carrying on the Deſign.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:101854:3"/>
As to what you ſeem to deſire, how this Plot is reſented here, among us, and what people ſay thereof, I muſt anſwer, that the ſtream ſeems to run two ways, and is divided according to the humour of the people. For the more moderate and juſt do extreamly blame the Authours and Promoters of it, and look upon them as the Ruiners of the Catholick Religion in <hi>England,</hi> who had ſuch indulgence, ſuch favour and kindneſs ſhewed them, both from Prince, and People, that notwithſtanding the ſevere penal Laws againſt them in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, they enjoyed fully their own, liv'd quietly without moleſtation, reproach, and diſtinction, were admitted into all Offices and places in the Commonwealth and Army, enjoying all the liberty they could expect, or juſtly deſire: and therefore theſe extreamly blame the Jeſuitical Party, and all thoſe who were Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratours, and promoters of this Plot and horrid Deſign, as wicked and ungrateful perſons, that ſhould abuſe ſo much mercy and indulgence ſhewn to them, and that they could not ſee their own quiet and happineſs in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying their Liberty and Eſtates without interruption, in a Kingdom wholly Proteſtant, and where they are but a handful in compariſon of the others, ſo that they could not hope to prevail, without horrid Maſſacres, much Bloud, War and Devaſtation. So that theſe men ſeem to be odious, and deteſted by all that have or make any profeſſion of Godlineſs, Religion and Piety, who do verily believe, that they have thereby utterly ſubverted and ruined the Catholick Cauſe in <hi>England,</hi> believing that you will now urge all thoſe penal Statutes in force againſt them, and make others more ſevere, where they are deſicient, or baniſh them wholly out of the Land. And that this will juſtly open the mouths, and awaken the Pens of all the Proteſtants againſt them, and rip up all their former Cruelties, to ſet the teeth of the people on edge againſt them, and to render them odious, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their former bloudy doings, which had elſe been forgotten, and were raked up under the aſhes of Time. As I perceive by one Book you ſent, called <hi>The Antichriſtian Principle Diſcovered,</hi> in a brief and true account of all the helliſh Plots, bloudy Perſecutions, and horrid Maſſacres, and moſt inhumane Cruelties and Tortures, exerciſed by the Papiſts throughout <hi>Europe, &amp;c.</hi> Which ſhews how much the Spirits of people are awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened againſt them by thoſe new Machinations, and that all their former Errours, Faults and Cruelties will be anew laid open, and brought out of the Grave of Oblivion, to teſtifie againſt them.</p>
            <p>But it is not onely in <hi>England,</hi> that they have by theſe unjuſt and wicked devices done themſelves and their Party an injury, but they have awakened the jealous eyes of all the Proteſtant party throughout <hi>Europe,</hi> who ſeem to be ſtartled and troubled at this wicked and horrid Deſign. And as I have heard it lately reported, it hath been ſo very ill reſented by all the Proteſtant Princes in <hi>Germany,</hi> that it has put them upon ſtricter caution or preſerving themſelves and Religion againſt theſe ſort of men, and the Papiſts in general, when they ſee <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the prop and glory of <hi>Proteſtantiſm,</hi> ſo deſperately ſtruck at, and like to be ſubverted by theſe horrid Plots, and wicked Machinations and Conſpiracies.</p>
            <p>But there is another <hi>Party,</hi> who either out of cunning, malice or ignorance, will not believe, or at leaſt ſeem not to believe this to be any ſuch Plot as you in <hi>England</hi> would make it to be. And theſe ſort of men are very ſedulous in raiſing divers Objections, and endeavour to leſſen the Evidences, and aſperſe the <hi>Judges,</hi> calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate both Magiſtrates and People, and by all manner of unjuſt ways and contrivances ſeek to inſtill into the Minds of people that there is no ſuch grand Conſpiracy, and that it is onely a ſubtle and politick way of ſome <hi>great ones in England,</hi> to make new Combuſtions and Inſurrections there, by which means either to ſet up the <hi>Presbyterian Party,</hi> or to bring in again a <hi>Second Commonwealth;</hi> and that all thoſe who have died for thoſe Crimes objected againſt them, as <hi>Coleman, Ireland, Pickering, Groves, Green, Berry, Hill, &amp;c.</hi> all died Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, Saints and Martyrs, without ſufficient proof, and undeſervedly. And this theſe ſort of men have been ſo very carefull to promote, and with that Confidence and Artifice, that truly, they have begot to themſelves a very great Party, not onely on this ſide the Water, but (as I underſtand from ſome coming from thence) in <hi>England</hi> alſo. And indeed, before I received your laſt preſent of all the Tryals, which you ſent me, I could not tell what to thing of it: but ſince I have read them, and ſeriouſly weigh'd all things in an equal Scale and with a juſt Balance, I am thoroughly convinc'd of the reality of the <hi>Plot,</hi> and the juſtneſs of thoſe mens Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings who have died for the ſame.</p>
            <p>And ſince you have given me the liberty and freedom to communicate to you my thoughts fully concerning this Plot, I think it will not be impertinent curſorily to take notice of the ſeveral Objections they have raiſed againſt it, to annihilate or invalidate the ſame, or at leaſt to call off the Odium and blackneſs of ſuch a wicked Conſpiracy from themſelves on others; and alſo, the Anſwers I have been able to give them in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereto. And ſince it may be of a publick good and concern, and to the ſatisfaction of many fluctuating people, if you ſhall think it requiſite, I give you free liberty to publiſh the ſame.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place then, that they may beget a very ill opinion of the Perſons that are the Diſcoverers of this Plot, and Accuſers of thoſe concerned therein, they have endeavoured to render, them <hi>ill Perſons in their Lives and Converſations;</hi> and ſo by this means to make all they ſhall ſay or ſwear not to be believed or adhered to. They remember the Maxime, <hi>Aſperſe boldly, ſomething will ſtick.</hi> This is onely to throw dirt in the faces of thoſe perſons that God has raiſed up to detect the moſt horrid of Villanies. And thus Mr. <hi>Ireland,</hi> in his Tryal, very ſubtly brings in Sir <hi>Dennis Aſhburnham</hi> to leſſen the Teſtimony of Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> by making him a perſon of little credit and of ill fame, and that he broke Priſon at <hi>Dover;</hi> but that onely by hear-ſay.</p>
            <p>Indeed could they have given any good proof of Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> his being formerly perjur'd they might have done ſomething as to taking off his Teſtimony, and weakned his Evidence in the opinion of the Jury: but what they endeavoured to prove was ſo very weak and frivolous, that it made rather againſt them, and onely ſhewed their Malice, for all that Sir <hi>Dennis</hi> ſays, amounts onely to this, <hi>that he had known Mr.</hi> Oates <hi>in his youth, and that then he was not a perſon of that Credit as to be depended on for what he ſhould ſay, and that had the Diſcovery of the Plot come onely from his Teſtimony, he might have made ſome doubt of it.</hi> But then, the very ſame perſon
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101854:4"/>
confeſſes, <hi>that it being ſo corroborated with other Circumſtances, he was convinced and ſatisfied in the truth of the thing.</hi> See now, from what little ſhadow of ill, they rais'd a dark miſt to blind the eyes of the people, and by it would endeavour to make them believe all that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſhould ſay was falſe, and that the Plot was of his own making and contriving, ſet on by the Enemies of their Religion.</p>
            <p>But let it be granted that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> had been formerly an <hi>ill Liver,</hi> or what they ſay of him as to his Life and Converſation in his youth: we know that God makes uſe of Sinners to glorifie his Name, and a conſpiring and perſecuting <hi>Saul</hi> may become a great and glorious Apoſtle. Had not Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> had ill Principles, he never could have been drawn into ſo horrid a deſign, (but the Hand of God was in it, who out of Evil produces Good:) for the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> are ſo cloſe and ſubtle, and carry on their Deſigns with that Secrecy and Contrivance, that it would be impoſſible to detect them, and to have a plain and evident proof againſt their Treaſonable practices, but by one of themſelves, and of their Conſpiracy. And therefore it cannot be thought any hard uſage, (as the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs</hi> obſerves,) to convict Offenders by Teſtimony of their Fellows, <hi>becauſe 'tis hardly poſſible to bring other Witneſſes: and therefore in that reſpect Witneſſes cannot be abſolutely ſpotleſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſidering the depth of this horrid Plot, and the great perſons that were collaterally in the ſame, carrying on great and various deſigns, Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> the firſt Diſcoverer, ran a very great riſque of his Credit and Life, ſo that it behoved him to be cautious and wary, and not to diſcover a thing of this nature without great proof: and for that by the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> one ſingle Teſtimony, though back'd with other Circumſtances, will not ſerve to condemn a perſon in caſe of High Treaſon, Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> could not of himſelf have been able to have brought the Offenders to condign puniſhment, had not God (whoſe hand was in the Diſcovery) raiſed up others alſo after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to give Evidence, and to clear up and dilucidate the whole matter. And this very thing it ſeems, made thoſe concerned in the Plot ſo very bold and confident, as not to Fly upon his firſt Diſcovery of the ſame: and he had like to have been born down with a ſtrong tyde of Oppoſition, till the Murther of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfry,</hi> whoſe forwardneſs and activity in doing his Duty, and detecting this horrid deſign, expoſed him to their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and fury; and they, who had gone ſo far, as to endeavour to murther their King, and ſubvert the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Country, would not ſtick at the little murther of one that was ſo active a miniſter in bringing the buſineſs to light, and unravelling the bottom of their wicked deſigns.</p>
            <p>But the murther of this perſon ſtrangely awakened the minds of people, who were before in a great Security, and looked but lightly on the Plot, (as I am inform'd by Relations from <hi>England)</hi> and the cry of his bloud call'd down God's Vengeance on the Plotters, and no doubt, they gave themſelves a mortal blow when they ſtrangled this Innocent perſon. And ſince it was requiſite, that there ſhould be more Evidence then one, God made uſe of this Murther, ſo far as to awaken thereby the Conſcience of Mr. <hi>Bedlow,</hi> who was to have been engaged in the Murther of this Gentleman, and who knew of it, and was one in the great Conſpiracy and Plot, and who alſo, though fled for the ſame, was at laſt compelled by the force of his troubled Conſcience to come in vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, to ſecond Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and to detect both the Murther and the Plot.</p>
            <p>I cannot hear, that they have any thing to object againſt Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> in particular to take off his Evidence, but that they aſperſe him in general terms, as if he were hired to the ſame: but if any one of an unbiaſs'd Judgment ſhall ſeriouſly reade and weigh all the ſeveral proofs made out againſt the Criminals, by Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi> agreeing in all Circumſtances, though no intimacy was ever known to be between them, he muſt needs acknowledge, that nothing is more clear and evident, then that there could not be any ſuch Conſpiracy between them, to invent and frame ſo many ſtrange ſtories and relations as they have given in under their Oaths, with all Circumſtances as to Places, Time and Perſons, without betraying themſelves, or being intrapped by thoſe quick ey'd perſons by whom they have been examined, and of which we ſhould quickly have heard. So that I cannot but admire at the ſtrange impudence of thoſe perſons, who ſtill buz into the ears of the people, that 'tis no Plot but of <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Bedlow</hi>'s making, giving the lie in the face of a whole Nation to the <hi>Juſtices,</hi> that have taken the Examinations, to the <hi>Judges,</hi> that have ſate on the Tryals, to the <hi>Council,</hi> that have ſifted and looked into the Papers and Writings belonging to theſe Plotters, Traitours and Murtherers, and to the Lords and Nobility of <hi>England,</hi> and to the Parliament, the Repreſentative of all the People of <hi>England,</hi> who in their Vote <hi>die Lunae 24. Martii</hi> 1678. declared <hi>nemine Contradicente, That they were fully ſatisfied by the proofs they had heard, That there now is, and for divers years laſt paſt hath been, a horrid and Treaſonable Plot and Conſpiracy contrived and carried on by thoſe of the Popiſh Religion, for the Murthering of his Majeſtie's ſacred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and for Subverting the Proteſtant Religion, and the Ancient and well-eſtabliſhed Government of this Kingdom.</hi> I ſay, that after all this clear Evidence againſt them, and that nothing can be made out more plain and perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that they ſhould ſtill endeavour to preſs upon the belief of people, that 'tis a fictitious Plot, is the moſt ſtrange piece of Impudence I ever heard or read of.</p>
            <p>Can any that entertain ſuch a thought believe that the whole Nation are deceived? and that all theſe, the wiſeſt of the Kingdom, are deluded, or can be made Fools and Aſſes of by Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedlow?</hi> or in reaſon think or ſuppoſe, that all theſe perſons are ſo wicked to frame a Plot againſt the Papiſts, and to take away the ſeveral Lives of theſe wretches, onely to extirpate a few Papiſts out of the Kingdom? One of theſe muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently follow if there be not in reality any ſuch Plot, as theſe ſort of men would have people believe. But God ſeeming to reſolve to diſcover fully the bottom of this deſign, and to make it apparent to all the world, he has given a cloud of Witneſſes, and wholly to take away that ſcruple, hath raiſed up <hi>Prance</hi> and <hi>Dugdale,</hi> two more, to ſecond and confirm the truth of <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Bedlow</hi>'s aſſertions.</p>
            <p>As to Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> I have heard that they have been ſo far from aſperſing him, that they have (ſome of them) been forc'd publickly to acknowledge him <hi>a ſober, honeſt man:</hi> yet he was drawn into the Plot for <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion's ſake,</hi> till he came to know of the intended Murther of the King, and then the alarm-Bell of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101854:4"/>
rung ſo loud that it awaken'd him out of his Lethargy, and brought him to a confeſſion of his Crimes, and to be an Evidence againſt them.</p>
            <p>As to Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> God ſuffer'd him to goe on and to be zealous (as I obſerve by his own Book) in this Plot, and to be one of the Inſtruments aſſiſting in the murther of that worthy Knight Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfry,</hi> and to continue without remorſe, till he was taken onely upon a bare ſurmiſe of his being from home ſome nights, which cauſed him to be brought before the Council, where he was diſcovered by Mr. <hi>Bedlow,</hi> to be one of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that he had ſeen in the Room where Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfry</hi> lay murthered; which Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges to be the immediate hand of God, which ſo far preſſed upon his Conſcience, as afterwards to make a full and ingenuous Confeſſion both of the <hi>Murther</hi> and <hi>Plot,</hi> for which he received the King's Pardon. And this is a ſtrenuous evidence againſt them, and ſtrong confirmation of the Aſſertions of Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Bedlow,</hi> and that what they had delivered, was not by Combination, or any Conſpiracy between them.</p>
            <p>But againſt Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> I find they had raiſed three ſeveral objections, thinking thereby to make his teſtimony inconſiderable. The <hi>firſt</hi> was, that he was <hi>Mad.</hi> But as to this, I think all that have read his Depoſitions, and the Evidence he hath given as to the Plot, with the circumſtances of his being engaged in the ſame, and the punctual account of the Murther of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfry,</hi> will not judge him to be bereft of his ſenſes. The things too well cohere together to proceed from a diſtracted perſon. The <hi>ſecond</hi> is, that he was tortur'd, and ill uſed in Priſon, to make him Confeſs againſt his Conſcience; and that all he had ſaid as to the <hi>Plot</hi> and <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> was through <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>terrour.</hi> But I ſhall onely mention his own words, ſufficient to clear this Aſperſion, <hi>pag.</hi> 25. of his Narrative, <hi>That the Report was wholly falſe and ſcandalous, but that on the contrary, he had received all the kind uſage and civilities imaginable, from Captain</hi> Richardſon <hi>the Keeper of</hi> Newgate, <hi>where he was confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all the time of his ſtay; and that nothing of compulſion or force was put upon him to declare any thing, but that what he did was freely and voluntarily, not byaſſed by any siniſter end, nor out of any malice, or in wrong to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whatſoever:</hi> And this he declares in the preſence of <hi>Almighty God,</hi> the Searcher of Hearts, before whoſe juſt and dreadfull Tribunal he expects to appear, and begs and implores the mercy of the King of Heaven, on his ſincere Repentance, for his wicked fact, and great ſin committed, in being an Acceſſory to the Death of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfry,</hi> as he had obtained that of his King here for the ſame. The <hi>third</hi> was, that being through fear and terrour made to acknowledge himſelf guilty, he was forced in his Conſcience to deny all again, before His Majeſty of Great <hi>Britain.</hi> And here indeed they have ſome appearance of Truth, and with it they have made a great duſt, thinking by this means to blind the eyes of the people. But Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> himſelf in his Narrative <hi>pag.</hi> 22. and 23. ſo well clears that aſperſion, that there can be no more ſaid, and in my judgment ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders him more ſtrong and firm after his ſtaggering and fluctuation: for he calls it there his imbecillity and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that though he had onely for his Conſcience ſake made his free Confeſſion, being awakened by the horrour of his Crimes, yet afterwards he went and declared to the King that he was Innocent, and that all thoſe he had accuſed were alſo Innocent. Now they cry out, a man that will thus ſay now one thing, and then another thing, is not to be believed; and that his Evidence is nothing worth. But <hi>pag.</hi> 23. Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> ſays this for himſelf, <hi>That the fear and terrour of</hi> death <hi>(not then having any aſſurance of Pardon) lying heavy upon him, and alſo the fear of being</hi> aſſaſſinated <hi>by the bloudy and revengefull</hi> Prieſts <hi>and</hi> Jeſuits, <hi>and alſo that if he ſhould eſcape with Life, that he ſhould wholly loſe his Trade, and ſo be conſequently ruined and undone, ſince his chief ſubſiſtence depended on the Trade he had with the</hi> Roman Catholicks, and that his Soul was not yet intirely out of the ſnare of Popiſh thraldom, induced him to think he might lawfully ſay, <hi>That he and all the reſt were Innocent, becauſe the horrid Crime of the Murther of Sir</hi> Edmundbury Godfry <hi>had been declared by the Popiſh Prieſts to be no ſin, and ſo in that ſenſe they were all Innocent, though he had not ſince the Fact received Abſolution.</hi> And thus by the way you may obſerve how they all die Innocent, as themſelves at the Gallows are pleas'd to ſay.</p>
            <p>But then he deſires you to conſider, that to ſtrengthen his firſt aſſertion, and to invalidate this act of his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and fear, he ſays, <hi>That what he had declared concerning the Murther was ſolemnly and upon Oath; and this ſuppoſed Retractation, ſuddenly in Paſſion, Conſternation and Fear, and not upon Oath.</hi> Secondly, That he was no ſooner carried back from the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Council</hi> to <hi>Newgate,</hi> not being above half an hour after, but that he ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly requeſted his Keeper to carry him back again, that he might juſtify his former Confeſſion to be true in all Circumſtances, and that what he had lately ſaid contradictory thereto, was cauſed by his perplexity of mind, and the terrour he lay under; and being immediately carried back, <hi>He denied his Recantation, and voluntarily upon Oath confirmed what he had firſt declared to be true.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And afterwards falling ſick whilſt in <hi>Newgate,</hi> and like to die, he then expecting to die, declared and often aſſerted to divers his firſt Confeſſion to be true in all points, as alſo ſince he recovered his health: So that 'tis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry plain, all this duſt which the Prieſts and Jeſuits have raiſed about this matter is blown away, and Truth is become perſpicuous to any ingenuous man, that will but impartially look into theſe tranſactions, and conſider them as they are, and not as they are repreſented by their falſe perſpectives.</p>
            <p>This is all that I have heard to be objected as to the Witneſſes, and you may judge by what I have been able to ſay, how frivolous it is. But theſe malicious perſons have not onely raiſed objections againſt thoſe perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, who were Witneſſes againſt theſe Plotters, but they alſo endeavour to caſt an Odium on the Judges themſelves, eſpecially the Lord Chief Juſtice; whom they report to be a very violent and paſſionate man againſt them, triumphing in their overthrow, handling the Priſoners cruelly and hardly, daunting their Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and laſhing out againſt them and their Religion, with many the like bitter reports: and as I have heard, they have not ſtuck to have ſent him Letters from this ſide the Water, upbraiding him for walking contrary to the ſteps of his Predeceſſors in the like Caſes; and have alſo been ſo impudent, as to ſend him a Book in the <hi>French</hi> Tongue, which endeavours to make this Plot to be contrived and laid, not by the Papiſts, but by the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101854:5"/>
Factious and Sectarian Parties in <hi>England.</hi> But this is <hi>fumos vendere,</hi> and I think that Worthy Perſon needs no Juſtification. I am ſatisfied, and ſuppoſe none that have read or heard the Trials of thoſe perſons condemned for the Plot, and Murther of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfry,</hi> but muſt remain ſatisfied in the fair and upright dealing of the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs,</hi> in hearing the Evidence fully on all ſides, and judging juſtly and indifferently between the King and the Priſoners. And in this extraordinary Caſe, if after an impartial and legall Trial, he, in ſumming up the Evidence, preſſed it home to the Jury to doe Juſtice, and if he ſpake ſomething as to the Catholick Religion, and the Jeſuits, and Jeſuited party, that has raiſed theſe Commotions and Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and brought thoſe men into the ſnare, he ought not to be blamed; and I cannot find either in him, or thoſe other Judges who gave Sentence of Death on the offenders, but that they did it according to Law, modeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and without that triumphing and bitterneſs, as they would ſeem to intimate.</p>
            <p>But to what poor ſhifts are theſe men drove to hide this abominable Plot and wicked Contrivance! when they would inſinuate into the people on this ſide the Water, and at a diſtance from you, that there never was any ſuch perſon as Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfry,</hi> and that you in <hi>England</hi> have fram'd a ſtory of ſuch a Murther, taking a hint from a Town called St. <hi>Edmunds Bury,</hi> to make the Papiſts odious, and by that means to raiſe the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the people againſt them. This ſhews very much the weakneſs of their Cauſe, or rather the foulneſs of it, that they are forced to ſuch narrow ſtarting-holes to keep up their reputation here: But with you this needs no anſwer, that worthy Gentleman being ſo well known in the place where he dwelt, and was too publick a Light to be hid in obſcurity under a Buſhel.</p>
            <p>To make this Diſcovery yet more full and evident, I find that God has brought forth of the Tower of <hi>London</hi> one Mr. <hi>Everard,</hi> after four years impriſonment, to give his Teſtimony concerning this very Plot, as appears by his Evidence and Narrative upon Oath, who there affirms what he knew of the ſame, and after what manner he came by it, being informed of it in <hi>Paris;</hi> ſo that coming over to <hi>England,</hi> for the intent of diſcovering what he knew concerning the ſame, he was clapt into the Tower, under the pretext of having ſome deſign of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an attempt againſt the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Life, where he was kept four years a cloſe Priſoner, without ever being brought to any Hearing or Trial; and though he had ſeveral times made ſome diſcovery of this Plot to Sir <hi>John Robinſon,</hi> the then Lieutenant of the Tower, he either did not or would not believe any thing of it, and would give no information to His Majeſty concerning the ſame; as may more fully appear by the Depoſitions of the ſaid Mr. <hi>Everard:</hi> which certainly is a very great Teſtimony, and very much corroborates the Aſſertions of the other Witneſſes concerned in the Plot, this man being none of the Confederacy, and ſo not entruſted with the horrid Intrigues thereof; yet ſo far knew of the ſame, as to have given ſome Light to the farther diſcovery of this dark deſign, had he not been thus ſubtly prevented by ſome of the Plotters means, who are ſince in cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody themſelves in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Province where they were to Act; for both that Kingdom and <hi>Scotland</hi> alſo was at the ſame time to have been ſubverted, as well as <hi>England.</hi> But things were not then ripe, and God had deſigned to let them run on yet farther in their wickedneſs, that his Glory might appear more great and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, and that his mercy, and protecting care of the King, and people of <hi>England,</hi> might be ſeen in diverting and making known a Plot and Conſpiracy ſo impending, and near taking effect, being carried on with ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy, skill and power ſo many years: but to God be given the Glory, and let the barking mouths of theſe Currs be ſtopped at laſt, and their endeavours to hide and to make this Plot of no account be blaſted and come to nought. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not withſtanding the Artifices of theſe men to ſupport their credit here abroad, and in ſome meaſure with you alſo in <hi>England,</hi> their Complices are like to ſuffer for their treaſonable practices. Some of the underlings have already paid for their Treaſon, with the forfeiture of their Lives; and the more great and formidable Plotters are like alſo to be called to account, and the very bottom of this horried and helliſh deſign like to be diſcovered. It is therefore now time for them to beſtir themſelves, and inded to ſay the truth, they will leave no ſtone un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd, and having firſt endeavoured to ſcandalize the Evidence againſt them, they now try to corrupt it, and to take them off; and this they have procured a ſubtle Agent to effect, one <hi>Nathaniel Reading,</hi> who by great and fair promiſes of great rewards and ſome Gold in hand, would have taken off Mr. <hi>Bedlow,</hi> one of the chief Evidence for the King againſt theſe Plotters; but I find that Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> out-witted him, and notwithſtanding he was a ſubtle Lawyer, brought him to ſhame and puniſhment for his Crime, which certainly was of a very high Nature, and which was punctually proved againſt him, ſo that none can deny the Truth thereof. Now from this I argue, If there were no Plot, as the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> here have endeavoured to have made us believe, why ſhould thoſe accuſed thereof ſeek by ſuch unjuſt means of bribery to take off the Evidence againſt them; and to draw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand ſuch matter onely for the Evidence to ſwear to, as might be ſure not to make them guilty of Treaſon, and out of the danger of the Law? Innocency needs not theſe ſhifts, and this alſo to me, and all rational men, muſt needs be another proof of their Guilt; and that notwithſtanding all this ſtir that they have made to hide their Crime, and moſt horrid Deſign, they are guilty of the ſame; and that there is and hath been a horrid Plot and Conſpiracy.</p>
            <p>Since you have deſired me to communicate my mind fully to you, I hope you will not think me tedious in that I cannot yet leave this matter; and that I reſolve as briefly as I can, to mention to you my thoughts on the ſeveral Trials of thoſe perſons Condemned, both for the Conſpiracy, and for the Murther of Sir <hi>Edmundbury God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fry,</hi> and to let you know what here hath been ſaid thereupon: for they have not onely endeavoured by all means and ways to <hi>beſpatter</hi> and <hi>calumniate</hi> the <hi>perſons</hi> of thoſe who <hi>diſcovered</hi> the <hi>Plot,</hi> the <hi>Judges</hi> who gave <hi>Sentence</hi> on the <hi>Traytors,</hi> and the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> againſt them, but alſo violently to ſpeak againſt the Juſtice and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality of the Trials themſelves; and ſo far to juſtify the Criminals, and thoſe Condemned and Executed for <hi>Traytors,</hi> as if they died <hi>illegally,</hi> without apparent proofs, and <hi>Innocent,</hi> and <hi>Martyrs.</hi>

And here I cannot but admire the ſtrange audacity of theſe men, that they ſhould think to be able, with bold and lying aſſertions to leſſen and pervert matters of fact, and things ſo notoriouſly known and acted in the face of a Nation; things not privately or clandeſtinely acted, but publickly and before the whole World. But what is it that theſe men will not attempt?

Tis for the ſake of Religion, and they may doe any thing.</p>
            <p>The firſt that comes upon the ſtage is Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> a leading man in this horried Plot and Conſpiracy, and a prime actor and promoter of it, by his great correſpondency abroad, both at <hi>Rome</hi> and in the <hi>French Court.</hi> I have read the Trial of that perſon with caution and conſideration; and however plain the proofs may appear to me, and to others of unbyaſſed judgments, yet they have had the confidence here to aſſert, and endeavour to impreſs it on the minds of the people, that nothing could be made out againſt this man to render him worthy of Death, or to make him guilty of Treaſon; and that he died innocent, a <hi>Saint,</hi> and a <hi>Martyr;</hi> and that at the Execution he utterly denied there was any ſuch thing: a Plot, as was pretended, though he own'd himſelf to be indeed a zealour promoter of the <hi>Catholick Cauſe.</hi> And, as I have heard, many were ſo ſottiſhly deluded with this opinion of his innocency, that they purchaſed at dear rates pieces of the Halter that ſtrangled him, to keep as reliques of his Saintſhip. That a great argument of his innocency was, that he never endeavoured to make any eſcape or to fly away, having his Liberty ſeveral days after the diſcovery of the Plot, and his being queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd about the ſame.</p>
            <p>The men who ſeem thus to believe nothing, and goe about to perſwade others to be of their opinion, and who raiſe the objections and reports to caſt a miſt before the eyes of the people, are thoſe no doubt whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences know the contrary to what they pretend to be abſolutely true, and are and have been agents and promoters of that Plot and Conſpiracy they would cry down: and they cannot but know that <hi>Coleman</hi> and the reſt had a fair Trial; that the proofs were home and evident againſt them, and that they ſuffered juſtly and by due courſe of Law. But it is their intereſt to ſeem of another mind: and notwithſtanding they have endeavoured to render the <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice</hi> odious, and cunningly to inſinuate his illegal proceedings with Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> thoſe of their own party could not but acknowledge the words that I ſhewed them in the ſeventeenth Page of his printed Trial to be full of <hi>honour and integrity.</hi> For there ſpeaking to Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> who was then to be ſworn as evidence againſt Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> he gives him warning to <hi>ſpeak nothing but the truth, not to adde the leaſt tirtle that is falſe for any advantage whatſoever; for that ſince the Priſoner's Bloud and Life was at ſtake, he ſhould ſtand or fall, be juſtified or condemned by Truth.</hi> He alſo then puts Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> in mind of the ſacredneſs of an Oath, and that to falſily it, and thereby to take away a man's Life, was Murther. Therefore he deſired he would ſpeak nothing but the down-right Truth, that he may not be condemned by any Circumſtances, but by plain evidence of Fact; and ſo that not onely Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> may be ſatisfied in the juſtneſs of his Trial, but all people elſe. I think this is ſufficient to manifeſt the uprightneſs of the Judge, and that Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> had a free and legal Trial for his Life, according to the Laws of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that they ſhould ſo boldly and with a conſident Brow aſſert, that nothing could be made out againſt him, that ſhould render him guilty of Treaſon or worthy of Death, is very ſtrange, when not onely the witneſſes that are brought againſt him do prove ſufficient matter of fact, but his own Letters produced and read before his face, which he acknowledges for his own, do in plain words ſay, that he is about <hi>a great work, no leſs then the Converſion of three Kingdoms, and the total and utter Subverſion and Subduing of that peſtilent Hereſy the Proteſtant Religion, which hath reigned ſo long in this Northern part of the World; and for the doing of which there never was ſuch great hopes ſince our Queen</hi> Marie'<hi>s days as at this time: pag.</hi> 69. Now can there be any thing more clear, then that this <hi>ſubverſion of a Religion</hi> ſo generally received in thoſe <hi>three Kingdoms,</hi> and ſo long and thoroughly eſtabliſhed, could not be effected but by the <hi>ſubverſion</hi> of thoſe <hi>three Kingdoms,</hi> and by the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi> of the eſtabliſhed <hi>Laws,</hi> the <hi>Liberties,</hi> and the <hi>Lives</hi> of many thouſands within thoſe <hi>three Kingdoms?</hi> and all this could not have been done without bringing in of forein Force, or raiſing a Rebellion amongſt your ſelves, or both. In his long Letter to Monſiour <hi>Le Cheſe</hi> he ſays, <hi>pag. 53. He would willingly be in everlaſting diſgrace with all the world, if by the aſſiſtance of 20000. li. to be obtained from the FRENCH KING, he did not regain to the DVKE his MASTER his former Offices, and eſpecially that of being ADMIRAL of the FLEET:</hi> and again <hi>pag.</hi> 54. he tells you for what end this deſign is, that it <hi>might give the greateſt blow to the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in</hi> England <hi>that ever it received ſince its birth:</hi> and therefore in the concluſion of one of his Letters to <hi>Le Cheſe,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King's Confeſſour, he deſires the power and aſſiſtance of <hi>France,</hi> which next under God he relies upon. So that his own hand convicts him of endeavouring to bring in <hi>Forein Powers</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> to eſtabliſh the <hi>Roman Catholick Religion,</hi> and to overthrow that now there eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>This was but one way to bring his deſigns about; the other moſt horrid and bloudy was the taking away the <hi>Sacred Life of the King,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſwears againſt him, <hi>pag.</hi> 21. that he was privy to the Conſult at the White-Horſe Tavern in the <hi>Strand,</hi> wherein it was reſolved, that <hi>Grove</hi> and <hi>Pickering</hi> ſhould be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to effect it, and that Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> did approve of the ſame: ſo that by this the proof was plain againſt him, for by the Laws of <hi>England</hi> his aſſent made him equally guilty with the Aſſaſſinates, there being no Acceſſories in <hi>Treaſon.</hi> And this Reſolve he ſwears was communicated to Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> in his hearing in <hi>Wild-houſe:</hi> and <hi>pag.</hi> 22. he ſwears he heard him ſay the deſign was well contrived. And <hi>pag. 24. Oates</hi> ſwears that Mr. <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> knew of the <hi>four Iriſh Ruſſians</hi> ſent to <hi>Windſor</hi> to kill the King; and in his hearing asked <hi>Harcourt</hi> at <hi>Wild-houſe</hi> what care was taken for thoſe <hi>four Gentlemen</hi> that went laſt night to <hi>Windſor;</hi> who replied, there was So. <hi>li.</hi> ordered to be ſent to them, which he ſaw there on the Table, moſt part of it in Guinies; and that Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> gave a Guiny to the Meſſenger who was to carry this reward, to be nimble and to expedite his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101854:6"/>
journey. Then <hi>pag.</hi> 25. he ſwears again, that Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> was privy to the inſtructions ſent by <hi>White,</hi> Provincial of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> from theſe parts, to impower the Conſulters to propoſe 10000 <hi>li.</hi> to Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> to poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the King; and that he not onely ſaw and read theſe Inſtructions, but copied them out, and tranſmitted them to ſeveral Conſpirators in this Plot within the Kingdom. And <hi>pag.</hi> 26. he ſwears, Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> ſaid he thought 10000. <hi>li.</hi> was too little, and that it would be neceſſary to adde 5000 <hi>li.</hi> more, that they might be ſure to have it done. And <hi>pag.</hi> 27. he ſwears that he ſaw Mr. <hi>Coleman's Commiſſion for to be Secretary of State,</hi> from the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the Society of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> by virtue of a Brief from the Pope; and that in <hi>Fenwick</hi>'s Chamber in <hi>Drury-Lane</hi> he ſaw him open it, and own the receipt of it, ſaying it was a good exchange.</p>
            <p>One witneſs is not enough in this caſe, but I find alſo Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> a ſecond to ſtrengthen the other's Evidence; he ſwears <hi>pag.</hi> 43. that he heard Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> ſay at his own houſe, <hi>That if he had an hundred Lives, and a ſea of Bloud to ſwim through, he would ſpend it all to carry on the Cauſe of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and to eſtabliſh that Church in</hi> England: <hi>and if there were an hundred heretical Kings to be Depoſed, he would ſee them all deſtroyed:</hi> ſo that both ſwear to the killing of the King, and ſubverting the Government. I cannot find that Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> could make any good or ſatisfactory defence for himſelf, but would have ſought ſtarting-holes and ſhifts to have amazed the minds of the Jury, with putting the witneſſes to have proved to a day what they averr, which is in moſt things done, and would take that advantage, where Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſays <hi>pag.</hi> 72. he will not be poſitive that it was ſuch a day; but Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> cannot bring any poſitive proof that it was not that day, or that the witneſs contradicted himſelf, as he attempted to doe. And indeed though Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> was never ſo wiſe a man, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to be Secretary of State, in matters of Fact ſo plainly and quite blank proved againſt him it is a very hard matter to make a good defence, nay impoſſible, unleſs he can any ways prove the witneſſes perjur'd, or ſome impoſſibility or contradiction in their Teſtimony, which Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> was not able to doe. And therefore I cannot but admire that any can ſay he had not a fair and legal Trial, and that nothing could be made out againſt him worthy of death; for if knowing of this <hi>Conſpiracy,</hi> of ſubverting <hi>Religion</hi> eſtabliſhed by Law in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, of an intent of <hi>murthering the King</hi> to promote that Cauſe, and alſo of endeavouring by Letters and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence to engage a Foreign Power to aſſiſt to bring in this Cauſe, be not worthy of death, nothing is. And when ſuch proof is made out ſo clearly, whatever Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> may ſay at his death of his Innocency, it ought not to be believed; for he may have many evaſions, and as Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> ſays in <hi>pag.</hi> 23, and 24. of his Narrative, it is, according to the ſenſe of the <hi>Jeſuiticol</hi> Doctrine, (I will not ſay <hi>Popiſh)</hi> to be Innocent, when the Prieſts had ſolemnly declared the fact they were accuſed of to be no ſin or crime, as they look'd on this, of bringing in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion by the death of an Heretical Prince, to be: or he might be Innocent having received full Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution for the ſame. But what-ever he meant by thoſe words of Juſtification, I believe few will ever believe him innocent of the Fact for which he was accuſed, that either have heard or read his Trial. And though he had the conſidence to deny this Plot, hoping perhaps that it might yet take effect, things then not being ſo fully diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as ſince; or, as I heard, expecting a <hi>Pardon</hi> or <hi>Reprieve</hi> to the <hi>laſt moment:</hi> yet it is now too generally received, and all the circumſtances more fully appear ſince his death, and that he was inſtrumental therein. That he fled not at firſt for the ſame argues not his innocency, ſo much as the confidence he had, that it was not ſo much known as he found afterwards it was, and relying too much on the hopes of being brought off. But herein alſo he was deluded, and perhaps repented too late, having been heard to ſay with great paſſion at his Execution, <hi>There is no Faith in Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next who came upon their Trial were <hi>Ireland, Pickering, Grove, Whitebread</hi> and <hi>Fenwick,</hi> being accuſed of this horrid Plot and Conſpiracy: and though the two laſt were by the oath of Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſufficiently proved to have a great hand in the Plot, and contrivance of the murther of the King; yet becauſe there wanted another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current Teſtimony, they were ſet by till further evidence might be produced: and becauſe theſe alſo are ſaid to be innocent, and that the matters of fact were not proved as they ought againſt them, I ſhall briefly charge my memory with what I have read in the Printed Book of their Trials; and as it gave me full ſatisfaction in that caſe, perhaps if diligently conſidered it may doe the like to others.</p>
            <p>But firſt I ſhall obſerve to you, becauſe many or moſt of theſe Conſpirators are Prieſts and Jeſuits, and that <hi>Ireland,</hi> if not <hi>Pickering,</hi> is ſo; they have given forth abroad, and no doubt ſpread the ſame amongſt the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant at home, that they were tried, and ſuffered <hi>quatenus</hi> Prieſts, upon the Statute of the 27 <hi>Eliz.</hi> by which Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute it is made Treaſon for any perſon that is a Subject born in <hi>England,</hi> to take Orders from the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and afterwards to come into <hi>England,</hi> and remain here 40 days, and <hi>ipſo facto</hi> for that offence he ſhall be found guilty, and ſuffer as a Traytor: ſo that they would endeavour to perſwade the ignorant that they ſuffer onely as <hi>Roman Catholicks, being Prieſts doing their Function, obeying the orders of their Superiours,</hi> and the dictates of their own <hi>Conſciences;</hi> and not as <hi>Plotters, Traytors,</hi> and <hi>Diſturbers</hi> of the <hi>Publick Peace.</hi> But that they might not fancy to themſelves, that they ſuffered Martyrdom for their Religion, nor perſwade others to the ſame, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have had the vanity to believe, and others the confidence to aſſert, it was declared by the <hi>King's Council</hi> in open Court, that theſe men, though liable to be puniſhed by that Statute, were not Indicted as Prieſts, nor upon that Statute of 27 <hi>Eliz.</hi> but of a more horrid and deteſtable Crime, <hi>The killing of the King, and ſubverſion of the Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to prove this two witneſſes are produced, Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedlow;</hi> and though both cannot perhaps ſpeak to one and the ſame Conſultation, nor to one and the ſame time, yet are they in Law two witneſſes to one and the ſame Crime: for thus ſeveral witneſſes to ſeveral overt Acts are ſo many witneſſes to the Treaſon; and the ſeveral overt Acts which declare the Intention, are but as ſo many evidences of the Treaſon: and this was openly declared to be Law in Court, upon the Trial of theſe perſons. And there is a great deal of reaſon that it ſhould be ſo, for men that run the hazard of their lives in ſuch Conſultations, will hardly ſuffer two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101854:6"/>
to meet twice together, whom they are not well aſſured of, but ſo diſpoſe them that they may meet ſeverally, at ſeveral times, and in divers places, as Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> did.</p>
            <p>As to the proof, Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſwears, <hi>pag.</hi> 19. and 20. that in a <hi>Conſult,</hi> begun at the <hi>White Horſe</hi> Tavern in the <hi>Strand,</hi> and proſecuted at the Meetings at their ſeveral Chambers, it was Reſolved, that <hi>Pickering</hi> and <hi>Grove</hi> ſhould go on in their attempt to murther the King; that <hi>Grove</hi> ſhould have 1500 <hi>l.</hi> for his Reward, and <hi>Pickering</hi> 30000. Maſſes for his: (which at 12 <hi>d.</hi> a Maſs comes to the ſame ſum in their account.) And this Reſolve was ſigned by <hi>Whitebread, Fenwick</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and by ſeveral others at four Clubs. He ſwears punctually that he ſaw them ſign it, and carryed the Inſtrument from one to another, and that they ſigned it ſeverally at their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. He alſo ſwears, <hi>pag.</hi> 23. that <hi>Pickering</hi> and <hi>Grove</hi> accepted to murther the King on thoſe terms, and that in his preſence they took the <hi>Sacrament</hi> and the Oath of <hi>Secrecy</hi> upon it, and did agree to effect the bloudy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal. Farther, the ſame Deponent ſwears, that he ſaw <hi>Pickering</hi> and <hi>Grove</hi> walking in the Park at ſeveral times, watching for an opportunity of committing their bloudy deſign of murthering his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> having with them ſcrewed Piſtols, which were longer then ordinary, and furniſhed alſo with Silver Bullets: and, <hi>pag.</hi> 24. he ſwears that <hi>Grove</hi> would have the Bullets champt, to make the wound incurable. And farther, that in the Month of <hi>March,</hi> having a fair opportunity of effecting their deſign, the Flint in <hi>Pickering</hi>'s Piſtol being looſe, he durſt not make an attempt; for which negligence <hi>Grove</hi> was chidden, and <hi>Pickering</hi> received twenty or thirty ſtrokes of Diſcipline, by way of Pennance, for his careleſneſs. <hi>Page</hi> 22. he ſwears againſt <hi>Whitebread,</hi> that he ſaw his Letter, in which he expreſſed a great deal of Joy, that Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> had accepted the 15000 <hi>l.</hi> to poiſon the King; and alſo, that he was by, when <hi>Harcourt,</hi> another of theſe <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and <hi>Fenwick</hi> the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, were at a Conſult, and agreed to the Propoſition of <hi>Fogarthy,</hi> of ſending four Iriſh Ruſſians to kill the King at <hi>Windſor,</hi> and that they were ſent accordingly. And <hi>pag.</hi> 29. ſwears, that <hi>Whitebread</hi> had ſealed ſome hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of Commiſſions, which they called Patents, to raiſe an Army, to be in a readineſs upon the Death of the King, which Seals were then produced in Court, naming one Commiſſion in ſpecial, which he the Deponent delivered himſelf to Sir <hi>John Gage</hi> of <hi>Suſſex. Pag.</hi> 22. he ſwears againſt <hi>Fenwick,</hi> that he told him that he, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, and three <hi>Iriſhmen</hi> more, fired <hi>Southwark,</hi> and that he had 400 <hi>l.</hi> for his ſhare, and the reſt 200 <hi>l.</hi> a piece. And <hi>pag.</hi> 20. to ſhew the great Malice of theſe men, <hi>Whitebread</hi> ordered Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> to come purpoſely from <hi>S. Omars</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> to Murther D. <hi>Tongue,</hi> for Writing the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Morals; and <hi>pag.</hi> 21. the ſame <hi>Whitebread</hi> ſent by him Inſtructions, that care ſhould be taken for the Murther of D. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Hereford.</hi> Theſe are the chief things obſervable in Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> his Depoſitions, and which are ſufficient to prove this horrid Plot.</p>
            <p>Then the Second Witneſs, Mr. <hi>Bedlow,</hi> ſwears <hi>pag.</hi> 37. that he was employed for the ſpace of near five years as a Meſſenger by theſe Conſpiratours for the carrying their Letters to ſeveral beyond the Seas, and returning others back, all or moſt relating to this Plot: for <hi>pag.</hi> 38. he ſwears he had a way to open the Letters and reade them, whereby he fully informed himſelf of matters. He ſwears <hi>pag.</hi> 37. that he heard ſome of theſe Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours ſay, they would not leave any member of an Heretick in <hi>England</hi> that ſhould ſurvive, to tell in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom hereafter, that there ever was any ſuch Religion in <hi>England</hi> as the Proteſtant Religion. He ſwears alſo the manner of his coming to be firſt employed by them, and then he brings his Brother <hi>James Bedlow</hi> to confirm his being their Agent or Meſſenger, who knew nothing of the Plot. He ſwears, <hi>pag.</hi> 48. and 49. his being ſo long employed by them, and that he had received oftentimes from theſe Jeſuits and Prieſts ſeveral ſumms of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in his Brothers behalf, ſometimes 50. or 60. pounds at a time: ſo that by this you may ſee Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> muſt be knowing in this deſign, employed under them ſo long in it. <hi>Pag.</hi> 41. He ſwears that about the latter end of <hi>Auguſt</hi> (the very day he confeſſes he cannot ſwear to) at Mr. <hi>Harcourts</hi> Chamber (one of the Conſpiratours) he there met <hi>Ireland, Pickering</hi> and <hi>Grove</hi> the Priſoners, with ſome others, where he heard them diſcourſe, that the four Ruſſians miſſing of killing the King at <hi>Windſor,</hi> that <hi>Pickering</hi> and <hi>Grove</hi> ſhould go on in their deſign, and that one <hi>Conyers</hi> was to be joyned with them to Aſſaſſinate the King in his Morning-walks at <hi>New market.</hi> And that Mr. <hi>Grove</hi> was more eager or forward then the reſt, ſaying, ſince it could not be done clandeſtinely, it ſhould be attempted openly; and that thoſe that do fall had the Glory to die in a good Cauſe: but if the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery ſhould be made, it could never come to that height but their Party would be ſtrong enough to bring it to paſs. All this he ſwears very punctually to: and <hi>pag.</hi> 48. he farther ſwears that <hi>Harcourt</hi> told him, that <hi>Grove</hi> was to have 1500 <hi>l.</hi> for his Reward, and that <hi>Pickering</hi> was to have ſo many Maſſes as came to that money. And <hi>pag.</hi> 45. he ſwears, that at the ſame time he heard them diſcourſe of the killing ſeveral noble Perſons, and of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Perſons that were to execute it; and in particular names one <hi>Knight</hi> aſſigned to kill the Earl of <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, Pritchard</hi> and Duke of <hi>Buckingham, O-Neal</hi> the Earl of <hi>Oſſory,</hi> and <hi>O-Brian</hi> the Duke of <hi>Ormond.</hi> So that by theſe two Teſtimonies the Evidence is very full againſt <hi>Ireland, Pickering</hi> and <hi>Grove.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Defence they have to make againſt this, is firſt, the denial of the Fact, though they can bring no Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to make any thing out but their own Aſſeverations: but they who can have a Diſpenſation for the breaking of any Oath, may be eaſily indulged for the telling of a lie to ſave their Lives, and to keep off a Scandal from their profeſſion. In the next place, they would endeavour to ſeem not to know Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and make as if they had ſcarce ſeen him: to this he ſwears by many ſeveral circumſtances, which they are forced to acknowledge; and <hi>pag.</hi> 32. ſwears <hi>Fenwick</hi> was his Father Confeſſour. But <hi>Ireland</hi> raiſed ſome little appearance of contradiction or miſtake in Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi>'s Evidence, for he brings two or three to prove, <hi>pag.</hi> 56, 57. that he was not in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> all the month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> ſwearing that he was at the Conſult held at <hi>Harcourts</hi> Chamber, in the latter end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> concerning the Death of the King. And indeed two poſitively ſay the contrary, and that he was from the third of <hi>Auguſt</hi> to the firſt or ſecond of <hi>September</hi> in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> and <hi>Weſtcheſter,</hi> and by circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that he was in the beginning of <hi>September</hi> at <hi>Wolverhampton.</hi> But were this granted, that he ſhould miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101854:7"/>
in the point of Time, yet this is nothing as to the matter of Fact expreſly ſworn againſt them, and ſo deſtroys not the Evidence, unleſs it were neceſſary to the ſubſtance of the thing: for this Meeting and Treaſonable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance might be ſome days or weeks after, and ſo true. And though ſuch a miſtake may ſomewhat weaken the Evidence in the opinion of the Jury, it ought not to invalidate the truth of the thing it ſelf, which may be true in ſubſtance, though not in circumſtance of Time. But againſt the aſſeverations of theſe Perſons, there is the Oath of Mr. <hi>Bedlow,</hi> who ſwears it poſitively; and beſides, Mr. <hi>Oates pag.</hi> 60. ſwears poſitively, that ten days at leaſt within <hi>Auguſt</hi> he was with him at <hi>Fenwick</hi>'s Chamber in <hi>London,</hi> and that in the beginning of <hi>September,</hi> either the firſt or ſecond day, he was to his knowledge in <hi>London,</hi> and that he had 20 <hi>s.</hi> of him. Then a third perſon is produced, that had been <hi>Grove</hi>'s Maid-ſervant, who very well knew <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the ſwears poſitively, and by good circumſtances, <hi>pag.</hi> 57, and 58. that ſhe ſaw him at a Scriveners Door in <hi>Fetter-lane,</hi> where he lodged, about the twelfth or thirteenth of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> So that theſe three concurrent Teſtimonies might very well be credited by the Jury in this caſe, and make them juſtly bring in their Verdicts, as they did, Guilty, without any deinur or heſitation. As for <hi>Pickering</hi> and <hi>Grove,</hi> they could not make any defence, beſides the denial of all that was ſworn againſt them to be true, and that they were innocent and not guilty.</p>
            <p>And now let all the world judge who are to be believed in this caſe, and admire at the obſtinacy of theſe men, who ſhall deny ſo clear evidence againſt them to the laſt gaſp, and die in their Impenitency; and at thoſe wicked ones alſo, that ſhall ſecretly and ſlanderouſly go about to make the world believe, that theſe men had not Juſtice done them, and that they died Innocent and Martyrs.</p>
            <p>I find my Letter ſwells to a bigger bulk then I intended, therefore I ſhall be as brief as I can in mentioning the Tryals of thoſe who had a hand in the murther of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfry,</hi> which was as punctually prov'd againſt them as could be; for in the caſe of Felony, by the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> one ſufficient Witneſs for the King is enough, though here you ſhall find a very plain concurrent Evidence, and the whole ſtreſs lies not upon Maſter <hi>Prance,</hi> who was one of the Aſſiſtants at the Murther.</p>
            <p>The perſons accuſed and convicted for this Murther were, <hi>Robert Green, Henry Berry,</hi> and <hi>Laurence Hill,</hi> Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who ſuffer'd for the ſame: others concerned were Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> who confeſſed the Fact, had the King's Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and was the Accuſer; beſides <hi>Kelly</hi> and <hi>Girald,</hi> Prieſts, who aſſiſted in the Murther, and who are fled, and ſome others, knowing of, and abetting the ſame, are alſo fled. The firſt thing that is proved by two Witneſſes, <hi>pag.</hi> 12. and 13. is that one of the Motives that theſe perſons might have to murther this Knight, was, becauſe of his forwardneſs in diſcovering the Plot; and to this Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſwears, that this Knight Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfry</hi> told him he had been threatned by ſeveral perſons, for being ſo active in that Diſcovery, and that he told him that he went in fear of his Life by the Popiſh party for doing his Duty, being a Juſtice of the Peace, and that he had been dogg'd ſeveral days. Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> a man of Credit, and of the Knight's long acquaintance, ſwears alſo to the ſame effect, and <hi>pag.</hi> 14. That Sir <hi>Edmundbury</hi> ſaid to him, That he did believe in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that he ſhould be the firſt Martyr, and that the depth of the Plot was not yet found out. By this we may ſee the reaſon that theſe men had to murther this Gentleman, hoping by his death to hinder the Diſcovery of the Plot, it being then very young, and hardly credited, he having the chief Depoſitions in his hand; or to deter others from being active or meddling in the buſineſs, ſeeing the Revenge they had taken upon him for the ſame; or out of Malice and Revenge to the Man, for being active in diſcovering their Villany, and bringing to light their wicked deeds.</p>
            <p>The next Witneſs is Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> who ſwears, <hi>pag.</hi> 14. that <hi>Girald</hi> and <hi>Kelly,</hi> two Prieſts, firſt drew him into this Murther, he being a Roman Catholick, (as all the reſt were, except <hi>Berry,</hi> who ſaid he died a Proteſtant, and feigned himſelf otherwiſe for a livelihood, which I can hardly believe) telling him it was no Sin, but a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Act, and that he was a buſie man, and had done a great deal of miſchief: and ſo they told the reſt: and this was at an Alehouſe, at the ſign of the Plough, about a fortnight before this Gentleman was murthered. He ſwears alſo, that they had dogg'd him into ſeveral places, to get an opportunity of murthering him; and that on the <hi>Saturday</hi> (the twelfth of <hi>October)</hi> about ſeven of the Clock in the Evening, <hi>Green</hi> and <hi>Hill,</hi> having dogg'd him into a Houſe at S. <hi>Clements,</hi> not far from <hi>Somerſet-</hi>Houſe, where he was murthered, <hi>Hill</hi> ſtay'd to watch his motion, and <hi>Green</hi> came to <hi>Prance</hi> his Houſe, to call him to aſſiſt them, and that he immediately went to <hi>Somerſet-</hi>Houſe, where were <hi>Girald, Kelly, Green</hi> and <hi>Berry,</hi> and that about nine of the Clock, <hi>Hill</hi> came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to give them notice of the approach of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfry,</hi> it being in his way to his own Houſe, that <hi>Hill</hi> went up to the Gate to watch for the coming by of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfry,</hi> and by a wile to draw him within the Gate, pretending two men to be a quarrelling, and deſiring his preſence to part them, he being a Juſtice of the Peace. That this Gentleman being at laſt perſwaded to do that good office, followed <hi>Hill</hi> within the Gate, till he came to the bottom of the Rails, when <hi>Green,</hi> coming behind him, flung a twiſted Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief about his Neck, and threw him down behind the Rails, where, aſſiſted by <hi>Girald, Kelly</hi> and <hi>Hill,</hi> they ſtrangled him. <hi>Pag.</hi> 16. and 17. Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> ſwears he was not by at the Action, for <hi>Hill</hi> ordered him to watch at the Water-gate, and <hi>Berry</hi> at the Stairs, that none might come in the mean time to interrupt them, and that after a little while, that he thought they might have diſpatched him, he went to them, and found the four be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned ſtanding about the Body, and <hi>Green</hi> boaſted to him, how well he had done it, and that the reſt told him the manner of their effecting it, and that <hi>Green,</hi> thinking him not quite dead, gave him ſeveral pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches on his Breaſt with his Knee, and twiſted his Neck about, and that preſently after <hi>Berry</hi> alſo came to them. And <hi>pag.</hi> 18. he ſwears they all ſix help'd to carry him up a pair of Stairs, into a certain Room in the Houſe where <hi>Hill</hi> lay, where the Body lay till Monday night, and was then removed into <hi>Somerſet</hi> Houſe, and on Monday night he was ſhewn the Body by <hi>Hill,</hi> with a dark Lanthorn, <hi>Girald, Hill</hi> and <hi>Kelly</hi> being by; and on Tueſday night the Body was carried back to <hi>Hill</hi>'s Lodging, where it firſt lay, but not into the ſame Room, but one over
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101854:7"/>
againſt it; and about nine of the Clock on the Wedneſday night, they removed it to the Room where it firſt lay, he being there when they removed it, <hi>pag.</hi> 19. and that about twelve a Clock that night, a Sedan being brought by <hi>Hill,</hi> they all put the Body into it, and that <hi>Berry</hi> at the ſign of a hem that was given opened for them the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Gate of the upper Court; that he, Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> and <hi>Girald</hi> the Prieſt (now the Porter) firſt carried the Sedan, <hi>Green</hi> and <hi>Kelly</hi> going before: and <hi>pag.</hi> 20. he ſwears they carried it to <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> where they reſted, and that the <hi>Green</hi> and <hi>Kelly</hi> took their turns, and carried it to <hi>Long-Acre,</hi> then <hi>Prance</hi> and <hi>Girald</hi> carried it to <hi>So-Hoe</hi> Church, where <hi>Hill</hi> met them with an Horſe, and that they then took the Body up and ſet it before <hi>Hill</hi> on the Horſe, who held him up, and that <hi>Kelly, Girald</hi> and <hi>Green</hi> went along with him, and that he the Deponent then left them to return home, for fear of raiſing a ſuſpicion. But he ſwears that the next day, they, <hi>Hill, Kelly</hi> and <hi>Girald,</hi> told him how they had diſpoſed of the Body; firſt that they had run him through with his own Sword, then thrown him into a Ditch, and laid his Gloves and other things upon the Bank. <hi>Pag.</hi> 22. he ſwears that they had all agreed to the Murther of this Gentleman, having had more then one Meeting about it, and that the firſt that met him was to give notice to the reſt; that there was a conſiderable Reward to be given among them for doing it, and that it was to come from (as they told him) the Lord <hi>Bellaſis.</hi> And alſo, that <hi>Girald</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to kill him that night, and if he could not get him in a more convenient place, he would kill him with his own Sword, in the Street that leads to his own Houſe.</p>
            <p>Judge now, whether all this be not punctually proved by one Witneſs, which is as much as the Law requires in this caſe: however, that theſe perſons might not have any the leaſt excuſe that they had not Juſtice done them, and to ſatisfie the whole world that they were not condemned onely upon the Teſtimony of Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> I find other ſtrong concurrent Witneſſes, that by many circumſtances corroborate his Evidence, among the which Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> is one, who ſwears, <hi>pag.</hi> 28. that he had been ſeveral times treated with by <hi>Le Faire, Prichard, Keins,</hi> and other Prieſts, about murthering a certain Gentleman they would not name, about the beginning of that <hi>October</hi> this Gentleman was murthered, and deſired him alſo (not telling him the reaſon) to get into the Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfry;</hi> and that he did ſo: and <hi>pag.</hi> 30. he ſwears, that very Morning Sir <hi>Edmund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> was murthered, at the <hi>Palſgraves</hi> I lead Tavern <hi>Le Faire</hi> told him, that there was a Gentleman that very Night to be put out of the way, a very material Man, that had all the Informations that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> and D. <hi>Tongue</hi> had given in; that ſeveral had been employed in the doing of it, and that ſeveral attempts had been made, and that they had miſſed ſeveral Opportunities, but that now it was to be done, for if he were not taken out of the way, the Plot would by his means go near to be fully Diſcovered, ſo that they ſhould not be able to bring their Deſign to paſs; but would not diſcover to him the name of the party: and alſo, that there was 4000 <hi>l.</hi> Reward to thoſe that did it, and no worſe man then the Lord <hi>Bellaſis</hi> had engaged for the payment of it. Upon which he ſwears, that he promiſed to engage in it, and to meet him that night at <hi>Somerſet</hi> Houſe, but that he went not according to his promiſe, knowing they had a deſign to murther ſome body: then, <hi>pag.</hi> 31. he ſwears far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he ſaw him not till the Monday night following, and then he was charged for his breach of promiſe; to which Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> replied, he would not engage in the Murther of any private Perſon, till he knew who he was, becauſe he might be his particular Friend. That <hi>Le Faire</hi> bid him meet him exactly at nine of the Clock that night in the Cloyſters at <hi>Somerſet</hi> Houſe, which he did, and that then he told him, that he had done ill that he did not help in the buſineſs, but that if he would help to carry the dead perſon off, he ſhould have half the Reward. That then he asked if he was murthered, and <hi>Le Faire</hi> anſwered yes: and upon his deſire to ſee the party, he took him by the hand, and led him through a dark Entry into a Room, where he ſaw ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, where they had a ſmall Light in a middle-ſiz'd Lanthorn, by which he ſaw a Corps, over which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was thrown, and one ſtepping to the Body threw off the thing that lay upon him, and he went and look'd upon him, and knew him preſently to be Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfry.</hi> And <hi>pag.</hi> 32. ſwears that they then told him that they had ſtrangled him, and that the Cravatte about his Neck was ſo ſtreight he could not get his Finger in between it and his Neck. That they did not think that he knew him, but told him that he was one that belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to a Perſon of Quality. That he would have perſwaded them to have tyed Weights to his Head and Feet, and to have ſlung him into the <hi>Thames.</hi> But they did not think that ſo ſafe, but anſwered, No, they would put the Murther upon himſelf. Then asking how they would get him out, <hi>Le Faire</hi> anſwered in a Chair, and that <hi>Berry</hi> the Porter was to ſit up to let them out. That he then told them that about eleven or twelve of the Clock would be the beſt time to carry him forth, and <hi>Le Faire</hi> then made him promiſe upon the Sacrament, that he took on the Thurſday before, to come and help to carry him off at that hour; for after the Diſcovery of the Plot, he ſwears, the Sacrament was adminiſhed to him twice a week to conceal it. He alſo ſwears, that he did not go, but went away for <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and that upon the great trouble and diſturbance in his Conſcience for this Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and horrid Plot, he revealed the ſame, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That upon his not coming they deſiſted from carrying out the Body that night, and for fear leſt he ſhould diſcover them, he ſuppoſed they cauſed it to be removed.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> alſo ſwears, <hi>pag.</hi> 33. that he never had any diſcourſe with Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> from the time that he ſaw him with the Body of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfry</hi> that night in <hi>Somerſet</hi> Houſe, and that ſeeing him in the <hi>Lobby,</hi> being taken upon ſuſpicion onely, he knew him again, and accuſed him for the Murther of that Gentleman. And <hi>pag.</hi> 23. Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> ſwears, that he never had any conference with Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> in all his Life, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly ſtrengthens the Evidence, and that there could be no Conſpiracy between them, to invent a Story with ſo many agreeing circumſtances. Then <hi>pag.</hi> 35. they prove, that Sir <hi>Edmundbury</hi>'s Body was found in the Ditch juſt as they had related it to Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> and alſo the diſlocation of his Neck, the ſtruggling, and contuſion of his Breaſt with ſome blows, and that the Wound made by the Sword could not be the occaſion of his death, by able Chirurgions: with ſeveral other circumſtances too long to remember now. So that all the circumſtances are proved as much as is poſſible by two ſeveral Witneſſes, not knowing, or ever diſcourſing one another: ſo that it
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101854:8"/>
would be the ſtrangeſt Miracle in the world, that they ſhould both agree in ſo many untrue Circumſtances. Had they laid their heads together to contrive this Story, which is impoſſible they ſhould do without diſcourſing with one another beforehand, yet, there being ſo many other ſeveral Witneſſes, to prove ſeveral other circumſtances, as their meeting at <hi>Bow</hi> at the Ale-houſe, and the Maid ſwearing that <hi>Hill</hi> was at Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfry</hi>'s Houſe, and ſpake with him that morning he was murthered, and that he had the ſame Cloaths on which he had then at the Bar, <hi>pag.</hi> 39. they alſo muſt be thought to have conſpired with them, to take away the Life of two or three men without any provocation or reward; a thing ſo unlikely, that it cannot enter into the thought of any ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal man; nor can any Chriſtian believe, ſo many could joyn together to invent ſo horrid a lie, to take away mens lives for nothing: nay if it were granted they might, I cannot believe they could have contrived ſo many ſeveral circumſtances without the leaſt variation, and without being intrapped by ſo many wiſe and judicious men who ſifted them; and the more, becauſe of the ſtrange obſtinacy and denial of the Criminals. Having therefore ſeriouſly conſidered all things, I cannot but admire that any in <hi>England</hi> ſhould doubt of the Guilt of theſe Murtherers.</p>
            <p>All I can find of any weight in their Defences for themſelves is of little conſideration to invalidate ſuch ſtrong proofs. That they all denyed it very ſtoutly to the laſt is true, but that is of no value againſt ſuch plain Evidence, and but aggravates their Crime. <hi>Hill</hi> would have invalidated Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> his Teſtimony becauſe he had deny'd it: but that has already been cleared, and could no ways legally take off his Evidence, for he was no ways perjur'd. But then to evade the matter, he brings ſeveral Witneſſes, all of his own Religion, to aver he was never from his Lodgings after nine of the Clock at night: but theſe do it ſo mincingly and generally, that no ſtreſs can be laid upon them, it being proved that they had ſeveral Keys to the Door, and that <hi>Hill</hi> might go in and out without their knowledge, and one of his Witneſſes makes but a miſtake of a whole month, <hi>pag.</hi> 55. and two of <hi>Green</hi>'s Witneſſes a whole week, <hi>pag.</hi> 66. ſo ill had they calculated the Time which they intended to ſpeak to. There is nothing that can be thought to be of any moment in all that the Witneſſes ſaid in behalf of the Priſoners, but what the Souldiers ſay in behalf of <hi>Berry, pag.</hi> 68. and 69. who were placed at the Gate Sentinels, and they ſay that they ſaw a Sedan come in, ſo far they agree with the King's Evidence, but then they confidently aver none went out all that night. But what is this to the matter of Fact, and to the Murther committed ſworn in all circumſtances ſo punctually to? for the Sentinel might be from his poſt, and Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> ſays (who knew of the Contrivance) <hi>pag.</hi> 16. of his printed Narrative of this Murther, that <hi>Berry</hi> had beforehand got the Sentinel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Houſe to drink, that he might not ſee the Sedan go out; and the Sentinel knowing he had committed a great fault by ſo doing, was ſo wiſe; though not very honeſt, to conceal it. And this is the moſt of colour they could produce that might any ways cauſe the leaſt heſitation, and how far this ſingle Teſtimony will go to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validate a Teſtimony ſo full, and not any ways to be contradicted, let the world judge; I muſt confeſs it has given me full ſatisfaction, and I hope will give the like to all others, who are impartial men, that ſhall reade the ſame.</p>
            <p>I muſt indeed declare that it ſeems ſomewhat ſtrange, that nothing ſhould work upon theſe men to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their Crime at their death; but that they ſhould take it upon their Salvation, that they died Innocent of this Murther they ſuffer'd for, as the Child that was newly born. But I fear they were under ſome horrid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion, and were ſo charm'd and bound up by ſo many Oaths and Sacraments, by their Ghoſtly Fathers the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites,</hi> who had brought them to this, that they durſt not acknowledge the Truth, or that they thought by this means they ſhould do great ſervice to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, and be Sainted for it in Heaven. And the Printed Account of <hi>Hill</hi>'s Confeſſion ſeems to make it plain, for there was found in his pocket after he was executed a very formal Confeſſion, written not with his own hand, neither had he Pen, Ink or Paper all the time he was in Priſon, and his Wife witneſſed it was not her Husband's hand. How he came by it none could tell, but it was very formally drawn, and in which I obſerve he ſtoutly denies the Fact, and calls God and Angels to witneſs his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and that he is wrongfully put to death, and for that cauſe cites all ſuch as had a hand in his death, and particularly the <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice,</hi> with the Jury and Witneſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhewing a very wicked and uncharitable Spirit in the Indicter, for I ſuppoſe this was given to <hi>Hill</hi> to con againſt the time of his Execution, and of which Leſſon he repeated as much as he could remember. So that I cannot but believe the obſtinacy of theſe men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> for it is plain this Writing was prepared for him by ſome other, and not by himſelf.</p>
            <p>I ſhall alſo inform you of another trick invented by theſe men. Upon the general report of the Plot, in ſome parts more remote from us, and where the Informations were uncertain, leſt it ſhould ſpread farther, they had fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a formal Writing, as under the Hand and Seal of a Perſon of Quality, with ſeveral other pretended Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Witneſſes, which was ſhewn about in ſeveral Borough-Towns, and noted places, as a Certificate to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the people that there was no ſuch Plot in <hi>England,</hi> as had been invented by divers factious and ſeditious people, to the ſcandal of divers peaceable people of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Faith in <hi>England,</hi> and that there had been no ſuch perſon murther'd as had been reported to be, and that there was not any ſuch perſon at all as Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfry,</hi> and that theſe reports were wholly falſe and all lies, raiſed by malicious and factious people, to cauſe uproars in <hi>England,</hi> and to diſquiet the peace of the King and Kingdom, and ſuch like ſtuff: which I hear has done them notable ſervice to take off the credit of the report of this horrid Plot, among the ignorant and vulgar people: but, as I hear, ſome have ſent Letters purpoſely to the Recorder of <hi>London</hi> to be certified of the Truth of this.</p>
            <p>Beſides all theſe Tryals and poſitive proofs of a moſt horrid and deſperate Plot, deeply laid and vigorouſly proſecuted, whereby the Plot very manifeſtly appears to all men of ſenſe and reaſon, and they muſt be wilfully blind, or deſperately deluded, that will not give credit to what hath been ſo ſolemnly ſworn, and ſo openly made known, the Narrative publiſhed by Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> being 81. <hi>Articles,</hi> all ſworn to, and depoſed by him, before
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101854:8"/>
Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfry</hi> when alive, and ſince, before the Lords of his Majeſtie's Privy Council, doth yet more manifeſtly ſet out the grounds and manner of this Plot, the progreſs and diſcovery thereof, ſo fully, amply, and with ſo many concurrent Circumſtances, that it is the ſtrangeſt thing in the world any ſhould queſtion the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and reality of the ſame; whenas none appears that can intrap him in contradictions, or diſprove what he hath ſworn to, and when he is backt by the teſtimony of others: that yet I ſay any ſhould be ſtagger'd with the confidence and obſtinacy of a few dying Traytors, and the whiſpering perſwaſions of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> againſt the teſtimony of their own eyes and ears, againſt both ſenſe and reaſon it ſelf, 'tis ſtrange, and wonderfully ſtrange, and makes me think that they are infatuated, or ſtrangely deluded.</p>
            <p>For it is plain, that the deſign extended as well into <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> as through <hi>England;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſwears poſitively in the firſt <hi>Article,</hi> that one <hi>Wright, Ireland</hi> and <hi>Morgan</hi> were ſent into <hi>Scotland</hi> under the notion, and in the diſguiſe of Non-Conformiſt Miniſters, to preach up the Covenant, and to promote Rebellion by that means: and <hi>Artic.</hi> 11. he ſwears that Letters were ſent to <hi>S. Omars,</hi> and to <hi>Leſhee</hi> the King of <hi>France</hi> his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour, which Letters he had ſeen and read, which gave an account that their Emiſſaries in <hi>Scotland</hi> had ſtirred up the Presbyterians there into a Rebellion, and that 20000 would be in Arms if his Majeſty of <hi>France</hi> would break with the King of <hi>England.</hi> And <hi>Artic.</hi> 35. depoſes, that he was by at a Conference with the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> wherein they read the Order from the Provincial for the ſending new Meſſengers into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Combuſtions there; and this was in <hi>July</hi> laſt. And <hi>Artic.</hi> 43. he farther ſwears, that on the 5. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> two were ſent away for <hi>Scotland,</hi> the one named Father <hi>Moor,</hi> the other F. <hi>Saunders alias Brown,</hi> (for they have uſually divers names) with full inſtructions how to behave themſelves as Non-Conformiſt Miniſters, and to preach to the diſaffected <hi>Scots</hi> the neceſſity of taking up the Sword for the defence of Liberty of Conſcience: and theſe the Deponent ſaw diſpatch'd. And <hi>Artic.</hi> 74. ſwears he ſaw Letters from <hi>White</hi> the Provincial, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at <hi>S. Ontars</hi> 4. of <hi>Sept.</hi> New Style, which gave an account to <hi>Rich. Blundell,</hi> that 12 more <hi>Jeſuits</hi> of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were ſent into <hi>Scotland,</hi> by order of the General of the Society, with full inſtructions how to behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves like Non-Conformiſt Miniſters among the Presbyterian <hi>Scots;</hi> and that they had 1000 <hi>li.</hi> given them by <hi>Leſhee</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King's Confeſſour: ſo that we may eaſily perceive by what means the Rebellion of <hi>Scotland</hi> is promoted.</p>
            <p>As to <hi>Ireland,</hi> where they have a far greater intereſt, they had ſufficient means and preparations there to ſtir up the <hi>Iriſh</hi> of their own Religion, and under their thraldome and command, to Rebell. And <hi>Article</hi> 18. Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> depoſes, Letters came from the Archbiſhop of <hi>Dublin Talbot,</hi> which Letters he ſaw and read at <hi>S. Omars,</hi> bearing date <hi>Jan.</hi> 1. 1678. New Style, which gave an account how vigilant they had been in that Kingdom, to prepare the people to riſe for the defence of their Religion and Liberty, and to recover their Eſtates, and that they would open a place there to receive the King of <hi>France</hi> his Army when he ſhould think fit to land them, and adviſed them to confer with <hi>Leſhee</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King's Confeſſour about the ſame. And he farther depoſes, that Letters were thereupon ſent to <hi>Leſhee</hi> about the ſame, who returned Anſwers by the ſame Meſſengers, <hi>Nevill</hi> and <hi>Busby,</hi> one being Prefect of the Studies, and the other Procurator to the Seminary, one of which to the Rectour of <hi>S. Omars, Richard Aſhby,</hi> the Deponent ſaw, which gave an account that the Father General of the Society would contribute 800000 Crowns, to be paid in the month of <hi>June</hi> next enſuing, and that his Holineſs the Pope would not be wanting to ſupply them when they had made ſome progreſs in that glorious attempt. And <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle</hi> 21. he there depoſes, that he likewiſe ſaw Letters of <hi>Feb.</hi> 1. 1678. New Style, from <hi>Whitebread, Keines, Ireland, Micho</hi> and the reſt, to <hi>Richard Aſhby</hi> Rectour of <hi>S. Omars,</hi> to let him underſtand that they had ſent <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Morgan</hi> and <hi>F. Lovell</hi> into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to ſee how affairs ſtood in that Kingdom; and that they had inſtructions given them to incourage the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Natives to defend their Religion and Liberty; and that they carried with them 2000 <hi>li.</hi> to ſupply their preſent wants, and order to promiſe 4000 <hi>li.</hi> more in caſe there ſhould be any Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And <hi>Article</hi> 27. he farther depoſes, that in the month of <hi>April</hi> following, he ſaw the Letters which <hi>Whitebread</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in <hi>London</hi> ſent to <hi>Richard Aſhby</hi> Rectour, and thoſe of the Seminary at <hi>S. Omars;</hi> in which they gave them an account that <hi>Morgan</hi> and <hi>Lovell</hi> were returned out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who gave them to underſtand, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were ready to riſe at 10 days warning with 20000 Foot and 5000 Horſe, and would let in the Army of the <hi>French</hi> King if he would land there; and alſo that in the North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> 15000 Horſe and Foot were in a readineſs to riſe, and that they were alſo very reſolute; and alſo that there were arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Commiſſions from the General of the Society, by virtue of a Brief from the <hi>Pope,</hi> dated <hi>Oct.</hi> 1. 1673. to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral perſons, and that they once more reſolved to cut the throats of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> when they ſhould riſe.</p>
            <p>Thus we may perceive what proviſion they had made, and how well prepared they were in thoſe Kingdoms, to effect their horrid Plot and Conſpiracy: but that they might leave no ſtone unturn'd, and that they might every-where work the deſtruction of the Proteſtants, I find <hi>Artic.</hi> 38. Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſwears, that he ſaw and read at Mr. <hi>Fenwick</hi>'s Chamber in <hi>London,</hi> on the 11. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> Letters from <hi>S. Omars,</hi> from the Provincial <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread,</hi> that he had ordered 12 <hi>Jeſuits</hi> to goe to <hi>Holland,</hi> to inform the <hi>Dutch</hi> privately, that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> did intend to aſſume the Crown, and to be their King, and to bring them under his Government: which was to beget an evil opinion of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> in the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and ſo to cauſe a commotion againſt the Prince and his Party. Alſo <hi>Artic.</hi> 56. he farther depoſes, that the Letters came from the ſaid <hi>Whitebread</hi> and the reſt, to <hi>John Fenwick</hi> and the reſt; which Letters he alſo ſaw and read dated 20. <hi>Aug.</hi> New Style, which gave account that the 12 <hi>Jeſuits</hi> were ſafely arrived in <hi>Holland,</hi> and were uſing all their skill and intereſt to make a Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there; and that <hi>Appletree Will</hi> (by which they meant the Prince) ſhould not be great there, urging the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in <hi>London</hi> to mind their buſineſs.</p>
            <p>By all this you may perceive the general ruine of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> was laid, and the large extent of this Plot. Three Kingdoms at once were to be in a Flame, and the Neighbouring Provinces to be put into a Combuſtion.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101854:9"/>
But this Plot had been ſeveral years a hatching, and if Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſwears truth, (as there is no ſcruple to be raiſed but he does, for ought I can ſee by any objection raiſed againſt him) we now know the manner and Authours of the great and famous Fire of <hi>London</hi> 1666. for <hi>Artic.</hi> 34. he depoſes, that he had it from the mouth of <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Strange,</hi> who had been Provincial of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> who told him, that this Fire had been ſeveral times at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted by him and others in the years 1664, and 1665. being aſſiſted by one <hi>Green,</hi> and 8 others, under the notion of Fifth Monarchy men; but that failing, and ſome of them being laid in <hi>Newgate,</hi> they deſiſted till 1666. when they fully effected it by his means, and by the aſſiſtence of <hi>Gray, Pennington</hi> and <hi>Barton Jeſuits,</hi> and <hi>Keimaſh</hi> a <hi>Dominican Frier,</hi> with one <hi>Fitz-Girald</hi> an <hi>Iriſh Jeſuite,</hi> and one <hi>Neal</hi> of <hi>White-Chappel,</hi> and 50 or 60 <hi>Iriſh-</hi>men, hired for that purpoſe to ply the work, and ſling about the Fire-Balls; and that one <hi>Everard</hi> kept them for them, being one then in the King's Service, and look'd after the Ammunition that was carrying down to the Fleet in the <hi>Dutch</hi> War. That this <hi>Strange</hi> went then by the name of <hi>Walker,</hi> and lay in <hi>Fanchurch-ſtreet,</hi> and with him lay <hi>Keimaſh</hi> the <hi>Dominican;</hi> that <hi>Pennington</hi> and <hi>Barton</hi> lay in <hi>Shoe-lane,</hi> and that <hi>Gray</hi> and <hi>Fitz-Girald</hi> lay at <hi>Neal</hi>'s houſe in <hi>White Chappell,</hi> which <hi>Neal</hi> was one that was to ſee the Fire carried along <hi>Thames-ſtreet:</hi> and alſo that as ſoon as the Fire was begun, the ſaid <hi>Neal</hi> knockt them up, and gave them notice about 12 a clock in the night, and that there were in all about 80 or 86 perſons employed in the ſervice, and that 700 Fire-Balls were ſpent in the ſervice; and alſo that they had others, both men and women, who were employed to plunder, and that they got in Jewels, Plate, Fine Linens, Money, and other things to the value of 14000 <hi>li.</hi> and that they had a Ware-houſe in <hi>Wild-ſtreet</hi> to lay up ſuch goods, with many other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars: ſo that you may now ſee by what means that famous Fire was effected.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Artic.</hi> 49. the ſame Deponent ſwears, that he had it from <hi>John Grove</hi>'s own mouth, in <hi>Wild-Houſe</hi> Garden, that he with 3 <hi>Iriſh</hi> men, having purpoſely prepared certain Fire-Works, went into the <hi>Borough</hi> of <hi>Southwark,</hi> where finding an Oyl-Shop, they ſet it on Fire, and that they had among them 1000 <hi>li.</hi> reward, that theſe <hi>Iriſh-</hi>men were procured by Dr. <hi>Fogarthy,</hi> and that they got 2000 <hi>li.</hi> by that Fire; the ſame being alſo told to the Deponent at another time by <hi>Richard Strange.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is not ſufficient, they had deſigned another general Fire, as the Deponent ſwears, <hi>Artic.</hi> 71. that one <hi>Blundell,</hi> that was engaged in this Conſpiracy, ſhewed him in <hi>Fenwick</hi>'s Chamber a draught of <hi>London,</hi> and the manner how it was to be fired anew, and to be carried on from <hi>Wapping</hi> to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> or from <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to <hi>Wapping,</hi> according as the wind ſate, and named the ſeveral parties, who were to carry it on from place to place; and that the Deponent, with 7 others, had order to ply the buſineſs about the <hi>Armitage,</hi> and for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he was to have 1000 <hi>li.</hi> and 80 <hi>li.</hi> more for former ſervices; and this paper was ſigned by <hi>Whitebread</hi> in the name of the whole Society. And <hi>Artic.</hi> 77. he ſwears, that <hi>Richard Blundell,</hi> after that the Deponent had begun to be diſcovered to deſert them, was appointed to ſupply his place, and to take care of carrying on the Fire at <hi>Wapping</hi> in his room.</p>
            <p>Theſe muſt be very ſtrange and formal inventions of Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> his framing, or horrid and black deſigns of theſe mens effecting; and certainly it appears by all the agreeing Circumſtances that the latter is true, and that there appears nothing to make the firſt likely, but the ſtout denial of thoſe who ſuffer'd for the ſame. <hi>Artic.</hi> 28. he ſwears, that to the number of 50 <hi>Jeſuits</hi> met at the Conſult at the <hi>White-horſe</hi> Tavern in the <hi>Strand,</hi> being on purpoſe called by <hi>Whitebread,</hi> for the effecting this Plot and horrid Conſpiracy, now brought almoſt to an head; and that from thence they all adjourned to ſeveral Clubs, or private Meetings, at their ſeveral Chambers. And <hi>Artic.</hi> 72. he depoſes, that the Pope had iſſued out a Bull, ſhewed to him the 30. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and bearing date in <hi>November</hi> or <hi>December</hi> before, wherein he diſpoſes of ſeveral dignitaries in <hi>England,</hi> and there are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the ſeveral <hi>Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Abbats, Deans, &amp;c.</hi> He alſo gives you a liſt of the chief of the Conſpiratours <hi>pag.</hi> 58. both of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and the other Orders of <hi>Prieſts,</hi> Secular and Lay perſons, both in <hi>England</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas, concerned in this moſt horrid Conſpiracy: and alſo <hi>pag.</hi> 61. gives you a liſt of the ſeveral Lords, and other Commanders or general Officers, Colonels, Captains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Militia, making a full and ample diſcovery of the ſame, to the great ſatisfaction of all people, excepting thoſe that are wilfully blind; and no doubt to the great trouble and conſternation of the Conſpirators. And indeed it was no wonder, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial <hi>Whitebread</hi> was ſo very angry and enraged againſt him, as he depoſes <hi>Artic.</hi> 77. and that when they had begun to ſuſpect Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> upon the firſt noiſe of the diſcovery of a Plot, he ask'd him with what face he could look on him having betrayed them, and box'd him and caned him in his paſſion, having thereupon taken an order for the ſending him the Deponent immediately beyond the Seas to ſecure him; which they had done, had he not hid himſelf out of the way, and been ſecured ever ſince from their Clutches. 'Tis very ſtrange that after all this, any, in <hi>England</hi> eſpecially, ſhall openly ſay, and ſeem to averr, that this is no Plot, but a feigned thing and Chimaera.</p>
            <p>But it is too manifeſt, and you ought to give God thanks, and ſolemnly to acknowledge his great care and mercy to your Nation, Government, and Religion; and alſo to reward thoſe who have been the inſtruments of this diſcovery, what-ever they were before, <hi>for by ſin grace doth abound.</hi> Much bloud and many murthers have been prevented, which it is plain they intended; for otherwiſe they could not have effected their deſign: and more eſpecially the Death of his Sacred Majeſty was aimed at and contrived by theſe wicked and execrable men, as appears by theſe Depoſitions of Mr. <hi>Oates;</hi> and they had contrived ſeveral ways to doe it, either to Stab him, Shoot him, or Poiſon him. For the firſt they had choſen <hi>Conyers</hi> and <hi>Anderton, Benedictine Monks,</hi> and four <hi>Iriſh</hi> Ruſſians; for the ſecond <hi>Groves</hi> and <hi>Pickering</hi> are prepared; and for the laſt <hi>Wakeman</hi> is hired. <hi>Artic.</hi> 13. the Deponent ſwears, he ſaw and read the Letter from <hi>Whitebread</hi> and others the chief of the Society, wherein they gave order that Father <hi>Leſhee</hi> ſhould be wrote to, and informed, that they were reſolved, for the advancement of their happy deſign, to find an opportunity to take the King from his Kingdom: or if they could not do that,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101854:9"/>
they would take his Kingdom from him. And <hi>Artic.</hi> 29. not long after the great Conſult at <hi>London</hi> about murthering the King, <hi>Whitebread</hi> being then come to <hi>S. Omars,</hi> he the Deponent heard him ſay in his Chamber on the 11. of <hi>June</hi> to this effect, That he hoped to ſee the King laid faſt enough, for that he was grown ſecure, and would hear no complaints againſt them. <hi>Artic.</hi> 68. Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> likewiſe ſwears, that <hi>Conyers</hi> employed by theſe Jeſuits to ſtab the King, ſhewed the Deponent the Dagger which he had bought on purpoſe to effect it, and coſt him 10 <hi>s.</hi> declaring the manner how he intended to effect it at <hi>Windſor;</hi> and (mark the great Providence of God in preſerving the Life of His Majeſty) that being on his way thither, with this bloudy deſign in his heart, his Horſe fell lame, that he was forced to return, being almoſt five miles on his way. The ſeveral other attempts upon the Life of His Sacred Majeſty by <hi>Groves, Pickering,</hi> and the <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> and the intention of <hi>Wakeman,</hi> and reward, to poiſon him, were ſpoke to before, and ſufficiently evidenced.</p>
            <p>Thus having given you at large an account of my Thoughts concerning this horrid Plot and bloudy Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, with the reaſons and proofs that appeared ſufficient to convince me, and to make me believe that theſe Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors that have ſuffered were guilty, and juſtly deſerved the puniſhment the Laws inflicted upon them for the ſame, and which has in ſome meaſure convinced others, who have ſeen and read them; I ſhall conclude with my Prayers for the proſperity of the King and the whole Nation, that the one may enjoy an happy Peace, Liberty and Proſperity; and that the other may continue with long life and all manner of felicity; and that the care and providence of Heaven will protect them both from all evil Conſpiratours, and wicked Plotters; and that God will work upon the hearts of ſome of thoſe who are yet in Priſon for this Conſpiracy, and e're it be too late, cauſe them to make a generous and free Confeſſion of the whole deſign, that the world may be better ſatisfied, and that there may be no ſcruple left of the verity of theſe things. And I alſo hope it will be the care of the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> when they meet, to goe on with their good intention of ſecuring the Nation for the time to come, and the Perſon of His Sacred Majeſty, from the Machinations and Conſpiracies of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and their Emiſſaries; by not onely reviving all the poenal Laws in that Caſe, but by making others that may give a certain ſecurity to the Peace of the Nation. I will not ſtand to beg your pardon, ſince your commands drew on you the trouble of this long Letter; and therefore I ſhall onely tell you, that I am,</p>

            <head>An <hi>APPENDIX</hi> to the foregoing Letter.</head>
            <p>THE foregoing Letter being wrote and received before the Trials of the five <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> laſt executed upon the account of the horrid Plot and Conſpiracy, and of Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> for the ſame, and being thought by ſome judicious perſons, and lovers of the peace and welfare of their Country, fitting to be publiſhed for the ſatisfaction of the people; the ſtrange obſtinacy and denial of theſe five <hi>Jeſuits, Whitebread, Harcourt, Fenwick, Gawin,</hi> and <hi>Turner,</hi> at their Execution, calling God and Angels to witneſs of their innocency, and taking it upon their ſalvation, that they were falſly accuſed, and knew nothing of any ſuch Plot as is pretended againſt them, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made a ſtrange impreſſion upon the minds of ſome ignorant, and ſome well-minded people, who cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they could go out of the world with ſuch a lie in their mouths, to the damnation of their Souls, I thought it requiſite to abbreviate alſo the Trials of theſe men, that the truth may appear, that they had a juſt, equal, and legal Trial; and that they could not be guiltleſs and unknowing of this horrid Plot, as they pretend, but were legally and by full proof condemned for the ſame: for that many people will not go to the price of their Trials, that would however give ſix-pence to be ſatisfied. And therefore I ſhall follow the ſame method my Friend at <hi>S. Omars</hi> did in the foregoing Trials, and point out to the plain proof and evidence in the printed Trials more fully expreſſed. But I alſo advertiſe, that here you ſhall find ſome evidence that has ſince come to light, and has made things yet more apparent.</p>
            <p>Firſt, take notice that theſe Prieſts and Jeſuits are not tried upon the Statute of 27 <hi>Eliz.</hi> which would have made them guilty for being in Orders, and remaining here in <hi>England;</hi> but they are tried as Traytors in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring the death of the King's Majeſty, and the utter ſubverſion of the Proteſtant Religion, and the bringing in of Popery, which was the end of this great Plot: and now judge how it is proved againſt them.</p>
            <p>The Evidences are long and tedious, but the main proof and what is poſitive appears, firſt againſt Mr. <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread pag.</hi> 12. where Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſwears, that in <hi>April</hi> 1678. Old Style, or <hi>May</hi> New Style, according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the ſaid <hi>Whitebread</hi> Provincial, there was a Conſult, in which were <hi>Whitebread, Fenwick, Harcourt</hi> and <hi>Turner;</hi> and that all theſe did in his preſence ſign the reſolve for the death of the King. Againſt theſe four he ſwears poſitively: and that <hi>Whitebread</hi> ſhould ſay after he was returned to <hi>S. Omars,</hi> in the Deponent's hearing, words to this effect, That he hoped to ſee the King's Head laid faſt enough. And <hi>pag.</hi> 16. he ſwears, that <hi>Fenwick</hi> on the 25. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> (78.) at his Chamber in <hi>London,</hi> did deliver Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſome money for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary charges, and did then admoniſh him to procure ſome Maſſes to be ſaid for a proſperous ſucceſs upon the Deſign. Then <hi>pag.</hi> 22. he ſwears, that <hi>Turner</hi> was at the Conſult in <hi>Fenwick</hi>'s Chamber in <hi>London,</hi> and that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101854:10"/>
there he ſaw him ſign the reſolve of the King's Death. And <hi>pag.</hi> 15. he ſwears againſt <hi>Gawen,</hi> that though he did not ſee him at the Conſult in <hi>April,</hi> yet he ſaw his hand, and makes it out how he knew it to be his hand, and that he gave them in <hi>London</hi> an account how affairs ſtood in <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> and <hi>Shropſhire July</hi> 1678. and how the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> was very diligent, and how proſperous their affairs were in thoſe Countries, and that there was two or three thouſand pound ready there to carry on the deſign; and farther ſwears, that ſometime in <hi>July</hi> he met <hi>Gawen</hi> at Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi>'s Chamber in <hi>London,</hi> where he gave to Father <hi>Ireland</hi> the ſame account as he had before written, in his hearing.</p>
            <p>The next thing I obſerve is a new Evidence, one Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> whom the priſoners do not endeavour to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatter as they had done Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Bedlow:</hi> and this man had no knowledge or acquaintance with Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> and <hi>Bedlow,</hi> and could not conſpire with them to take away the Lives of men that were innocent. You will ſee how far he agrees with them, and what a poſitive proof he is againſt the priſoners. <hi>Pag.</hi> 22. Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſwears againſt <hi>Whitebread,</hi> that he ſaw a Letter from him to Mr. <hi>Ewers</hi> a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> and Confeſſour to Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> in which he gave him a caution, to be ſure to chuſe thoſe that were trully and reſolute, no matter whether they were Gentlemen, if ſtout and couragious: and then ſhews how he knew it to be <hi>Whitebread</hi>'s hand. And this he ſwears too again, that he ſaw the words in expreſs terms under his hand <hi>pag.</hi> 29. to kill the King. Againſt <hi>Gawen</hi> he ſwears poſitively, that he entertained him to be of the Conſpiracy to murther the King, as one of thoſe reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute fellows mentioned by <hi>Whitebread.</hi> And <hi>pag.</hi> 23. he ſwears. that they had ſeveral Conſultations in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in ſeveral places which he names, and particularly at <hi>Boſcobel,</hi> for the murthering of the King and the bringing in of <hi>Popery;</hi> (this ſure proves the Plot) in which <hi>Gawen</hi> was a chief Oratour to perſwade people into this deſign. Another meeting to this purpoſe he ſwears was at <hi>Tixal,</hi> where <hi>Gawen</hi> alſo was in <hi>Septemb.</hi> 1678. and that the Conſult then was, for the introducing of Popery, and the taking away the Life of the King: and that he being a perſon choſen for that purpoſe, was to be ſent to <hi>London</hi> by Mr. <hi>Harcourt,</hi> to be under the tui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one <hi>Parſons;</hi> and that Mr. <hi>Gawen</hi> diſcourſed of it to him, and incouraged him in it, <hi>pag.</hi> 24. And that he had given them 400 <hi>li.</hi> for the carrying on of this deſign, and to pray for his Soul; and that he had promiſed them 100 <hi>li.</hi> more, for which they told him he ſhould be canoniz'd a Saint. And that this diſcourſe of killing the King, and introducing Popery, was in the Parlour in the Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s Houſe, and in <hi>Ewers</hi> Chamber. And <hi>pag.</hi> 25. Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> farther ſwears, he heard them diſcourſe at one of theſe Conſults, that it was the opinion of thoſe at <hi>Paris,</hi> who were concerned in this Conſpiracy, that as ſoon as the deed was done, that is the killing the King, they ſhould lay it on the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> that they might by that means provoke the other Proteſtants to cut them off, and then they might the more eaſily cut their throats; and that they ſhould have an Army in readineſs to cut off all ſuch as were not (or would not be) Papiſts: and alſo that Mr. <hi>Gawen</hi> ſhould tell him, neither men nor money ſhould be wanting from beyond the Seas, and endeavoured by ſeveral Arguments to prove the deſign lawfull; and alſo, by Scripture, that it was lawfull and good to deſtroy any for the advantage of their Religion; and ſhewed the example of Father <hi>Garnet,</hi> and how that ſeveral of his Reliques beyond Sea had done great Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. And <hi>pag.</hi> 26. he ſwears, that he had intercepted and read (for their Letters came under his Cover) an 100 Letters to the ſame purpoſe, all tending to the introducing Popery and the killing the King.</p>
            <p>And now I am to take notice to you of a moſt clear and manifeſt evidence, that Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfry</hi> was murthered by the knowledge and contrivance of theſe men, and which till now never came to light, and proves it as plain as the Sun at Noon: for <hi>pag.</hi> 26. the ſame Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſwears, that on the <hi>Monday</hi> next after the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfry,</hi> he received a Letter directed to Mr. <hi>Ewers</hi> the <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> being in the Countrey, and which Letter came from <hi>London</hi> by the <hi>Saturday-</hi>nights Poſt, the ſame night Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfry</hi> was murthered, from Mr. <hi>Harcourt,</hi> ſigned <hi>W. H.</hi> his uſual mark, and that he knew his hand; in which Letter theſe words were wrote, <hi>This night Sir</hi> Edmundbury Godfry <hi>is diſpatch'd:</hi> and that then, he the Deponent ſhould ſay to <hi>Ewers,</hi> that very thing would overthrow their deſign: and this was three days before any in <hi>London</hi> (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thoſe privy to the murther) could tell what was become of this Knight: ſo as the thing is plain <hi>Harcourt</hi> knew of it. Then to prove this is none of <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s invention, one Mr. <hi>Chetwin</hi> was ſworn, <hi>pag.</hi> 27, 28. who ſays, that being at that time in the Country near where Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> was, the next day being <hi>Tueſday Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> the 15. another Gentleman came to him, and asked him if he had any news of a Juſtice of Peace in <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> that was kill'd, for that he had heard it ſo reported at one <hi>Eld</hi>'s Houſe, by Mr. <hi>Dugdale. Chetwin</hi> replied he heard nothing of it, but that the next <hi>Saturdays</hi> Poſt brought him the news of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfry</hi>'s murther, and tells by good circumſtances how he knew it to be that very day: and alſo that he was not in Town when the murtherers of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfry</hi> were tried, or elſe he would have witneſſed the ſame. This is a clear evidence theſe men knew of this murther.</p>
            <p>Againſt <hi>Turner,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſwears <hi>pag.</hi> 30. that he ſaw him with others at <hi>Ewers</hi> his Chamber, where they conſulted together to carry on this deſign, and that he agreed to all that he had ſworn as to the Plot; that is the bringing in of Popery, and the killing of the King. Then <hi>pag.</hi> 30. Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> ſwears againſt <hi>Harcourt,</hi> that he told him ſuch a day, when he bought an Image of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> of him, to ſend into <hi>Mary-Land,</hi> that there was a deſign of killing the King. Againſt <hi>Fenwick</hi> he ſwears <hi>pag.</hi> 31. that he told him in Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi>'s Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in <hi>Ruſſel-ſtreet, Ireland</hi> and <hi>Grove</hi> being by, that there ſhould be 50000 men in a readineſs to carry on the Cauſe, and ſettle their Religion; and that he asked <hi>Fenwick</hi> who ſhould govern them, who then replied, the Lord <hi>Bellaſis,</hi> the Lord <hi>Powis,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Arundel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next witneſs is Mr. <hi>Bedlow,</hi> who gives an account why he did not before give in his evidence againſt <hi>Whitebread</hi> and <hi>Fenwick,</hi> becauſe he was then finding out the Bribery of <hi>Reading,</hi> in behalf of the Lords in the <hi>Tower.</hi> But now he poſitively ſwears <hi>pag.</hi> 32. that he had ſeen both <hi>Whitebread</hi> and <hi>Fenwick</hi> at the Conſults a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this Plot, and that he heard <hi>Whitebread</hi> tell <hi>Coleman</hi> the manner of ſending the four Ruſſians to <hi>Windſor</hi> to

kill the King, and this was in <hi>Harcourt</hi>'s Chamber; and alſo, that he ſaw <hi>Harcourt</hi> take the money out of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet, about 80. or 100 <hi>li.</hi> and give it the Meſſenger, by Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi>'s order, with a <hi>Guiny</hi> for the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger to drink <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Health, which <hi>Coleman</hi> left, as <hi>Harcourt</hi> himſelf ſaid. And <hi>pag.</hi> 33. he ſwears that <hi>Whitebread</hi> told him, that <hi>Pickering</hi> was to have a great number of Maſſes, and that <hi>Grove</hi> was to have 1500 <hi>li.</hi> for killing the King. And <hi>pag.</hi> 35. he ſwears, that <hi>Harcourt</hi> employed him ſeveral times to carry their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults beyond the Seas, and that he received, in <hi>Harcourt</hi>'s preſence, Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi>'s thanks for his fidelity, and that <hi>Harcourt</hi> recommended him to the Lord <hi>Arundel,</hi> who promiſed him great favour when the Times were turned. Alſo, that he ſaw <hi>Harcourt</hi> give Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> a Bill to receive 2000 <hi>li.</hi> in part of a greater ſum, and that he heard Sir <hi>George</hi> ſay, 15000 <hi>li.</hi> was a ſmall Reward for the ſettling Religion and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving three Kingdoms from Ruine.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the chief proofs which are punctually ſworn to, beſides ſome Letters found among <hi>Harcourt</hi>'s Papers that gave ſome light of this Deſign, and ſtrengthened the Evidence very much, which I paſs over. And in this Evidence you may obſerve, that there is the Teſtimony of three, Mr. <hi>Oates, Dugdale,</hi> and <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi> againſt <hi>Whitebread.</hi> And likewiſe three quite blank againſt <hi>Fenwick, viz. Oates, Bedlow</hi> and <hi>Prance.</hi> And againſt <hi>Harcourt,</hi> very fully four, <hi>Oates, Pugdale, Bedlow</hi> and <hi>Prance.</hi> Againſt <hi>Gawen,</hi> there is poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively <hi>Dugdale</hi> and <hi>Oates.</hi> And againſt <hi>Turner</hi> two likewiſe, <hi>Dugdale</hi> and <hi>Oates.</hi> Whereby the matter of Fact is plainly proved, and the Evidence full and legal, notwithſtanding their denial of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Now we will ſee what Defence theſe Learned men do make for themſelves: and, as my Lord Chief Juſtice ſays, they defend their Lives as they do their Religion, with weak Arguments and fallacious Reaſons, which take many times with the Ignorant, ſeldom with the Judicious. As to the matter of Fact charged againſt them, they can ſay nothing by way of diſproof, excepting their ſtout Denials; and they are not aſhamed to contradict all Oaths, how punctually ſoever ſworn to, and in the face of the Court to charge them all with Perjury, but prove nothing that can truly invalidate the Teſtimony that is brought againſt them. All they endeavour is by way of Evaſion, and to catch at circumſtances, as to Time and Place: and to diſprove Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> they came as to that prepared, as they thought, and had brought a ſmall Regiment of young Lads, well trained in their Principles, who endeavour'd to have perſwaded the Jury that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> was at <hi>S. Omar</hi>'s, at the time he ſaid he was in <hi>London,</hi> and that ſuch perſons did not come over with him as he had ſworn did. But ſuppoſing they had made this Allegation good, ſtill, I ſay, it depended upon the nice circumſtance of Time, which Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> might be miſtaken in, and yet the truth of the Plot no way invalidated, nor thoſe matters of Fact charged againſt them by the other Witneſſes any ways diſproved. But you ſhall hear their Defence, and how far they could make this Allegation good, and how well Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> has defended himſelf, and then judge.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing that <hi>Whitebread</hi> and <hi>Fenwick</hi> Object is, That they had come to a former Trial, and therefore thought, legally they ought not to anſwer for the ſame Fact, <hi>pag.</hi> 4. But the Court cleared that to them, that though Indicted they came not upon their Trial, and the Jury had them not in charge, and ſo their Lives were not in jeopardy, and that it was the conſtant courſe of the Law ſo to do, with ſeveral Reaſons and Examples for the ſame, there more fully ſhewn, <hi>pag.</hi> 5. and 6. They then pleaded, as the reſt, not Guilty. As to their Evaſions and odd Interpretations of the Letters, and their aſperſions of Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> as inſufficient Witneſſes, they are little to the purpoſe, therefore I ſhall paſs them by.</p>
            <p>The main in their Defence, is their offering to prove Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> miſtaken in point of Time; for whereas he had ſworn poſitively againſt them, that he was with them at their Conſult, wherein they determined the Death of the King, held the twenty fourth of <hi>April,</hi> old Style, in <hi>London,</hi> they allege and endeavour to prove by at leaſt ſixteen Witneſſes, young Lads of the College or Seminary at <hi>S. Omar</hi>'s, that they ſaw Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> almoſt every day there in the College, from <hi>December</hi> 1677. to the middle or latter end of <hi>June</hi> following, and that he was never out of the College, but that they ſaw him every day, and convers'd and dined with him all that time, except two days and one night he was abſent at <hi>Watton,</hi> and two or three days that he was in the <hi>Infirmary,</hi> he not being well, and that ſome of them ſaw and ſpake with him in the <hi>Infirmary;</hi> and by ſeveral circumſtances they ſeem to make all theſe Aſſeverations good. So that if this be true, and that they can perſwade the Jury to believe this Teſtimony, (as they ought, if no ways to be diſproved) they have done their work, as to Mr. <hi>Oates.</hi> And this they do <hi>pag.</hi> 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51. and ſo to <hi>pag.</hi> 63. ſo that it is impoſſible that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſhould ſwear Truth, and that he ſhould be in <hi>London</hi> the twenty fourth of <hi>April</hi> at the Conſult, if what theſe Witneſſes ſay be true, and that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> was never out of the College, till ſome time in <hi>June,</hi> from <hi>December</hi> before: and ſo his Teſtimony ought to be invalidate. Then, whereas Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> had ſworn he came over with Sir <hi>John Warner</hi> and Sir <hi>Tho. Preſton Jeſuits,</hi> they endeavour to prove, and from <hi>pag.</hi> 60. to 63. the Witneſſes do confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently aver, that the ſaid perſons were not, the one from <hi>Liege,</hi> the other from <hi>Watton</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> neither <hi>April</hi> nor <hi>May,</hi> and ſo Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> could not come over with them to <hi>England</hi> as he had ſworn.</p>
            <p>Let us now ſee how Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> doth make good his Teſtimony, and what proof he brings to contradict theſe <hi>Novices</hi> who came ſo well prepared. Firſt by the way, we muſt obſerve, that moſt of the Witneſſes ſay, that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> left their College ſome time in <hi>June,</hi> ſome ſay the tenth, ſome at the latter end, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but <hi>pag.</hi> 53. one Witneſs miſtakes his month, and avers he is ſure it was in <hi>July,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> went away: and being told that he differ'd from all the reſt, he cry'd, he was ſure he was there till after the Conſult in <hi>London;</hi> which gave a great light to what point of time theſe <hi>Novices</hi> were inſtructed to ſpeak to, and cauſed the people to laugh, to ſee the young man out in his part.</p>
            <p>But to let that paſs, we will ſee Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> his proofs, and he brings at leaſt ſeven ſubſtantial Witneſſes, who ſwear they ſaw him in <hi>London</hi> in <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May</hi> 1678. the time they aver him to be at <hi>S. Omar</hi>'s. <hi>Page</hi> 80. Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> a Miniſter ſwears, that in <hi>April</hi> (78.) he met Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> in <hi>S. Martin</hi>'s Lane diſguiſed in a Serge Coat and Gray Hat,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101854:11"/>
which he wondered at, not knowing he was turn'd <hi>Jeſuite:</hi> and the next morning he relates the ſame to one Mrs. <hi>Ives,</hi> who in Court ſwears the ſame, that in <hi>April</hi> the ſaid Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> came to her Shop and told her, that the day before he had met Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> at the upper end of <hi>Saint Martins-lane,</hi> near <hi>Leiceſter-</hi>Houſe, in diſguiſe. So that you have here one poſitive Witneſs, and a ſtrong concurrent Teſtimony. <hi>Pag.</hi> 81. Mrs. <hi>Mayo</hi> ſwears more punctually as to point of Time, that a week before <hi>Whitſuntide,</hi> or thereabouts, which was in <hi>May,</hi> ſhe ſaw Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> in Sir <hi>Richard Barker</hi>'s Court-yard in <hi>London,</hi> and that one of Sir <hi>Richard</hi>'s men told her, that it was Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and that he was either turn'd Quaker or Catholick; but that ſhe ſaid he was no Quaker, becauſe he then wore a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwig: and that about a week after ſhe ſaw him again walking in the Garden with another Gentleman: and ſwears this Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> then in Court was the ſame man ſhe had ſeen. The other young man that the knew Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> was dead. Then <hi>pag.</hi> 81. one <hi>Page</hi> ſwears that he ſaw this Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> in a Gray or Light-coloured Campaign Coat, and diſcours'd with him at Sir <hi>Richard Barker</hi>'s in <hi>May</hi> (78.) and tells a circumſtance to prove his knowledge that it was in <hi>May.</hi> Then Sir <hi>Richard Barker</hi> ſwears, that his Servants told him that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> was at his Houſe about <hi>Whitſuntide,</hi> and that he was there in two ſeveral diſguiſes, once with ſhort hair, and another time with a Perriwig, and that they thought he was turn'd either Quaker or Papiſt. Then <hi>pag.</hi> 83. Sir <hi>Richard Barker</hi>'s Coachman ſwears, he was well acquainted with Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> and that he was at Sir <hi>Richard</hi>'s Houſe in <hi>Barbican</hi> in the beginning of <hi>May</hi> (78.) with his hair cut cloſe to his ears, in Gray Cloaths and a Gray Coat, and then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him for D. <hi>Tongue;</hi> and that he knew him well for three years before, and is very ſure he in Court was the ſame man. <hi>Pag.</hi> 84. Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> Schoolmaſter at <hi>Iſlington,</hi> ſwears, that in the beginning of <hi>May</hi> 1678. he dined with him at his Houſe in <hi>Iſlington,</hi> and, as he remembers, it was the firſt Monday in <hi>May,</hi> and that he knew him well, for he had been his Scholar at <hi>Merchant-Taylours</hi> School when he was Uſher there: and that he ſtayed with him three or four hours after Dinner diſcourſing of his Travels. Then Mr. <hi>Clay</hi> ſwears, <hi>pag.</hi> 84. and 85. that he met Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> in <hi>April</hi> and afterwards in <hi>May</hi> (78.) at Mr. <hi>Howard</hi>'s, who lived in one Corner of <hi>Arundel-</hi>Houſe, and that this was the ſame man he ſaw there: and this Mr. <hi>Clay,</hi> who teſtified this, is a <hi>Roman Catholick;</hi> ſo that they are not all Proteſtants that he brings to annul their Evidence, but one of their own Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, who durſt ſpeak Truth. And now let all the world judge, whether the Jury had any reaſon to think that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> his Evidence was any ways weakened by all that thoſe <hi>Novices</hi> had averr'd, knowing that the Proteſtant Religion allows in no caſe of telling a lie, much leſs of ſwearing falſely.</p>
            <p>As to their averring, that Sir <hi>Jo. Warner</hi> and Sir <hi>Tho. Preſton</hi> were at their ſeveral places of reſidence all <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> and ſo could not come over with Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> as he had ſworn, Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what they would have inſiſted on, was not prepared with Witneſſes to back that Teſtimony: but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a matter of little or no conſequence, and they failing of making good the more ſubſtantial part of their Defence, we may well believe they alſo made a falſe Report in this latter, as well as in the former.</p>
            <p>Then Mr. <hi>Gawen pag.</hi> 63. undertakes alſo to prove that he was in the Country in <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> all <hi>April, June</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> the time of the Conſult, and the time that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> had ſworn he ſaw his hand to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult: and for this he brings ſeveral Witneſſes from <hi>pag.</hi> 63. to 69. But, whoever conſiders well what the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſays there in the Priſoners behalf, will find, that theſe Witneſſes were not ſo confident as thoſe from <hi>S. Omar</hi>'s, and that they ſpeak ſo mincingly and give ſo weak Reaſons, that in truth it appears not by what they ſay, but that Mr. <hi>Gawen</hi> might ſtep up to <hi>London,</hi> and ſign this Conſult in few days, without their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; for they cannot but ſay, he was ſometimes at the Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s: but <hi>pag.</hi> 65. Mrs. <hi>Winford</hi> ſays, ſhe knows he could not go to <hi>London,</hi> becauſe he had not his Linnen with him: and this is all the reaſon, which is a very weak one. To this Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſwears again, <hi>pag.</hi> 67. that he ſaw him in <hi>London,</hi> either in the beginning or middle of <hi>July:</hi> then Mr. <hi>Gawen</hi> brings ſeveral Witneſſes <hi>pag.</hi> 68. and 69. that indeed prove he was not in <hi>London,</hi> but at <hi>Wolverhampton</hi> the latter end of <hi>July,</hi> but as to the beginning or middle of the Month, none of them can ſpeak; ſo that the thing is plain he doth not contradict Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> his Teſtimony, for he might be in the Country all the time his Witneſſes aver, and yet be in <hi>London</hi> at the time Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> had ſworn.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>pag.</hi> 69. Mr. <hi>Whitebread</hi> offers Witneſſes to prove that D. <hi>Oates</hi> had ſworn an untruth, and therefore he was not <hi>probus Teſtis</hi> a credible Witneſs, in that he had ſworn Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> was in <hi>London</hi> the middle of <hi>Auguſt</hi> and beginning of <hi>September,</hi> which he could prove was falſe: but the Court let him know, that having already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Verdict it ought not to be heard again: yet <hi>pag.</hi> 71. they were ſo favourable as to hear his Witneſſes, though to that point; and 72, 73. to 76. ſome Witneſſes that were not at <hi>Ireland</hi>'s Tryal do aver, that Mr. <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was in <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> from the fourth to the twenty ſixth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> ſo that it could not be true what Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> had ſworn, that he was in <hi>London</hi> about the middle of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> Againſt this Evidence you have not onely D. <hi>Oates</hi> his Teſtimony upon his Oath, but alſo <hi>Sarah Pain pag.</hi> 78. and 79. appeared in Court, who there gave in the ſame Evidence ſhe had done in the former Tryal of Mr. <hi>Ireland,</hi> that ſhe ſaw Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> going into Mr. <hi>Groves</hi> his Houſe, and that ſhe made a Curtiſie to him, about the middle of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> which is the time that D. <hi>Oates</hi> charges him to be in Town. So that you have two Witneſſes on Oath, that contradict thoſe brought by the Priſoners.</p>
            <p>But ſince they have made a great talk of this Evidence, and have ſaid that they had ſeveral Witneſſes againſt two, one of them being their Accuſer, and that ſome have thought this point not ſufficiently cleared, I have for the ſatisfaction of the world here publiſhed what hath ſince come to my hands, and not at the time of the Tryals of theſe perſons known, which is a very great confirmation of the Truth of D. <hi>Oates</hi> his Teſtimony, and I hope will give much ſatisfaction.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>YOurs I had bearing date the fifteenth of this Inſtant, and have not miſſed a Poſt I could ſend to you by. I am not ignorant of the offer made by his Majeſtie's Proclamation, and lay hold of nothing but pardon for concealing what circumſtances I have known ſo long: yet did not altogether conceal it neither, for I told my Couſin</hi> Smith <hi>of it within two or three days, of the breaking out of this damnable Conſpiracy, which how much it weighs I am not ſit to judge. The ſpeaking of Truth is an Action that rewards it ſelf; and I would not, were it to gain a million, nay a million of worlds if poſſible, draw the leaſt drop of Innocent bloud upon me, for I know it is a crying ſin, therefore I pray God avert it from me. All that I can tell you, as I hope for forgiveneſs of my ſins, and eternal Salvation, is (if you will diſtinguiſh betwixt the times) what follows. Being come from</hi> Windſor, <hi>where I promiſed my ſelf the happineſs and ſatisfaction of ſeeing you, that I might take my leave before my Journey for the</hi> North, <hi>which, to the beſt of my memory, was about the latter end of</hi> Auguſt, <hi>I went to do the ſame to Mr.</hi> Ireland, <hi>whom then (with all the reſt) I did believe a man of the beſt converſation and life in the world; for you know the Law does preſume every man good, unleſs he be proved otherwiſe. After my ſalute, and I had told him I had been at</hi> Windſor, <hi>his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terragatory or Queſtion was, What News? My return was the uſual, No News but good. Then he proceeded to ask me (to the beſt of my memory) How his Sacred Majeſty and the Court diverted. I replyed, that I heard his Majeſty took much delight in Hawking and Fiſhing, but chiefly in the latter, which his Majeſty followed early in the morning, as I heard, accompanied onely with two or three Lords, or other Attendants. I wonder, ſays Mr.</hi> Ireland, <hi>why his Majeſty ſhould be ſo thin guarded, he were eaſily taken off, or removed; or ſome words to that purpoſe, ſo ſounding. God forbid, I returned. No, ſubjoyns he, I do not ſay it is lawfull; and ſomething elſe which I cannot call to mind, that did qualifie the former words, that I did then think his meaning was, he was ſorry his Sacred Majeſty ſhould go ſo weakly guarded. I then took it by that handle, having no other reaſon, for I did believe him a Saint, never hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him or any of them, as I hope for everlaſting life, defend or maintain in the leaſt that damnable Doctrine of Depoſing Kings: but now I know that paſſage may be taken by the other handle, and I'm not fit to judge how far; yet you know words are to be taken in the milder ſenſe, unleſs they be poſitive, which theſe with their qualification that followed, and the time they were ſpoke in, I humbly conceive, with ſubmiſſion to better judgments, were not; for if I had believed they were, they ſhould have ſeen light ſooner. I ſuppoſe there is clearer Evidence then this from Mr.</hi> Oates, <hi>that better knew him then I.</hi>

            <head>Some Obſervations or Remarks upon the foregoing Letter.</head>
            <p>FIrſt, the words ſpoken by Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> to Mr. <hi>Jenniſon,</hi> though then with a Plain-meaning man, and one ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of their Plot, though a Papiſt, they might receive that candid interpretation he put upon them; yet ſince it hath been made known, we may very well have a ſuſpicion that Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> made thoſe Queries in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the horrid Deſign of murthering the King, which they then expected to be effected by the four Ruffians, which made <hi>Ireland</hi> ſay, hearing how ſlenderly he was guarded, that he might then be eaſily taken off.</p>
            <p>But not to ſtrain words againſt a man, when ſuch poſitive proofs have been brought to condemn him, we bring not here this Letter ſo much to prove the Plot, as to be a very ſtrong concurrent Evidence againſt Mr. <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as to his being in <hi>London</hi> in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> which he denied, and his Evidence ſeemed to make good: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as to that I deſire you will conſider,</p>
            <p>That the King went to <hi>Windſor</hi> the thirteenth or fourteenth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> (78) as is proved by Sir <hi>Robert South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> and by Sir <hi>Tho. Dolman,</hi> at the Trials; it was indeed the fourteenth.</p>
            <p>That Mr. <hi>Jenniſon</hi> in his Letter writes thus, Being come from <hi>Windſor,</hi> I went to take my leave of Mr. <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> before I took my Journey into the North: and Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> asked, What news from <hi>Windſor?</hi> How does the King paſs his time, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> which notoriouſly proves that his diſcourſe with <hi>Ireland</hi> was, when the King was at <hi>Windſor,</hi> and after Mr. <hi>Jenniſon</hi> came from thence, and before he went into the North, to wit, betwixt the nineteenth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> and the fourth of <hi>September,</hi> and implies that it was immediately after his coming from
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101854:12"/>
               <hi>Windſor</hi> by the Queſtion, What news from thence? And it is the more likely that it was immediately after, becauſe Mr. <hi>Jenniſon</hi> himſelf ſays, he is ſure it was a good while before he went into the <hi>North.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this time nearly agrees with <hi>Sarah Pain</hi>'s Teſtimony at <hi>Ireland</hi>'s Trial. See the Trial, <hi>fol.</hi> 57.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Ireland</hi> was try'd the ſeventeenth of <hi>December</hi> (78.) and Mr. <hi>Jenniſon</hi>'s Letter was writ from <hi>Reading</hi> in <hi>Berks</hi> (whither he was gone in obedience to the Proclamation, being a Papiſt then, but has ſince Conform'd) the nineteenth following, ſo that he could not then have any knowledge of that Trial, or of what <hi>Ireland</hi> had inſiſted upon.</p>
            <p>That when Mr. <hi>Jenniſon</hi> wrote this Letter, he was under an apprehenſion that he had offended, and was in danger for having concealed <hi>Ireland</hi>'s diſcourſe, of the eaſineſs of taking off the King at <hi>Windſor,</hi> which ſeems to be the main occaſion of his writing that Letter to his Friend in nature of a Confeſſion.</p>
            <p>I need ſay no more, for I queſtion not but that all the world will ſay this is a very great concurrent Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and ſtrengthening to the King's Evidence, as to that point of Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi>'s being in <hi>London,</hi> notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding what the <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> Witneſſes had ſaid in the Priſoner's behalf. And as to the verity of this you may be eaſily informed, Mr. <hi>Jenniſon</hi> being a known perſon, and one of credit and reputation.</p>

Mr. <hi>Gawen</hi> ſtarts a point of Law, whether as to himſelf he may be legally condemned for Treaſon, being accuſed for one thing in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> and for another thing in <hi>London,</hi> ſo that there is but one Witneſs to either. But the Court cleared this point to him by Sir <hi>Hen. Vanes</hi> Caſe, and <hi>pag.</hi> 88. told him that the Law was ſettled therein, and that they two, though they were Witneſſes to two ſeveral acts done, in two ſeveral places, yet it was to the ſame Treaſon. For <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſwears to his killing the King, altering the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and bringing in of Popery; and <hi>Oates</hi> ſwears he ſaw his hand to the Conſult, which was for the ſame Treaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> for the Murther of the King, raiſing an Army, and the bringing in of Popery, which is the ſame Treaſon: ſo that it was plain there were two Witneſſes againſt him, and his Plea not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
            <p>This is the whole ſubſtance of their Defence and what they have to ſay for themſelves. I need not uſe any Arguments to ſhew the weakneſs of it, 'tis obvious to all that reade or hear their Trials. And as to the matter of Fact which is ſo punctually ſworn againſt them, they can ſay nothing, but onely their own conſtant denials of their Guilt, and aſſeverations of their Innocency: but how far that will prevail with impartial men, I ſhall leave themſelves to judge: but I am ſure there were twelve men of one mind, that thought them guilty, and I am confident that there are twelve thouſand of the ſame opinion, and that all thoſe who ſay to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, muſt ſpeak it out of Ignorance or Prejudice.</p>
            <p>As to the proofs againſt Mr. <hi>Langhorn,</hi> you will find them very home and poſitive: and firſt <hi>pag.</hi> 6. and 7. Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> is brought to prove the Plot in general, which he again ſwears to as to their ſeveral Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and deſign of murthering the King, and maſſacring the Proteſtants, and bringing in of Popery: to which alſo Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> concurs. Then as to the particular Charge againſt Mr. <hi>Langhorn,</hi> Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſwears <hi>pag.</hi> 10. that he carried ſeveral Letters from Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> to perſons beyond the Seas, in one of which he ſaw under his own hand, <hi>That now they had a fair opportunity to begin and give the blow,</hi> with many other expreſſions plain enough concerning the Plot; and theſe he ſaw ſigned <hi>Richard Langhorn:</hi> and then he farther ſwears, that he had Orders from the Provincial to give Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> an account of the Reſolutions and paſſages that were form'd and done at this Conſult of the twenty fourth of <hi>April,</hi> and that he gave him an account of the ſame, and of their Reſolution of killing the King; and that the ſaid <hi>Langhorn</hi> lift up his hands and eyes, and pray'd to God to give to it a good ſucceſs. Then <hi>pag.</hi> 11. he ſwears he ſaw in his Chamber, in the <hi>Inner-Temple,</hi> lying on the ſide of his Desk, certain Commiſſions, which he had heard to have been ſent over to him for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral perſons in <hi>England,</hi> which they called Patents; and that upon Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> his deſire to ſee them, he permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to peruſe ſeveral of them, which he did, and there ſaw one Commiſſion to the Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> of <hi>Wardour,</hi> and another to the Lord <hi>Powis,</hi> the one to be <hi>Lord High Chancellour,</hi> the other to be <hi>Lord High Treaſurer of England,</hi> and to the Lord <hi>Bellaſis</hi> to be <hi>General,</hi> to the Lord <hi>Peters</hi> to be <hi>Lieutenant-General,</hi> and one for Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> to be <hi>Secretary of State,</hi> and for Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> himſelf to be <hi>Advocate of the Army:</hi> and that theſe were ſigned <hi>Johannes Paulus de Oliva,</hi> by virtue of a Brief granted by the Pope. Theſe Commiſſions were ſigned with the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> mark. And that Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> told him he had ſent one of theſe Commiſſions by his Son, to be delivered to the Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> of <hi>Wardour</hi>'s Son, and that it was delivered. And <hi>pag.</hi> 13. he ſwears, that Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> being employed as Solicitour for ſeveral of the Fathers of the Society, that upon his ſolicitation of the <hi>Benedictine</hi> Monks, they had promiſed him 6000 <hi>li.</hi> for the carrying on of the Cauſe, and that Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> promiſed in his hearing, to do his utmoſt for the procuring the ſaid money. And alſo, that he was much diſguſted with Sir <hi>George Wakeman,</hi> becauſe he was not contented with 10000 <hi>li.</hi> to poiſon the King: and <hi>pag.</hi> 14. he ſwears that Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> call'd the ſaid Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> a covetous man, and that ſince it was a publick concern, it was no matter if he had done it for nothing, but that he was a narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirited and narrow-ſoul'd Phyſician. Then an Inſtrument being produced in Court, ſigned by <hi>Paulus de Oliva,</hi> Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſwore that the Commiſſions he ſaw were ſigned by the ſame hand, and had all the ſame mark: but they were all convey'd away, and this being onely concerning an Eccleſiaſtical buſineſs was left; however, this ſhews he uſed to receive Patents from, and had Commerce with the Superiour of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in <hi>Rome.</hi> And this was found in Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi>'s Chamber a long time after Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> had given in his Teſtimony.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>pag.</hi> 19. Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> ſwears, he went with Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> to Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi>'s Chamber, and there Mr. <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> gave him his Letters to <hi>Le Cheſe,</hi> and to the Pope's <hi>Nuntio,</hi> and to others, open, to reade, and to regiſter in a Book by him kept for that purpoſe; and that he ſaw Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> reade theſe Letters, which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101854:12"/>
the deſign they had in hand, and that he regiſtred them in a Book in his Cloſet, whilſt he and Mr. <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> walked in the outer Room, and that afterwards <hi>Coleman</hi> ſealed up theſe Letters, and gave them to Mr. <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi> who was to carry them to <hi>Le Cheſe,</hi> the King of <hi>France</hi> his Confeſſour; and that ſome of the expreſſions in thoſe Letters were, <hi>That all things were now in a readineſs, and that they onely wanted money: That the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks were now in ſafety, and that all places and offices had been diſpoſed to them, and that all the Garriſons were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in their hands, or would be put into their hands ſuddenly: And that now they had a fair opportunity, having a King ſo eaſy to believe what was dictated to him by their party; and that if they miſt the opportunity, they might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of ever introducing Popery into</hi> England. This was the effect of moſt of the Letters, and with them Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> was made acquainted, and regiſter'd them in a Book. <hi>Pag.</hi> 20. he ſwears he brought Letters from <hi>Harcourt</hi> to Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> to be regiſter'd, which Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> receiv'd, and regiſter'd accordingly; for he wrote by him to <hi>Harcourt,</hi> that he had receiv'd the Letters by Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> (which was the name that <hi>Bedlow</hi> then went by) and that he would tranſcribe them, and return them to him again. Now theſe Letters were one of them declared to be from the Rectour of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Colledge at <hi>Salamanca,</hi> which ſpecified that the Lord <hi>Bellaſts,</hi> and the reſt of the Lords concerned, and the whole party ſhould be in a readineſs; and to have it communicated with all expedition: for that they had ſent ſome <hi>Iriſh</hi> Caſhier'd Souldiers, with many other Lay-Brothers, under the notion of Pilgrims for <hi>S. Jago,</hi> who were to take ſhipping at the <hi>Groin,</hi> and to land at <hi>Milford-Haven</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> and there to meet and join with the Lord <hi>Powis.</hi> The other Letter was from Sir <hi>William Godolphin,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> had brought out of <hi>Spain,</hi> directed to the Lord <hi>Bellaſis,</hi> which was about the ſame deſign, and was alſo regiſter'd by Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> in a Book which he ſaw near 3 inches thick, and that he gueſſes two thirds of the Book might be wrote out.</p>
            <p>Now by this judge you whether the Indictment of High Treaſon be not proved againſt Mr. <hi>Langhorn,</hi> and whether he be not guilty of this Treaſon and Conſpiracy of bringing in Popery, of levying War, and killing the King, by two ſeveral witneſſes, who have ſo poſitively ſworn it againſt him.</p>
            <p>The defence Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> makes for himſelf, is no other then what his Brethren in Iniquity had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, to deny the fact, and to endeavour to invalidate the credit of the Witneſſes, by intrapping them in point of time and place. And to this end <hi>pag.</hi> 14, 15, 16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he asks Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> many queſtions little to the purpoſe, and onely to amuſe the Auditours. Then <hi>pag.</hi> 27. he would make Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> an Approver, as having been pardoned for the ſame Crime; and that the witneſſes had received rewards and gratifications for ſwearing againſt them: thus making no defence as to the matter of Fact, onely endeavouring to ſupport themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the incompetency of the Witneſſes. But all theſe objections or cavillings were well anſwered by my Lord Chief Juſtice, who let him know, that unleſs he could prove any reward to be given by contract or ſubornation, it could not make an objection if there were any given, for that allowance or ſuſtenance was uſually given of old to Approvers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next thing Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> endeavours, is to invalidate Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> his teſtimony, by making him to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſworn in point of time; and he brings the ſame witneſſes from <hi>S. Omars,</hi> as were brought in the behalf of the five Jeſuits the day before, to prove he was at <hi>S. Omars April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> and ſo could not be in <hi>London;</hi> and they being the ſame evidence, and ſwearing to the ſame point, we will not repeat them: onely take notice, that one of them <hi>pag.</hi> 33. being asked how he came to take more notice of Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> being at <hi>S. Omars</hi> all <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> and not in <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July</hi> as well, anſwers plainly, (not being well inſtructed, or more ſimple then the reſt) that it was becauſe the queſtion he came for did not fall upon that time, which ſtill gives more light to the ſuſpicion, that they came with their Leſſons in their mouths to ſave the Lives of theſe men, and not to ſpeak truth. But to confront theſe witneſſes, Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> produced in Court the ſame that had the day before ſworn they had ſeen him in <hi>London</hi> both in <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> ſo that he ſufficiently clear'd his teſtimony by 7 Witneſſes.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>pag.</hi> 46. Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> produces the Woman that kept the White-horſe Tavern, where Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> had ſaid the Conſult was held, and ſhe averrs that there is no Room in her Houſe would hold above a dozen, and that therefore there could not meet 50 or 18 or 20 perſons there at a time. To anſwer this three ſeveral Witneſſes ſtrangers ſtood up in Court, and being ſworn atteſted, the firſt, that he knew ſixteen to Dine often in one Room of that Houſe: the ſecond, that he knew two Rooms, one backward, the other forward, where thirty might Dine at a time: and the third, that at a Wedding he knew of above twenty that Dined together in one Room next the Street. So that this Evidence did Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> no kindneſs: for ſhe that was ſo peremptory in this falſhood, might give a ſuſpicion that the reſt of his witneſſes might be falſe in their averrments.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>pag.</hi> 57. Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> goes about to prove by ſeveral witneſſes, that Sir <hi>Tho. Preſton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Poole,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Warner</hi> did not come over with Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> as he had atteſted, and this reſts indeed on Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> his ſingle teſtimony; but this being onely circumſtantial, and not any way contradictory to the matter of Fact, it ought not, nor could not legally invalidate his evidence: For it is not much to the purpoſe, whether Sir <hi>John Warner,</hi> Sir <hi>Tho. Preſton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> came over with Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> or no; or if he did commit any miſtake therein, theſe men not being indicted: but it had been more then a circumſtantial matter, to have proved Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> to have been actually at <hi>S. Omars</hi> the time of the Conſult, the 24. of <hi>April,</hi> and would have ſtuck againſt him, had he not well clear'd that matter by 7 ſubſtantial witneſſes, who have ſworn they ſaw him in <hi>London</hi> about the ſame time. So that all this conſider'd, I think there is none, except he be much prejudic'd, who reads theſe, but will judge Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> to have had a fair Trial, and that the Jury proceeded to find him guilty of Treaſon by the plain proof and teſtimony of two witneſſes, back'd by other circumſtances, among which, the Letter found amongſt <hi>Harcourt</hi>'s papers was one, that proved the Conſult to be the ſame time, and clearly hints alſo the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to be of the ſame nature, as Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> had ſworn it to be.</p>
            <p>I think there is none that truely conſiders the fair Trials of theſe wicked Conſpiratours, and juſtly weighs
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101854:13"/>
every thing that hath been proved againſt them, that will think theſe men innocent, or that there hath not been a moſt horrid and helliſh deſign amongſt them, which they have not yet given over, and which we yet hope God will more fully diſcover and bring to light in mercy to this Nation, and for the glory of his Name. Will you ſtill be wilfully blind, and will you ſhut your eyes againſt all this clear light, and cry it is no Plot? Do not you ſee them ſtill endeavouring to Fire the City, as witneſs thoſe Servants hired by <hi>Stubbs,</hi> as hath been mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly made known, and almoſt miraculouſly prevented? Do they not ſtill go on in their wicked deſign againſt the Life of His Sacred Majeſty? and will you have your throats cut ere you will believe? Shall the ſtout denials of thoſe that ſuffer, and the obſtinacy of theſe Traytors, in confeſſing nothing at their Deaths, ſtagger you in your opinion of their being guilty, againſt ſuch full proof and evidence? Conſider the Principles of their Religion, and the Doctrine theſe Fathers of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have publickly taught and maintained, the depoſing and killing of Kings for the ſake of their Religion, and that it is lawfull in that caſe to make uſe of Equi vocations and Lies, and that thereby they do God good ſervice, if it be for the propagation of the Faith: and are not all Vows, Oaths and Sacraments diſpenſed with by the Pope on that occaſion? Have we not ſeen and heard of many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the ſame, enough to have fill'd a Volume, and not untruly affixed upon them, but what have been really and publickly committed by them? What heed then is to be taken to the denials of theſe men at their Deaths? or what credit to be given to their Speeches, when they have yet liberty given them to deceive the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and that by their obſtinacy they may perſwade them into a belief that there is no Plot, till the Sword is at their Throats? But I will conclude in the <hi>Recorder</hi>'s words, that I hope the fair Trials theſe perſons have had, and the publiſhing of them for the ſatisfaction of all thoſe who will look into them, will not onely confirm all who are <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> but will prevail upon thoſe whom they have inveagled into their perſwaſion, to deſert ſuch a Religion, till ſuch time as they alter their principles from the bloudineſs and inhumanity they are ſtained with, and which theſe men have inſtilled into all their <hi>Proſelytes.</hi>
