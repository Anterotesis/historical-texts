            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Moreover <hi>True Godlineſs</hi> is opened in his own primitive <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,</hi> and <hi>External Beauty</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi>; being vindicated from all thoſe foul Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Reproaches caſt upon him in this and former Ages: With his ſad Lamentation, in reſpect of the prevailing power of <hi>Vice Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlines,</hi> and that great danger he ſeems now to be in by <hi>Papiſtry</hi> and other Enemies. Alſo the uſefulneſs and neceſſity of Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and the Creatures utmoſt care and diligence in order to their <hi>Converſion,</hi> is clearly evinced; with the chief means, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and excellency thereof.

            </argument>
            <p>TRUE <hi>Godlineſs</hi> being of late, as well as in former daies) become ſo great a ſtranger to moſt men, and indeed not known but by a very few in the World; I ſhall in the firſt place, before I Treat of his <hi>Travels</hi> and of the <hi>Entertainment</hi> he meets with where he comes, give you a deſcription of him, and the rather becauſe many perſons I perceive are ſubject to ſo great an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour as to take <hi>Mortality</hi> for him; and others out of ignorance (to ſay no worſe) Rail, and ignominiouſly

call and abuſe him, by the names of Singularity, Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſs, Pride and Rebellion, as if he were not fit to live or have a being in the World, he being ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a make-bate, a ſeditious and common diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of all Kingdoms, Cities, Towns, and Villages whereſoever he comes and is entertained: Yea, ſuch a factious and quarrelſome companion, that he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the only cauſe and ſtirrer up of all thoſe unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py differences, diviſions, troubles and miſeries that are this day in the world, This being ſo, I conclude nothing is more neceſſary, than to take off that ugly Maſk or Viſard, which his implacable enemies have put upon him, and clear him of all thoſe ſoul and unjuſt ſlanders and curſed reproaches of the Sons of <hi>Belial</hi>; that ſo he may appear in his own original, primitive and ſpotleſs Innocency, that none may be afraid of him, or be unwilling to entertain him, nor aſhamed to own him, and make him their boſome-companion.</p>
            <p>Know ye therefore in the firſt place,<note place="margin">Godlineſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</note> That <hi>Godlineſs</hi> conſiſts in the true and right knowledg of Divine Truths, or fundamental principles of the Goſpel; which all men ought to know and be eſtabliſhed in, that would be ſaved <hi>without Controverſie, great is the myſtery of Godlineſs: God manifeſted in the fleſh, juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the Spirit, ſeen of Angels, preached unto the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, believed on in the World, and received up to Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>

                  <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.</note> Theſe great Truths of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion are called <hi>Godlineſs</hi>; many men conclude 'tis no matter what faith or principle they hold and cleave to, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they do but live a ſober and honeſt life, <hi>doing to all men as they would be done unto,</hi> ſuppoſing that the whole of Religion and Godlineſs conſiſts in theſe things; but alaſs, they are greatly miſtaken; <hi>Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:66398:5"/>
is another kind of thing than they imagine; it is impoſſible to receive or entertain <hi>True Godlineſs,</hi> whilſt we ſhut out of doors the Eſſentials of the Chriſtian Religion; and inſtead thereof imbrace Superſtition, Errour and Hereſie, there being damning princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples as well as damning practices, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2, 3.</p>
            <p>Now ſhould any demand further, to hear more particularly what thoſe principles of divine truths, or fundamentals of Chriſtian Faith be, which are the Eſſentials of <hi>True Godlineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. I anſwer the Doctrine of the Bleſſed Trinity, or the three diſtinct Subſiſtances in the Glorious Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Unity of the two natures in the perſon of Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> that he is really God and man, in one perſon <hi>David</hi>'s Lord, and yet <hi>David</hi>'s Son; <hi>David</hi>'s Root, and yet <hi>David</hi>'s Off-ſpring.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Doctrine of Attonement, or that plenary ſatisfaction and reconcilliation the Lord Jeſus hath made by his glorious underſtaning on man's behalf.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith alone, or the imputation of Chriſts Righteouſnes to thoſe who do believe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Doctrine of Regeneration, Reſurrection, Judgment, the World to come, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now I ſay in the true knowledg of theſe and ſuch like principles of divine truths, and being truly eſtabliſhed in the ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt belief thereof, does <hi>True Godlineſs</hi> in part conſiſt. But <hi>ſecondly, Godlineſs,</hi> as to his inward and more hidden parts and power, is a holy conformity to theſe ſacred and divine principles which natural men may underſtand Religion by; but <hi>True Godlineſs</hi> conſiſts in the light of ſupernatural truths and life of Grace, God manifeſting himſelf in the light of thoſe glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous principles, and working the life of ſupernatural grace in the ſoul by the Holy Ghoſt, it conſiſts in the

ſaving and experimental knowledg of God and Jeſus Chriſt, in having all the evil qualities of the Soul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and heavenly habits infuſed in their room, or in a gracious conformity, diſpoſition and affections of the heart to God, cleaving to all truths made known to us, to find the powerful influences of the Goſpel and Spirit of Chriſt upon us, whereby our Souls are brought into the Image and likeneſs of his death and reſurrection; this is <hi>True Godlineſs,</hi> 'tis not a bare living up to the natural principles of morality, nor a ſimple knowledg of the letter of the word, or an hiſtorical, notional, or dogmatical knowledg of the ſacred Goſpel, and the precepts thereof, but in a faithful living up to the ſupernatural principles of Grace and the Goſpel, diſcharging our duties with as much readineſs and faithfulneſs towards God as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards man, ſo that our conſcience may be kept void of offence towards both. <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 24.16.</note> It conſiſts in forſaking of every ſin, and not only to leave it, but to loath it as the greateſt evil, and to cleave to God in ſincerity of heart, valuing him above all who is the chiefeſt good, and from a principle of divine love, willingly ſubjecting to all his Laws and appointments; Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs makes a man ſay with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>whom have I in Heaven but thee?</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 73.25.</note> &amp;c. <hi>Non amat Chriſtum, amat aliquid plus quam Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auſtin, he loves not Chriſt at all, that loves him not above all</hi>: He that entertains <hi>True Godlineſs,</hi> is as much for the Work of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as for the wages of Religion: Some there be who ſerve God, that they may ſerve themſelves upon God, but a true Chriſtian deſires grace, not only that God would glorifie him in Heaven, but that he may glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God on Earth: He cries, Lord, rather let me have a good heart than a great Eſtate; though he
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66398:6"/>
loves many things beſides God, yet he loves nothing above God. This man fears ſin more than ſuffering, and therefore he will ſuffer rather than ſin: He is like a Palm-Tree, he alwaies flouriſhes beſt when he is preſt down moſt. This may ſerve in the ſecond place, to diſcover what the inward life and power of <hi>True Godlineſs</hi> is.</p>

               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Then know ye that the form or external parts of <hi>True Godlineſs</hi> are very comely and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and no marvel it is ſo, ſeeing he was form'd and faſhioned by the wiſdom of the only wiſe God our Saviour; the works of whoſe hands being all glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; but this (<hi>viz.</hi>) the formation of <hi>Godlineſs</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the chiefeſt, higheſt and moſt admirable contrivances of his eternal wiſdom, muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty excel in glory, ſweet odour and amiableneſs; his form and external beauty therefore is ſuch, that he needs no humane artifice to paint or adorn him, or any waies to illuſtrate or ſet off his beauty and ſweet comelineſs of his countenance; for there is nothing defective as to his Evangelical and Apoſtolical form, as he came out of his great Creators hands; and as there is nothing from head to foot that is ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, more than needs or might be ſpared, ſo every line and lineament, Veins, Nerves and Sinews of him are in ſuch an exact and admirable order placed, that is to his beauty there can be no addition: Every one therefore that goes about to take from, add to, or alter any thing, touching the form of <hi>True Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> mars inſtead of making, and defiles inſtead of beautifying; beſides God hath ſtrictly forbid any
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66398:7"/>
thing of this nature to be done, no man is to ſet up his Poſt by the Lor'ds Poſt. <hi>Add thou not unto his Word, leſt he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pro,</hi> 30.6.</note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> by fathering that upon God which is none of his; do not the Papiſts call thoſe ſuperſtitious and vain Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, us'd in their Church, by the name of God's Worſhip, and what is this leſs than the putting a lye upon him; beſides it reflects upon the wiſdom of God; to attempt to change or alter any thing of the form of <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> as if he did not know beſt how, and in what way, or after what manner he himſelf would be worſhipped: But muſt be beholding to man for his help, wiſdom and rare contrivances, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many things that are by the Papiſts called decent and neceſſary; alſo doth it not reflect upon the care and faithfulneſs of God, inſomuch, that he ſhould not himſelf take care to lay down in his bleſſed word many things, which are very neceſſary to be added to the form of <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> which man's care and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is fain to ſupply.</p>
            <p>Therefore from hence all may perceive, that <hi>True Godlineſs</hi> never alters his Phyſiognomy, nor changes his countenance, he is the very ſame and not altred in the leaſt from what he was in the Primitive Time; nay, and there is indeed nothing in the world he hates more than thoſe pompous Garbs, ſuperſtitious Veſtments, and other Fooleries that are uſed in the Popiſh Church; as Croſſings, Cryſoms, Salt, Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, Oyl, and Holy Water, with divers other ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culuous Cereremonies, which are ſo numerous, they are too tedious here to reckon up, therefore take heed you do not take the counterfeit form of <hi>Godline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> for the true Form; for as there is a counterfeit <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> ſo there is a counterfeit form of <hi>Godlineſs</hi> which the counterfeit or falſe <hi>Godlineſs</hi> alwaies wares;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66398:7"/>
it is alſo needful to note one thing more, leſt you are deceived, <hi>viz.</hi> you muſt be ſure to receive the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> with his form; for his form without his inward life and power will do you no good; 'tis but as the Body without the Soul, or the Shell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Kirnel, or the Cabinet without the Jewel; neither ought any to ſlight his form, for you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what the Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>the form of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi>

            <p>Having thus briefly given you the deſcription both of the inſide,<note place="margin">The Pedegree of Godlineſs.</note> and outſide power and form of <hi>True God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi>; We ſhall proceed to Treat of his Pedigree, and ſhew you whoſe Off-ſpring he is, you by his name may eaſily read from whence he deſcends, and learn what a Noble Patronage he is of, he is indeed High-born, the great and glorious Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring of the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the Almighty Prince of Heaven and Earth, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, the univerſal Monarch of the World, whoſe Kingdom ruleth over all; and as this is his Noble Extract and renowned Deſcent, ſo likewiſe he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in high eſteem and favour with his glorious Prince, for there is none, no not one in Heaven or Earth that he loves and takes more delight in, than in <hi>True Godlineſs</hi>; nor is there any indeed more like him, or does more lively repreſent him in all the Earth; for he bears his expreſs, ſweet and Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Image; yea, and ſuch a venerable reſpect and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious eſteem hath he of him, that thoſe who love him, he loves; thoſe who hate him, he hates;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66398:8"/>
thoſe who receive him he receives; and thoſe who reject him he rejects; where he comes to dwell, there God, Chriſt and the Holy Ghoſt dwells.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Godlineſs</hi> is of great Antiquity;<note place="margin">The Antiquity of Godlineſs.</note> nay according to the deſcription we gave you of him: In the firſt place, we may well ſay he is without beginning of daies, for Truth (for ſome times he bears that name) dwelt in God from Everlaſting, though in time manifeſt or made known to men, and that in divers waies and manners, according as God in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſaw good. But if we ſpeak of his Antiquity, in reſpect of his dwelling here below, the firſt man that knew him was <hi>Adam,</hi> who whilſt he ſtood in the ſtate of Innocency enjoyed ſome part of his ſweet Company but by the malice of a great and potent Enemy he was abuſed, and his Image ſo defaced and marr'd, that he forſook his Habitation, which was the ruine and utter undoing of our firſt Parents and their whole Poſterity: and had not the Father of <hi>True Godlineſs,</hi> the King of Heaven and Earth, found out through his infinite wiſdom, a way to recover Man from his loſt Eſtate <hi>Godlineſs</hi> had made his abode no longer in this World, for by means of Corruption of Nature there was begotten and brought forth a curſed Monſter of ugly ſhape, whoſe Name was <hi>Vice, alias</hi> Luſt, who found ſo much favour with <hi>Adam</hi>'s Children, that <hi>Godlineſs</hi> was utterly diſcountenanced; and though he was the Off-ſpring of Heaven (as you heard before) and the only delight of <hi>Jehovah</hi> (and unto man the greateſt friend and chief Benefactor in all the World, ſtriving to enrich him, chear his heart, and to make him truly Noble and Renowned on Earth, and bring him back into his former Primitive Glory, and thereby at laſt make him eternally hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in Heaven) yet he was neglected and lamentably
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:66398:8"/>
ſlighted, that there was but only one of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring cared for him at that time, and he too for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining of him with that juſt and good reſpect he deſerved, was by his Brother, whoſe Name was <hi>Cain,</hi> baſely murdered; ſo that <hi>Godlineſs</hi> by this perceived very early what kind of uſage and entertainment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Children of men he was like to meet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; and truly never was there any one ſo nobly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, and of ſuch an excellent, peaceable and ſweet a nature and behaviour, generally ſo dealt with as <hi>Godlineſs</hi> hath been, from the beginning to this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day; (except the Prince of <hi>Godlineſs</hi> himſelf) yet he found ſome friends after <hi>Abel</hi> was ſlain, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained him kindly, and though they were reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, hated, and perſecuted for ſhewing favour to him, yet they never loſt anything by him, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywiſe were infinite gainers, for he never came empty handed to any mans houſe, but alwaies brought plenty of good things along with him, yea, ſuch things, the worth and value whereof no mortal is able to compute; (as I'll ſhew hereafter, God aſſiſting) nay, ſo great a friend he was to the next man, which I find eminently embraced him, that he ſaved him from the Grave, he ſent him to Heaven without calling at the Gate of Death; his name as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, was <hi>Enoch,</hi> and 'tis not to be thought what ſweet and Heavenly Communion, true Joy and Felicity this good man had with <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> for the ſpace of three hundred years, for ſo long they abode together on Earth, and now dwell together with the <hi>Father</hi> of <hi>true Godlineſs,</hi> and his only begotten <hi>Son</hi> in Heaven. Some time after this great Prince (for ſo they are all made who entetain <hi>True Godlineſs</hi>) was carried to Heaven, a ſad diſaſter beſell the World (I mean the Enemies of <hi>Godlineſs</hi>) for ſo it was, that curſed Monſter and Off-ſpring of Hell (<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>Vice,</hi> finding ſuch great
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:66398:9"/>
your with the men of the Generation, they delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in nothing more than in ſin and wickedneſs, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting God and his true and lovely Off-ſpring <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> it provoked him to take vengeance upon them, and utterly to deſtroy them from off the Earth; and this was done by a fearful and amazing Flood of Water: Now, this heavy Judgment was brought, I ſay, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the men of that Generation for their ſlighting, neglecting, and baſely contemning of <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> and ſad it was to conſider how generally men were at that time out of love with him, for there was not one in ten thouſand but hated him, and loved vice and ungodlineſs far better than he; nay, to tell you plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there was but one man in all the World who was an eminent Lover of this Noble and High Born Prince, <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Noah,</hi> though 'tis not to be doubted but his Wife and Sons, eſpecially two of them, were in ſome meaſure Favourites of him like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: But mark how at that time it fared with this Holy Man and his Family, who were Friends to <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> never a one of them were deſtroyed by that Flood; we may well ſay, <hi>Godlineſs is profitable unto all things,</hi> and Bleſſed are all they who love and kindly entertain him; for had it not been for <hi>Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Noah</hi> had doubtleſs periſhed as well as others.</p>
            <p>But to proceed in this brief Hiſtory of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> it would not be amiſs if we ſpeak a little of the next man after <hi>Noah</hi> who entertained him, and how he was bleſſed in ſo doing; his Name at firſt was <hi>Abram,</hi> but afterwards he was called <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>: This man lived for ſome time amongſt a Blind, Heatheniſh, and Idolotrous People, and was ignorant of <hi>True Godlineſs</hi>; but when he became ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him, few men ever loved him better, for he made him his Boſom Companion, and chiefeſt delight (and ſo indeed muſt every one that entertains
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66398:9"/>
him) and hereby he became great, and his Glory and Renown was ſpread abroad; nay he was by this means ſo honoured, that he was called the Friend of <hi>God,</hi> and the Father of all true Lovers of <hi>Godlineſs</hi>; and beſides the outward Bleſſings, this faithful man reaped as the fruit or donation of <hi>Godlineſs</hi>; (which were many, for he had much Cattel, Men-ſervants, Camels and Aſſes, ſo that he became very great) he was bleſſed with all ſpiritual Bleſſings; (<hi>viz.</hi>) he had ſweet fellowſhip and communion with God, aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in Faith, Love, and Joy in the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi>; the Covenant of Grace was alſo renewed to him, with a gracious Promiſe, that in his <hi>Seed all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed</hi>; for he having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>Godlineſſ</hi> as his choiceſt Companion, and chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Delight, <hi>Godlineſs</hi> brought along with him the Promiſes of this Life, and that which is a thouſand times better (<hi>viz.</hi>) the Life which is to come.</p>
            <p>But now near where this faithful man dwelt, there was a City, nay more than one, whoſe Inhabitants were utter enemies to <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> and lovers of that ugly and baſe-born Monſter and Spawn of the <hi>Devil, Vice,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding in all manner of horrible wickedneſs, who for this very reaſon were deſtroyed with their Cities by Fire and Brimſtone from Heaven; yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, before they were conſumed (ſo great a lover is <hi>Jehovah</hi> of <hi>Godlineſs</hi>) that he told <hi>Abraham,</hi> if there were but ten righteous perſons in that City, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch who had entertained <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> and were true lovers of him, he would ſpare the City for their ſakes; but it appeared there was but one man who ſhewed him countenance, and was in love with him. And yet before the City was burned, the Angels bid him haſte and be gone; for <hi>Godlineſs</hi> was ſuch a ſure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to him, the Angel could do nothing till he was gone forth: <hi>Sodom</hi> could not take Fire whilſt righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Lot</hi> was in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:66398:10"/>I might proceed further, and ſhew you who they were that entertained <hi>Godlineſs</hi> in the ſucceeding A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, for the ſpace of more than two Thouſand Years, and what great bleſſings he brought unto them, and what they ſuffered for his ſake; but I can but give a brief hint or two upon this account; 'tis known to all what <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſuffered for him by his envious Brethren, and how <hi>Godlineſs</hi> advanced him for his Integrity to him at laſt. Moreover the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> after <hi>Joſeph</hi> was dead, were through that love they bore to him, grievouſly oppreſſed by the mighty King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but it proved his own utter Ruine in the end. <hi>David,</hi> for the love he bare to him, was for many Years together greatly perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but afterwards <hi>Godlineſs</hi> raiſed him to great honour, and made him very ich, and ſat a Crown upon his Head; All along I might ſhew you in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient daies he was very much hated and perſecuted; nay, and ſome of his true Friends and Favourites, were for his ſake caſt into a fiery Furnace, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother into a Lions Den, yet they never loſt any thing by him, nor did they ever repent the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment they gave him. If we ſhould come lower into the Times of the Goſpel, 'tis well known what uſage he met with in our Lord and Saviour <hi>Jeſus</hi> and his Bleſſed Apoſtles; afterwards alſo by the Heathen Emperours, he was moſt abominably hated and perſecuted, and all thoſe who entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him were put to all manner of cruel Deaths and Torments imaginable. Laſtly, we might alſo ſhew you what hard uſage he met with by <hi>counterfeit Godlineſs,</hi> I mean <hi>Papiſtry,</hi> for near 1200 Years, how many of his dear Children and Servants have for the ſake of him been burn'd to Death, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies tormented in moſt Nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> but let what hath been ſaid ſuffice, touching the Antiquity, gray Hairs, and uſage of <hi>True Godlineſs</hi> in former days.</p>

               <p>Having thanked them for their good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, with a great deal of joy, retires himſelf, being very well ſatisfied with the advice Dr. <hi>Self-love</hi> and Sir <hi>Worldly Wiſeman</hi> had given him. and indeed this is the miſery of moſt rich men, (<hi>viz.</hi>) if they lie under any convictions of ſin, from that little light Conſcience hath at any time got, then preſently (being ſtirr'd up thereto by <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi>) they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with fleſh and blood, and then Dr. <hi>Self-love</hi> and Sir <hi>Worldly Wiſeman</hi> are their great Counſellers. But to proceed, <hi>Riches</hi> got now a Reader, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of opening to <hi>True Godlineſs,</hi> he opens to <hi>counterfeit Godlineſs,</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Papiſtry.</note> which was occaſioned through Ignorance, and thoſe other fooliſh Counſellers he hearkened to. Now, this <hi>Reader,</hi> as it appears, proved a ſad Fellow, for though he was a Scholar, being brought up in ſome Foreign Univerſity, yet he never car'd to read the Bible, but (as ſome ſay, would now and then curſe it) lov'd to read <hi>Romances</hi> and Song Books. But poor <hi>Conſcience</hi> being ſtifled, in a little time he gave content to the whole Family, in that he could mumble over a few Prayers out of a Book. And that in rhe ſecond place, he could Bowl, drink Healths, be Drunk, and cry God damn him with any of them; and there was indeed never a one in all the Family, that hated <hi>True Godlineſs</hi> more than he, for he made ſongs of him and ſcoffed, jeered and derided him continually, and made himſelf and others merry with his mean, low and diſtreſſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:66398:18"/>
and alſo ſtirr'd up all the Neighbourhood, to find fault, and quarrel with all thoſe who were friends and true lovers of him.</p>

               <p>now perceived he was like to have but cool Entertainment at this Houſe, having waited at <hi>Riches</hi> Gate till his patience was almoſt worn out. began to think of a removal, and to Travel to ſome other place; but before he took his final farewel, he was reſolved to ſpeak his mind freely to him, thereby to leave him without any kind of excuſe whatſoever, and therefore addreſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to him after this manner, being at door ready to depart.</p>

               <speaker>Godli.</speaker>
               <p>Well <hi>Riches,</hi> I ſee now very plainly, you did but flatter me when you began to hearken to your poor Steward <hi>Conſcience,</hi> in order to the letting me into your Houſe; for evident it is, you are grown far worſe than before, and have blinded his eyes by entertaining another, who calls himſelf by my name inſtead of me, but before I do depart, I will ſhew you the great danger you are in; and the cauſe of it, the truth is, you have got ſuch a Crew of loſe, baſe and deceitful Servants, that they will utterly undo you, and bring upon you the eternal ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of your poor ſoul, which I deſign'd by my coming to you, to ſave and make happy for ever; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed (whether you will believe it or no) there was never any who entertained theſe graceleſs Villains and enemies of God, but were for ever ruin'd by them at laſt; nay, and not only eternally hereafter in the World to come, but many times externally here in this World; therefore I adviſe you to do what you can to get rid of them, and I will help you to far better Servants in their ſtead. For firſt of all, can you think it will be ſafe for you to keep <hi>Preſumption</hi> ſtill in your Houſe, ſince there is ſcarce
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:66398:18"/>
a more deceitful and bloody Wretch in the World; how many thouſands of poor ſouls hath he impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently deſtroy'd, by cauſing them to preſume on the mercy of God, and the death of Chriſt, and yet live in <hi>Sin, Pride</hi> and <hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi> and in a vile man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, hating and contemning me, that is to ſay <hi>True Godlineſs.</hi> Doth not God ſay it is harder <hi>for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven</hi>; and yet you are perſwaded by him to think it is an eaſie thing; and doth not the Scripture ſay, <hi>Except your righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs do exceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, ye ſhall in no wiſe enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.20.</note> And yet he tells you that by doing a few good deeds, or by giving a little of your great abundance to the Poor, your ſtate is good enough; whereas many of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> did, as to acts of Charity, exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out-do you; nay doth not St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, <hi>Though he gave all his goods to feed the Poor, and his Body to be burned,</hi> yet without Charity (that is to ſay, true love to God and <hi>Godlineſs</hi>) <hi>he was nothing</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.20</note>; and yet you,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3.</note> though you ſlight and contem <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> are taught to preſume on <hi>God's</hi> Mercy, who hath notwithſtanding poſitively ſaid concerning you, and ſuch as you are; <hi>He that made them, will not ſave them; and he that form'd them, will ſhew them no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</hi> Iſa. 27.11.</p>
               <p>And then as touching your Servant <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief,</hi> he is ſuch a bloody and devouring Monſter, that he hath ſent Millions to Hell, by hindring them from believing what God hath ſaid in his Word, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Grace and Clemency to the truly penitent, and of his wroth and vengeance to the Impenitent and unbelieving Soul; he will not ſuffer you to believe nor give credit to that word, <hi>If any man
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:66398:19"/>
loves the World, the love of the Father is not in him,</hi> 1 John 1.15. Nor to that word neither, <hi>Except a man be born again he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God,</hi> John 3.3. And <hi>he that believes not ſhall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> Mark 16.16. And many like dreadful Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, which he will not ſuffer you to regard, nor give the leaſt credit to; and thus he teaches you to make God a Lyar, for he hath ſaid, you ſhall without Repentance be damned and periſh in your ſins, but he ſays, ye ſhall be ſaved though ye live in your ſins.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as to what <hi>Ignorance</hi> ſays of getting Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of Sins for a piece of Money, by ſending for a <hi>Popiſh Prieſt,</hi> he deſerves to be cheated of his Soul that will hearken to ſuch a blind Sot; <hi>who can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give Sin but God?</hi> Shall any believe that Pardon, which is the gift of God, can be bought with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: Sure his <hi>Holineſs</hi> never learn'd this Doctrine of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> whoſe Succeſſor he ſays he is, for St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to ſuch a one as thou art, <hi>Thy money periſh with thee,</hi> Acts 8.20.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, As concerning <hi>Pride,</hi> whom you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain and hug in your boſom as a ſweet and beloved Friend, he hath been the ruine of many Souls like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; nay, and not only Men, but Angels alſo, for 'tis thought he was the principal <hi>Agent</hi> who wrought their eternal deſtruction, and from Heaven caſt them down to Hell, and of Angels of Light made them Devils. But, Sir, pray remember that word, <hi>Pride goes before Deſtruction, and a haughty Spirit before a Fall.</hi> What became of the great King of <hi>Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> for entertaining this Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, was it not <hi>Pride</hi> that brought him down with a vengeance, and turned him a grazing to eat ſtraw like Oxen, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.4. Moreover, what became of <hi>Herod</hi> the Great, who was ſo fond of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion?
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:66398:19"/>
Did he not bring God's heavy wrath upon him in ſuch a fearful manner, that a bleſſed <hi>Angel</hi> was ſent to ſmite him with Death immediately, and he was eaten of Worms, <hi>Acts</hi> 12.23. Have you not read, that the <hi>day cometh which ſhall burn as an Oven, and all the proud, and all that do wickedly ſhall be ſtubble,</hi> Mal. 4.1. This haughty Villain, <hi>Pride,</hi> is one of thoſe ſeven things, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſhews which God hates, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.16. If you will not, <hi>Riches,</hi> be perſwaded from hence to turn him out of your Houſe, even take what will follow.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Vain-hope</hi> I know is one that hath kept up your ſpirits, and ſpoke peace to you all along, but he is fitly ſo called, for he will leave you like a deceitful, falſe-hearted, and treacherous Friend, when you come to fall into diſtreſs. You hope to be ſaved (and ſo did many thouſands that are now in Hell) but alas, what ground have you to build your hope upon? <hi>The Hypocrites hope ſhall periſh, whoſe hope ſhall be cut off; and whoſe trust ſhall be as a Spiders Web,</hi> Job 18.13, 14.</p>
               <p>Ah, Sir, what will your hope avail you though you have gain'd the World, <hi>when God taketh away your Soul?</hi> Job 27.8.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, and Laſtly, as touching your ſweet Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi> he is made up with <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and what can be more deteſtable to <hi>Jehovah</hi>? ſo long as you Entertain and love him you <hi>adore an Idol</hi>; he is indeed the Ring-leader to almoſt all manner of Wickedneſs; nay, there is ſcarcely a viler and more abominable Wretch breathing on Gods Earth, therefore juſtly called, <hi>The Root of all Evil.</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.10.</note> he hath taught many to play the Thief, others to commit Treaſon, and others to Murther Innocents for their Inheritance; he is guilty of <hi>Bribery, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſary,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:66398:20"/>
Extorttion,</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſion</hi>: It was he as made poor <hi>Achan</hi> loſe his ſweet Life, he alſo contrived the death of <hi>Naboth</hi> and his Sons; and more than all, he tempted <hi>Judas</hi> to Sell, and baſely to betray my dear <hi>Lord and Maſter, Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> for Thirty pieces of Silver: Do not blame me therefore if I bear ſo hard againſt him; moreover, I can ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ever get one Foot, into any <hi>rich mans</hi> Houſe through his means; 'tis he and his Companions who keep me out, he hath through his hard-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, almoſt famiſhed to death all the Poor, both in City and Countrey, and hath alſo of late very near betrayed my whole intereſt that I have in the world into the Enemies hands: he hath alſo grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly corrupted many who profeſs kindneſs to me by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbring their minds ſo with the Affairs of this Life, that they cannot find the way to the Church; when they ſhould be hearing of God's Word; he forces them to abide in their Shops, nor will he ſuffer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them to take a little time to pray in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, nor in their Cloſets: He has alſo expoſed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of my poor Miniſters to many great ſtraits and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, by which means their heads have been ſo filled with the cares of this Life, that they have been out of capacity to preach the Goſpel as they ought to preach it, nor can they get ſuch helps that are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and all long of him: Nay, he hath almoſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done every Nation, Kingdom and Commonwealth; Firſt, by corrupting the Law, and ſubverting Juſtice, cauſing Judges to judg for Reward, and Lawyers to plead more for Fees than Equity. And then ſecond<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, by ſpoiling Commerce, for he hath Monopolized Trades and Commodities ſo into his own hands, and inhanced the prizes of things, that many men have been undone by him. I cann't, Sir, reckon up all his horrible Crimes, and is this he you ſo dearly love,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:66398:20"/>
and muſt I be ſlighted and diſregarded by you through love you bear to him? Alas, Sir, he will bring your Soul, if you follow him to deſtruction: Pray what became of <hi>Achan</hi> who harboured him (mentioned before) alſo what became of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> whom he forced to tell a lie to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt? <hi>Acts</hi> 5.1, 2, 3, 4. Who was it that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the <hi>Young Man</hi> in the Goſpel to fall ſhort of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and to go away from Jeſus Chriſt very ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and <hi>Demas</hi> to turn Apoſtate, and to embrace this preſent evil World; was it not <hi>Coveetouſneſs?</hi> Ah, Sir, take heed of this abominable Miſcreant, for tho' ſome wicked ones of the Earth may bleſs you, yet he cauſed God to hate you. See what <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Wicked boaſteth of his hearts deſire, and bleſſeth the Covetous whom the Lord abhorreth,</hi> Pſal. 10.3. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of theſe things, and be perſwaded to put away all theſe deceitful and Hell-bred Companions, which you have a long time nouriſhed in your Houſe, or it will be worſe with you, I do aſſure you. O that you would now at laſt, before I leave you, hearken to my Counſel, and receive me into your Houſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce that Monſter you have lately embrac'd, who calls himſelf by my Name! What do you ſay <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>?</p>

               <p>Sir, I perceive your condition is miſerable, for you ſeem to be hardened, and whilſt you have had gracious means afforded you to bring you to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, you are grown worſe and worſe; howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, let me tell you, if you die before you have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced and received me into your Houſe, you will pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in your ſins, and Hell will be your Portion for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; thoſe who reject me, reject God and Jeſus Chriſt alſo, and to tell you the truth, all this time that I have been at your door, the Lord Jeſus hath ſtood waiting at your door with me likewiſe.</p>

               <p>Leave your Canting, you are a bold and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent piece; do you begin to threaten me? Am I not my own Maſter? Would you Lord it over me? I perceive you what you aim at, you would have me entertain you, that ſo your poor deſpiſed Off-ſpring might have a good fleece out of me. I could find in in my heart to be revenged on you, and ſet all the Rabble of the Town upon you, Sirrah, I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered of the buſineſs, and have had advice what to do from two able Counſellors, Dr. <hi>Self-love,</hi> and Sir <hi>Worldly Wiſeman.</hi>

producing that Text, <hi>be not righteous overmuch, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make thy ſelf overwiſe; why ſhouldeſt thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy thy ſelf</hi>? Eccl. 7.16.

               <p>Shewing how <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> in his Travels, came to a poor Cottage, where dwelt one call'd <hi>Poverty,</hi> with whom he earneſtly deſired to make his Abode; and how he was ſhamefully denied Entertainment there alſo.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <hi>GOdlineſs</hi> finding how baſely he had been ſerved by <hi>Riches,</hi> and that he could not with all the ſtrongeſt Arguments and Motives imaginable get any Entertainment with <hi>him,</hi> travelled further, and as he wandred up and down in the <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> of this World, at laſt he chanced to come to a ſmall Village, at the furthermoſt end of which (upon the <hi>Common</hi>) he eſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a little Cottage, a poor old ruinous thing it was, the Windows being all broke, only they had cramm'd into the holes ſome old Rags to keep out the Cold, and by the propping it up, it ſeemed as if it was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to fall; but however, he remembring what his bleſſed Lord and Maſter ſaid, <hi>The Poor receive the Goſpel,</hi> reſolved to go thither, and ſee whether he might not meet with Entertainment there; (for he is <hi>no reſpector of Perſons,</hi> he is as willing to be Gueſt to the <hi>poor,</hi> as to the <hi>rich,</hi> and to dwell with the <hi>Peaſant</hi> as with the <hi>Prince</hi>; or to make his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode in a <hi>Cottage</hi> as in a <hi>Palace</hi>:) And being come up to the Door, he underſtood the poor man's name who dwelt there, was <hi>Poverty:</hi> Now <hi>Godlineſs</hi> knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed five or ſix times before he could have any manner of Anſwer for it ſeems he was aſleep in Bed with his Wife; but at laſt being between ſleeping and waking, he aſked (though very faintly) <hi>Who's there? who's at the Door?</hi>

               <hi>Godlineſs</hi> liſtned, but he could not hear what <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty</hi> ſaid, by reaſon of the noiſe that was within; for he having many Children, it happened that by this time they were wak'd, and fell into a fit of cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſome wanted Victuals; and ſome of them cried for other things which he had not to give them; which made him one while to weep, and another while to fret and ſtorm at the poor Children, ſo that <hi>Godlineſs</hi> could have no anſwer till he knock'd again; which he did, and that pretty hard.</p>

               <p>He had ſome reaſon for it, I warrant you; and truly I my ſelf do not like very well what you talk of; for he is a man ready enough to open his Door to any who are worth entertaining; I mean pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Gueſts: if you could get no lodging at his Houſe, what ground have you to think you ſhould meet with any here; beſides, though I cann't deny but that I have heard of your Name, yet I know you not; and moreover, I am forbid by certain Edicts

of this Country, to entertain one who goes by your Name, and it may be you as far as I know: 'Tis Sir, a dangerous thing to open ones door to ſtrangers at any time, but more eſpecially now, when there are ſo many grand Cheats and Robbers abroad: Sir, though I have not much to loſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet my life is as dear to me as any man's; and ſhould I let you in, how you would deal with me, God knows; for I have heard that many thouſands through your means have loſt their ſweet Lives as well as their Eſtates.</p>

               <p>Truly we poor Folks in the Country, think 'tis <hi>Godlineſs</hi> enough for us to bear an honeſt mind, and pay truly for what we have, and go to Church now and then to hear ſome good Prayers there, and ſay the <hi>Creed,</hi> the <hi>Ten Commandments</hi> and the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Prayer</hi> now and then at home when we come from work, if we do not chance to fall aſleep firſt; for it has been ſo with me, God knows, many a time, the Lord help me; but if I thought it would be for my profit, I could find in my heart to open to you.</p>

            <p>Firſt, <hi>Sloth</hi> and <hi>Idleneſs</hi> would not ſuffer him to riſe up out of his Bed of Security, to call upon God, nor take pains to pull up the Briars and Thorns that grew in his heart; by which means his Field lay barren and untill'd, nothing growing therein, but what the Ground brought forth naturally. Nay, theſe made him of ſuch a ſluggiſh Temper, and ſuch a lover of Reſt, that he complain'd many times becauſe he could not go without motion; nay he was unwilling to be at the trouble of feeding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; therefore would wiſh that men might live as Trees and Plants do: and though there was offered him a Cabinet of rich Jewels, yet he would not ſo much as ſtretch out his Arm to take hold of it, and notwithſtanding he had many fiery darts ſtuck in his Breaſt, yet he would not be at the pains of pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them forth; by which means he was in a ſad and lamentable condition.

            <p>
               <hi>Light-fingers</hi> told him, he had been for a great while his beſt Friend; and if it had not been for him, he had been ſtarved to Death long before now.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Diſtruſt</hi> fell into diſcourſe with his thieving Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and poſitively ſaid, if he turned <hi>Light-fingers</hi> out of his Houſe (as he knew he muſt if <hi>Godlineſs</hi> came in) he would certainly go a begging from door to door.</p>
            <p>

            <p>
               <hi>Carping-Cares</hi> filled his head ſo full of diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoughts, that he had no time to think of <hi>God, Chriſt,</hi> nor his own <hi>Soul,</hi> from one weeks end to another; but his great ſtudy was, either to think where to borrow Money, and ſo get more in debt
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:66398:26"/>
or elſe how to pay what he ow'd, to get out of debt, or what he ſhould do for work, Trade being grown (by the badneſs of Times) very dead; by this means Villain) fill'd with ſad thoughts, not knowing how he ſhould get more Bread, when that he had was eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en up, and more Clothes, when they he had would hang on no longer; beſides, it could not go out of his mind, but that at one time or other he ſhould be A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted, and thrown into a Goal, having many times fearfully broke his word.</p>

               <p>Firſt, as to theſe lazy Companions, <hi>Sloth</hi> and <hi>Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> who will not ſuffer you to labour for the good neither of Body nor Soul, they have in part brought you into this poor and miſerable condition you are in. Oh how many have they brought to beg their

Bread from door to door! and ſtirred up others to rob, ſteal and commit horrible Murders, to uphold them in their looſe, lazy and ungodly lifes; by which means they have brought, and daily do bring a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men and women to the Gallows: but the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt miſchief they do, is to the Souls of men; for they have caſt thouſands into ſuch a deep ſleep, that never awake until they lift up their eyes in Hell; they will not ſuffer men to labour to find out their great danger, till it is too late; and others, when they do perceive their woeful condition, are hindred by them from endeavouring timely and in a right manner to get out; they many times cry, <hi>Lord help us,</hi> and <hi>Lord have mercy upon us</hi>; but never ſtrive to take hold of the offers and tenders of his Grace and Mercy, by cleaving to Chriſt, and leaving all their abominable wickedneſs. 'Tis the <hi>idle Soul that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers hunger</hi>; who ſhall <hi>beg at harveſt, and have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> though there is Bread and enough to ſpare for you in Gods Houſe, yet they will not ſuffer you to ſeek out for it, but cauſe you to cry, <hi>yet a little ſleep, yet a little ſlumber,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ignorance</hi> is a <hi>Murtherer,</hi> and hath deſtroyed millions of Souls, though there was a time indeed when God ſeemed to wink at him, <note n="*" place="margin">

unto, if you could, yet they could not anſwer your preſent neceſſities. If you will give credit to ſuch a notorious <hi>Liar, Murtherer</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemer,</hi> who certainly in a ſlie and treacherous manner ſeeks to ſtab you at the heart, who can help it? Are Chriſt's Promiſes of Grace and Peace here, and Glory here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, becauſe not ſeen with external Eyes, fictions? He will tell you alſo ere long, if you will believe him there is no God nor Devil, Heaven nor Hell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not ſeen with viſible eyes; he may ſuggeſt the one to you as well as the other. Come, <hi>Poverty,</hi> thouſands of my Children, by bleſſed experience have found my Promiſes no fictions nor idle fancies, but things full of reality, marrow and fatneſs: <hi>O taſte and ſee how good the Lord is.</hi> And why may not you obtain theſe glorious good things, <hi>viz.</hi> Union and Communion with God, Pardon of Sin, Peace of Conſcience, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt, as well as others? They were commonly given in the time of the Goſpel to the Poor. Come, <hi>Poverty,</hi> theſe things are thine (as ſure as God is in Heaven, if thou wilt but let me in) poor <hi>Laſarus</hi> underſtood them, and experienced the ſweetneſs of them, and ſhall to Eternity. And then laſtly, have you no need of theſe good things of mine, becauſe they may not ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly anſwer your outward neceſſity? Are not the neceſſities of your Soul more to be minded than to get ſtore of <hi>Meat, Drink, Clothes, Silver</hi> and <hi>Gold</hi>? What are all theſe things to the love and favour of God, an Intereſt in Chriſt, and to have a Right to the Kingdom of Heaven? How ſoon, alas, may your Life be gone, and what good will thoſe things do you; do you not ſee they periſh in the uſing? And as they are corruptible, ſo likewiſe they can never ſatisfie nor fill the deſires of your Soul, nor do they ſuit the neceſſities thereof. Conſider, can any of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:66398:29"/>
theſe things make thy Soul happy? Can Gold or Silver enrich it, or the rareſt worldly dainties feed it, or Wine chear it? No, <hi>Poverty,</hi> if thou hadſt the things of this World in never ſo great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, yet till thou letteſt me in, and makeſt me thy chief Companion, thy Soul would be miſerable. What is it to have plenty of all good things, and no God, no Chriſt, no Pardon, no Peace, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywiſe, the Curſe of God, Horror of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Hell at laſt? Thou wilt, <hi>Poverty,</hi> become more happy if thou doſt open the door to me, and thou and I dwell together, than the proudeſt and haughtieſt <hi>Monarh</hi> in the World; thy Comforts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Peace and Joy will excell theirs, and thy Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches be more abundant in <hi>Quantity,</hi> beſides the rare and excellent <hi>Quality</hi> of them; nay, and thy Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry will be far more tranſcendent; and beſides, 'twill abide with thee to the daies of Eternity,</p>

               <p>Firſt, they ſay I am grown here of late very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, and am of very little eſteem or cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit * amongſt any ſort or degrees of men;<note place="margin">

               <p>To this I anſwer, firſt I never had much eſteem amongſt great men; nay, in every Age of the World very few gave credit to me; and now being come (almoſt to the end of my Travels) into the laſt and worſt Age, I could expect no other uſage than what I

                  <hi>Pride, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief</hi> and <hi>Senſuality,</hi> that is in the hearts of the adverſe party, they having eſpouſed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of <hi>Apollyon,</hi> my grand Enemy; and alas, it will be ſo, unleſs I could connive at, or bear with thoſe curſed evils which are in the hearts of men. But can it be ſuppoſed, that Virtue ſhould wink at, or ſide with filthy Vice, or <hi>True Godlineſs</hi> allow of, and indulge men in Ungodlineſs, or Truth joyn or cloſe in with Error? Alas, ſhould I do this I ſhould loſe my very being, and be no more what I am; for as 'tis impoſſible for Light to have fellowſhip with Darkneſs, or Chriſt to have concord with <hi>Belial,</hi> ſo 'tis for me to allow of or bear with any of the evil enormities of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men; ſhould my Children do it, they would at that very inſtant ceaſe to be my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; therefore let all the World bear me wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs this day, that I clear my ſelf of thoſe foul crimes and calumnies that I am charged with. And further, to vindicate my ſelf, I call in my old friend Saint <hi>James,</hi> pray hear what he hath to ſay about the horrible charge brought againſt me. St. <hi>James,</hi> pray ſpeak to this great caſe, from whence come that Strife, Wars and Contention that is in the World? Am I the cauſe of it?</p>
               <p>James, <hi>From whence come wars and fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men? Come they not hence, even of their luſts that war in their members?<note place="margin">Jam. 4.1.

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:66398:43"/>
Doctrine of <hi>Truth,</hi> and the <hi>Truth</hi> of Grace. But pray, St. <hi>James</hi> go on, <hi>Where envying and ſtrife is, there is confuſion and every evil work. But the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that is from above, is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, eaſie to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without wrangling, and without hypocriſie.</hi> It is enough I alwayes teach men and women, who embrace me, to be holy, peaceable, gentle, and eaſie to be entreated, full of mercy, to hate hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, and all the deeds of the fleſh. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take notice, if any who are called by my name, or profeſs love to me, are unholy, quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, given to ſtrife, debate and contention, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out with their Neighbours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> making cauſeleſs diſturbance in the Town, Place, or Houſe where they dwell, I do this day diſown them; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I fear 'tis they who have in part expoſed me to reproach and contempt in theſe evil dayes.</p>
               <p>I am accuſed alſo with <hi>Sedition</hi> and <hi>Faction,</hi> and for being the chief ring-leader of Sects, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I may well ſay, with my old friend, St. <hi>Paul</hi> (who was accuſed by <hi>Tertullus</hi> in like ſort) being called <hi>a peſtelent Fellow, and a mover of Sedition,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 24.5. I am clear from this evil Charge, neither can they prove this Accuſation against me, I have been travelling up and down in moſt parts of the earth for almoſt ſix thousand years, and 'tis ſtrange, were I really guilty, that none ſhould come forth and prove it againſt me. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore know ye, that the Doctrine, I <hi>True Godlineſs,</hi> the Off-ſpring of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the darling of Heaven, do, and ever did teach upon this account, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That Husbands ought to love their Wives, Wives to obey their Husbands, Children to honour their Parents, and Parents to carry it wiſely to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Children, and to bring them up in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:66398:43"/>
the fear and nurture of the Lord. Servants to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey their Maſters, and Maſters to carry it well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Servants; and Neighbours to live in love one with another, and Subjects to obey their Prince. Did I not ever teach this Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> That all Men ought <hi>to be ſubject to Principalities, to obey Magiſtrates, and to be ready to every good work,</hi> Tit. 3.1. And if Chriſtians at any time are by their Superiors required to do ſuch things, that they conceive are contrary to the Word and Will of God, then I bid them patiently to ſuffer, and not to reſiſt, but to learn of my bleſſed Maſter, who when he was reviled, reviled not again, and when he ſuffered, he threatned not. But palpable 'tis, if men are bound to ſubmit to their Superiors in all things, in Divine matters whatſoever, then the Apoſtles were faulty, who in ſpiritual things cry'd out, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be right in the ſight of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 4.19.</note> 
                  <hi>to hearken to you rather than God, judg ye.</hi> Beſides, this would cauſe Perſecution for ever to ceaſe, and charge all the Martyrs in every Age of the World, not only with diſobedience, but alſo with folly; and then alſo it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, whatſoever Religion in any Nation, the chief Magiſtrate thereof does ſet up, muſt be ſubjected to, which ſure no wiſe man will ſay ought to be done; therefore I am for <hi>rendring to Caeſar the things which are Caeſars, and unto God the things that are Gods,</hi> Mark 12.17.</p>
               <p>But theſe things are not the whole cauſe of my Lamentation, but there are many other reaſons.</p>
               <p>Alas, I am not only abuſed and laid under re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and infamy by my open enemies, but alſo baſely ſlighted by many of thoſe who pretend love and reſpect to me; moſt indeed, now a dayes, do
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:66398:44"/>
but complement me, they ſpeak me fair to my face, but their hearts are not with me: Was there ever more Godlineſs profeſſed and leſs practiſed, and more without doors and leſs within? Did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Pride, Covetouſneſs, Vain-glory, Self-love, Slaviſh-fear, Carnality,</hi> and <hi>Luke warmneſs,</hi> attend any People who called themſelves Chriſtians, Saints, and Members of Chriſt, as in theſe days? There are ſome who profeſs love to me, that I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of, they do me more wrong than the open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane. I may cry alas, and call long enough upon many in theſe dayes; nay, beg as it were, upon my bare knees to be entertained by them, and all in vain, for they will not mind me, nor take me in; I meet indeed with nothing but feigned promiſes from the moſt of people: <hi>I will open to you, Sir, I intend to let you in, I am reſolved to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace you hereafter,</hi> &amp;c. And thus I am put off and ſlighted from day to day. O, How long have I waited at the doors of ſome of theſe deceived Souls, even till they are grown old, and all to no purpoſe, for I have ſeen death often ſeize and carry them away before I could get into their houſes, that ſo I might ſave them from Hell (where now 'tis to be feared they are) O, with what unkind dealings do I meet withal! Is it not ſad, that <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs</hi> ſhould be by many ſo countenanced, and I hated, reſiſted, and contemned in every place, almoſt by every body; for <hi>Riches</hi> contemns me, <hi>Poverty</hi> diſlikes me, <hi>Youth</hi> derides me, <hi>Old Age</hi> will not know me, <hi>Legaliſt</hi> miſcalls me, and <hi>Formality</hi> playes the hypocrite with me, and the <hi>Babylonians</hi> ſeek to take away my life; I have a multitude of enemies, and but a few friends.</p>
               <p>But in the midſt of my <hi>Lamentation</hi> the thoughts of those glorious promiſes of God concerning what
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:66398:44"/>
he hath said of me in the latter dayes, does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive my heart; for though I have few to plead my cauſe, or to clear my innocency, and am like to be run down by <hi>Apollyon</hi> and his ſpurious Off-ſpring, <hi>Lust</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs,</hi> yet I ſee my day is a coming <hi>when ſin ſhall be aſhamed and iniquity ſtop her mouth,</hi> Pſal. 107.42. <hi>When the Holy of the Lord ſhall be eſteemed honourable,</hi> and it ſhall be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to be wicked. Though I am now ſlighted I ſhall then be prized; <hi>Jehovah</hi> will make my Glory to ſhine forth In the midſt of all Nations, and my Children ſhall flouriſh in every place; and in that day none ſhall dare to open their ungodly mouths againſt me, nor ſhall I need to travel up and down to ſeek for entertainment. <hi>For the knowledg of the Glory of the Lord ſhall cover the Earth, as the Waters do the Sea. In that day there ſhall be upon the Bells of the Horſes Holineſs unto the Lord; and the Pots in the Lords Houſe ſhall be like the Bowls before the Altar. Yea, every Pot in</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>and</hi> Judah <hi>ſhall be Holineſs unto the Lord of Hoſt, and all they that Sacrifice ſhall come and take of them and ſeeth therein; and in that day there ſhall be no more a</hi> Canaanite <hi>in the Houſe of the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> Zach. 14.20.21. Nay, and this alſo adds to my joy in the midſt of my ſorrow, this longed-for-day is near, and haſtens greatly; 'tis but a little while, and there will be a great alteration in the World, the Angel who enlightens the Earth with his Glory, will ſuddenly cry, <hi>Babylon the Great is fallen, is fallen,</hi> Rev. 18.13, 2.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Godli.</hi> Sir, a ſtranger to you, though your very good Friend, and one who would gladly have a Lodging in your Houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Legal.</hi> What is your Name?</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Godli.</hi> Sir, 'tis your great miſtake, for I am ſure you know me not, nor were you ever yet acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Legal.</hi> What, do I not know <hi>True Godlineſs,</hi> this is ſtrange; do not you and I converſe together e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Godli.</hi> Sir, I am not the perſon you take me for, there is one or two more who go ſometimes by my Name, and 'tis very probable you may be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with one of them; pray what are his manners; what Doctrine I mean, doth he teach you, for by that I ſhall know who it is.</p>

I ſay the like. And 3. <hi>That you muſt do unto all men as you would have them do to you,</hi> I ſay the very ſame, it being my Maſters own Doctrine.</p>

               <speaker>Godli.</speaker>
               <p>He teaches you to ſeek for Juſtification by doing, but I only by believing; he by keeping the Law, or by living a ſober and honeſt Life, I by Gods Free Grace, through the Merits of Chriſt.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Godli.</speaker>
               <p>No, Sir, you ought to keep it as far as you are able, though not as it is the Law of Works, but as 'tis the Law of Chriſt; but you muſt not look for Righteouſneſs and Juſtification, by your keeping ths Law in any ſence (it was on this very Block the Jews of Old ſtumbled, and were broken in pieces) becauſe you have ſinned, and daily do break the Law; and the leaſt tranſgreſſion thereof, expoſeth you to the wrath and curſe of God.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Legal.</speaker>
               <p>I know I cannot perfectly keep the Law? but I will do (by the help of God) what I can; and wherein I through weakneſs do tranſgreſs, the Lord is merciful, and I truſt he will forgive me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Godli.</speaker>
               <p>Forgive you! Why he hath ſaid, he will in no wiſe clear the guilty, moreover, what the Law ſaith, it ſaith to them that are under the Law, that all mouths may be ſtopped, and the whole world become <hi>guilty</hi> before God.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Legal.</speaker>
               <p>What do you ſay? will not God forgive me who am a penitent perſon? O what a horrible Doctrine is this! I believe he will not forgive the impenitent, and they are ſuch guilty ones only that the Scripture ſpeaks of.</p>

               <p>Miſtake not Sir, all are guilty, all have broke the Law, all are under ſin and wrath; 'tis
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:66398:46"/>
not your Repentance will do; God will not forgive any man, let him be who he will, except he believes in Jeſus Chriſt, and takes hold of the Merits of his Blood, for as by the deeds of the Law no fleſh ſhall be juſtified, ſo God will not pardon your ſins, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding your Repentance, as a ſimple act of his Mercy, unleſs you fly to him through Chriſt, who hath ſatisfied his Juſtice; for what you ſay ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Chriſts glorious undertakings void and unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; and ſo does caſt a great reflection upon the wiſdom of God in ſending his Son into the World.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Legal.</speaker>
               <p>How do you make that appear?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Godli.</speaker>
               <p>Do you not ſay you'll do what you can to keep the Law; and wherein you tranſgreſs, God will through his Mercy forgive you; now if God doth accept of your obedience in keeping the Law, and forgive all your deviations, as a ſimple act of his Mercy, and that hereby you are juſtified and accepted by him, why then did he ſend Jeſus Chriſt into the World to die the curſed death of the Croſs? For if by this way Righteouſneſs and Salvation is attainable, it is evident Chriſt is dead in vain; for could not God have done all this if Chriſt had never come? Thou art a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed creature, and therefore look to Chriſt, or thou art undone.</p>

               <p>Shewing how <hi>Godlineſs</hi> came to one Mr. <hi>Formaliſt</hi>'s Door, who bid him very welcome; but he ſuſpecting his Integrity, and that he harboured divers grand E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of his, particularly one <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie;</hi> refuſed to go in: alſo How <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie</hi> came to be diſcovered; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you have his Character, or a clear and compendious Diſcription of him; ſhewing likewiſe, how Mr. <hi>Formaliſt</hi> at laſt refuſed to entertain <hi>True God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>GOdlineſs</hi> being (as I told you) informed that there was another great Profeſſor living in this Village or Town, of Religion, he tought it was convenient for him to ſee whether he might not get a Lodging in his Houſe, becauſe he was a man whom all the Neighbourhood ſaid had a great Love to <hi>True Godlineſs</hi>; nay, many verily thought he had for a long time taken up his Lodging with him, and wondered when they heard him aſk for his Houſe (for by that means they perceived he was a ſtranger to him) but it was a conſiderable time before he could find where he dwelt. For it appeared he was called by another Name, <hi>viz. Devotion</hi>; but at laſt coming by one man's door, and by another, he heard a man at Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:66398:49"/>
and he ſpoke ſo loud, that all who walked along the Street, with much eaſe might hear him; he then preſently concluded it was very probable he might dwell there; and to his door he came, and knock'd as he uſ'd to do, and was ſoon heard.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:66398:51"/>Sir, was he ever throughly wounded in the ſenſe of ſin as 'tis ſin, being convinced of the ugly and abominable Nature thereof; there being nothing in all the world more hateful to God than that; not only convinced of the evil which does attend it, or is the fruit of it, but alſo of that curſed evil there is in it, it being utterly contrary to the holy and pure Nature of God, a breach of his Law, and that which hath made a breach between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> and baſely defaced the Image of <hi>God</hi> in <hi>him,</hi> and is the abſolute cauſe of all that abominable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity that is in his heart againſt <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Me</hi> his <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Offſpring</hi>; and alſo makes man in love with the waies of the <hi>Devil,</hi> nay to be like the Devil, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to him, and to do his <hi>will?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Is there no one Sin that ſecretly he loves and lives in (the evil habit never being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) have you nor found him now and then telling Lie for his advantage ſake; or in telling of tales or ſtories, adding to them, to pleaſe the company; or to excuſe himſelf when accuſed of this or that, that ſo he may gain credit? Is he not ſometimes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertaken by Drunkenneſs? Is he not proud, mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more the Honour, praiſe and applauſe of men in what he doth in Religion, than the praiſe of God? Is he not <hi>Covetous</hi>? Doth he give according to his Ability to the poor? Doth he not rob God, to ſerve the World? I mean neglect hearing of Gods Word, and other indiſpenſable Duties, for worldly Profit ſake; and ſo prefer the World above the Word? Doth he never in Trading offend you in ſpeaking better of his Commodities than they deſerve? Is not the World more in his love and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections than <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>? Does he alwaies give good and juſt weight and meaſure, and not take unlawful profit? Doth he not make gain of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:66398:51"/>
Godlineſs, and uſe Religion as a <hi>Cloak</hi> to cover his ſecret ſins? Doth he concern himſelf for the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the Goſpel, and by his open-heartedneſs, ſhew upon that account he loves Chriſt above Son or Daughter? Is he reſolved to part with all ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to ſin againſt God, and to offend you his poor <hi>Conſcience</hi>? Doth he ſee more evil in the leaſt Sin, than in the greateſt Suffering?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Doth he deſire as much to have his Sins mortified as pardoned; to be made holy here, as well as happy hereafter? Is he as much in love with the work of holineſs, as with the wages of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Doth he love the word of God, becauſe of the purity of it? Is he willing to bear the Croſs, as well as wear the Crown, to be with Chriſt in his Temptations here, as well as with Chriſt in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altations hereafter? to live to God on earth, as well as to live with God in heaven?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Is he the ſame in private as in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick?

Doth he pray in private, as if men ſaw him, and in publick, as knowing God ſees him? Doth not his ſatisfaction more lie in his aſking of God, than in his receiving from God? Does he not ſeek more for ſuitable words in Prayer, than for a ſuitable heart? Doth not he ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy more for acute expreſſions to affect the hearts of others, than to meet with powerful impreſſions upon his own? Doth he not lengthen his Prayers before others, and hurry them over in private? Doth he as much endeavour after what he needs from God, as that which he ſeeks of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Can he bear reproofs kindly for his faults, and take them patiently; nay, and eſteem him his greateſt friend who deals moſt cordially

               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Doth he as much deſire to have his heart filled with Grace, as his head with knowledge? Doth he take as much care to make the Glory of God his end in what he doth, as the Command of God his ground in what he doth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Is he not more ſevere in preſſing the leſſer concerns of Religion, than in urging the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Doth he not require thoſe Duties of others which he himſelf is loth to practice? Is he not more curious to know other mens conditions than his own?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Hath he received a whole Chriſt with a whole heart? Firſt, A whole Chriſt compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all his Offices, and a whole heart compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all his <hi>Faculties.</hi> Hath he received Chriſt not only as a Prieſt, to die for him, but alſo as a Prince to rule over him? Doth he obey all God's Precepts, as well as believe all God's Promiſes? 2. As to his <hi>Faculties,</hi> his underſtanding may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what enlightned, but his affections may be carnal, and his will oppoſe me, being averſe to <hi>True God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</hi> Is not his <hi>Heart divided</hi>?

but really wicked; he loves the <hi>Face</hi> of <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> but is without the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>Holineſs</hi>; his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt care has been to waſh the outſide of the <hi>Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>; if he can but keep his name from being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd by men, he cares not though his Heart be grievouſly defiled before God, Should I tell you of all thoſe Luſts which he harbours in his heart, and what favour he ſhews to that <hi>Old-Man</hi> (you mentioned before) I ſhould quite ſhame him; he is a Saint indeed abroad, but a Heathen (to ſay no worſe) at home, he prays, hears, and reads, but 'tis to keep up his Credit, Name, and Eſteem amongſt many Chriſtian men of this Town; for I have often found him very weary of theſe Duties, God knows it as well as I: Nay Sir, he would ſeldom pray at all were it not to qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et me; for he doth not love my laſhes; beſides, he performs them with a ſad, cold, dead, carnal and lifeleſs ſpirit; he is much for the leſſer things of Religion (as you minded) he keeps a mighty ſtir about <hi>Mint, Aniſe,</hi> and <hi>Cummin,</hi> but quite neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects the greater and more weighty things; nay there is one thing more I will tell you, as he does not love <hi>ſtrict Godlineſs</hi> himſelf, ſo his heart is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to riſe againſt all ſuch who outdo him. Sir, he is a meer <hi>Diſſembler,</hi> yet he would be thought as religious a man as any in the <hi>Town.</hi> I find him alſo much abroad finding of faults in others, or ſpying the more that is in his Brothers eye, but never minds the beam that is in his own: nay, and he is ready to fall out with many good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, becauſe they will not follow him in <hi>Habit, Mode</hi> and <hi>Gesture,</hi> &amp;c. In a word, moſt of all thoſe black Marks of this <hi>deceitful Villain Hypocriſie,</hi> you hinted at, I find in him alſo.</p>

Sir, 'tis you who have brought ſo great a reptoach upon this <hi>poor Town</hi>*,<note place="margin">Religion.</note> and on all its <hi>Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants</hi>; Nay, and 'tis through your means I am ſo baſely villifi'd and condemned by that blind Fellow <hi>Ignorance</hi>; for he is ready to conclude, that all my Friends and true Fovourites are ſuch as your ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> meer looſe and <hi>Formal Hypocrites.</hi> Beſides, you are like to be undone and periſh for ever, unleſs you do the ſooner turn this vile Enemy of mine out of doors; for I expect no other but that you will in a little time fall into Apoſtacy: but ſhould you die firſt, yet aſſure your ſelf you will be damned; for Hell is indeed prepared for ſuch as you are; you are, poor Creature! in the worſt condition of all men; for the wicked hate you becauſe you pretend ſo much love to <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> God alſo and all good men hate you, becauſe you are not real, but only pretend love to them, being not ſincere and upright in your Profeſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Formaliſt,</hi> At this began to be very angry, being greatly offended at <hi>True Godlineſs</hi>; for he could not endure to ſee his State ript open, nor did he like to hear of his preſent nor future miſery; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſwaded by Mr. <hi>Vain-hope, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief,</hi> and <hi>Good-Opinion,</hi> to think his condition for all this might be ſafe enough; however <hi>Vain-hope</hi> told him, though at preſent his ſtate might be doubtful, yet he ſhould have many daies on earth, and that he might repent, and ſet all things at rights before he died; whoſe word and promiſe he adventur'd to take, and ſo bid <hi>True Godlineſs</hi> be gone; at this, great grief ſeem'd to ſeize upon <hi>True Godlineſs,</hi> and

               <p>Shewing how <hi>Godlineſs</hi> travelling further into the Town (called <hi>Religion</hi>) ſaw abundance of People, who had been <hi>great Profeſſors,</hi> getting away out of the <hi>Town</hi> as faſt as they could. Shewing alſo what Diſcourſe he had with one of them; wherein the Nature and Danger of <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> is plainly opened.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <hi>GOdlineſs</hi> had no ſooner left <hi>Formaliſt</hi>'s door, and gone a little further into the Town <hi>Religion,</hi> but he eſpied a great number of People haſting out as faſt as they could go: nay, he obſerved ſome of them ran, though others of them went very ſoftly: At firſt he wondred what the matter was; becauſe the <hi>Town</hi> was a little before look'd upon to be a very ſafe and honourable place to dwell in, as any in all the Countrey, and had as <hi>great</hi> and <hi>glorious Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges</hi> belonging to it; but upon enquiry, he was told there was a number of <hi>Lions, Evening-Wolves,</hi> and other evil <hi>Beaſts</hi> (who had for a long time been ſhut up in their <hi>Dens</hi>) a getting out, and they having a great while been kept without prey, they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid they ſhould be torn in pieces: But he obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving which way they went, was the more amazed; for he perceived plainly they all ſteer'd their courſe directly towards the great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Babylon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>True Godlineſs</hi> at this ſeemed ſo mightily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, that he could not let them all paſs without ſpeaking to them; and minding one of them to look like a <hi>ſober</hi> man, though he hung down his head as if he had been aſhamed, reſolved to have a little Diſcourſe with him, to whom he ſpake after this manner.</p>

               <p>Sir, What is the matter you leave this <hi>Town</hi> and haſte away ſo faſt? When you firſt took up your dwelling here, did you not intend to abide in it as long as you liv'd?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Apoſtate</speaker>
               <p>(for that it ſeems was his Name) truly, Sir, I did intend it; I had a great love for this poor <hi>Town</hi>; but I muſt remove out and be gone now.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Godli.</speaker>
               <p>Why muſt you? Is there a neceſſity laid upon you to acquit this place, this honourable Town <hi>Religion?</hi>

               <speaker>Apoſtate,</speaker>
               <p>Sir I ſhall be deſtroyed elſe; for the Walls of late are much gone to decay; I do not ſee that ſafety to reſide here as formerly: Beſides, they ſay there are a great number of <hi>Lions, Romiſh Wolves,</hi> and other <hi>Beasts of Prey</hi> a breaking out upon us; and I am afraid if I ſhould eſcape with my life, yet having a few Sheep and Lambs, they will devour them: Truly Sir, I do it to ſave what I have, yet I wiſh very well to the place.</p>

               <p>'Tis very like you ſpeak the truth in this; but Sir, pray whither are you going?</p>

Come, go back again with me, and I will dwell with you and be a ſure defence to you, ſo that you will not be hurt, let Lions Woolfs, and Devils too do what they can, My name is <hi>True Godlineſs,</hi> Sir I have ſaved many thouſands from ruin in as great danger as you can be in.</p>

               <p>Sir there will be no ſafe living for me, I muſt acquit the place, the Town is beſieged.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Godli.</speaker>
               <p>What though it is beſieged God is able to defend it, and will be a wall of fire about it; but why Sir, do you chuſe that great City you ſpeak of for your Habitation? I perceive you intend to go far enough.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Apoſt.</speaker>
               <p>Sir don't miſtake me I do not intend to go ſo far; but to return again when the danger is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, at preſent I will go but a little way out of the town.</p>

               <speaker>Godli.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, you ſhew your ſelf to be a naughty, and trayterous and hypocritical perſon; will you leave this Town in its diſtreſs? if the danger be great which attends it, you had the more need to abide in it, to ſtrengthen and encourage the poor Inhabitants. Pray Sir, do not ſhew ſo baſe and cowardly a Spirit: What is this leſs than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray rhe Town to the enemies? Is not the ſtrength of any place the People? Beſides, your flying mightily encourages the Adverſaries; for by this means they may think to frighten all out, and then with much eaſe take the Town, and utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it: Alſo you weaken the hands, and ſadly
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:66398:55"/>
grieve the hearts of all true Proteſtants, whoſe chief Treaſure lies in the Town, and cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out; and it being alſo their Spiritual Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive place, they reſolve to abide in it to the laſt, let what will come, You ſay you intend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again when the danger is over. What dangers you ſee above others, to move you to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit the Town, I know not; but let me tell you, few who leave this Town out of fear of humane loſs or danger, do return again.</p>
               <p>You ſay, you intend to go but a little way; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, you can't tell where you ſhall ſtop; when once you leave the <hi>True Religion,</hi> you deſert Gods gracious protection; you may not only cleave to Papiſtry, but Atheiſm, or any thing: Come go back, let me ſave you from a fall: Why will you leave that Religion you have been ſo long eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Apoſt.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I retain the ſame Principles that I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly held, and my love is the ſame to the Town as it was.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Godli,</speaker>
               <p>Poor wretch, you own the Principles of the <hi>True Religion,</hi> and yet cleave to <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Superſtition.</hi> The three Worthies of old by your example might have retained Faith and right Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in their hearts, of the true God, and yet have bowed down to the Golden Image, and ſo needed not to have expoſed themſelves to a hot fiery Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace.</p>
               <p>Nay, by this Doctrine, who needs ſuffer Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution? Beſides, it renders all the Martyrs of old to be meer fools and madmen. What do you ſay, will you return? my company one would think, might allure you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Apoſtate,</speaker>
               <p>No Sir, I have formerly had your company, and I don't find you ſo pleaſant a
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:66398:56"/>
Companion; beſides, the Town is ſadly divided amongſt themſelves, thoſe who love you, do not agree,</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Godli.</speaker>
               <p>Nay Sir, now you are out; for you and I never dwelt together yet; for if I had ever took up my dwelling with you, I would have kept you from this great Fall: you will prove your ſelf a meer Hypocrite, one that never loved God nor this Town <hi>Religion</hi> in your heart. Sir, Upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Sincerity of heart preſerves from Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and what though the Town is divided, it is my great grief to ſee it, but you had the more need to abide in it, to do what you can to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them to love and Union, however to unite in Affection. Come, humble your ſelf before God for this great Sin, and let us dwell together now, and thou ſhalt abide ſecure, notwithſtanding the Diviſions within, and Troubles without, and have moſt ſweet peace, and inward joy; yea ſuch as thou never hadſt in all thy Life. What doſt ſay?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Godli.</speaker>
               <p>Well, ſince I ſee I cannot perſwade you to return, but that you are reſolved to leave <hi>Religion,</hi> and not receive <hi>True Godlineſs,</hi> I will tell you what your preſent ſtate is, and what your future portion is like to be for ever here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>

               <speaker>Godli.</speaker>
               <p>I do not care whether you do or no, I will ſhew it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It appears (as I hinted before) that you were never truly converted,<note place="margin">Matth. <hi>13.</hi>
                  </note> being no part of that good ground Chriſt ſperks of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:66398:56"/>Secondly, You are (it appears) forſaken of God; he hath left you, or elſe you would never think of cleaving to Myſtery <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Either God will let <hi>Conſcience</hi> out againſt you to torment you (as he did upon <hi>Francis Spira</hi>) or elſe wholly give you up (as he did <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old) to your own hearts Luſts, to walk in your own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Your Sin tends towards the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, that ſhall never be forgiven, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this world nor in that which is to come: for you have been a perſon (I hear) much enlightned,<note place="margin">

               <p>Eighthly, The place you are going to, is like ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to be deſtroyed.

                  <hi>Godlineſs</hi> having thus parted with him, at laſt he met a man travelling into the Town <hi>Religion,</hi> being not very rich nor very poor, but in a middle ſtate, between both; and he lookt as if he had a mind to take up his dwelling in this place; for he enquired where he might have a convenient Houſe? <hi>Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> was much pleaſed with this perſon, becauſe when others were haſting to leave the Town, he was haſting into it; beſides, he had a very ſerious coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Shewing how <hi>Godlineſs</hi> coming to one <hi>Thoughtful</hi>'s Houſe, found there his <hi>Friend Conſideration,</hi> whom he had a long time ſought for, alſo the great oppoſition <hi>Conſideration</hi> met with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <hi>GOdlineſs</hi> peing not without hopes of finding <hi>Serious Conſideration</hi> (for ſo ſometimes he is called) in or near this place, chanc'd to knock (as you heard before) at a mans door, who was newly come to dwell in the Town <hi>Religion.</hi> Now this perſon formerly (as it appears) had been a very great Enemy to <hi>True Godlineſs,</hi> having liv'd a grievous looſe and profuſe Life, and like the poor Prodigal, waſted all his chiefeſt Subſtance. <hi>Godlineſs</hi> had not long knock'd and called at his door, before he liſtned to him, and ſpake within himſelf to this purpoſe; Who is this that is come to my door? ſure, ſaid he, this is a voice different from any I ever heard in all my life; and he doth not knock alſo as others uſe to do; at laſt he cried out, Who is there? who is it that is at my door? your Name Sir.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Godli.</speaker>
               <p>Soul. Chriſt is at the door; and I his noble and renowned <hi>Off-ſpring True Godlineſs.</hi>

               <p>He told him his Name might very well be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led looſe and ungodly <hi>Prodigal</hi>; for (ſaid he) I have hitherto lived a very wicked life; but ſome call me of late <hi>Thoughtful,</hi> becauſe I am (bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God) newly come to my ſelf, by think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon my latter end, and the evil of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer waies.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Godli.</speaker>
               <p>But why doſt thou chuſe to take up thy dwelling in this Village now, when ſo many are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thoughtful,</hi> Sir, 'tis becauſe I hear it is the beſt Town in all the Country to ſecure a man from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in evil times, provided I can but get a place in one of its ſtrong holds in the heart of the Town; for I have heard there is no ſafe dwelling at the Towns-end, no nor any where in the Subburbs.</p>
               <p>Beſides, I was told lately that <hi>Babylon,</hi> where I have dwelt till now of late, wil ſuddenly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed: I do it indeed to ſave my own Soul; I am Sir, deſirous to find out (if it may be) where true peace, happineſs and eternal felicity is to be had; for I ſee they are not to be found in thoſe paths I formerly walked; I mean, in the waies of <hi>Riches, Honour,</hi> and the <hi>Pleaſures</hi> of this World.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Godli.</speaker>
               <p>I commend thee honeſt <hi>Thoughtful</hi>; thou haſt done wiſely, and like a conſiderate man; pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thee let me come in and dwell with thee, and thou wilt find this poor Town the ſafeſt and moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure place in theſe dangerous times, in all the world. Sir, I have wandred about a long time, travelling from place to place to ſeek for one whom I bear much good will to but hitherto I have not
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:66398:59"/>
found him; his Name is <hi>Conſideration</hi>; and many things more he ſaid to make him in love with <hi>True Godlineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this, <hi>Conſideration,</hi> who, it ſeems was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, whiſpered <hi>Thoughtful</hi> in his ear, and ſaid, This is he that can alone make thee happy, if he be <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, ſincerely</hi> and <hi>heartily embraced</hi> and <hi>entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Is it not good for thee to muſe upon the worth and Excellent Nature of thy Soul; thou art made a man, and therefore for a nobler and higher end and employment (ſure) than eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſleeping and playing, and wholly to mind thy Trade and ſeculiar Affairs, and to enjoy ſenſual pleaſures (a happineſs which Beaſts arrives to as well as thee) for this glorious Soul which lies in thy Boſom, is capable of knowing God, and of enjoying Union and Communion with him for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſo that all thoſe who ſuffer the Honours, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and pleaſures of this World to take up and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs their hearts, go aſtray, and err from the great end of their Creation. Alas there is nothing doubtleſs can fill the deſires of thy Soul, or be its <hi>Summum Bonum,</hi> but God himſelf: Thou haſt hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto ſuffered thy affections and deſires to run af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whatſoever thou couldeſt think might yeild thee true Felicity; but it is evident there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing thou canſt find here below, that can ſatisfie thy thirſty and ever-craving Soul. <hi>Riches,</hi> which ſometimes thy heart hath been ſo much ſet upon, cannot be thy <hi>Summum Bonum,</hi> or chief happineſs; for they are uncertain, fleeting, and variable things; and let a man have never ſo much of them, yet he is ſtill craving and deſiring more, ſo that 'tis as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaies, <hi>He that deſireth Silver, ſhall not be ſatisfied with Silver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, Honours</hi> are of like nature; and beſides
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:66398:59"/>
their vanity, they depend on the minds, will and humors of men, who are changeable and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, Pleaſures</hi> and <hi>Voluptuouſneſs,</hi> they are common (as I told thee) with Beaſts as well as men, and alſo have annexed their ſting and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation when they are paſt.</p>
               <p>Beſides all this, <hi>Conſideration,</hi> to induce him to open to <hi>True Godlineſs,</hi> bid him aſk his Soul where it was, what it was a doing, and whither it was a going?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> He endeavoured to ſhew him where his Soul now was, and made it out by the help of Gods Word, that it was in the gall of bitterneſs, and in the bond of iniquity, being under the Law, and Curſe of God, both in reſpect of Original and Actual Sin; he having not yet clos'd with Chriſt, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>True Godlineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Then as to what he was a doing; he bid him ſee if he did not neglect that one thing needful. Have you, ſaid <hi>Conſideration,</hi> made Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion your chief buſineſs ſince you come to live in this place? Have you not rather ſpent too much of your time about Notions and airy Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whither are you a going? ſaid he: Are you fit (being well prepared) to die? Are you a going the way to Heaven? Sure that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, unleſs you receive <hi>True Godlineſs</hi>; for I have heard that he conſiſts in a right Faith, as well as in a holy Life. Oh what Coſt, Labour, Pains, Means, Motives and Arguments hath God uſed to make men ſenſible of the everlaſting intereſt of their Souls, and to engage them to a ſerious prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for another World.</p>
               <p>And this ſerious preparation muſt neceſſarily be
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:66398:60"/>
a through Work of Regeneration, Faith and ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs converſation; for the Nature of the Means (ſaith he) muſt ever be ſuitable and agreeable to the Nature of the End. And Heaven being a holy place, nothing but perfect Holineſs reigning there, ſo it was impoſſible to enter into it hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, without a conſiderable progreſs was made in Holineſs here; and that it was not to be thought a man could reach to the higheſt ſtep of a Ladder without aſcending the lowermoſt firſt. Who (ſaid he) ever hoped for a Crop of Corn without ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any) or expected to reap Wheat, and ſowed nothing but Tares?</p>
               <p>He laid alſo before him the Nature and Holineſs of God, his infinite hatred of ſin, and great ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity againſt all unbelieving and impenitent Souls, together with the perfect knowledge he had of the hearts, thoughts and waies of the Children of men; together with his dreadful Judgments, Commands, Threats, and precious Promiſes.</p>
               <p>He brought to his mind alſo the evil of Sin, ſhewing him what an abominable thing it was for men to ſeek to pleaſe, obey, and do the will of the Devil, and offend, diſobey, and croſs the will of God. Nay and he began to ſpeak of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of <hi>True Godlineſs</hi> alſo, and what he ſhould gain by embracing him, and letting <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>the Spirit</hi> of <hi>Chriſt, Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Grace of Chriſt, Chriſt</hi> and <hi>True Godlineſs</hi> reign in his heart. Nay, he had ſo much to ſay, that had he not been op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and baſely obſtructed (with ſome other help) <hi>Thoughtful</hi> had preſently opened the door to <hi>True Godlineſs</hi>: But alas, on a ſudden there was great Diſturbance in the Houſe, and poor <hi>Conſideration</hi> went to the walls, and was almoſt utterly expelled his Tabernacle.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:66398:60"/>Now the Enemies he met with, were theſe; <hi>Difficulty, Sloth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The chiefeſt Enemies of <hi>Conſideration</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, Security, Danger, World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Cares,</hi> and <hi>Carnal Company:</hi> Theſe and many other Enemies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to obſtruct and hinder <hi>Conſideration</hi> about this great and importunate buſineſs of opening to <hi>True Godlineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt <hi>Difficulty</hi> ſpake after this manner; Sir;<note place="margin">Difficulty</note> Do not trouble your ſelf to ſtudy to find out theſe great Myſteries of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Godlineſs</hi>; for it is a Work too hard and difficult for you to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; there is nothing in the World that is more abſtruſe and myſterious; therefore to muſe upon them, would be loſt labour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sloth</hi> told him,<note place="margin">Sloth.</note> it was a laborious and toilſom Work, and 'twould be great wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſomneſs to him, if the <hi>Difficulty</hi> did not make it impoſſible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Deficiency</hi> ſaid,<note place="margin">Deficiency.</note> he was a man of a weak underſtanding, and thoſe things were matters for the Learned and moſt knowing men of all to ſtudy; nay, and that many of them too, notwithſtanding all their profound Learning, Proficiency and ſkill in the Tongues, could hardly attain to the right knowledge of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Security</hi> endeavoured to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear his Condition was very good and ſafe now,<note place="margin">Security.</note> and that he had <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Godlineſs</hi> enough, without troubling himſelf further, and that he exceeded in holineſs many men that had lived long in that Town. Moreover he told him that he had followed the Counſel of <hi>Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> too much already.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:66398:61"/>
                  <hi>Danger</hi> ſpake to ſeveral things: 1. That to give place to him,<note place="margin">Danger.</note> would let in his Enemy <hi>Melancholy,</hi> which might endanger his Life. Do you not ſee (ſaith he) how uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable this Fellow <hi>Conſideration</hi> hath made many brave men, cauſing them by thinking upon their latter Ends, to hang down their heads like a Bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſh, fold their Arms, and ſpend their daies in Tears and Weeping; hearken not to him, for he will certainly infuſe ſad thoughts into your Mind, and give you nothing but Gall and Vinegar to drink.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He ſaid moreover, <hi>Conſideration</hi> had made many men go beſides themſelves; and if he did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to him about this Affair, he would be diſtracted.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He inſinuated alſo, that if he did <hi>ſeriouſly muſe</hi> upon this Matter, or give place to <hi>Conſideration,</hi> ſo that <hi>Godlineſs</hi> came to be let in, he would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, and utterly ruin'd, the Times were ſuch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Worldly Cares</hi> proved as great an Enemy to <hi>Conſideration,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Worldly Cares.</note> as any of them; for he could not ſeriouſly muſe or think up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Eternity, or the preſent condition his poor Soul was in; he was ſo hurried in his Mind about the affairs of this Life; nay, no ſooner at any ſeaſon that he ſet himſelf to ruminate or ponder them in his mind, but <hi>Worldly Cares</hi> would expel and drive ſuch thoughts away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Old Companions,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Evil Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</note> and <hi>Carnal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany</hi> did greatly abuſe <hi>Conſideration,</hi> by endeavouring to make him out of love with a <hi>virtuous Life</hi>: Theſe labour'd to fawn him into Miſery, and tickle him into an eternity of Torment; they turn'd <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Godlineſs</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Jeſt, and made the Precepts of the Goſpel mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for Railery, and told him that thoſe men that ſeemed moſt ſerious, were the moſt ſeditious, and

               <p>Whereas to undertake great and hazardous, and dangerous Atchievements, for worldly advantages, this is notwithſtanding preſently undertook; men do not care how difficult the work is if it be but profitable; and ſhall this be a ſtumbling block in thy way?

               <p>'Tis not becauſe <hi>Conſiderations</hi> about Heaven and Happineſs are ſo hard and difficult; but becauſe men have no will nor love to theſe things, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things are more in their affections.

—Strong Stupidity! Men do not think it hard to carry talents of Lead, or mountains of ſin on their backs, and yet they think <hi>Conſideration</hi> difficult, who like a faithful friend, would tell them how to be rid of that load that will, except they get faith in Chriſt, or receive <hi>True Godlineſs</hi> into their hearts, ſink them down into the loweſt pit; they do not think it hard to dig into Hell, yet they think <hi>Conſideration</hi> hard, who would teach them a way to quench that fire; they do not think it hard to be oppreſſed by a bloody Uſurper, and yet they think <hi>Conſideration</hi> hard, which would help them to ſhake him off. O fools and ſlow of heart! they that have courage to meet an Army in the Field, and have confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to laugh at the glittering Spear and Shield, they that have courage to plow the Sea, to face the mouth of a Canon, to ſtand a volley of Shot, to fight Duels, to endure the noiſe of Guns, to hear the claſhing of Swords and Spears, and lie on the cold ground many nights together, to have an Arm or Leg cut off; have they courage to do all this, and ſhalt thou think <hi>Conſideration</hi> about theſe great things too hard for thee?

thoughts of being overcome by this deceitful and timerous fellow <hi>Difficulty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, As to what <hi>Deficiency</hi> ſays,<note place="margin">Deficiency.</note> that thou art a man of a weak underſtanding; alas, thou canſt perceive that Gold is better than Glaſs or Rattles, and that Pearls are better than Pebbles; thou art able to perceive thou art mortal and muſt die, and doſt know when a Bone is broke, 'tis good to have it ſet; and that Food is good for thee when thou art hungry; and that 'tis good to get Clothes on to hide thy nakedneſs, and art not able to <hi>conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the need there is of food to feed thy Soul, and Clothes to cover the nakedneſs of thy Soul; and that it is good to get Grace to enrich thy Soul. Art able to find out how grievous 'tis to be caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a furnace of fire; and canſt not think that 'tis worſe to be caſt into a fire that cannot be quenched? Nay, and have not weak and ſimple ones in their own eyes, and in the eyes of others too, attained to the ſkill of <hi>Conſideration</hi> about their eternal ſtate, nay and have wonderfully outdone the wiſe and learned ones of the World in it too; <hi>Knowledge is easie unto him that hath <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi>

               <p>Thirdly, As for what <hi>Sloth</hi> ſaith, thou haſt cauſe to abhor him, for he is a beggerly Villain, and deſerves to be drove not only out of thy Houſe, but out of the Town and World too, for
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:66398:66"/>
he never did any man the leaſt good; caſt him out as a Vagabond: How now <hi>Thoughtful,</hi> wouldſt thou not take pains? Remember the ſloathful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhall beg at Harveſt, and have nothing. Through his means, and <hi>Idleneſs</hi> his Brother, thy Houſe is ready to fall through, and thy Vineyard is grown all over with Thorns and Nettles; and yet he would not have thee <hi>conſider</hi> thy danger till 'tis too late to eſcape it. Oh how many have loſt their ſouls by this bloody wretch? What good comes of <hi>Idleneſs?</hi> Beſides do you not ſee how the men of the World hate him? They will not hearken to him, but will in deſpight of him <hi>conſider</hi> of fit waies and means to get Bread to eat, and Clothes to put on; nay, and ſeek out through great indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry rare projects to get ſtore of Riches; and wilt thou be drawn away by him from thinking on the ready way to be made rich, great and renowned for ever? 'Tis the diligent hand that hath the Promiſe:<note place="margin">Prov. 2.4.</note> thou muſt <hi>ſeek for Wiſdom as for ſilver, and ſearch for her as for hid Treaſure.</hi> Nay, and do not think neither, I put too great a burden upon thee, for thou maiſt perceive thou needeſt not to take greater pains about this ineſtimable Jewel, than the men of the World take to get the periſhing things of this Life; nay, if men did beſtow half the labour about the good of their Souls, as they beſtow about getting the World and providing for their bodies, what happy creatures might they be?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, As touching what that timorous faint-hearted <hi>Fellow Danger</hi> laid before thee, in reſpect of letting in <hi>Melancholy</hi>; this is a meer deceit, for there is a vaſt difference between <hi>ſerious Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:66398:66"/>
and deſtructive Melancholly, a man is not therefore ſad becauſe he will not Swear, Rant, Whore and be Drunk. <hi>Conſideration</hi> will let thee ſee that thoſe men who are taken ſo much with vain ſports and merriment, have the leaſt cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce of any men in the world.</p>
               <p>Jollities are, as one obſerves, much like <hi>Attila</hi>'s Nuptials, whoſe Wedding-Day proved his Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. Who would hazzard an Eternity of Joy for a Moments time of vain and empty pleaſure? None can rejoyce ſo heartily as he that hath God for his portion, and hath his Name written in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conſideration</hi> will let thee ſee that whatſoever vain men may ſay, prate and boaſt of touching Joy and Pleaſures, yet there is no delight and felicity like that which is found in the waies of True Virtue; that Goodneſs is the beſt ſecurity, and that the Joy of the whole Earth is Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> that in this Garden are the ſweeteſt Roſes, the moſt odoriferous Flowers, the moſt Fragrant Plants, Roſes, which have no Prickles under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath; (not like carnal Delights) whoſe Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers fade and wither away; nor like the frotthy mirth which the laughter of Fools affords.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conſideration</hi> would let thee ſee that thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious perſons who look dejected and melancholly to a carnal eye, have Joys within, which no ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger intermeddles with, and as little as they make of chearfulneſs, yet they carry in their Breaſt that which can make their life a perpetual Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilee.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are Fools that account the life of a Chriſtian Madneſs, and his inward peace an aiery fiction; none is ſuch a Phanatick as he who che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes

a Serpent in his boſome, that will certainly ſting him to death, who never ſows, yet thinks to reap a good crop at harveſt; that may have glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Robes to cloath him, and yet values his own naſty Rags above them, or elſe chuſe to go naked; who hates, and ſeeks to deſtroy his beſt friends, for the ſake of whom he is not deſtroyed; who thinks to go to Heaven, and yet walks the direct way to Hell. Can there be greater Madneſs than to prefer a Stone before Bread, or feed upon Huſks with the Swine, when there is all good things to be had if they would but ſeek out for them; Can there be greater madneſs than to value a baſe Luſt above God, Chriſt, and eternal Glory?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whereas <hi>Danger</hi> tells thee (to obſtruct <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration</hi> from opening to me) of the evilneſs of the times, and that if I am let in, thou wilt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, know then if I am kept out, there is no way to eſcape, but ruin'd thou wilt be; no danger like Soul-danger; he can never be undone that hath God for his portion, and Heaven for his inheritance; loſe thy Soul, and what haſt thou more? and unleſs thou conſider the ſooner, and open to me, thou canſt not ſave it; for <hi>without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Worldly Cares</hi> I know hinders my dear Friend <hi>Conſideration</hi> as much as any thing; he would perſwade thee thou haſt no time to think on God nor Godlineſs, having a Trade to follow, a Family to provide for, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But ſhall thoſe things hinder thee from thinking of any thing elſe? Is there not one thing more needful; <hi>viz.</hi> to make much, or ſeriouſly think on me, and of the concerns of thy Soul, when thou art at work, or about thy ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:66398:67"/>
Affairs, when thou goeſt out, and when thou comeſt in, when thou lieſt down, and when thou riſeſt up; thy heart may be with God, when thy hand is otherwiſe imployed: True, if the World is got into thy heart, there can be little room for <hi>Conſideration</hi> nor <hi>True Godlineſs</hi>; a continual hurry of Buſineſs puts out the Eye whereby it ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon it ſelf: But ſhall the Earth keep out Heaven, and the Prince of Darkneſs ſhut out the Prince of Light, and Briars and Thorns choak the good Seed? Shall <hi>Worldly Cares</hi> and Buſineſs be thy chiefeſt Gueſts, whom thou biddeſt welcome? and ſhall Chriſt ſtand at thy door as a neglected ſtranger? Shall Thoughts be cheriſhed about getting the World, and ſerious <hi>Conſideration</hi> be cruſhed, who would put thee in a way how to get Heaven? But remember this, he that has no time to open to Chriſt here, Chriſt will find no time to open to him hereafter. Can the World help thee to Peace and Pardon on a Death-Bed, or Riches deliver thee in the day of Wrath?</p>
               <p>Sixthly, As to what thy <hi>Old Companions</hi> lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee to render me odious, if thou mind or regard them, adieu for ever: they that hate ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs themſelves muſt needs diſlike it in others; Theſe are the Devils Agents, whom he ſends a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad into the World to deflowr Virtue; theſe are his Factors, by whom he draws men into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Chains of Darkneſs; theſe ſtrive to put me (<hi>True Godlineſs</hi>) into a Wolves Skin; then ſet all the Dogs in the Town upon me. This Age hath bred more Monſters of wickedneſs than many A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges before it. <hi>Shun</hi> keeping Company with theſe <hi>Scoffers</hi> and <hi>Contemners</hi> of <hi>True Godlineſs,</hi> for the

Lord's ſake. As thou art come into the Town of <hi>Religion,</hi> ſo let the truly Religious be thy Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, who will inſtead of hindring, help ſerious <hi>Conſideration.</hi> What ground is there to think a man ſhould mind the true intereſt of his Soul, that keeps Company with perſons who makes a Sport and Maygame of <hi>Serious Conſideration</hi>? He that would keep his Garden and precious Flowers ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely, muſt be ſure whatever he does to keep out the Hogs. What is he that keeps company with Sinners, but a companion of Sinners? and ſociety in Sin ſtrangely takes off from the heinouſneſs of it: Alſo men may judg of a Perſon by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany he keeps; as is a man's Company, ſuch is the man, and as is his Company here, ſuch it is like to be hereafter. O how do ſinners harden one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in waies of Wickedneſs! They think there is ſome comfort in having aſſociates in Miſery.

him the outward danger he would be in, if <hi>True Godlineſs</hi> was embraced; he told him, he was like to ſuffer great Perſecution, it being the portion of all who entertained <hi>True Godlineſs,</hi> in ſo much that his very life might be in danger; but <hi>Godlineſs</hi> comforted him ſweetly with many precious <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes;</hi> telling him alſo he had ſuch a glorious <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue</hi> to attend him, which he would bring into his Houſe with him, that he need not to fear any difficulty, provided that he would but let him in; but he ſeeing he was not able to open the door, his enemies being too ſtrong for him, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his own ſtrength: To his joy he told him, there was one friend of his, whom, if he could prevail with to come into his aſſiſtance, he would ſoon make the way clear, and open the door. Who is that? said <hi>Thoughtful, Godlineſs</hi> then diſcovered immediately, the excellency of his <hi>Perſon,</hi> and the nature of his <hi>Operations,</hi> by which he ſoon underſtood it was the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi>; upon this he was not a little glad, but preſently cryed out as one whoſe life is in danger, to God to ſend the Holy Spirit to aſſiſt him, <hi>O Lord, the Spirit, the holy Spirit,</hi> now Lord! thus he cry'd, and preſently there was ſtrange ſtruglings indeed, yea, ſuch a conflict, that he never met with in all his life, <hi>Judgment</hi> in the combate behaved himſelf bravely; <hi>Conſideration</hi> was not wanting; <hi>Conſcience</hi> laid on home blows, being back'd with <hi>Endeavour,</hi> alias <hi>Laborious</hi>; but at laſt, in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the battel, in comes the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> and with him <hi>Faith,</hi> and ſome other of <hi>Godlineſs</hi>'s Attendants, and the door flew open, and <hi>Old Man</hi> immediately went to the walls, crying out <hi>quarter,</hi> pleading his great <hi>Age,</hi> but had no mercy ſhewed

him. <hi>Wilful-will</hi> ſtraitway ſubjected himſelf (that Scripture being made good, <hi>My people ſhall be willing in the day of my power</hi>) and became <hi>Thoughtful</hi>'s very good Servant, <hi>Carnal Affections</hi> changed their minds, and were made heavenly, and ſo they abode, to his great joy, until his dying day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>True Godlineſs</hi> being now entred into his Houſe, with his Attendance, <hi>Thoughtful</hi> was not a little comforted.

               <p>Now the two firſt glorious Companies who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend <hi>True Godlineſs</hi> here, theſe entred in with him immediately, and the other Glories, <hi>Thoughtful</hi> was ſure of poſſeſſing after a few daies, ſo that he was wonderfully fortified againſt all Domeſtick Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or foreign approaching dangers whatſoever; for he could not but expect that new Troubles would be raiſed againſt him both from within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out: And ſo indeed it ſuddenly came to paſs; for <hi>Apollyon</hi> the curſed Prince of Darkneſs firſt raiſed up all his ſcattered forces which ſtill remained within, who lurked in holes and ſecure corners of his houſe; for particularly <hi>Old-man</hi> though he was dangerouſly wounded, his head broke, and laid a bleeding, yet it appears he was not quite dead, yet was committed cloſe priſoner under the charge of one of <hi>Godlineſs</hi> his Servants, called <hi>Holy Revenge</hi>; and though he had a ſtrict Command to kill, him yet he ſaw he could not preſently do it; by which means it fell out, that in a little time he ſeemed to revive again; and poor <hi>Thoughtful</hi> thereby was continually plagu'd with <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling Sin</hi> to his dying day, which was a great grief to him, and an hindrance alſo to <hi>True Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> at all times; and the worſt of all was, this <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Corruption,</hi> alias <hi>Old-man,</hi> alias <hi>Body of ſin,</hi> getting too great power by the treachery of Mrs. <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Apollyon,</hi> the Prince of Darkneſs; for they laying before him his manifold evils, and remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in holy Duties, perſwaded him that he harbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in his houſe an Enemy of <hi>True Godlineſs,</hi> called <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> and that he was like upon that account to loſe all his hopes here, and that happineſs which
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:66398:76"/>
                  <hi>Godlineſs</hi> aſſured him of hereafter; and had not <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerety</hi> come in with <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> he had been utterly undone; but as God would have it, <hi>Self-clearing,</hi> by the help of <hi>poor Conſcience,</hi> made it appear to him, that <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> was not hid in his houſe, nor in the leaſt countenanced by him; for firſt, they made it out he had a general hatred of all iniquity, and did not allow of, nor connive at any ſin what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, by the aid of <hi>Spiritual Indignation</hi>: And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That there was no one duty which he was convinced of, but he readily ſubjected to it by the help of <hi>New Obedience.</hi> Thirdly, That he was mighty careful of, and had alwaies (by the help of <hi>Chriſtian Watchwel</hi>) kept a ſtrict eye over Mrs. <hi>Heart</hi> whom he moſt of all miſtruſted, and had great Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of. Fourthly, That he reſted not upon the external performance of any Duty, but did all he did, to the praiſe and glory of God, by the help of true love. Fifthly, that he was the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in private, which he was in publick, by the aſſiſtance of filial fear. Sixthly, and that alſo he gave according to his ability, at all times to <hi>Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> (Chriſts Miniſter) and to the poor Saints; the one by the aid of <hi>New Obedience, Bounty, Liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>Godly Zeal,</hi> and the other by the help of <hi>Chriſtian Charity.</hi> Seventhly, that he did nothing to be ſeen of men, or for vain glory ſake, by the directions of <hi>Holy Ends</hi> and <hi>Aims.</hi> Eighthly, That there was done by the power of <hi>Heavenly New man.</hi> Ninthly, and that he was alwaies conſtant in his love to, and his eſteem of <hi>True Godlineſs,</hi> being as much for the work of Godlineſs, as for the wages by the aſſiſtances of <hi>Faithful.</hi> Tenthly, That he did not inordinately love, nor ſet his affections upon the things of this life, by the help of temperance and ſobriety. Eleventhly, that he laboured to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:66398:76"/>
live a ſpotleſs Life, being taught ſo to do by ſweet <hi>Purity</hi> and harmleſs Innocency. Twelfthly, that he bore up bravely in the profeſſion of the Goſpel, not being aſhamed, nor afraid to own Jeſus Chriſt before men, by the means of <hi>ſtability</hi> and <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Courage.</hi> Thirteenthly, and that he did not faint under afflictions and tryals, by the help of bleſſed experience, patience, and precious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Fourteenthly, That he was not corrupt in principle, nor led into errour, by the means of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent knowledg.</p>
               <p>Now Conſcience and ſelf-clearing having thus freed <hi>Thoughtful</hi> from the falſe Charge about harbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Hypocriſie, he came to perceive what excellent advantage he had, and ſhould receive by Godlineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes noble and heavenly Retinue, and hereupon he fell ſo in love with them, that he never would go any where, nor do any work without their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; which <hi>Apollyon</hi> perceiving, knew it was in vain to aſſault him any more in that ſort, but being fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with helliſh rage and malice againſt him, he raiſed up mighty forces and powers upon him, from without; for firſt, he ſtirr'd up abundance of baſe Fellows of the worſer ſort, to abuſe him, amongſt which were theſe following, <hi>Hate-good, Time-ſerver, Pride, Toſs-pot, Outſide, Ryot, Ignorance, Belly-god, Hard-heart, Scoffer, Pleaſe-all, Love-luſt, Make-bate, Giddy-head, Pick-thank, Rob-Saint, Tempori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer, Idolater, Oppoſer, Avarice, Shameleſs, Raſh, Highminded, Lofty, Sear'd-Conſcience,</hi> and many more of like ſort, like Bees compaſſed him about, miſcalled and abuſed him in a cruel and unmerciful manner; which made him wonder what the cauſe ſhould be, but at laſt he perceived the ground and reaſon of it was, only becauſe he had received <hi>True Godlineſs.</hi>

            </argument>
            <p>
               <hi>THoughtful Chriſtian,</hi> for ſo now we muſt call him, notwithſtanding all the high and unutte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Bleſſings, Riches and Honour he had arrived at by his late embracing <hi>True Godlineſs,</hi> remained ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſad and <hi>melancholy,</hi> being attended with many deſponding Cogitations, by perceiving not only the great Diſtreſſes and Troubles which his Wife and Children were like to meet with in this world, but alſo what ſad, unſettled and unhappy daies he was fallen into, and of the abounding Evils and horrible Blaſphemies which ſtar'd him in the face where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he came; together with the low and deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition the Church of Chriſt and True Religion was in, in this diſmal hour, which <hi>Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> perceiving, told him of one <hi>Contentment,</hi> whom he ſaw he had not yet found; and that if he could but obtain that favour to perſwade him to dwell with him, his mind would remain ſweetly ſettled and compoſed, and that he would enjoy all calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſerenity of Soul imaginable, being delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from all <hi>Anxious Thoughts</hi> about all preſent and future Events of things, and undergo all Croſſes and

harſheſt Accidents with <hi>equanimity</hi> and <hi>acquieſcence</hi> of Spirit, wholly ſubmitting unto, and being fully ſatisfied with the Divine Diſpoſal.

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, He alſo <hi>ſtirred</hi> him up to ſeek for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment</hi> by pondering upon his preſent ſtate and condition. <hi>What</hi> ſaith he) <hi>hath God done for thee?
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:66398:78"/>
Thou waſt in the gall of bitterneſs, and bond of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and God hath brought thee out, and yet not</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent! <hi>Thou wast a a Child of Wrath, and now art a child of</hi> God, <hi>yet not</hi> Content! <hi>Haſt thou</hi> God <hi>for thy</hi> God, <hi>Chriſt for thy Saviour, the Holy Spirit for thy Comforter, and yet not</hi> Content! <hi>Nay, doth</hi> God Chriſt <hi>and the</hi> Holy Spirit, <hi>dwell with thee, and yet not</hi> Content! <hi>Haſt thou received.</hi> True Godlineſſes <hi>glorious Retinue into thy houſe, to abide with thee, to enrich thee, ſtrengthen thee, to comfort thee, and make thy life ſweet to thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet not</hi> Content! <hi>Are thy ſins pradon'd, thy ſoul juſtified, haſt thou</hi> Union <hi>and</hi> Communion <hi>with the</hi> Father <hi>and</hi> Son, <hi>and yet not</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent! <hi>Is thy Name writ in the Book of Life? ſhalt thou dwell with</hi> God <hi>and</hi> Chriſt <hi>for ever? is Heaven thy Inheritance? art thou an Heir of a Crown and Kingdom, that fadeth not away, and yet not</hi> Content! <hi>Nay, let me tell thee all theſe things, and many more are abſolutely thine with</hi> Contentment. <hi>Come are thou willing to poſſeſs them, to make them thy own, and to enjoy them for ever, yea or no? if thou wouldſt be ſure of them, then get</hi> Contentment <hi>to dwell with thee; for</hi> Godlineſs <hi>with</hi> Contentment <hi>is great gain,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.6. <hi>It doth not ſay</hi> Godlineſs <hi>without</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, <hi>but with</hi> Contentment. <hi>'Tis this glorious Prince it appears, who puts thee into the ſure poſſeſſion of all true</hi> happineſs, <hi>and yet not</hi> Content!</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Ponder ſaith <hi>Conſideration,</hi> upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of <hi>Contentment</hi>; for a Saint never looks like himſelf, acts like himſelf, acts like a perſon of ſuch Rank and Quality, a perſon who hath received ſo many glorious and excellent Graces and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, but when in all conditions he is therewith <hi>contented</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Ponder, ſaith <hi>Conſideration,</hi> upon the Evils of <hi>Diſcontent</hi>; Oh what diſhonour doth it

bring unto God! what reproach to <hi>True Godlineſs</hi>? and what great wrong to thy own Soul!</p>
            <p>Fifthly, 'Tis below thy <hi>Chriſtian Relation,</hi> ſaith <hi>Conſideration,</hi> to be <hi>diſcontent</hi>: It was the Speech of <hi>Jonadab</hi> to <hi>Amon, why art thou, being a King's Son, lean from day to day?</hi> But that was (as one obſerves) for a wicked Cauſe; he ſaw his Spirit was troubled, for otherwiſe he was fat enough.
