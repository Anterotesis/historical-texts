            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Concerninge the causes of the
nevv Edition of this Relation;
vvith a defence therof against
diuers Impugners.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HREE</hi> or foure causes (good
reader) haue induced me to
renew this <hi>Relation,</hi> and to
sett yt forth againe, after three years
space, that it was first wrytten, and
printed, which was in the yeare of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biley
1600. The first reason is, for that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
hauing to performe afterward in this
third part of the Treatise, <hi>of three
Conuersions of England,</hi> diuers
points heere promised concerninge the
vnfolding of sundry falsifications, vsed
as well by <hi>Iohn Fox,</hi> as by some other
English wryters of our time; I thought
good to lay downe the ground of my
obligation and promise made in this
relation, to the end yt may be seene,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:22711:3"/>
whether I do satisfie the same or no.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, wheras my former narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was very breefe, &amp; founded only
vpo certaine letters receaued from <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
at that time; now I hauing pervsed
the whole acts &amp; gests of that cofere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
betweene the B. of <hi>Eureux, &amp; Plessis
Morney,</hi> authentically published by
authority, &amp; by the approbatio of the
deputies themselues that were iudges in
the cause; I haue come to know many
particulars which then I knew not, &amp;
consequently, I am desirous, that the
reader should be partaker therof in like
manner for that they may import him
not a little, being of the subiect they are.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> My third reason was, for that there
hath come to my hands since the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
printinge of this <hi>Relation</hi> two
aduersary wrytings, published against
the same, or at least wise, against some
principall points therof, the one in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:22711:3"/>
French, wrytten (as is thought) by
the <hi>L. Plessis</hi> himselfe or by some other
at his directio, after the flight from the
combat, the other in English by <hi>O. E.</hi>
otherwise interpreted <hi>Mathevv Sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliffe.</hi>
who hath taken vpon him to be
his procter and aduocate: both vvhich
wrytings I thought good in this place,
breefely to looke ouer, &amp; by occasion of
printing againe this <hi>Relation,</hi> to lett
the reader see, what truth or substance
there is in them; but yet with such mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of speach as we may imitate
therin (so neere as may be) the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
proceeding vsed by the aduersary
partyes in this <hi>Triall</hi> in France, as a
little after you shall heere, &amp; in deed is
conuenient to the subiect handled,
(which is Religion) and to the persons
that treate the same.</p>
            <p>And albeit accordinge to the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
which men giue heere of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:22711:4"/>
nature &amp; condition of <hi>O. E.</hi> little hope
is conceaued of any good correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
from him in this point, as not so
powerable ouer his owne passions, as to
performe it: yet will I hope the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
for this tyme, presuminge that
his so exorbitant excesse in former
wrytings, proceeding of the confidence
of a visard, wherby he thought per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
to passe vnknowen; but now the
maske being taken away, and euery
child being able to read and interprett
vvhat the vvords <hi>O. E.</hi> do signifie, to
witt, a person, that professeth Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
life &amp; dignity; I shall expect
somwhat from him agreeable to that
profession, vvherin I promise againe
all due correspondence on my behalfe,
to the end, that matters of Religion
may be handled in the stile they ought
to be. But if I be deceaued, and that
he vvill needs follow his ould veigne
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:22711:4"/>
still; I am like inough to leaue him in
that kind and giue him ouer to others;
that vvill pay him perhaps his dew,

            <p>For these reasons then, and some
other, I haue byn moued to sett forth
this <hi>Relation</hi> againe, togeather with
a defence therof, encreased, as yow
vvill see, and confirmed out of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall
acts sett forth by publike

            <head>THE
OCCASION, ARGVMENT,
AND SVBSTANCE
of the ensuinge triall.</head>
            <head>CHAP. 1.</head>
            <p>NOtwithstanding (gentle reader) I may
iustly presume, that the report of the
late combat, and conference had in <hi>France,</hi>
betweene two noble and famous learned
men, concerning a triall of fidelity and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood
in alleaginge authorityes for contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies
in Religion, hath come into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
before this day, being a matter of so
notorious memory &amp; done in the presence
of so great a King, and of so many Princes,
and so neare to our countrey, and vpon so
markable preambles and premisses, as heere
are declared:<note place="margin">Causes of this Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> yet was I moued by diuers
reasons, and considerations, to lay the same
togeather in these few sheets of paper, and
to sende them vnto thee to reade, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
and (as the importance of the thing it
selfe requireth) to be considered with some
attention, and leasure. For first I weighed
with my selfe, that albeit the chalenges
which heerafter do follow, be extant in the
French tongue, and consequently like also
to be in England before this day: yet for
that euery man vnderstandeth not that lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
nor is it so probable that many men
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:22711:6"/>
will take the paynes to translate &amp; diuulge
the same, to such as may haue neede or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to reade it; I iudged the labour not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
to performe the same from hence.</p>
            <p>But besides there is another reason of
more moment, and more peculiar to this
place, to witt, that albeit the former printed
chalenges, might come to Englishmens
hands by other meanes: yet the combat it
selfe, with the true issue therof, togeather
with the manner of the triall, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
occurred therin, which haue byn wryt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
hither by most authenticall partyes (as
vnto the place, where accompt of such af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres
concerninge Religion is wont to be
giuen) could not, or would not perhapps so
fully, and sincerely be related in England, as
the truth of the whole action requireth, the
reason wherof each man will easily co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider.</p>
            <p>These then being the causes that moued
me to take this little paine, founded (as yow
see) in the zeale of truth and fidelity, I haue
thought good to deliuer faithfully vnto
you such letters, as haue come to my hands,
about this affayre, though not all. For that
diuers letters wrytten out of France, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
other partyes reportinge the selfe same
thing, I thought not needful for me to print,
nor to multiply relations without necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but to content my selfe only (for breui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes
sake) with the letter of the K. Maiestie
himselfe, and with one other of the Bishop
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:22711:6"/>
(that was an actor in the cause) wrytten to
the Kings Embassadour in this place, and
to some other Cardinalls besides, by them
to be exhibited vnto his <hi>Holynes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">VVhy the B. of <hi>Eureux</hi> his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is of much creditt.</note> to whome
the Bishopp well knew, that the selfe same

               </gap>e
interessed in the matter then himselfe; and
more then this, that his said letters and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte
would be returned to France againe,
where all adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage would be taken against
him by the aduersary, yf in any one point he
should exceed the bare truth in his narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
which consideration may assure vs,
that he would haue great care to relate all
points both truly and modestly, as in his
letter that ensueth may be seene, that he
doth, and the same may be gathered also
plainely by the K. letter it selfe to the Duke
of <hi>Espernon,</hi> which after we shall relate.</p>
            <p>But yet besides these two letters, there
was another wrytten, two dayes after the
said Bishops letter, by the Popes Nuntio in
<hi>Paris</hi> vnto <hi>Cardinall Aldobrandino,</hi> and by him
to be deliuered to his holynes, wherin is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
&amp; verified (though in very few words)
the very same<note n="*" place="margin">All this is novv co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed by the publique Acts prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that after do ensue.</note> narration, which the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
wryteth, as by the extract therof heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
sett downe appeareth. And this now
were sufficient for a preface only to this
matter, were yt not, that I haue thought
expedient also to touch breifely two other
points. First, what these two persons are,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:22711:7"/>
which had the combat, and then the briefe
summe of that which passed betwene them
therein.</p>
            <p>For first the <hi>L. Plessis Morney</hi>
               <note place="margin">L. Plessis Morney.</note> his name and
person is well knowne in England; for that
aboue 20. yeares past I saw my selfe a booke
of his intituled: <hi>Of the Church, and notes therof,</hi>
translated into English, and much esteemed
by protestants of that time, for that he wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
more cunningly and couertly, and is
more plausible in shew both of scriptures &amp;
Fathers, then commonly other wryters of
his Religion then were. And for that he is
a noble man borne, and of the laity and not
vnlearned in diuers languages, and in great
creditt for many yeares with this King of
<hi>France</hi> (whose Embassadour he was in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
whilst he was yet a protestant, and
his Maiestie King only of <hi>Nauarre</hi>) and now
since his comminge to the kingdome of
<hi>France</hi> much trusted also, and vsed by him
in his ciuill affayres, and in gouernment of
the towne and country of <hi>Saumur.</hi> For these
causes (I say) and for that he hath wrytten
many bookes, he is accompted euery where
for one of the cheeife champions and head
pillars of Protestant Religion in France,
wherby this his disgrace so notoriously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued
in that thinge, wherin he made pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike
profession to be exact, to witt, in true,
and playne dealinge: must needs open the
eyes of such, as are discreet, and desirous in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:22711:7"/>
deed to follow truth and decline from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood,
and so it did vs after yow see.</p>
            <p>The B. of <hi>Eureux</hi> on the other side, named
<hi>Monsieur Person,</hi>
               <note place="margin">L. Bishop of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reux.</hi>
               </note> is a person no lesse eminent &amp;
markable, both for that his parents being
great Protestants, &amp; himselfe also for many
yeares, he being a man also of great wyet, &amp;
extraordinary memory, and by reason of his
state of life more occupied in studyes (as is
probable) then the other, comminge after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
by readinge, and by Gods especiall
grace to be a Catholike, he became so zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
earnest, and ardent therin (as none do
more when they are full informed) that his
greatest indeauours since his conuersion,
haue byn to conuert also others, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
that light, which God hath bestowed
vpon him, to as many as possibly he can. In
which respect the K. Maiestie of France ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge
loued him much, and esteemed also
before, when he was a Protestant, and no
lesse synce that he hath byn a zealous Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike,
and knowinge him to be both lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
faithfull &amp; sincere; made choyce of him
for his especially Embassadour in Rome in
the yeare 1595. to treat his great affayre for
his reconciliation to the Catholike Church,
which hath come to that happy issue, which

               </gap>ll the world seeth both for the good of his

               </gap>arson, people, and crowne.</p>
            <p>And thus much of these 2. persons, who
being both of them so gratefull and well
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:22711:8"/>
liked of the King, as I haue shewed, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties
indifferency in iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t also betwene
them both, (the truth of the cause only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted)
must needs be voyd of all suspition,
and consequently his sentence afterward
prononced on the one side (as by his letter
appeareth) must in reason be thought to
haue proceeded of the manifest difference
of the said cause, and force of truth it selfe,
which he discouered vpon that triall. Now
then to speake a word or two of the action
as it passed, you must vnderstand, that about
Christmasse last, there came forth a booke
in <hi>Paris</hi> of the aforsaid <hi>Monsieur Plessis</hi> against
the <hi>Masse;</hi>
               <note place="margin">A briefe relation of the vvhole action.</note> which booke making shew (as the

for his purpose, great admiration see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to be conceaued therof, and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
euery where began to triumph of so
famous a worke, published in their behalfe,
Whervpon diuers Catholike learned men
tooke occasion presently to examine the

            <p>All the preachers of <hi>Paris</hi> in like manner,

of the said temporal state which he had left,
he was forced for some yeares, to take a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular

armes, as he did, by licence of the Supreme
Pastor of Gods Church, yet after publike af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres

vertuous life, &amp; preacheth with great zeale,
&amp; singular edification of all sorts of men, &amp;
well sheweth that his mind is superior to all
wordly welth &amp; promotion. And these are
examples that are not found lightly among
Protestants, but are reserued as peculiar to
Christs Catholike Church, where the dew
of heauenly grace, continually falling, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
often such extraordinary effects. And
thus much of him.</p>

               <hi>Monsieur Sainct-Mary</hi> at length conuerted (the

of all men, in respect of the great humility,
and zeale he vsed in his returne to Gods
Church, and with much comfort of the K.
himselfe, to whome first before all other he

had commaunded both partyes afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
to be present, and their bookes to be
brought with them for this triall, to be
made in his owne presence: <hi>Monsieur Plessis</hi>
seemed to shrinke, and to seeke all delayes

bring it to some longer examination, by
going ouer all his bookes and works <hi>leafe by

to deale more plainly, and shew frendshipp,
sent vnto him threescore places taken out
of his booke, vpon which he mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to presse
him, and (as his words are) <hi>to begin the play:</hi>
wishinge him to come well prouided in the
same. Of which threescore <hi>Monsieur Plessis,</hi>
chose out nynteene, that seemed to him
most defensible, and vpon which he said he
would ioyne the combat, adding moreouer,
that he would leese his life, yf he were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced
therin. But the next day the triall
being begon vpon the first place, and that
found false, he would haue passed to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,

deputyes and iudges there present, would

was falsified, which at length they did, as
well in this, as in the rest there examined;
and <hi>Monsieur Plessis</hi> remayned in that pittifull
plight, which afterward yow shall heare by

examined matters of doctrine, &amp; the truth

the disputers, and other disguisinge of the

no; For triall wherof, yt shall only be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to bringe eyes for iudges to behould,
whether the citations which we do accuse
of falshood, be so indeed in the authors, as
<hi>Plessis</hi> hath alleaged in his booke. And yet of
the ouerthrow of these so many falsifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
gathered togeather, ensueth the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
and dishonour of the cause which is
defended by such weapons.</p>
                  <p>And consequently we are much bound

to the holy prouidence of almighty God,
that he hath permitted in this last assault of

            <p>WHEN I had vnderstood (gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)
the L. B. of <hi>Eureux</hi> gaue forth,
that the places of the fathers quoted by me

a certayne Chalenge wrytten, and subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed

the said B. hath caused to be printed &amp; pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished,
though I sent the same to him pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately
by the way of his owne brother.
Heerevpon notwithstanding, my <hi>L. Bishopp</hi>

way I sent to him.<note place="margin">The first cavill of Plessis vpon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</note> Iudge (Reader) whether
in matter of prouocation (for so he calleth
my chalenge) this manner of proceeding be
to be receaued, and not rather subiect vnto
sinister interpretation. Yet notwithstanding
the euent perhaps will make men iudge
better of his intention, whervnto willingly
I reserue my selfe.</p>
            <p>And of this my priuate chalenge to him,
as of one particular man to another, he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
by &amp; by a publike defiance of one part
to another; as they which in an army do

should tend to reniute, and ioyne togeather

vnto the which I do submitt my

that which greueth him (neyther can he

that of some false citations, whose falshood
is lesse euident: (if he passe them ouer) I wil
take witnesse, as though they granted them
to the preiudice of the Catholike Church:
But the truth is, that he doubteth least by

will shew me 500. false citations by num<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber,
but men will not easily beleeue him,
who know that such bragging without ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
hath continued already 20. yeares and

word to answere, which is, that when we
meete, we shall see<note n="*" place="margin">Now it is seene by the tryall.</note> what he can doe. And
therfore not to make many words which
serue for nothinge, but to put of the things
themselues, I will (notwithstandinge all
this) take myne offer, as accepted by him.
And euen now to this intent, I haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated

my most humble request to this effect, by
the which I do beseech this Maiestie, that
it will please him to ordaine some deputyes
to the end aboue mentioned. Which peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
if it please God to prosper and blesse, I
hope it wil proue a good preamble for some
greater designment, worthy the magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of our King, towards some holy refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the Church in his Kingdome, by
the meanes wherof, we shall see in this our

his estate; &amp; one that flieth higher then any
<hi>Constantine</hi> in restoringe the whole Church
of Christendome by the example of his
owne reformed Kingdome.</p>
            <p>This our requeste recommended by me
to the said <hi>L. Mareshall,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Great dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: as vvill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the euent.</note> was yesterday the last
of March so earnestly by him presented to
his Maiestie, as by his answere he giueth me
no small hope, that very soone he will giue
vs meanes to effectuate our desires: And the
more to hasten the matter, I haue againe
this morninge intreated most humbly his
Maiestie by my letters; so as now there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
nothing but to beseech the same of
God, as I do withall my hart, for his glory,
&amp; for the instruction of his people. And so

HItherto are the chalenges, answers and
replies of these two partyes: which the
K. Maiestie hauinge pervsed, and seeing so
great shew and confidence to be in both for
entring the combatt, he gaue very nobly &amp;
Christianly, his royall assent thervnto, as by

the triall was made at <hi>Fontayne-blea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

foure or fiue dayes after, in the presence of
his Maiestie &amp; Princes of bloud, with many
of the greatest nobility, with those particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larityes,
which the said ensuing letters will
represent vnto yow. But yet before all, I
haue thought good to sett downe the K.
owne letter, though short, and briefe, yet
very substantiall and pithy, relatinge very
prudently in few words the successe of that
triall, with the good effect, that might be
hoped therof for conuersion of many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
that are not peruerse and willfull.
It was wrytten at <hi>Fontayne-bleau</hi> where the
meeting was, the very day of the triall: and
for the worthinesse therof and due respect
to so great a personage, yt shall go both in

(and greater also perhaps) in the chiefe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant

competent number of equall iudges, might
be assigned on both sides to heare the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
with the same lawes and conditions as
the matter passed in France, to witt, that no
point of controuersie or disputation be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to be disputed of, but only matter of
fact discussed: As for example, whether such
and such places and authorityes as are cyted
&amp; quoted in their wrytings, out of Fathers,
Doctors, Councells, and storyes, and are
auouched by Catholiks to be falsified, be so
or no? If this (I say) might be obtayned
(seeing larger triall &amp; disputation, so often
and earnestly by vs demaunded, cannot be
had) and that by the wisdome and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of her Maiestie &amp; her honourable Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
this at last might be brought to passe;
yt would be an infinite comfort to all sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,

noteth before, yt wilbe sufficient for this
triall, to bringe only eyes, and to open the
books, whence the authorityes are cyted.
And to the end that some tast before hand
may be taken of the matter, which would
breake forth in such a triall, concerning the
Protestants part; I haue thought good to
adde these few obseruations that do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue,
which are of a person that would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly

that inuented yt, or chose to follow yt,

(for all this, and much more he declareth in

&amp; is (no doubt) or may be easily in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland

of the iudgment of strangers, to witt, that
by testimony and asseueration of diuers ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
learned men of other nations, there was
neuer wrytten a thinge in that kind, and of
such an argument more excellent in respect
of the infinite variety of hereticall books,
which he sheweth to haue read, and well
pondered, and for the many inuincible rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
&amp; demonstrations which he alleageth
for his purpose. And so much of this.</p>
            <p>And now I will speake somewhat larger

by this present story of <hi>Plessis Mornay</hi>

the spiritt of old heretiks agreeth with this

others; and if we will consider the cause &amp;
necessityes of this reproach in like manner,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:22711:25"/>
we shall find them no lesse euident or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible

               </gap> the antiquity of heretiks and
sectaryes, which they dare not alleage
openly, (though they follow them) they
are forced to fayne and forge somewhat of
their owne; as for example some of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Fathers to be with them, or els should
they remayne without all shew or colour of

they do not agree amonge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues:<note place="margin">Luther &amp; other sectaryes denyed al fathers at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</note>
For that first <hi>Martyn Luther</hi> their great

at the beginninge to cast himselfe into
these two troublesome labyrinthes; first of
shiftinge of by diuised interpretations those
manifold authorityes of Fathers, that were
to be brought against him, and then in fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
out other Fathers in his owne behalfe;
he tooke a more briefe, and compendious
way, which was to deny and contemne
them all, for so he doth in very many places
of his workes, protesting at the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
almost of all his heresies, (to wit in the
yeare 1521.) in an epistle wrytten to a Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
knight,<note place="margin">Luth. in epist ad equitem Germ. an. 1521.</note>

and addeth in the same place, <hi>that the fathers
wrytings were full of errors, contrary often to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and disagreeing the one from the other, wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinge
scriptures;</hi> and the like.</p>
            <p>The same also he saith of Councells in
the same place, and in the next yeare after
this, wrytinge against K. Henry the 8. he
saith:<note place="margin">Luth. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Henr. Angl. Reg. an. 1522.</note> 
               <hi>I do oppose against all the testimonyes of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
of men neuer so holy, of Angells, and of diuells,
&amp;c.</hi> Wherby we may see, what accoumpt
he made of Fathers and Councells, when
they were against him. And the same did
<hi>Zuinglius, Caluyn,</hi> and others after him for a
tyme, when Fathers authorityes plainly
were against them, and could not be shifted
of, by sleight interpretation, as in their
works appeareth: and <hi>Rescius</hi> declareth it
notably and largely, by manifold examples,
and places in his tenth Chapter, and first
booke aforesaid.</p>
            <p>But when this audacity grew in tyme to

told him in effect; <hi>That Papists were
Papists, and so they were to be dealt withall,</hi> and
other answere he could not gett; which
thinge made the good Gentleman to make
a new resolution with himselfe, and to take
that happy course which he did to leaue his
countrey, and many great commodityes,
which he enioyed therin, to enioy the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, for saluation of his soule:
and so he both liued and died in voluntary
banishment for confession of that truth,
which his Sauiour by occasion of <hi>Maister Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wells</hi>
falshood, had reueyled vnto him.</p>
            <p>The second example, which I remember
of my owne knowledge,<note place="margin">M. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors Steuens.</note> is <hi>Maister Doctor Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens,</hi>
a learned man yet aliue, who being Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
or Chaplyn to <hi>Maister Iewell</hi> (for I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
not well whether) and a forward
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:22711:29"/>
man in Protestant Religion at that tyme,
espied certayne false allegations in his Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
booke, whilst yt was yet vnder the
print in <hi>London,</hi> wherof aduertisinge him by
letters (for that he supposed yt might be by
ouersight) the other commaunded notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standinge
the print to goe forward, and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
it ouer as it was, which this man seeing,
that had a conscience, and sought the truth
indeed, resolued to take another way of fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge
yt out: and hauinge found yt in the
Catholike Church where only it was to be
found, he resolued also to follow yt, and so
he did, and went voluntarily into banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the same, where yet he liueth vnto
this day in <hi>France,</hi> with good reputation
both of learninge and godlynes.</p>
            <p>The third example that I call to mynd, is
the worthy man before named <hi>Maister VVil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Reynolds,</hi>
               <note place="margin">M. VVil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds.</note> who being first an earnest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor,

in England, and much engaged amonge the
Puritans in <hi>Northampton-shire</hi> (as he was
wont to tell) he fell in the end to read ouer
<hi>Maisters Iewells</hi> booke, and did translate some
part thereof into Latyn: but before he had
passed halfe ouer, he found such stuffe, as
made him greatly mislike of the whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and so he leauing his hopes, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modityes
in England went ouer the sea in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
these parts, and the last yeare of <hi>Iubiley,</hi> to

that booke with him,<note place="margin">M. Iewels booke preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Rome.</note> and presented both
himselfe and yt, to the Tribunall of <hi>Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of his owne free motion and accord,
where I ghesse the booke remayneth still,
yf yt be not burned: and himselfe after ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
receaued from his former errors
(which he with great humility and zeale
required, &amp; my selfe also at that tyme spake
with him in that place) he returned into
<hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> and there liued many
yeares with singular edification for his rare
vertue &amp; learninge; and how hartily indeed
he was conuerted, may well appeare by his
zealous wrytinge both in Latyn &amp; English
in defence of Catholike Religion, &amp; in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation
of Protestant errors, which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
before had held for verityes. And thus
much of the falshood of <hi>Maister Iewells</hi> wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyngs,

him read <hi>Maister Hardings returne of vntruthes,</hi>

and other Assistants &amp; Iudges, as disfauourable

                  </note> vpon better deliberation,
new defences for the points wherin they had byn con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>demned
in the conference, as both the <hi>Arrians</hi> did
after the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> wherin they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
and the <hi>Donatists</hi> after their conference
with the Catholiks at <hi>Carthage,</hi> and as euery man
condemned at our English barres would do, yf they
might haue replyes allowed them, after their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnations.
The third point of euasion vsed by them
is, recrimination, that is to say, to shew that others
also do falsifie besides them, and haue vsed fraud in
their quotations, which though yt were true (as in
the particulars obiected, is shewed by the defender
that they are all false) yet were it no honourable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
as each man will confesse. And this is the summe
of that discourse, and the confutation therof.</p>
               <p>Now then for so much as Plessis, and his frends had
published this false discourse; yt was thought good by
the K. &amp; his Councell vpon request of the Catholiks,
that the authenticall Acts of the said conference, and
all particularityes passed therin, and taken fourth by
seuerall publike notaryes appointed for that purpose
before hand, and one of them of the new religion,
should be examined anew, vpon the depositions as
well of the said notaryes, as also of 200. more, and
so published to the world, which was done, and the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:22711:33"/>
whole presented to the K. by the B. of <hi>Eureux</hi> vpon
the 29. of August in the same yeare 1600. which

            <head>CHAP. I.</head>
            <p>FOR that my briefe narration before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited,
was founded only vpon certayne
letters sent from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> presently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the conference had, as by pervsing therof
yow haue seene, and my purpose also was
to be very briefe; I could not sett downe so
many particularityes, as these acts do now
represent: yet do I find that whatsoeuer I
related before, is now confirmed againe by
these acts, and diuers things added, wherof
some principall I shall heere touch in few
words, cytinge the leafe of the said <hi>Acts,</hi>
wherin they may be read more largely. The
title of the said Acts is this: <hi>Actes de la confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

tenue, &amp;c. Acts of the conference held betweene
the L. Bishop of Eureux, and the L. Plessis in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the King at Fountayne-bleau, the fourth of
May 1600. published by the permission and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his Maiestie, &amp;c. the same yeare 1600.</hi> And

downe in these Acts is, that vpon the 20.
day of March <hi>anno</hi> 1600. a great noble man
of <hi>Normandy</hi> named, <hi>Lord Sainct-Mary du Mont,</hi>
a Protestant at that tyme, but soone after
conuerted, meetinge with <hi>Monsiear Plessis</hi> at
the lodginge of the <hi>Lady</hi> Princesse of <hi>Orange</hi>
in <hi>Paris,</hi> told him how he was cryed out of
euery where about the falsifications found
in his booke lately printed <hi>against the Masse,</hi> &amp;
that himselfe had seene some shewed vnto
him by the B. of <hi>Eureux</hi> which he could not
solue. Heervpon <hi>Monsieur Plessis</hi> thinkinge
himselfe touched greatly in honour, did
iudge yt the best way to make a publike
Chalenge to the said B. of <hi>Eureux,</hi> which he
wrote and gaue abroad the very same day,
and the <hi>L. Sainct-Mary</hi> sent one of them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
to the B. wherevnto he made ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were,
acceptinge of his Chalenge, vpon the
25. of March, which letters before I<note n="*" place="margin">Supra cap. 3.</note> haue
alleaged; and soone after the said Bishopp
thinking yt conuenient to print and publish
the same, did so, and sent a copy therof to
the King, togeather with a letter of his
owne hand of the 28. of March, wherin
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:22711:35"/>
amongst other words he saith thus: <hi>I do send
vnto your Maiestie a Chalenge of Monsieur Plessis
made about the examen of his allegations in his booke</hi>
against the Masse,<note place="margin">The B. of <hi>Eureux</hi> letter to the king. <hi>Act. fol.</hi> 5.</note> 
               <hi>togeather with my answere to
the same. I should be vnworthy to serue so great and
noble a King, and of so high courage at your Maiestie
is, yf I should refuse such a Chalenge, especially in a
quarrell that may be ended without bloud, and tend
much to the glory of almighty God, and to the salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
os him that shalbe ouercome, and therfore I do
most humbly beseech your Maiestie to permitt this
triall, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heervpon <hi>Monsieur Plessis</hi> vnderstandinge
that the B. had wrytten to the King, he
wrote also another to his Maiestie to the
same effect, &amp; returned likewayes an<note n="*" place="margin">Supra cap. 4.</note> ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were
to the Bishop, shewinge himselfe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge
to goe forward in the said triall, but
with diuers exceptions and diuersions, as in
the said letter appeareth, which we haue
related before. The King hauinge receaued
these letters from both partyes, and confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the same with his <hi>Counsell,</hi> resolued to
permitt the triall demaunded, as also to be
present theratt himselfe, and so gaue order
to the <hi>L. Chancelour</hi> of France vpon the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
of <hi>Aprill,</hi> to warne the partyes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
themselues, and to be ready for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginninge
of the next moneth with all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision
necessary for that Triall.</p>
            <p>In the meane space the Popes <hi>Nuntius</hi> that
lay in <hi>Paris</hi> hearinge of an appointment for
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:22711:36"/>
triall of matters in Religion, began to make
some difficulty to permitt any such publike
act, appertayning to the vniuersall cause of
Christendome, without licence and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of the Sea Apostolike, and proofe of
the persons that must dispute, alleaginge
that it was a thinge inconuenient to lay the

when he was answered by the B. and after
by the K. himselfe, and others, that their
meaninge was not to dispute of controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
but only to examine places cited by
<hi>Monsieur Plessis</hi> whether they were truly and
faithfully calleaged or no? and that this
should be sett downe and obserued as the
first law of this conference, the <hi>Nuntius</hi> was
satisfied, and so the day was appointed, his
Maiestie commandinge expressely, that the
conference should be made with all sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and courtesie, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>So in the meane space diuers things were
set in order necessary for that conference, as
namely for choosinge the iudges on both
sides, and principall assistance without all
partiality, to witt, learned, wise and graue
men, to the end that all might passe with
indifferency, loue, and charity, as much as
might bee; &amp; namely for the Catholiks, was
chosen the president of <hi>Tou,</hi> a great learned

should follow, and bringe the B. of <hi>Eureux</hi>

               <hi>and leafe by leafe,</hi> as before he had
demaunded, but the B. refused this for the
same reasons which he had alleaged before
in his<note n="*" place="margin">Supra cap. 3.</note> letter to <hi>Monsieur Plessis,</hi> principally
for that yt was but a refuge to draw out
tyme, he well knowinge that yt would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
be ended.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The second demaund was, that all such
places of his booke, as the B. did not accuse
of falsity, might be esteemed as allowed and
approued after this conference. But this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the B. said was no reason, for that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happs
other men would find other faults in
other places, which he had not examined,
and that after these first 500. now obiected,
were examined, he offered to be bound to
go ouer his whole booke, <hi>page by page, and lyne
by lyne</hi> as <hi>Plessis</hi> desired.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third petition was, that if this might
not be graunted, that at least the Bishopp
would giue him in wrytinge, the first 500.
places, that he had noted togeather with his
proofes, against the same, and that he might
haue tyme to examine them before hands,
to cutt of long disputes before his Maiestie.
But to this the Bishopp aunswered in like
manner, that if he did so, the other would
aske so much tyme to examine them, as he
would delude this conference now appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Wherfore he offered, that yf the present
triall might go forward, he would send
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:22711:38"/>
him 50. places the day before to prouide
himselfe for the first day, and so 50. the next
day, for the second conference, and so forth
for 10. dayes togeather, vntill all the 500.
were examined.</p>
            <p>The fourth demaund was, that the same <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
order might be held in examininge his
booke, which he had held in wrytinge the
same, to witt beginninge from the first part
therof, &amp;c. But this also the Bishopp refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
sayinge that it was only a shift, for that
<hi>Plessis</hi> comonly had ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dled only light points
in the first part of his booke, wheron it was
no reason to stand and leese tyme, but rather
as an accuser he might begin where he
would, and that <hi>Plessis</hi> was bound to auns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were
him: yet for the last vpshott &amp; to end
all, he offered the King, to giue the whole
500. places presently into his Maiesties
hands in wrytynge, &amp; so to take them from
him euery day by 50. at once, to be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in ten dayes, as is afore said, and after
this he said, he would bynd himselfe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
a whole moneth with him in <hi>Paris</hi> or
els where he should thinke best, to examine
the rest of the 4000.</p>
            <p>After this vpon the second day of May all
the iudges and comissaryes being now arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
(except the President <hi>Calignon,</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained

of the finances, as also of the <hi>president</hi> of
<hi>Tou, Cazaubon,</hi> and others, asked him why
he would not yeld to this demaund; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
he answered as before, saying that this
was but a new delay, therby to gett into his
hands the whole 500. places, and then to
seeke to answere them rather by wrytinge,
then by present confere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which he might
breake of by diuers occasions,<note place="margin">Actes fol. 21.</note> yf once he
were sure to haue therby the places into this
hands, and therfore he desired his Maiestie
to admitt no further delayes now, but that
the appointed triall might go forward,
which being once ended, he promised most
faithfully, that he would stay to examine
the whole booke, as longe as his Maiestie
should appoint, or <hi>Plessis</hi> desire.</p>
            <p>Whervpon the Lords present as well
Protestants as Catholiks said, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopp

the <hi>Chancelour</hi> hauing done, <hi>Plessis</hi> answered,
that he could not accept of yt; wherat the

well to his creditt, for that if he should be
found to be a falsifier in matters of diuinity,

gaue him the list of the 19. places, which
<hi>Plessis</hi> had chosen to defend, which list when
the Bishopp had read, he tould the King &amp;

diuers Ministers of the new Keligion.</p>
            <p>All being sett, the L. Chancelour made
first a briefe speech, confirmed afterward by
the King himselfe, that the meaning of this
meeting was to try out the truth of certaine
allegations, that were called in controuersy
in the L. <hi>Plessis</hi> booke, and not to dispute of
any article of Religion at all; to which ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
also the Bishop had a breefe speech, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaging
the example of <hi>Eugenius</hi> Archbishop

that as he had wrytten his books with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

of his Church, and would thinke himselfe
happy,<note place="margin">

hand to haue done yt, he should be the first
to burne the same. He made mention
againe, and shewed greefe,<note place="margin">Actes fol. 31.</note> that 4. thousand
places should be noted, as falsified by him in
his booke, and finally protested, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
it succeded with him, his cause was
particular, and touched not the reformed
Churches in <hi>France,</hi> which were before him,
and would be after him, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The B. repeated againe the matter of
4000. places corrupted, and offered to stand
vnto yt, and to verifie them as well, as those
500. new agreed vpon, and repeated againe
breifely the whole story of this action, and
how guilfully <hi>Plessis</hi> had proceeded in cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge
out 19. places only of 60. offered him,
and of these had put in the first ranke <hi>Scotus</hi>

corrupted by him in the very same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie
of the reall presence amongst the
number of these three score: which fraud,
to the end the iudges and deputyes might
see and behould, he laid downe vpon the
table that stood before them the whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue
of the said 60. places sent the day
before to <hi>Plessis:</hi> which being done, the King
comaunded the foure secretaryes of the
crowne, to wryte only the conclusions and
iudgments that should be giuen, and not the

the said <hi>Scotus</hi> and <hi>Durandus,</hi> thinking therby

trifle out the tyme in wranglinge about
these, as he did a whole houre about the

done the whole day, yf he might haue byn

fraud vnto the auditorye, shewed withall,
that his deceyt and false dealing was all one

greatest, &amp; therfore that it was not so much

the first that he would make his Reader be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
that <hi>Scotus,</hi> &amp; the rest of the Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
when they propose any matter to be
disputed to and fro, do doubt of the truth
therof, which is a most absurd imposture,
for so he might say also, that they doubt
whether God be God, or whether God
can create any thing, for that they putt this
question.<note place="margin">Scot. 2. sent. dist. 1. q. 2.</note>

arguments ended, they resolue that yt is so,
to witt, that there is a God, and can create
things of nothinge, and do solue all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments

settinge downe his full determination in

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:22711:43"/>
And he proueth the same by two places of
scripture, to witt <hi>Math.</hi> 26. where Christ
saith: <hi>This is my body,</hi> and <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6. where he
saith: <hi>My flesh is truly foode.</hi> This then is the

haue vsed in alleadginge <hi>Scotus</hi> against his

               <p>The second is, for that he saith, that <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>

the <hi>quantity, locality,</hi> and <hi>circumscription annexed

and for that respect he named
the Councell of <hi>lateran</hi> in his speach, which

that the Councell of <hi>Lateran</hi> determined as
well the article of the <hi>reall presence,</hi> as of
<hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> as appeareth in the said
Councell, and that <hi>Scotus</hi> was as resolute
in the one as in the other. And finally
that <hi>Plessis</hi> words before recyted are plaine
inough without a comentary, <hi>that Scotus
durst to call into question whether the body of Christ

               <p>And as for the places he would seeme to

to that which <hi>Plessis</hi> would haue him

this resolution accordinge to the common
faith of the Catholike Church, he passeth to
answere the former obiection, sayinge to
the former argument to the contrary (about

               <p>Which words being recyted in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

but yet necessity made him take hart, &amp;
to aduenture a new euasion, saying, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit

yet it seemed to him such an obiection, <q>as
might hould the place of a resolution, yf the
authority &amp; decision of the Church had not

should be temerity to hold the contrary: but
the Bishop refuted this presently as imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent

to help his cause: For albeit <hi>Durand</hi> did
hould, that God out of his omnipotency
might haue appointed yt so yf he would,

                  <note place="margin">Math. 19.</note> It was noted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
that in the end of the first text alleaged
by <hi>Plessis</hi> out of <hi>Durand,</hi> the words in vulgar

therfore (as yt seemeth) this first way is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>Out of which allegation of <hi>S. Chrysostome</hi>
the Bishopp did shew, and plainly declare,
that <hi>Plessis</hi> had depraued <hi>S. Chrysostomes</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge,
for that he did not inferre any such
conclusion at all against prayer to Saints,
but manifestly the contrary in these words
in the very same place, sayinge for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
after a long discourse: <hi>These things then

               <p>These are the words of <hi>S. Chrysostome</hi> tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

not say, but that, <hi>we must not put all our hope

also <hi>S. Chrysostomes</hi> meaning, for that

out, yet two leapes he gaue, but ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did serue his turne.<note place="margin">Tvvo vayne leaps of <hi>Plessis</hi> to gett out of the bracke.</note> The first was, by
sayinge, that his intention was not to sett
downe <hi>Saint Chrysostomes</hi> words formally as
they lay in the text, for that his discourse
was longe, and indured for diuers pages, but
only to put downe the some therof. But
this was beaten backe by the B. asking him
first, why then he sett downe those words
in a different letter, as proper words of <hi>S.
Chrysostome?</hi> Secondly, why he left out <hi>Saint
Chrysostomes</hi> true words before recyted, and
put in other of his owne, of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary sense?
Thirdly why he changed, &amp; falsifyed <hi>Saint
Chrysostomes</hi> whole meaning, drifte, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
as hath byn shewed; and finally he
told him, that albeit <hi>S. Chrysostomes</hi> discourse
were large in expounding the forsaid verse
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:22711:47"/>
of <hi>Ieremy</hi> the Prophett; yet was his conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
about praying to Saints very short, and
vttered in no more words then before was
sett downe; so as this helped him nothing.</p>
               <p>His second skip therfore was to say, that
<hi>S. Chrysostome</hi> in this place spoke of prayinge
to liue Saints only, and not to dead Saints,
but the Bishop replied, that albeit this were
true (as it appeareth euidently to be false by
the examples of <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Iob,</hi> whome <hi>Saint
Chrysostome</hi> there nameth) yet that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued
him and his falshood nothing at all:

proued two absurdityes in steed of one, the

(euen as that of <hi>S. Chrysostome</hi> was before) yt

of what sort of Saints soeuer <hi>S. Hierome</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Wherfore he prayed the iudges to giue
sentence concerninge this place, as of the
former; whervpon <hi>Plessis</hi> began to cauill
againe,<note place="margin">Acts fol. 69.</note> and to say, as he did in the former
passage of <hi>S. Chrysostome,</hi> that he alleaged not
this place of <hi>Saint Hierome</hi> directly against
Saints deceased, but indirectly. But the B.
proued that neyther directly, nor indirectly
this place of <hi>S. Hierome</hi> made any thinge
against prayers to Saints, but rather for the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:22711:51"/>
same. For he that saith, that prayinge to
Saints auayleth not him, that is negligent
of his owne part, signifieth in effect, that yf
he be diligent, he may be holpen therby,
which is <hi>S. Hieromes</hi> doctrine against <hi>Vigilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
as <hi>Plessey</hi> confesseth, though he saith that

when he spoke the contrary as he
would haue him to seeme.</p>
               <p>After this, <hi>Plessis</hi> leapt to another place of

But the Bishopp charged him, that the last

him to shew them. <hi>Plessis</hi> answered, that in

reseruedly, in vttering the points &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steryes

in effect <hi>Cyrill</hi> did confesse yt, as presently
shalbe shewed, for that he yeldeth the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why they did yt. But on the other side
yt is a farre better argument to say: <hi>Iulian</hi>
the Apostata obiected that Christians ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Crosse of Christ, and painted the

yf yt were true, that <hi>S. Cyrill</hi> did reprehend
the Emperour <hi>Iulian,</hi> for charginge falsely

the constitutions of <hi>Iustinian</hi> printed at <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua,</hi>
and the words were read there as the

out of diuers other authors more ancient

another obiection of <hi>Minutius Foelix,</hi> who

against himselfe.<note place="margin">A deceyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full reply of <hi>Plessis</hi> turned vpon himselfe.</note> For that the pagan hauing
obiected to Christians, that they honoured
<hi>Crucem,</hi> wherby he vnderstood a gibbett or

him: <hi>Nos Cruces nec colimus, nec optamus,</hi>
we do neyther worship nor wish Crosses in
your sense, that is to say, gibbetts. And all
did maruayle at <hi>Plessis,</hi> that he would bring
in this deceatfull obiection: out of which

except the Pagan <hi>Cecilius</hi> had knowen in
those dayes, that Christians worshipped
Crosses, he would neuer haue obiected the

               <p>And this being done the B. demaunded

that they honoured the Crosse, and made

haue done, yf Christians had vsed to do
so indeed. Whervnto the Bishop answered,
that <hi>S. Cyrill</hi> did not obiect ignorance about

yow see) all that which <hi>Plessis</hi> would haue
proued, by <hi>S. Bernards</hi> authority against <hi>S.
Anselme.</hi> And finally the Bishop after diuers
other cauills answered, returned to the first
matter againe, and to affirme as at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:22711:57"/>
that <hi>Monsieur Plessis</hi> had not dealt
truly and sincerely in this allegation of <hi>Saint
Bernard,</hi> but that he should haue alleaged the
sentences seuerally, as they lay in the booke,
and not haue left out the principall clause,
that went betwene them, yf he had dealt
truly. Wherfore he desyringe iudgment

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:22711:57"/>
obiected two manifest and willfull falsifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:<note place="margin">Acts fol. 90. 91. 92.</note>
First for that he had against the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
meaninge of <hi>Theodorete</hi> translated the
Greeke word <hi>Idoll</hi> for <hi>Image,</hi> which <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rete</hi>
did cleerly distinguish: and secondly for
that he cut of a plaine clause in the middest,
wherby the author of purpose did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
himselfe, to witt these wordes; <hi>ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by pagans,</hi> and <hi>adored for Gods,</hi> so as this
declared euidently, that he had no true
meaninge.</p>
               <p>To this <hi>Plessis</hi> answered, that as for the
words <hi>Idoll</hi> and <hi>Image,</hi> they were all one,<note place="margin">The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt <hi>Idoll</hi> and <hi>Image.</hi>

that albeit accordinge to their Etymologye
in Grammer, the Greeke word <hi>Eicoon</hi> and
<hi>Eidoolon</hi> do sometyme signifie the same, and
that some ould heathen writers do vse them
so: yet the Ecclesiasticall vse therof both in
scriptures &amp; ancient Fathers, doth alwayes
distinguish most exactly these 2. words: as
for example, it can neuer be found, either in
scriptures or ancient Fathers, that the word
<hi>Idoll</hi> is taken in good part, as <hi>Image</hi> is, nor
that they did euer call the <hi>Cherubins,</hi>

any Christian wryter dare to speake other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:22711:58"/>
other like examples, wherby is euident, that
both the scriptures, and holy Fathers did
obserue a strict distinction betwixt these
words: And heervpon was there spent some

but no one example could he giue out of

of any Father to this purpose.</p>
               <p>And on the other side the Bishop pressed

to be of no importance, whether they were

<hi>Theodorete</hi> would not haue praised

<hi>Theodoretes</hi> owne meaninge, and to
answere to the second, why he had left out
those words, that declared his meaning, to
witt, <hi>Idolls adored by the pagans, and adored for
Gods?</hi> He aunswered that he had left them
out for breuityes sake, and had sett downe
only the substantiall clauses of <hi>Theodoretes</hi>
text. But the Bishop replyed, that this bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity
was not commendable, and that the
clause left out was the most substantiall of
all the rest, for declaringe the truth, and
<hi>Theodoretes</hi> meaninge in the matter in hand.
<hi>Plessis</hi> answered,<note place="margin">Many turnings and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of Plessis.</note> that it appertayned not to
his purpose to alleage those words. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
said that yt did, yf his purpose were to

Then fell <hi>Plessis</hi> to his ould refuge and said,
that he had not alleaged the forsaid text of

                  <hi>Theodorete</hi> directly against Images, but indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly,
and by a certayne analogie or conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
which the Bishop refuted. And fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
after all, he demaunded iudgment
vpon the place, and vpon both the two cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
obiected, which after diligent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uew
of the place in <hi>Theodorete,</hi> and aduise ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of all the deputyes, the Lord <hi>Chancelour</hi>

(giuen also by his owne men) he remayned

            <head>CHAP. III.</head>
            <p>As soone as the K. Maiestie was depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the place of conference, euery
man began to talke &amp; reason of that which
had passed, but especially those that had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
without in other Chambers, and
Galeryes round about, and in the K. garden
beneath, and could get no place within the
Chamber, where the conference was hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;
these, I say, as well Catholiks, as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
pressed greatly to know what had
byn done, &amp; what had byn the issue of that
tryall. And so earnest sute was made vnto
the Secretaryes, for copyes of the sentences,
as that very night they were geuen abroad
in wryting, conteyning as before yow haue
heard, to witt that vpon the first 2. places of
<hi>Scotus</hi> and <hi>Durandus,</hi> the sentence was; <hi>that
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:22711:60"/>
Monsieur Plessis had taken the obiection for the reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</hi>
Vpon the second places of S. <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome;
that he had left out that which he should haue
put in.</hi>
               <note place="margin">A breefe recapitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences.</note> Vpon the fifth place of <hi>S. Hierome;
that he ought to haue alleaged the passage entyre, as
yt was in the author.</hi> Vpon the sixt place of
<hi>S. Cyrill: That the passage alleaged out of S. Cyrill
was not to be found in him.</hi> Vpon the 7. place
out of the Emperors <hi>Theodofius</hi> and <hi>Valens;
That Plessis had alleaged truly Crinitus, but that
Crinitus was abused.</hi> Vpon the 8. place out of
<hi>S. Bernard: That it had byn well, Plessis had cyted
the place distinctly as yt lay in the author, without
cuttinge of any thinge in the middest.</hi> And finally
vpon the 9. place out of <hi>Theodorete</hi> against
Images: <hi>That the passage alleaged, was not to be
vnderstood of Images, but of Idolls, and that this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
by the words which Plessis had omitted in his
allegation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which iudgments being read and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
yt was wonderfull to behould the
great diuersity of affections, which they
styrred vp, to witt of comfort, and alacrity
in the Catholiks, and of confusion &amp; greife
in the Hugonotts there present, who being
in number aboue 200. considered, that these
sentences had passed by the consents aswell
of their owne iudges, as of the other, &amp; that
there was no way left of tergiuersation.
And further that <hi>Monsieur Plessis</hi> being one of
the cheefest men simply of their Religion
in France, and most accoumpted of for his
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:22711:60"/>
learninge, this his disgrace was the disgrace
of all their Religion, and his error inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable,
in respect of his former bragges, and
Protestations, and of the willfull falshood
now found in him.<note place="margin">Diuers cheefe Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to thinke of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

them, and those also of the principall, began
soone after, by assistance of Gods holy
grace, to open their harts to another cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
for their conuersion, as a little after
yow shall heare.</p>
            <p>The Kings Maiestie also was exceedingly
moued in mynd, to see what had passed, as
may appeare by his affectious speaches, and
letter wrytten to <hi>Monsieur Espernon</hi> that very
night after his departure from the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
which letters we haue recyted<note n="*" place="margin">Supra cap. 5.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and the causes of his motion we shall
touch a little afterward, when we haue sett
downe what ensued immediatly vpon this

reason also to mooue his Maiesty the more,
as presently yow shall see. Wherfore we
shall relate the same in the very words of
the printed Acts, which are these that

            <p>The next morrow,<note place="margin">VVhat passed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference ended.</note> which was friday
the fifth of May at 6. of the Clocke in the

of <hi>Eureux,</hi> telling him that <hi>Monsieur Plessis</hi> had
byn very euill that night, &amp; that he prayed
the Bishop to be content to haue the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
differred for that morninge;<note place="margin">Acts fol. 105.</note> but the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:22711:61"/>
Bishop asked him for how longe this delay
should be, the gentleman answered vntill
that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sieur Plessis</hi> should be in state of health
to prosecute the same. Soone after this, there
came to the Kings chamber <hi>Monsieur de la Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiere</hi>
cheefe phisitian to his Maiestie, tellinge
him that the conference was like to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
vp, by reason of the L. <hi>Plessis</hi> indisposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whome he said, that he had left very
sicke, with violent vomitts, and tremblings
of all the parts of his body; which he King
hearinge, comaunded him presently to go,
and tell the same to the L. Chancelour, to
the end that he and the deputyes should not
take their iorney in vaine that day to the
pallace; which being told vnto them, and
they imagininge, that perhaps <hi>Monsieur Plessis</hi>
his sicknesse might endure longe, sent that
very night late to his Maiestie, to know his
iudgment &amp; pleasure, whether they should
remayne still in <hi>Fountayne-bleau,</hi> or returne to
<hi>Paris.</hi> The King that he might giue them
more certayne answere, willed the <hi>Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour</hi>
at ten of the clocke at night, to go and
see <hi>Plessis,</hi> &amp; to know from his owne mouth,
what he would do concerning the prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this conference. The <hi>Chancelour</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
with him at that tyme, the <hi>L. President
Fresnes Canay,</hi> cheefe deputy for the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
party in the said conference, desyred
him to go to him which he did, and brought
answere, that <hi>Plessis</hi> was not in state to go
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:22711:61"/>
forward now, but he would aduise vpon it
in <hi>Paris:</hi> which answere being related to the
Chancelour, by the President, and from the
Chancelour, to the King; his Maiestie gaue
licence to the iudges, &amp; deputyes to depart

<hi>Fresnes,</hi> who remained at <hi>Fontayn-bleau</hi>

            <p>But the next day at noone, about six

and so they went all to <hi>Paris,</hi> and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie
arryued there vpon the 12. of May.
And about some 4. or 5. dayes after, <hi>Monsieur
Plessis</hi> departed to his gouerment of <hi>Saumur</hi>
without takinge his leaue of his Maiestie or
seing the L. <hi>Chancelour</hi> (as he had promised)
and without sending any word at all to the
B. of <hi>Eureux,</hi> about the conference or fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
triall.</p>
            <p>Thus farre goeth the narration of the
printed Acts, published by authority of the
King &amp; deputyes that were present, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we see the end of this action, and how
the <hi>L. Plessis</hi> behaued himselfe therin: But
about 2. monethes after, came forth the
aforesaid little discourse with out name of
author,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Plessis</hi> his new discourse</note> bearinge the title of, <hi>true discourse of
the conference at Fontayn-bleau,</hi> full of elusions,
disguisments, and inuectiues (saith the B.
of <hi>Eureux</hi>) <hi>sett forth by Plessis himselfe, though dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblinge
his name, to the end he might enioye the
fable vnder this maske and ly with out blushing, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding
to his Reader what he thought best:</hi> For so
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:22711:62"/>
are the words of the said Bishopp in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation
of this michinge discourse, which
conteyned, as before hath byn shewed three
principall points; the one in peruerting the
story of the Acts themselues: the second in
diuising new shifts and euasions, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred
not vnto him while he was in the
triall: the third, in recriminations, or obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctinge
other mens falsityes in like manner.
Which kind of proceedinge did more yet
discreditt <hi>Plessis</hi> with the wiser sort of men,
then his former ouerthrow in the field, for
that this did shew indeed that to be true
which <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith;<note place="margin">Tert. de praescript. aduer. hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reses.</note> 
               <hi>that heretiks may more
easily be ouercome, then persuaded;</hi> and that <hi>Plessis</hi>
had an obstinate mynd to go forward, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstandinge
whatsoeuer was, should, or
might be proued against him, but yet diuers
other of the more learned and grauer sort of
his owne side, began, as hath byn said, to
enter into another cogitation, &amp; to thinke
whether yt were not best by this occasion,
to seeke out the truth of matters indeed, and
that without pertinacity or passion, for so
much as yt was a matter concerninge the
eternall saluation or damnation of their
soules.</p>
            <p>And this happy course amonge others,
tooke, (as in part before yow haue vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood)
the aforsaid noble man of <hi>Normandy,
Monsieur Sainct-Mary du Mont,</hi> who being a
great Protestant before, was first moued to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:22711:63"/>
Catholike Religion, partly by the
Sermons of <hi>Monsieur Buchage</hi> brother to <hi>Duke
Ioyeus</hi> made afterward a Capuchin friar, as
hath byn<note n="*" place="margin">Supra cap. 1.</note> declared (which Sermons were
principally against the falsifications of <hi>Plessis</hi>
in his booke <hi>against the Masse</hi>) partly also by
the sight of some of the said falsifications
themselues,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> of Monsieur du Mont, <hi>and of</hi> Monsieur Fresnes.</note> shewed vnto him in priuate by
the said B. of <hi>Eureux</hi> before the conference,
but he was fully conuerted by the trialll it
selfe, and became afterward a zealous Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike.
But more notorious and admirable
was the conuersion of the <hi>L. Fresnes Canay</hi>
cheife president for the Protestant party,
in the parlament Chamber called <hi>Demy par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
in <hi>Languedocke</hi> &amp; chosen by <hi>Monsieur Plessis</hi>
himselfe for chiefe deputy on his party for
this confere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: who taking the same course
in enforminge himselfe, found matters so
euident, as he became a Catholike vpon the
sight of this triall, and that with such fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
as he would not be absolued secretly
of his heresie before held, (as for respect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his dignity and place was offered) but
would needs abiure publikely in the hands
of the B. of <hi>Paris,</hi> and so he did, being a very
learned man in his profession, &amp; at this day
is Embassadour for his Christian Maiestie
with the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> where his wife in
like manner the last yeare, by his owne
especiall meanes (she being a Lady of
much nobility) was conuerted also, &amp; both
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:22711:63"/>
of them remayned most zealous Catholiks.</p>
            <p>Which two examples of <hi>Monsieur Sainct-Mary</hi>
and <hi>Mousieur President Fresnes</hi> (both of
them being learned and earnest Protestants
all their life before) did greatly mooue the
King himselfe, for his comfort and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
in Catholike Religion, but no one
thing so much, as his being present at the
forsaid <hi>Conference,</hi> and so he is said to haue
often confessed afterward, for that he saw
there, that which he could neuer haue ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
to witt that men of learning &amp; iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
would willfully for maintayninge of
faction, wryte and publish that, which they
must needs know in their consciences to be
false. He co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered that these 9. places there
examined,<note place="margin">Motyues of much conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to the Kings Maiestie in this Action.</note> were picked out by <hi>Plessis</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
of 60. sent him by the Bishop, and that
these 60. were but a parcell of 500. which
the said B. had bound himselfe to exhibite
in 10. dayes, to be discussed: and that by all
probability the forsaid 9. were of the least
falsified, and easiest to be defended of all
the rest, at least wise of the first 60. for that
otherwise <hi>Monsieur Plessis</hi> would not haue
chosen them. Wherfore hauinge seene by
experience, that no one of those 9. was able
to be defended from plaine and willfull fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood,
he imagined what would fall out in
the rest, if the conference had gone forward,
and if all should passe as in these 9. through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the 500. there ready to be exhibited, yea
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:22711:64"/>
in 3500. more which the Bishop said he had
gathered out, and offered to bynd himselfe
to conuince them, of no lesse falsity and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture,
then those nyne, and all this out of
one boooke. These things (I say) laid to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather,
his Maiestie had good cause to
thinke, what may be thought of that mans
conscience, that wryteth and printeth such
a booke in matters of Religion.</p>
            <p>Moreouer his Maiestie could not but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
what tales the said <hi>Plessis,</hi> and other
such fellowes had told him against Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks
&amp; Catholike Religion for many yeares,
whilst he was yet a Protestant, to witt, that
they had no truth on their side, no antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

<hi>Plessis</hi> in this last conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion about his booke,
before yt came to the tryall, offering to leese
his life and honour, yea to burne his owne
hand, yf any one place were proued to be
wittingly corrupted, or falsified, which yet
was so euidently conuinced by the triall,
not in one only, but in euery one of the nine
places, as no man of reason could deny yt,
and the deputyes of his owne party gaue
sentence against him.</p>
            <p>Wherfore this hauing so fallen out, and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:22711:64"/>
the Bishop of <hi>Eureux</hi> protestinge of his side,
that the places of greatest corruption re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned

more in number, then those that had byn

<hi>Monsieur Plessis</hi> from the continuation of the
combatt,<note place="margin">His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties comfort in being a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.</note> and the shamelesse discourse cast
abroad by him without a name, wherin
many matters of fact well knowne to his

according to passion, most contrary to the
knowne reall truth therof: All these consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
(I say) &amp; many other concurring
togeather, and representing themselues to
his Maiesties wisdome, made him to feele
infinite comfort in the happy resolution he
had taken of being a Catholike, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
from that day forward all conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious

few or no Catholiks in them, and now are
so many, as his Christian Maiestie hath byn
entreated of late, to name them seuerall Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
Bishops. And the same letters do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
that there is no one moneth lightly
passed, but that in <hi>Auinion</hi> for example (from
whence one of these letters were wrytten)
some 20. 25. 30. or 40. persons, comminge
from other parts abroad of their owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
where heresies do raigne, do abiure
the same in the hands of the Catholike In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitor,
with great zeale and feruour, and
detestation of heresie. And that in the Citty
of <hi>Aubenas,</hi> where one <hi>P. Iacobus Salesius</hi> a Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite
was martyred by the Hugonots a few
yeares gone, aboue 200. haue byn of late

heard of, to be peruerted (God be thanked)
in many yeares togeather.</p>
            <p>All which in great part is ascribed both
to the euent of this conference with <hi>Plessis
Mornay,</hi> &amp; to the diligence of other Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like

where in their bookes and sermons do dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
the falshood of heresie, and hereticall
authors, which no doubt is a principall
point to be vrged against them, though
themselues would seeme to make yt a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

that no one thinge doth gaule them more,
nor mooue discreet, and ingenuous men to

from <hi>Paris,</hi> and returne to <hi>Saumur,</hi> calling his

               </gap>ed how
he might repaire the losse of credit receaued
at <hi>Fountayne-bleau</hi> by the conference; and yt
seemed good in their eyes, full of passion, &amp;
greife, to sett forth a certayne wrytinge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled:
<hi>A true discourse of the conference at Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne-bleau,</hi>
putting no certayne name ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto,
but only these 4. letters F. D. L. M. and
this discourse was printed, and diuulged
with such diligence, for sauing the honour
of their cause, as with in 3. monethes after,
there were 3. seuerall editions extant therof,
as appeareth by the B. of <hi>Eureux</hi> his citation
of the third edition.</p>
            <p>The contents of this discourse consisted
in three things,<note place="margin">Three points of <hi>Plessis</hi> reply.</note> as before we haue shewed:
first in misreportinge and peruertinge, the
very history yt selfe, of the conference: The
second in diuisinge new shifts, for couering
the falsifications before condemned, &amp; sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced:
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:22711:67"/>
the third in recharging the B. with
other pretended falsityes, taken out of <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi>
that gathered the canon law, and some
other; and some other obiected out of the
Bishopp his owne works. All which three
assaults are beaten backe by the B. vpon
him, with a particular confutation therof
printed togeather with the publike Acts:
wherin he sheweth that the first of these
points is great audacity, to goe about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
or disguise that, which the records of 4.
seuerall Secretaryes, and the memory of
aboue 200. wittnesses, can, and do testifie to
the contrary. The second is importunity, to
endeauour to call in question and doubte
againe matters, so authentically examined,
and decyded, &amp; this with lesse reason, then
at the beginning. The rhird is impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:
for that albeit <hi>Plessis</hi> could proue that
others had byn faulty also in their allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
(as he doth not but only by calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
yet was not this any good excuse for
him, nor any iust defence of his honour.
And for that the said Bishop doth handle
largly and learnedly all those three points in
his forsaid confutation: I might remit who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Reader thervnto: and so I shalbe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to do for the later two points, for that
this briefe defence of myne admitteth not so
large a disputation: only I will note heere
some few examples of the first point: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
yow may easily iudge of <hi>Monsieur Plessis</hi>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:22711:67"/>
manner of proceedinge both in that and all
the rest,<note place="margin">Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas cogit. ad turpia.</note> and how <hi>necessity</hi> (as the prouerbe
saith) <hi>enforceth a man oftentymes to shamefull
attempts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First then (saith the Bishop) besides a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
deprauation to be seene in this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of <hi>Monsieur Plessis</hi> of whatsoeuer passed
in the conference, and besides his silent pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
ouer and dissemblinge so many aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
conditions, as were made vnto him,<note place="margin">The first point ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined. <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Refut. fol.</hi> 108.</note>
besides many intolerable slaunders and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniations
laid by him vpon the K. him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
as also vpon the <hi>Chancelour</hi> &amp; deputyes
as partiall against him: he obiecteth diuers
things in particular so manifestly false, &amp; to
be conuinced by the records themselues, as
yt easily declareth, that he had sett vp his
rest to continue the defence of his cause, by
the same meanes of shameles lying, wherby
he had begonne yt.</p>
            <p>As for example in the 34. page of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
&amp; third edition,<note place="margin">1. Depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</note> he wryteth that the
Bishop had obiected vnto him, in the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the third place which was out
of <hi>S. Chrysostome,</hi> vpon the first epistle to the
<hi>Thessalonians,</hi> that he had left out of the text,
these words: (<hi>yf we our selues be negligent</hi>) and
heervpon he insulteth, for that these words
are not in <hi>S. Chrysostome.</hi> But this is great
folly: for the Bishopp obiected the leauinge
out of those words in the sentence of <hi>S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sup. cap. 2. place 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and not of <hi>S. Chrysostome,</hi> as before hath
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:22711:68"/>
byn seene in the examination of those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
and the words obiected to be left out
of <hi>S. Chrysostome,</hi> were others no lesse mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously
cutt of then these. As before yow
haue seene in the examination of the said
third place.</p>
            <p>Then passinge to the page 38. of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
<hi>Plessis</hi> saith (talking of the same place
of <hi>S. Chrysostome</hi>),<note place="margin">2. Depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</note> that the andience hearing
<hi>Chrysostome</hi> to speake of preaching to Saints,
imagined that he had spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of dead Saints:
<hi>and vpon this ignorance</hi> (saith he, for so he qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifieth
the iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of all that were present)
<hi>they gaue an applause, &amp;c.</hi> Which is altogea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
false, for that the applause giuen, was
not vpon this first place of <hi>S. Chrisostome</hi> vpon
the epistle to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> but another
out of his homilyes vpon the second epistle
to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> brought in vpon the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of the fourth place of the nyne before
examined. And the cause of this<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> said ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause
of laughter of the auditory was this:
That <hi>Plessis</hi> pretending to bring two places
out of <hi>Saint Chrysostome</hi> against prayinge to
Saints, which were the third and fourth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
examined, and then yt being proued
by the Bishopp that both those places were
falsified by him, and that they made expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sely
for prayer to Saints, yf he had put them
downe wholy, and truly, he had no other
refuge, yf yow remember, but to say, that
he had putt downe the true sense of <hi>S. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome,</hi>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:22711:68"/>
though not his words: &amp; then being
beaten from that with other places of <hi>Saint
Chrysostome,</hi> declaring his owne meaning for
prayer to Saints, <hi>Plessis</hi> was forced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
against himselfe (that had alleaged him
for impugning prayer to Saints) that indeed
<hi>Chrysostome</hi> allowed prayer to Saints, but yt
was to liue Saints only, and not to dead:
against which shift the Bishopp recyted this
place followinge out of his 26. homily vpon
the second epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> talking
of the pious deuotions of the Emperors of
his tyme, in prayinge to <hi>S. Peter,</hi> and <hi>S. Paul,</hi>
&amp; highly praysing the same in these words:
<hi>He that is apparelled in purple doth make supplication
to Saints,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chrysost. hom. 26. in cap. 2. Cor. &amp; hom. 66. ad Pop An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochen.</note> 
               <hi>that they wilbe his intercessors to God, and
he that weareth a diademe, doth pray to a tent-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
and to a fisher-man now dead, to be his prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors:
and will yow dare then to say that their mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
is dead, whose seruants now after their deathes,
are the Protectors of Emperors liuinge vpon earth?</hi>
Which place being recyted out of <hi>S. Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Cufu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Plessis.</note>
that confirmeth so euidently both
prayer to Saints, and to dead Saints, some
laughter there was, and strangewondering
at the impudency of <hi>Plessis,</hi> in running so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to his refuge of dead and liue Saints: and
he could not but blush to see himselfe so
euidently taken. And this is the applause,
which he complayneth of, though wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and fraudulently alleaged, as yow
haue heard.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:22711:69"/>Furthermore the same <hi>Plessis</hi> passinge on
to handle the decision, and sentence geuen
vpon the foresaid fourth place, telleth his
reader for certayne, that the iudges did not
determine that there was any omission vsed
therin in cytinge <hi>Saint Chrysostomes</hi> words.
Which is such an impudency,<note place="margin">3. Depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</note> as not only
the records of all the foure Secretaryes do
vniformally conuince,<note place="margin">Discours. pag. 36.</note> who haue the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the deputyes thus registred; <hi>that
Monsieur Plessis had left out that which he should
haue putt in:</hi> but the very layinge open of the
text of <hi>Saint Chrysostome</hi> doth conuince the
same, to him that hath eyes and skill to read.</p>
            <p>It followeth vpon the examination of
the same fourth place before mencyoned,<note place="margin">4. Depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</note>
that he chargeth the deputyes of ignorance,
in geuinge sentence (as he saith) that the
words of <hi>S. Chrysostome,</hi> there cyted out of his
homily vpon <hi>S. Mathewes</hi> ghospell, <hi>ought to be
vnderstood of Saints deceased,</hi> wheras they gaue
no such sentence at all, as the records of all
foure secretaryes do testifie,<note place="margin">Discours. pag. 46.</note> but only the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
same sentence, which was giuen before
vpon the third place, to witt; <hi>that Plessis had
left out, that which he should haue put in:</hi> and the
Bishop grauntinge in that place, that those
words of <hi>S. Chrysostome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts fol. 59.</note> being indifferent to
be vnderstood either of dead, or liue Saints:
did vrge, that yf <hi>Plessis</hi> would vnderstand
them only of liue Saints, they made most
against himselfe, who had brought that
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:22711:69"/>
place of <hi>S. Chrysostome</hi> to impugne prayer to
dead Saints. So as this doth only shew a
mynd in <hi>Plessis</hi> to ly, cauill, and calumniate
without releeuing himselfe therby, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
encreasing his dishonour and shame.</p>
            <p>About the fifth place examined out of <hi>S.
Hierome</hi> vpon <hi>Ezechiell,</hi>
               <note place="margin">5. Depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</note> he accuseth greatly
the B. for that he would not (as he saith)
harken to him, when he alleaged another
place of <hi>S. Hierome</hi> vpon the epistle to the
<hi>Galathians,</hi> where he hath these words:<note place="margin">Discourse pag. 48.</note> 
               <hi>At
that day vvhen vve shalbe before the tribunall of
Christ, neyther Noe, Iob, nor Daniell, can pray any
more for any man, &amp;c.</hi> Which charge is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
false, as before<note n="*" place="margin">Suprae cap. 2. loc. 4.</note> yow haue heard de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
in the examination of this place, and
may see in the Acts themselues. For that
albeit the Bishopp told him, that this place
was brought in against order, besides the
number of those 19. which <hi>Plessis</hi> had chosen
to be first examined: yet he was content to
stand vpon the examination therof, yf <hi>Plessis</hi>
would, &amp; of other places cited in his booke,
and to bynd himselfe to proue, that in that
only one page he had committed 4. noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
falsificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; but <hi>Plessis</hi> refused to ioyne
with him in that point;<note place="margin">Acts fol. 69.</note> and so the Bishopp
expounded the place alleaged of <hi>S. Hierome,</hi>
that yt was meant of the day of iudgment,
when no more praying to Saints shalbe, nor
of Saints for vs, which doth not impugne
our present prayinge to them, but rather
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:22711:70"/>
confirme the same. For that <hi>S. Hierome</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
heere, that there shalbe no more pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge
to Saints, or of Saints for vs at the day
of iudgment, doth euidently signifie that
before that tyme, both may be vsed.</p>
            <p>About the examen of the sixth place,<note place="margin">6. Depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</note> out
of <hi>S. Cyrill,</hi> concerning the honouring of the
Crosse, <hi>Plessis</hi> deceaueth notably his Reader,
in tellinge him, that falsity being obiected
vnto him by the Bishop,<note place="margin">Discourse pag. 49.</note> the King spoke in
his behalfe, pronouncing with a loud voyce
that both partyes had reason: which all men
there present know to be false; for that the
King did rather the quite contrary, sayinge,
that wheras <hi>Plessis</hi> had brought that place of
<hi>Cyrills</hi> words to <hi>Iulian,</hi> to proue that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
in his tyme did not adore the Crosse,
yt seemed to him that they proued neyther
the one nor the other, (which was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
of <hi>Plessis,</hi> that had alleaged the
same against honouring the Crosse) &amp; then
his Maiestie added further, that by the obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of <hi>Iulian,</hi> exprobratinge vnto them
that they did honour the Crosse: yt seemed
to him euident, that he would neuer haue
made such an obiection, yf yt had byn alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather
false. Which speach of his Maiestie
being publike and registred in the eares of
all men, a man may see the modesty of <hi>Plessis,</hi>
that dareth so openly, and in print, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert
the same.</p>
            <p>Vpon the very same place he falsifieth also<note place="margin">7. Depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</note>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:22711:70"/>
in like manner, the sentence giuen by the
deputyes,<note place="margin">Discourse pag. 50.</note> sayinge that <hi>the Chancelour pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
simplely, that the words alleaged out of Cyrill,
were not found in him, leauing yt easy to the hearers</hi>
(saith he) <hi>to inferre, that the sense notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge
was to be found in him.</hi> Which is a great
vntruth, for that the sentence registred by
all 4. secretaryes comprehendeth the whole
passage in these words:<note place="margin">Acts fol. 72.</note> 
               <hi>The passage cyted by
Monsieur Plessis out of Cyrill,</hi> is not <hi>found in Cyrill;</hi>
which sentence conteyneth as yow see
both sense and words. And it is a poore shift
of <hi>Plessis,</hi> to go about to help himselfe by so
childish an inference, as for that they gaue
sentence, that the words alleaged by him
were not in <hi>Cyrill,</hi> yt might be inferred, that
the sense was.</p>
            <p>After this the Bishopp sheweth diuers
other grosse vntruthes in this kind, as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely,
that in reportinge the sentence of the
<hi>Chancelour,</hi>
               <note place="margin">8. and 9. Depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</note> and deputyes vpon the last place
examined out of <hi>Theodorete,</hi> about <hi>Idolls,</hi> he
falsely peruerteth the same, leauing out the
principall important words of the said sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
to witt, <hi>adored by Paynims, and adored for
Gods,</hi> contrary to the faith of the records
themselues, vniformally taken by all 4. se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaryes;
&amp; then againe to excuse himselfe
from a foule disgrace, happened in the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of the first place about the reall
presence out of <hi>Scotus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Discourse pag. 60. &amp; 65.</note> whose text <hi>Plessis</hi> could
not read, he telleth in his discourse this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:22711:71"/>
lye, <q>that the B. of <hi>Eureux</hi> had vsed a
certayne fraudulent sleight to disgrace him,
which was to bring two editions of <hi>Scotus,</hi>
the one fayre to be read, which he sent him
ouernight with the 60. places to prepare
himselfe, the other he retayned with him
of an euill print, which he obtruded to him
in the conference.</q> But this shamelesse fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
the Bishop refuteth first by the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of them, that brought backe againe
the bookes from <hi>Plessis</hi> house to the <hi>confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi>
and then by the wittnesse of 4. seuerall
Frenche gentlemen,<note place="margin">A foolish calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niation refuted.</note> to witt, <hi>Monsieur du Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
du Beaulien, du Berulle,</hi> and <hi>du Salettes,</hi> that
came with him from <hi>Paris,</hi> &amp; knew that he
brought but one only edition of <hi>Scotus</hi> with
him, which was <hi>in folio</hi> of the print of <hi>Badius
Ascensius</hi> in the yeare 1519. and lent vnto him
by the college of <hi>Sorbone</hi> in <hi>Paris</hi> for this
<hi>conference,</hi> which booke being giuen to <hi>Plessis</hi>
to verifie his place alleaged out of him, he
could not so much as read, nor turne the
booke, for that there were some abreuia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
therin after the manner of schoole-doctors,
and therby all the lookers on, and
hearers well perceaued that he was vtterly
ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in reading schoole-doctors, though
euery where for ostentation of learning, he
was accostomed to cyte them in his bookes.
And this shame <hi>Plessis</hi> had no other way to
couer, at that present, before all the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
but to say that he was not practised
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:22711:71"/>
but in his owne bookes only, though after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
vpon more deliberation, he thought
good to deuise this other shift of changinge
the booke by the Bishopp, which yet being
so malitiously co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uinced of calumniation by
the wittnesses before mentioned, did excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
tend to <hi>Plessis</hi> discredit. And this shall
suffice for the first point of <hi>Plessis</hi> reply,
wherin yow see, that for defence of his 9.
places before conuicted of falsification, he
vttereth 9. other great vntruthes, for dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blinge
the number.</p>
            <p>As for the other two points of new shifts
and recrimination,<note place="margin">The other 2. points of <hi>Plessis</hi> discourse</note> I will remitt the Reader
to the Bishop his owne refutation, for them
that vnderstand the french tongue; and for
the rest yt will not be hard to ghesse by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of this which we haue alleaged, what

for his further defence in so manifest
conuinced falsifications; and yow shall heare
presently what <hi>O. E.</hi> in England can say for
him. And yf yow find him by this little, a

not only of this his booke <hi>against the
Masse,</hi> wherout so many falsifications haue
byn gathered, but of others also wrytten in

the eyes of many, as did also this other <hi>against

by learned men. But for the other in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
I can assure the Reader, that yt is a most

            <p>HAVING pervsed what <hi>Monsieur Plessis</hi>

in the conference and after, vpon better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation:
we must now examine briefly
what our ould frend <hi>O. E.</hi> (for vnder that
vizard he masketh hitherto) hath diuised
for his defence: For that my forsaid breife
relation, fallinge into his hands, he thought
yt to appertayne to his manhood, as a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
minister, to proclayme himselfe cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion
in <hi>Plessis</hi> quarrell, therby to fullfill the
prouerbe; <hi>that none so bold as blynd bayard:</hi> and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:22711:73"/>
though he be not able to defend his owne
head (as after yow shall see) from the same
or like blowes which <hi>Plessis</hi> hath receaued:
yet will he needs be doing, &amp; intrude him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
for a shylde to the other; and this with
such violence, or rather virrulency of speche
raginge and rauinge at all those, that will
seeme to touch <hi>Plessis</hi> fidelity, in the places
alleaged, as he may seeme to need rather
byndinge then answeringe: yet somewhat
shall we say to him, as the straitnesse of this
place and tyme will permitt; and therby
shew sufficiently what manner of aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
he is, and that hauing lost or laid aside (as
it seemeth) all manner of respect to sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastnes
and modestie, he may easily lend out
his tongue &amp; pen for small hire to any man.
And truly I can not but maruayle, that a
man of his profession &amp; place, can persuade
himselfe that so excessiue a raylinge and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious
stile, against all whome he auns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wereth, should gayne him credit with any
modest or sober sort of men: he will find
some in the end that will returne him <hi>legem
talionis</hi> &amp; then he may count his gaine. I for
my part am resolued not to be drawen by
him to that veine, but to vrge him only
with substantiall points of the controuersy
in hand, as the reader shall see by that
which ensueth.</p>
            <p>Wherfore to come to the matter, wheras
<hi>Monsieur Plessis</hi> diuided his refuge into three
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:22711:73"/>
points, as before yow haue heard. The first
concerninge the history of the conference
it selfe;<note place="margin">Three partes of <hi>Plessis</hi> defence.</note> the second in seeking out new eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
the third in recriminations: <hi>O. E.</hi> set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
before vs the same Coleworts sodden
againe, but guised after another fashion;
puttinge <hi>recriminations</hi> in the first place of all,
but much more vaynely then <hi>Plessis</hi> did in
the third. And in the second he taketh vpon
him to defend the truth and fidelity of <hi>Plessis</hi>
in all the places before examined. And for
that in this point consisteth in deed the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
substance of the controuersie: I shall only
examine the same in this place, leauing the
other to a more full and larger aunswere,
when we shall haue vewed a seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d edition,
which <hi>O. E.</hi> is said to haue made of his new
chalenge, in fiue seuerall controuersies to

with this only aduertisment premised, that
it shall be good for the Reader first to looke

(which heere <hi>O. E.</hi> would haue to by so

called) cannot be censured for lesse then
willfull imposture. For yf he had not so
much iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as to discerne an obiection
from a resolution, then was he a simple fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
to wryte books: and yf he did discerne
yt, and yet sought to deceaue his Reader in

&amp; solued by him. This is the charge
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:22711:75"/>
of the Bishop against him. And what will
yow say to Maister <hi>Sutcliffe</hi> auouchinge the
contrary? But lett vs see what manner of
proofe he will bring for his assertion, for

Yf this can be proued I will call <hi>O. E.</hi> a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

that yt is rashnesse to affirme that the body of Christ,

to that, which <hi>S. Chrysostome</hi> did make.
For that he exhorteth men to pray to Saints

impertinency, there is little accoumpt to be
made, where there is imposture, and open

all that he saith in this cause. And yow will

two obiections of his aduersary brought in

<hi>S. Chrysostomes</hi> words quite against the

his aduocate will answere the two charges:

the aforsaid words left out were alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:22711:84"/>
impertinent or no, which we shall
briefly examination.</p>
               <p>The question was whether <hi>S. Chrysostome</hi>
in his commentaryes vpon <hi>S. Mathew</hi> did go
about to ouerthrow the foundation of
prayinge to Saints,<note place="margin">The state of the question and <hi>O. E.</hi> his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</note> as <hi>Plessis</hi> said that he did,

words: <hi>that we haue more assurance by our owne
prayers &amp; good life, then by the prayers of others, &amp;c.</hi>
And presently after the said Father adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
for his explication the other words
left out by <hi>Plessis: vve do not say this, that vve
should not pray to Saints, but to the end that our

would aske: were these words altogeather
impertinent to haue byn put in or no? Or is
not <hi>O. E.</hi> an impertinent fellow, not to blush

words yf they had bene expressed, doe vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly

And thus is the first obiection auns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered

him, lett vs see the second, whither he will

               <p>The second obiection was,<note place="margin">The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond charge more foolishly aunswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</note> that <hi>Plessis</hi> had

and therfore we are not so continually to pray to
Saints, and so to trust in their intercession as the
Church of Rome doth, that maketh prayer to Saints
a great peece of their Church seruice.</hi> Marke heere
two points (gentle Reader) first that albeit
<hi>S. Chrysostome</hi> do say and protest, that by his
words; <hi>we must confide more in our owne diligence,
then in others,</hi> he meaneth not against prayer
to Saints: yet <hi>O. E.</hi> saith that yt followeth
of his words, <hi>that we must not rely vpon Saints
prayers,</hi> whome shall we beleeue, either <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi>
of his owne meaninge and intent, or
<hi>O. E.</hi> that will force him to say that which
he denyeth? Secondly do yow marke that
<hi>O. E.</hi> seemeth heere to admit some certaine
measure of prayer to Saints, so yt be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate:
for he saith that, <hi>we must not so continually
pray to Saints, nor so trust in their intercessions, as the
Church of Rome doth, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But heere (perhaps) some man will aske
me, is it possible that <hi>O. E.</hi> hath so little
iudgement as not to see this absurdity, to
force <hi>S. Chrysostomes</hi> meaninge against his
owne protestation? Wherto I aunswere
that at length he saw yt, and went about to
remedy the same, thus:<note place="margin">O. E. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fut. ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>But were yt</hi> (saith he)
<hi>that the argument were not good</hi> (to witt of <hi>Plessis</hi>

collection out of <hi>S. Chrysostome) and his consorts
do commit falsifications, as often as they bring weake
or euill shapen arguments.</hi> Wherto I aunswere,
that yf they should be so mishapen as yours
<hi>(Syr Mathew)</hi> are, that do bely the author to
his face, and will beare him downe that he
meaneth the plaine contrary to that which
he protesteth in expresse words, I would
not only say that they were weake and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shapen,
but false and malitious also; and
the authors worthy to leese their creditt
for euer.</p>
               <p>Finally <hi>O. E.</hi> hauing no more to say about
this place,<note place="margin">A false and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> concludeth his whole defence in

(videlicet in the confere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce by <hi>Plessis) that
Chrysostome had nothinge in this place, that might
force vs to beleeue that he taught or beleeued prayers
to Saints departed, which may serue fully to answere
all the aduersaryes vaine cautillations.</hi> Wherto I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
that I know not what may be sufficient
to force <hi>O. E.</hi> and his faithlesse bretheren, to
beleeue that <hi>S. Chrisostome</hi> approued prayers
to Saints: but yf his owne words often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
may be sufficient, yow haue heard
them before sufficiently out of him selfe, &amp;
consequently the iudicious Reader will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily

certayne words out of <hi>S. Hierome</hi> vpon
the Prophett <hi>Ezechiell</hi> as makinge against
prayer to Saints, leauinge out those words
that immediatly followed, and declared his
whole meaning. The words alleaged were:
<hi>that we must confide in God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hier. l. 4. in Ezech. cap. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>and not in other mens
prayers: for albeit they be Saints and Prophetts, yet
shall they deliuer but their owne soules, and not those
of their children, yf their children be negligent.</hi>
Which last words <hi>(if their children be negligent)
Plessis</hi> craftily cutt of, and being pressed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
and not able to cleere himselfe, had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
after many shifts reiected, iudgement
geuen against him of falshood, as before you
haue heard. Let vs see now,<note place="margin">Sup. cap. 2.</note> how <hi>O. E.</hi> will
recouer his creditt againe, and remember
what I noted before of his willing obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
when he hath no list to be vnderstood, as
I presume the ordinary Reader will hardly
vnderstand him in this passage,<note place="margin">VVillfull obscurity of O. E.</note> yf this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication

his defence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The fifth obiection was</hi> (saith he) <hi>for that in
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:22711:86"/>
Plessis citing these words out of Hieroms comment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes

But before I aunswere yt, I would first aske
him, why he putteth downe the state of this
controuersie so darkely? for yf I had not
explaned the matter somewhat before, who
would heere haue vnderstood wherin the
difficulty lieth? for what sense do make
those words in Latyn, and not englished,
<hi>bonum est confidere in Domino, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>si negligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
fuerint?</hi> but all this is of art and fraud to
dazell the Readers eyes, that he vnderstand
not the falsity wherin <hi>Plessis</hi> was taken. For
yf his proctor <hi>O. E.</hi> had sett downe the true
words of the controuesie, as I did before, his
question had byn aunswered of it selfe: for
who but a simple fellow will put in doubt,
but that the words before rehearsed <hi>(yf their
children be negligent)</hi> be of cheife importance
to be putt in, or left out, seing they do solue
all the difficulty? <hi>For yf the children of Saints be
negligent</hi> (saith Saint Hierome) <hi>then vvill not
the only prayers of their parents saue them:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hier. ibid.</note> but yf
they be diligent, and do cooperate also of
their owne parts, <hi>then will they auayle them,</hi> as
<hi>S. Chrysostome</hi> in like manner declared in the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:22711:86"/>
former passage. Consider then how true, &amp;
substantial this first defence of <hi>O. E.</hi> is, which
maketh his entrance with so blynd &amp; false
relation of the controuersy it selfe, and how
well he deserueth to be an aduocate for
others, that so marreth his clie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts cause euen

                  <hi>Besides</hi> (saith he) <hi>the ordinary glosse doth rehearse

of words in the text, but <hi>Plessis</hi> tooke
vpon him to sett downe a whole place out
of <hi>S. Hierome,</hi> for impugning prayer to Saints
desceased, and so cyted them <hi>verbatim</hi> and at
large, vntill he came to the words that made
against him:<note place="margin">Gloss. in cap. 14. in Ezech.</note> to witt, <hi>that Saints prayers will not

condition yet the glosse omitteth not but
expresseth yt in other equiualent words
thus: <hi>yf they follow not the faith and works of their

not the words, as now they are found
in bookes falsifyed by Idolaters and Crosse

cyteth the law out of authenticall records.
Our wise relator heere,<note place="margin">An other defence of <hi>O. E.</hi>
                  </note> to make the matter

<hi>Iustinian</hi> was not yet in the world, when

if <hi>Tribonian,</hi> in the Emperours name,

seing both <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beris</hi>

condemned paintinge of images.</p>
               <p>Thus pleadeth <hi>O. E.</hi> for his client, but in
such sort, as I thinke verily heerafter few
will entertayne him for their aduocate, and
though he thrust himselfe in, as he hath
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:22711:91"/>
done in this cause, he wilbe reiected and
thrust out againe, and barred of all practise,
as a puny pettifogger, that doth more hurt
then help his clients cause, we shall make a
few notes vpon this his answere, wherby,
and by readinge the examen made before
vpon this place,<note place="margin">Sup. cap. 2.</note> in the conference yt selfe,
yow will easily see the vanity therof. First
then yt is false, that <hi>Plessis</hi> alleaged <hi>Petrus Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitus,</hi>
though he quoted his name in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
there being great difference betweene
allegation and quotation.<note place="margin">Acts. fol. 77.</note> As all men know
that are learned the text of <hi>Plessis</hi> went thus:
<hi>vvhat vvill they say</hi> (to witt the Papists) <hi>to the
Emperors</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">This is false for it was <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> the second &amp;. <hi>Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> the third.</note> 
                  <hi>Theodosius and Valens, vvho by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
edict, did forbidd the paintinge of images.</hi>
Thus he did triumphe, with the Emperors
themselues in the text, though in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
he quoted <hi>Crinitus</hi> for his refuge, when
he should be pressed. Secondly, where he
saith; <hi>that Crinitus cyteth the law out of authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
records, and not as they are found now falsified
by Idolators,</hi> yt is a notorious vanity, and this
audacious Iconoclast should haue cyted
some proofe out of some one author or

without all reason or authority auouch so

when <hi>Plessis</hi> had vsed diuers shifts as
well by some shew of proofe, that <hi>Idolls</hi> and

and then that the clause omitted was not of
such importance, &amp; after both these refuges
largely confuted by the Bishopp,<note place="margin">The state of the question.</note> as in part
yow may see before vpon the examen of
this place, sentence was giuen against him
by consent of all the deputyes, which <hi>O. E.</hi>
would now gladly haue reuersed. Let vs see
his good reasons and arguments he bringeth
for the same.</p>
               <p>To the first obiection of Translating fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sely

                  <hi>O. E.</hi> first answereth
thus: <hi>As yf euery one</hi> (saith he) <hi>that doth translate

all badd translations of the old Latyn interpreter of
the Bible, were so many falsifications.</hi> And is not
this a substantiall answere? we do not say
(<hi>Syr Mathew</hi>) that all erroneous translations
be falsifications, yf they be of meere error,
without malice, but yf yt be with plaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to deceaue the reader, and to make

               <p>And where our English Sectaryes at this

diuersly, accordinge as yt serueth to their

example, the selfe same Greeke word <hi>Idoll</hi>
and <hi>Idolator</hi> they translate in some places so,
and in other, <hi>Image,</hi> and <hi>Imageworshippers:</hi> the

gentills did their Idolls: those reasons therfore that
are forcible against the Idolls of the Gentills, are also
most forcible against the Popish vvorshipp of Images.</hi>
So saith he. And this is all the substance of
his aunswere to this obiection, wherin to
omit his intemperat raylinge I would haue
euery man of reason to consider the folly &amp;
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:22711:97"/>

worshipped for Gods, wherin standeth the

is apparant, in telling vs, that if these words

Sutcliffe</hi> disorderly to bring in, to the end
he might seeme, that the accusations laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, are for such trifles: but neither
these trifles, nor the mistakinge of matters
themselues (so yt be without fraud) are vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

faults which we obiect vnto <hi>Maister Sutcliffe</hi>
and his fellowes, and not <hi>misplacing of margi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
notes, or mistandinge of words, points, or quotae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi>
nay we may ad a further degree of false

which is,<note place="margin">Diuerse degreas of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shode &amp; falsifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> that where the falshood is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
and cannot be denyed, nor by any probable

same, nor to excuse yt by ignorance, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnes,
trust vpon other men, or by any like
error, but to continue, and bolster out the
same by other sleights and new frauds: this
I say is the highest degree of all falshood and
impudency, &amp; vsed as now yow haue seene
both by <hi>Maister Plessis</hi> in his reply after his
first confutation; and much more by <hi>Maister
Sutcliffe</hi> his aduocate in his broken defence,
and the like we shall see practised againe by
him afterward in this Chapter, vpon like
occasions of defendinge himselfe, and his
owne wrytings.</p>
            <p>Concerninge which wrytings, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth
in his said epistle to <hi>Syr Robert Cecill,</hi>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:22711:102"/>
as also in his preface to the reader a certaine
priuiledge from the ciuill law, which is, that
when diuers cases are proposed by one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in law to be admitted, or excepted against
by the other, and that the other excepteth
only against some, and letteth passe the rest;
then yt is to be vnderstood (saith the law)
that those which are not excepted against,
are admitted. Which benefitt <hi>Maister Sutcliffe</hi>
would haue allowed to his chalenge; that
is, wheras <hi>E. O.</hi> hath excepted only against
some 26. places of Fathers and Doctors cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
and falsifyed by him; all the rest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
these 26. might be held as free from
corruption.<note place="margin">Decius in I. 1. ff. de Reg. iur.</note> 
               <hi>Yf lawyers say true</hi> (saith he) <hi>that
exceptions confirme the rule in cases not excepted,
then hath my aduersary confirmed the mayne dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course

not said any thing vnto yt, but only excepted against a
few places, wherof he taketh 13. to be vntruly allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and 13. to be falsifyed.</hi> And againe in his
preface to the reader: <hi>yf he be not able to except
against more places then 26. or ther about, yt is cleere
that I haue said true in the rest, and that I haue ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued
and alleaged authorityes to good purpose.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sutcliffe</hi> would autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize the rest of his booke by a priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the ciuill law.</note> So he.
And will not heere our iudge laugh againe
thinke yow, to see this poore man endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
so diligently to authorize his booke,
by the accusations of his aduersary, and by a
priuiledge drawne from the <hi>Ciuill</hi> law? The
rule alleaged of exceptions doth hold only
where some few cases are proposed to be
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:22711:102"/>
excepted against, by the aduerse party, but
it holdeth not in a mayne booke, where the
points are many, and almost infinite that are
handled and proposed, and out of which is
lawfull for any accuser to take his accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
where he will, without authorizinge
or ratifyinge the rest, and in our common
law of England no man can be ignorant,
but that yf one should be accused (for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample)
for stealinge of 5. sheepe, and should
acquitte himselfe therof: yet this would not
barre any other accuser, that would after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
call him into tryall for hauing stolen
fiftye more.</p>
            <p>Wherfore <hi>Maister Sutcliffe</hi> can not shroud
himselfe by this, but that other men also
may examine his chalenge<note place="margin">Challeng. 3. cap. 9.</note> besides <hi>E. O.</hi> as
we haue seene that <hi>VV. R.</hi> hath done, and
gathered out an infinite huge heape of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes,
and if I ghesse not amisse, not much
lesse then a hundred in one Chapter. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
seing <hi>Sutcliffe</hi> is so earnest to prouoke &amp;
intreate aduersaryes to wryte against him,
yt is reason he prepare himselfe to answere
all commers, &amp; not to slipp away vnder the
shaddow of a Ciuilian rule or priuiledge,
for so much as he is an Englishman, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
must be tryed by the common
law of the land.</p>
            <p>And this may suffice for this first part of
his new worke, standinge in epistles &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces,
except yow would haue a breefe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:22711:103"/>

beginning, of the manner of answering and
shiftinge, which he meaneth to vse after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
in his whole discourse, and therby
know the man &amp; his talent euen at his first
entrance. Heare then how he answereth a
speach of his aduersary touching the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of Catholike Religion.<note place="margin">In his preface to the Reader.</note> 
               <hi>My aduersary</hi>
(saith he) <hi>calleth Popish Religion Catholike, &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth
it was pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted heere by Gregory the great, &amp;c.
and that it was alwayes visible since Christ, &amp;c.
but he should do well to shew how true Religion can
be visible, for our Sauiour Christ saith: that true
vvorshippers vvorshipp God in spiritt, and truth, but
spirituall vvorshipp and true internall deuotion, is not
so easily seene; vnlesse therfore our aduersary suppose
Popish Religion to consist in the Popes myter, and in

and this was that which his aduersary
mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t when he said, that the visible Church
or Congregation of Englishmen, comming
downe visibly from the tyme of <hi>S. Gregory</hi>
vnto oures, and professing alwayes one and
the selfe same faith &amp; Religion, did make a
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:22711:103"/>
visible Church, and therby a visible dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Catholike Religion, for the space
of a thousand yeares to geather, and that
this was not only to be seene or proued by
the Popes myter, or cooles of monkes, (as
this merry madd minister iesteth) but by all
English Kings crownes, and coronations,
by all parlament robes, and other honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
testimonyes of our nobility both spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
and temporall, and by whatsoeuer
other most authenticall proofe this scoffer
can diuise. And who then will not laugh
to see him, for ouerthrow of all this demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
to start out behind a bush, and say:

out at;<note place="margin">The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by <hi>Sutcliffe</hi> to runne out at.</note> first, that albeit <hi>Caluyn</hi> confesse these
ceremonyes to be very auncient, and that
the foresaid ould Fathers and Doctors do
mention them in their writings: yet do they
not mention the vse of the Apostles, or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of the auncient Church before their
dayes. Is not this a pretty shift? as though
themselues were not sufficient witnesses of
the ancient Church? The second is, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
the Fathers, though dispersedly as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
was offered, mencioned these ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes
as vsed in the Church in their dayes,
yet did they not sett them downe altogea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in one place. And is not this a more silly
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:22711:106"/>
shift? as though the Fathers testimonyes of
them in seuerall were nothing, except they
did set them downe altogeather; by which
reason, the Euangelists themselues may be
reiected, for that they putt not downe all
things togeather but many dispersedly, as
occasion is offered to treat of them. The
third is, that albeit these ceremonyes were
in vse in the primitiue Church, yet not in
the same particular signes and formes of
words, as they are vsed now in the Roman
Church; for so he hath a little after, that yf
we wilbe obstinate, we must proue that the
Fathers prayed in consecratinge lights, or
vsed the same words in hallowinge water
&amp; salt, which is now set downe in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Missall; &amp; by these &amp; other like shifts,
which for breuityes sake I omitt, he putteth
of all, that can be laid against him.</p>
            <p>And it is as good a manner of answering,
as a merry good fellow is said to haue vsed
at <hi>Oxford,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of statutes by a good fellow stude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in <hi>Oxford.</hi>
               </note> in a visitation to auoid the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the breach of certayne Statutes of
his colledge, in the beginninge of the late
Queenes raigne; to witt, that when the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
was vrged against him, which did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidd
schollers vpon paine of expulsion to
come in or go out ouer the walles; he ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered:
<hi>that is true when the gates be open:</hi> and
then being vrged by another statute forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge
vnder the same paines to beare any
weapons; he answered: <hi>that bearinge is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:22711:106"/>
in mens hands, but not as hanginge at their gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dills.</hi>
And by these meanes was he able to
answere fully all obiections made against
him for breach of statutes. And so is <hi>Sutcliffe</hi>
for falsifyinge of Fathers by the like manner
of answeringe. And this shall suffise for the
first place. In the end wherof notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
he returneth againe to <hi>Caluyn</hi> as being
more troubled with his authority, then all
the other Fathers brought against him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maister Caluyn</hi> (saith he) <hi>doth not affirme any
thinge contrary to my words,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ansvvere to <hi>except. pag.</hi> 5.</note> 
               <hi>for albeit he saith, that
he knew how ancient some of these ceremonyes are,
vvhich I deny to haue bene vsed in the first Churches;
yet doth he not expresse how auncient they are, nor
speake any thinge of their seuerall formes, &amp;c.</hi> Lo
shiftinge &amp; shufflinge vpon <hi>Caluyn</hi> also. He
did graunt, <hi>they were auncient,</hi> but did not tell
how ancient; and <hi>Sutcliffe</hi> said before, <hi>that
they were not practised in the ancient Church,</hi> and
now he saith; <hi>that he denyed them to be vsed in the
first Churches;</hi> and though thirdly yow should
proue that they were vsed as <hi>Caluyn</hi> saith in
the ancient Church; yet will he say that <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyn</hi>
doth not affirme them to haue bene in
the first Churches of all; nor doth he speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
the perticular formes of words, now vsed
by the Roman Church. And so will he
scape out that way; but now I would aske
the discreett reader in good sadnes what
scriptures, what Fathers, what most eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
truth, may not be shifted of, and delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:22711:107"/>
by these kind of illusions. Let the reader
but looke ouer the sixt Chapter of ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes,<note place="margin">Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg. cent. 2. 3. 4. cap. 6.</note>
in the 2. 3. 4. and fifth centuryes of the

of all these points against <hi>Sutcliffe</hi> in this
place.</p>
            <p>The second place obiected by <hi>E. O.</hi> to <hi>O.
E.</hi> is in the same page, where he saith: <hi>It is no
Catholike doctrine of the Councell of Trent,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d place.</note> 
               <hi>to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
them accursed, that shall not hold baptisme to
be necessary to Saluation.</hi> The words of the
Councell are these in the fourth Canon
concerning baptisme: <hi>Si quis dixerit baptismum
liberum esse,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sess. 7. Can. 5.</note> 
               <hi>hoc est, non necessarium ad salutem, ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema
sit.</hi> 
               <q>Yf any man do affirme that bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
is free, that is to say, not necessary to
saluation, lett him be accursed.</q> And it is to
be vnderstood <hi>re vel voto,</hi> as generally all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
diuines do expound, to witt that a
man be eyther really or actually baptized, or
at least wise haue a desire therof, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
is to be vnderstood in them that haue
yeares of vnderstandinge, and are letted
otherwise by some extrinsecal meanes from
actuall receauinge the same. And what
Christian man would reprehend this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
or call it vncatholike, as <hi>Sutcliffe</hi> doth?
<hi>E. O.</hi> assaulteth him with three sorts of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
as himselfe confesseth. First the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of ancient Fathers, that affirme bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
to be necessary to saluation; secondly
the words of their owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion booke,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:22711:107"/>
where talking of the Sacrament of <hi>Baptisme,</hi>
they say, <hi>that none is saued that is not regenerate
by water.</hi> Thirdly out of his owne words, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
tymes repeated in other places vpon
other occasions, where he saith, <hi>that children
by baptisme are receaued into the arke of Christ his
Church.</hi> And againe; <hi>that want of baptisme sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
infants to hell fire.</hi> Wherof his aduersary
inferreth: <hi>ergo</hi> yt is necessary to saluation; for
that neither out of the arke, nor in hell fire,
can they be saued, which is the same do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
that the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> doth
teach, and addeth a curse to them that deny
yt. And these are the charges giuen; now
lett vs see how <hi>Sutcliffe</hi> seeketh to runne out
of the lists.</p>
            <p>First he standeth much vpon the words
<hi>lett them be accursed,</hi> and willeth vs to shew
out of the Fathers that they do vse the word
<hi>accursed:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Answere to <hi>except. pag.</hi> 5.</note> 
               <hi>Neither doth any Father</hi> (saith he) <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
that such are accursed that hold not baptisme
to be necessary.</hi> Is not this an egregious foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?
as though the controuersie were of the
word <hi>accursed,</hi> &amp; not of the doctrine yt selfe,
seing that <hi>Sutcliffes</hi> owne words in his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
are:<note place="margin">The first notable shift.</note> 
               <hi>VVhich doctrine</hi> (of the Councell)
<hi>doth not</hi> (saith he) <hi>appeare to be Catholike,</hi> and
yet now would he hide himselfe vnder the
word <hi>accursed,</hi> as though the controuersie
were not about the doctrine, but about the
word, and yet of we will stand also vpon
the curse, <hi>Sutcliffe</hi> cannot so escape, but must
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:22711:108"/>
vndergoe the said curse in like manner, for
he shall find the same both condemned and
accursed expressely in the Councells of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi>
and <hi>Miliuitanum,</hi> at which <hi>S. Augustine</hi>
was present: and vpon both the said Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells
earnest request, the same was accursed
also by <hi>Pope Innocentius</hi> the first, as testifyeth
<hi>S. Augustine epist. 90. 92. &amp; 93.</hi> And this is the
first shift.</p>
            <p>Secondly, of all the Fathers that spake of
this matter against him, and <hi>S. Augustine</hi> by
name in almost infinite places, he maketh
his aduersary to alleage only one text out of
the said Father (and we must beleeue him
for that we haue not his aduersaryes trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise)
<hi>S. Augustines</hi> place is <hi>lib. 3. de anima cap. 9.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aug. l. 3. de orig. animae ad Vinc. Vict. cap. 9.</note>
but cyteth not his words, yet aunswereth
them thus: <hi>To S. Augustine I answere, that he
speaketh of such as dy in originall sinne, and seeme to
contemne baptisme.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Asname<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse shif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of, of <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten.</hi> and the rest of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> This is the most blockish
refuge, that possibly can be imagined: for
first all men before baptisme dy in originall
sinne, and secondly <hi>S. Austen</hi> speaketh of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
that haue not capacity to contemne
baptisme, his words are these: <hi>Noli credere,
noli dicere, noli docere,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>do not thou beleeue, do
thou not say, do thou not teach, yf thou wilt be a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike,
that infants preuented by death, before they
be baptized, can come to receaue pardon of originall
sinne.</hi> Behould then the forehead of <hi>Sutcliffe</hi>

places of <hi>S. Augustine</hi> more expressely auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge

or willfull, in that he would aunswere
<hi>S. Augustine</hi> without lookinge vpon him: yf
he did and aunswered as he doth, then is he
both malitious and shameles.</p>
            <p>But now thirdly to the authority of their
<hi>communion-booke</hi> brought against him by <hi>E. O.</hi>
sayinge; <hi>that none is saued,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The 3. shift.</note> 
               <hi>that is not regenerate
by baptisme,</hi> he answereth thus: <hi>It is impious to
tye Gods grace to Sacraments,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>VVe exclude not
extraordinary courses.</hi> Wherin first (as yow see)
he reiecteth plainly the authority of the
said <hi>Communion-booke,</hi> that tyeth saluation to
regeneration by baptisme, &amp; secondly yow
must remember, that the question, whether
this doctrine of <hi>Sutcliffe</hi> of extraordinary
courses, and sauinge men without baptisme
be Catholike, &amp; conforme to the vniuersall
doctrine of ancient Fathers or noe, wherof
he speaketh not one word, nor alleageth
any one testimony to prooue his opinion
<hi>Catholike,</hi> that is to say <hi>generall</hi> and <hi>vniuersall,</hi>
but only saith: <hi>vve exclude not extroordinary
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:22711:109"/>
courses,</hi> and telleth vs not who these: (<hi>vve</hi>) are,
for that it cannot be the Church of England
which set forth the said communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> booke,
and consequently hauing neyther the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Church, nor our Church at this day,
nor the Church of England to stand with
him, I would gladly know how he will
make his opinion Catholike, that is vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall.
And thus much of the third shift.</p>
            <p>The fourth is in his answere to his owne
words, alleaged against him by <hi>E. O.</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
he aunswereth thus:<note place="margin">The fifth shift and cosenage</note> 
               <hi>I do confesse that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants

that cannot desire baptisme. For as for
others that be of age, and do desire yt, they
may be saued by baptisme in desire, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is graunted. Againe your immediate
words before in this very sentence, doe
speake of infants: for you say; <hi>I do confesse that
infants are damned to hell fire;</hi> and what a fellow
are yow then, which say in the second part
of the same sentence, <hi>albeit they much desire yt
and beleeue in Christ Iesus.</hi> Thirdly yow said a
little before, <hi>that vvant of baptisme did soud in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
to hell,</hi> and now yow say, <hi>that infants dying
in originall sinne are damned to hell fire,</hi> which

yf of eternall, how can yt be caused by the
want of small matters? yf of temporall, how
is it caused by want of knowledge? or how
agrees it with the death caused by want of
baptisme, which is eternall? how agreeth
yt also with sendinge to hell, which is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure

that neyther Catholike Priests now at this

yet do I not meane to stand vpon these

what substance they haue, wherfore lett vs
passe to see how he answereth the foresaid
authorityes of Fathers alleaged against him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the place of Chrysostome</hi> (saith he) <hi>I do ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were,</hi>

part of the comentarye is plaine contrary
to the text yt selfe, which saith yf yow re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
<hi>that much gaine and profit doth come vnto

they ly in <hi>S. Chrysostome</hi> are yet more signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
for that talking of the Apostles, whome

of praying for the dead in time of the
deadfull misteryes, he saith: <hi>Sciunt enim indè
illis multum contingere lucrum, vtilit atem magnam.</hi>
The Apostles did know, that the soules
departed were to receaue much gaine, and
great vtility by that remembrance made
for them. The former part also of the auns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were,

himselfe at large in this matter, read the 41.
homily vpon the first to the Corinthians,
and his 21. vpon the Acts of the Apostles,
and then yow will confesse, that these are
egregious companions, in so deluding their
readers by shamefull shiftinge. And this of
<hi>S. Chrysostome:</hi> now lett vs see what he saith
to <hi>S. Epiphanius</hi> and <hi>S. Augustine</hi> about <hi>Aërius</hi>
condemned of heresie well neere 1300.
yeares past for denying sacrifice and prayers
to be offered for the dead.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vnto the places</hi> (saith he) <hi>of Epiphanius and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> (I answere) <hi>that Aërius was condemned
for disalowinge the order of the Church in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration

               <hi>and geuing thanks for their
blessed end, and this is that prayer which Caluyn and
we confesse to haue byn in the Church a long tyme.</hi>
Heere yow see that he taketh vpon him to
aunswere to three seuerall partyes, to witt
<hi>S. Epiphanius, S. Augustine</hi> and <hi>Iohn Caluyn,</hi> and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:22711:113"/>
that with the same truth that he answered
before <hi>S. Chrysostome:</hi> to witt, with plaine
cosenage and shiftinge. For vnto the two
Fathers he saith (yf he say any thinge) that
they affirmed <hi>Aërius</hi> to haue bin condemned
as an heretike, not for denyinge sacrifice or
prayer for the dead, but for disallowing the
order of the Church in their commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
&amp; geuing thanks for their blessed end,
which comme moration he expoundeth a
little before, <hi>to haue byn a recytall only of dead
mens names, without any prayer for remission of
sinnes,</hi> which yf yt were so, and that <hi>Sutcliffe</hi>
will graunt as he seemeth to do, that <hi>Aërius</hi>
was iustly condemned and held for an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike,
for disallowinge this commemoration
or recytall of dead mens names, why do
the Protestants also disallow the same, or
at leastwise do not vse yt in England in
their communion, and so by omittinge the
same doe participate with him in the same
heresie.</p>
            <p>But all this is shamefull shifting, turning
and wyndinge of a leud and lost conscience
to deceaue the reader, for the words of <hi>Saint
Epiphanius</hi> and <hi>S. Augustine</hi> are most plaine &amp;
euident that <hi>Aërius</hi> was condemned of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
for denyinge prayers and sacrifices to be
offered for the dead:<note place="margin">Aug. haer. 53.</note> 
               <hi>orare vel offerre pro mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:22711:113"/>
not yeaster day but in the tyme of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
the great, when <hi>Aërius</hi> was condemned
as an heretike by the whole Church of that
tyme, for denyinge these points which our
Protestants deny also, &amp; blaspheme at this
day. <hi>Magnum mundo malum</hi> (saith <hi>Epipbanius</hi> of
<hi>Aërius) suriosus mente,</hi>

               <hi>elatus opinione, &amp;c. Aërius</hi>
was a great plague of the world, furious in
mynd, and proud in his opinion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What
would he haue said of <hi>Sutcliffe</hi> at this tyme,
who sheweth himselfe no lesse proud then
he, and auoucheth the same heresyes, and
many more besides?</p>
            <p>But to returne to <hi>Sutcliffes</hi> answere to the
forsaid two Fathers concerning <hi>Aërius.</hi> First
yow may see &amp; consider, that in his former
relation of the matter, he vseth a sleight of
his budget, when he saith: <hi>that Epiphanius and
Augustine seeme to say that Aërius was condemned,
&amp;c.</hi> for they do not only <hi>seeme to say so,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and cause of <hi>Aërius</hi> his here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.</note> but
do absolutely affirme yt, and <hi>S. Epiphanius</hi>
maketh a longe discourse therof, shewinge
the beginninge and occasion of <hi>Aërius</hi> fall
into this heresie, to witt, that he being a
Priest, could not be made a Bishopp (which
<hi>S. Augustine</hi> also toucheth) and that vpon this
enuy, spite &amp; mallice, he beganne to obiect
against the cleargy, that they ought not to
offer sacrifice or prayer for the dead, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the lyuinge, and consequently for the
same was condemned, and held alwayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for an heretike by the Church of that,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:22711:114"/>
and all other ensuinge ages. Secondly yt is
another sleight to say, that <hi>Aërius</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<hi>for disallowing the order of the Church in
this commemoration of the dead,</hi> as though <hi>Aërius</hi>
his fault had not byn against any point of
Catholike and vniuersall doctrine of the
Church, but disobedience only against some
Ecclesiasticall order; and therfore yf yow
marke yt, he neuer nameth him heretike, as
indeed disobedience to orders is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
heresy, if it be not against some article
of doctrine.<note place="margin">Three se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall shifts of <hi>Sutcliffe</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue his Reader.</note> And all these are shifts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyances
of <hi>Sutcliffe</hi> to dazell the readers
eyes, wheras the forsaid Fathers say plainly,
that he was condemned for hereticall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
And <hi>S Chrysostome,</hi> as you haue heard,
before alleaged, affirmeth the contrary do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of prayinge for the departed in tyme
of the dreadfull misteryes, to haue come
downe from the Apostles themselues, and
the same in effect saith <hi>Epiphanius,<note place="margin">Ibid. pag. 13.</note> traditione a
patribus accepta,</hi> by tradition receaued from
their forefathers.</p>
            <p>The third shift is, that <hi>Sutcliffe</hi> in this his
shufflinge aunswere foisteth in these words,
<hi>commemoration of the dead, and geuinge thanks for
their blessed end:</hi> as thongh <hi>Saint Epiphanius</hi> or <hi>S.
Augustine</hi> had said or meant so: which is
quite contrary, for they expressely affirme,
that this commemoration was to pray for
them, that is to say for those that are syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and haue need of our prayers, which
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:22711:114"/>
               <hi>Epiphanius</hi> expresseth in these words:<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
               <hi>pro iust is
&amp; precatoribus memoriam facimus, peccatoribus
quidem misericordiam Dei implorantes:</hi> we make
commemoration of iust men, and for syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
desiringe Gods mercy for those that
be in synne, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which is the very same
that <hi>S. Chrysostome</hi> distinguisheth in the place
before alleaged of his 69. homily to the
people of <hi>Antioch: that some are greater sinners,
some lesse, some perfect and holy.</hi> But <hi>S. Augustine</hi>
(accordinge to his manner) more cleerly &amp;
perspicuously in these words: <hi>Non omnibus
prosunt,<note place="margin">Aug En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chirid. cap. 110.</note> &amp;c.</hi> 
               <q>our prayers and sacrifices offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for the dead, do not profitt all sorts of
men; And why do they not profitt all but
only for the difference of life, which euery
man hath lead in this body? Wherfore
when sacrifices eyther of the Altar, or of
any other almes are offered vp for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
departed, yf they be very good men,
for whome they are offered, they are thanke
geuings,<note place="margin">Three sorts of men des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased.</note> &amp; for them that are not very euill,
they are propitiations or appeasings with
God; but yf they be very wicked, then
though they be no helpes to the dead: yet
are they some kind of comfort for the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge,
and vnto those deceased, whome
they do profitt, they are profitable in this,
that eyther they procure them full remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
or at least wise, that their punishment
or condemnation, be therby made more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:22711:115"/>
So <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> who explaneth as yow see
most perspicuously the Catholike doctrine,
and cutteth of all shifts from cauillinge he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiks,
about the different sorts &amp; qualityes
of men desceased, &amp; with what distinction
the Catholike Church doth make comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration
for them in the publike sacrifice,
either by praying, or praising God for them.
And thus much of his shuffling and shifting
away the Fathers authorityes, lett vs now
come to consider, how he will put of his
<hi>Maister Caluyn,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hovv <hi>Sutcliffe</hi> shifteth of <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>VVil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note> and his <hi>Brother VVillet</hi> alleaged
also yf yow remember against him. But as
for <hi>VVillett</hi> he maketh him not worthy of a
seuerall answere, but presumeth him to be
of his opinion in all points, and the like he
would also force <hi>Caluyn</hi> vnto, for that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge
said, that the commemoration of the
dead (for deniall wherof <hi>Aërius</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned)
was but a thankesgeuing for their
blessed end, he saith immediately: <hi>And this is
the prayer which Caluyn and we confesse to haue ben
in the Church a longe tyme, but maketh nothinge for
Howleglasse his purpose.</hi> Which I thinke also,
nor yet for <hi>Sutcliffes</hi> purpose, yf he haue any
purpose but only to play the foole, and to
mocke and delude his Reader. For first we
haue shewed, that <hi>Aërius</hi> was not condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for denying thankesgiuing, but sacrifice
&amp; prayer for the dead. And secondly <hi>Caluyn</hi>
is not alleaged by <hi>E. O.</hi> as confessinge only
the vse of thankesgeuing, or bare recytall of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:22711:115"/>
their names to haue byn in vse aboue thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
hundred yeares past, but of prayinge
for the dead, and for reprouing <hi>S. Austen,</hi> and
<hi>S. Monica</hi> for that custome, and how chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
then that <hi>Sutcliffe</hi> aunswereth not vnto
this obiection, which himselfe had sett
downe before with his owne pen, but sli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
away in silence, as though he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
spoken yt, nay he dissembleth and omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the quotation of <hi>Caluyns</hi> place, to the
end we should not find yt out, but I haue
thought good to note the place in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
whose words are;<note place="margin">Calu. 3. Iustitat. cap. 5. §. 10.</note> 
               <hi>ante mille &amp; trecentos

aboue a thousand, and three hundred
yeares agoe, that prayers should be made for
the desceased: and a little after he saith, <hi>that
they were all deceyued</hi> in that doctrine.</p>
            <p>Now then do yow looke in <hi>Sutcliffes</hi> face,
and see what countenance he will set vpon
this notorious cogginge: <hi>this is that prayer</hi>
(saith he) <hi>vvhich Caluyn, and vve confesse to haue

This first is no prayer at all. Neyther do ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Fathers aforecited, or <hi>Caluin</hi> call this
a prayer, or treat of this, as by there words
yow haue seene. How then can it be said
that <hi>Caluyn, Sutcliffe,</hi> and his brother <hi>VVillett,</hi>
doe agree in this confession of this prayer
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:22711:116"/>
to haue bene in the Church for so longe
time? But if he speake of true prayer in deed
for the dead, as both <hi>Caluyn</hi> and the Fathers
do, then how maketh this nothinge for his

being the true owle indeed, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

three before mentioned by <hi>Saint Augustine,</hi>
which is yf they be very iust. And yet out
of these two places would this simple di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputer
inferre, that <hi>Saint Chrysostome</hi> beleeued
not purgatory, which is expressely agaidst
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:22711:116"/>
               <hi>S. Chrysostomes</hi> owne words and discourse, in

vs passe to his conclusion &amp; so make an end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly</hi> (saith he) <hi>in auncient tyme,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trut he about praying a for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarkes and not to them.</note> 
               <hi>they made
commemoration of the patriarks, of the blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
of the Apostles, Martyrs, and others, now they
pray to them, not for them as in tymes past.</hi> And
why doth not this simple shamelesse fellow
alleage some one author, some one testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
wittnesse, or authority for so bold an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion?
<hi>Now they pray to them, and not for them</hi>
(saith he) <hi>as in tymes past:</hi> But what auncient
Father, Doctor or historiographer can he
cite, that euer said so, or me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned any such
practise eyther of himselfe or others, that
prayed for the blessed Virgin, Apostles,
Martyrs, or the like in those ancient dayes?
But we haue manifest proofes to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
that they were prayed vnto in the
masse of old tymes, not prayed for. <hi>S. Cyrill</hi>
B. of Hierusalem that liued aboue twelue
hundred yeares agone, hath these words
talking of the masse:<note place="margin">Cyrill. Cath. Myst. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Cùm hoc sacrificium offeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,
&amp;c. VVhen vve offer vp this sacrifice, vve do
make mention by name of those which died before vs,
and first of Patriarks, Prophetts, Apostles, and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
that God vuill receaue our petitions by their
prayers and deprecations for vs:</hi> Behould heere,
<hi>S. Cyrill</hi> did make a commemoration of the
Patriarks, Prophetts, Apostles and Martyrs,
as praying vnto them, and not for them, in
his masse and sacrifice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:22711:117"/>
The like saith <hi>S. Basill</hi> both in his liturgy
and elswhere affirminge the very same, for
that speakinge of the forsaid co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>memoration
of Patriarks, Prophetts, Apostles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in his

vs presume by them and their intercession
to come vnto thee (o Lord) and to exercise
this dreadfull and holy office. And finally
<hi>S. Augustine,</hi> not only affirmeth this doctrine,
but yeldeth a reason also therof, to witt of
the different commemoration, that is made
in the masse of desceased Saints, and discea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
sinners in these words:<note place="margin">Aug. tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Ideo quippe ad ipsam

like commemoration of Martyrs, as we do of others
that are desceased in peace; so as vve pray not for
them, but rather that they do pray for vs.</hi> So <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine.</hi>
And the same he repeateth againe in
diuers other places; so as this is cleerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced
against <hi>Sutcliffe</hi> by testimony of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
which he presumeth to name, but
cyteth no wittnesse at all.</p>
            <p>Now then to conclude this whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<note place="margin">A consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration about <hi>Sutcliffes</hi> maner of vvryting.</note>
lett the Reader by this little make some
ghesse, what he may iudge of the whole.
And yf in the examination of these two or
three places only, so many falshoods, frauds,
sleights, shifts, contradictions, and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencyes
haue ben discouered, what would
be found, yf the whole number of six and
twenty obiected by <hi>E. O.</hi> should be discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed?
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:22711:117"/>
yea the whole chalenge diligently
skanned? consider also I pray thee good
reader, whether in defence of these 9. places
<hi>Sutcliffe</hi> haue not vsed the highest degree of
falshood before described of witting &amp; wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
deceyte, seing that before he did sett
downe this article in his first chaleng about
masses and prayers for the dead, yt is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that he had read some auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that made mention therof, and yet
would he auouch that no true Catholike
had vsed the same, but being reprehended
for yt, and told of his lyinge by his aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
&amp; diuers Fathers cited for proofe therof,
and his owne <hi>Maister Caluyn,</hi> and his brother
<hi>VVillett</hi> for acknowledginge the same, yet
commeth he now to affirme and print yt
againe in his second edition of his chalenge,
and dissembleth, peruerteth and shifteth of
the authorityes both of the said Fathers, &amp;
<hi>Caluyn</hi> himselfe, as though they had neuer
ben obiected against him. And what will
yow say to this manner of dealinge? will
you aduenture your soule with such a man?
or will yow giue creditt any more to his
fond crakinge or vauntinge aboue men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned?</p>
            <p>But we are ouerlong in this third part,<note place="margin">The 4. part or principal member of this edition.</note> &amp;
cannot well get out of it, through the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of aduantages that <hi>Sutcliffe</hi> geueth vs
in pursuinge him in this his chase of defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge
himselfe; yet must we sound retreat,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:22711:118"/>
and say only a word or two of the fourth
part of this his new booke, conteyninge, as
yow haue heard, a heap or fardell of recri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
gathered togeather against aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Popes, Councells, synods, historio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers,
and other Catholike wryters, and
lastly against <hi>Cardinall Bellarmyne, Cardinall
Baronius</hi> and <hi>F. Parsons;</hi> by which ostentation
of names and authors, he would make men
beleeue, that all the world were full of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
and falsifications in wrytinge, and
consequently that those of his, and of his
fellowes are little to be respected; but when
the occasion shall come to aunswere this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
edition at large, the differences wil be
shewed, and how vainly this little enuious
mouse, hath gone about to gnibble at Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
authors edges of their garments, &amp;
particularly at the wrytings of the most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
learned, and honourable men of our
tyme, <hi>Cardinall Bellarmine,</hi> and <hi>Cardinall Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
who haue so beaten downe heresy with
their most excellent works, as by allusion
we may say of them in respect of <hi>Sutcliffe,
ipsi conterunt caput tuum, tu vero insidiaris eorum
calcaneis,</hi> they haue broken thy head, and
thou doest byte at their heeles. Of the
third which is <hi>F. Persons</hi> and the obiections
heere brought against his wrytings, we had
thought to haue spoken somewhat more
particularly, but lacke of tyme and roome
maketh vs also to albreuiate this, yet
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:22711:118"/>
somewhat for example sake shalbe said.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sutcliffe</hi> nameth two books of his,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sutcliffes</hi> obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to two of <hi>F. Persons</hi> bookes.</note> the first
entituled. <hi>A briefe discourse conteyninge reasons,
why Catholiks refuse to go to Church.</hi> The next is
called: <hi>A Christian directory,</hi> and commonly
knowne by the name (saith he) of <hi>Parsons Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution.</hi>
Against the former booke he brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
two reasons, as wise as his head can
deuise: the one, that he promised to make
three parts of that booke, and performed
but one,<note place="margin">Ansvvere to <hi>except. pag.</hi> 182.</note> 
               <hi>abusinge</hi> (saith he) <hi>both his frends and
aduersaryes with his false promises:</hi> The other
reason is (saith he) for that to persuade men
not to go to Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts Church must needs
stand vpon this supposition, <hi>that the Popes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is true,</hi> and therfore he should first haue
proued this principle before he had gone
about to giue reasons, to stand stedfast ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
<hi>But now</hi> (saith he) <hi>yf Parsons can say nothinge
why the Religion in England is not Catholike and
Apostolicall, then all his reasons fall to the ground.</hi>
These two reasons do well declare what a
man of worth <hi>Sutcliffe</hi> is. And not to shew
on my parte distrust in the Readers iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I will not go about to refute such va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nityes.
For if this last reason haue any force,
yt proueth also that no Protestant Preacher
or wryter, may exhort any of his Religion
to constancy, perseuerance, patience, humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
or any other vertue, except he proue
first all that Religion to be true. But lett
vs passe to the other booke, perhaps his
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:22711:119"/>
obiections wilbe stronger against that.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His directory also</hi> (saith he) <hi>is a most idle,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ansvvere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to <hi>except. ibid.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>and
vayne discourse</hi> (so idle and vaynè do seeme all
treatises of piety to this prophane minister)
<hi>yt should consist of three parts, but as the fashion is, of
three promised, he keepeth backe two, performeth
the third very simply.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eight fond ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the booke of resolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> This is his censure of that
booke. And presently (as he is fertile in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention,
though foolish in his election) he
commeth with eyght choise accusations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
yt. The first is, for that he proueth
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> there is a God, and that Christian Religion
is true aboue all other Religions, and that
he treateth against dispayre of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes,
tentations, and too much feare of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution:
<hi>VVhich rather doth hinder a man</hi> (saith
<hi>Sutcliffe</hi>) <hi>from leading a Christian life, then help him
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to resolue.</hi> The second. <hi>That the greatest part</hi>
(saith he) <hi>is taken out of</hi> Loartes, Stella, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natensis,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <hi>and other such authors.</hi> The<note n="*" place="margin">This was only set dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne for yovv and yours to dravv them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> atheisme</note> third.
for that yt argueth Catholikes to be badd
Christians, that they must be taught there
is a God, hell, heauen, and the like. The
fourth: That <hi>Sutcliffe</hi> doth not find, that yt
hath made hitherto any one Christian, or
directed him to the way of lyfe, but many
yong men to the gallowes. The fifth that yt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
hath not brought <hi>Father Persons</hi> him selfe yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
to a good resolution, nor to enter into Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> The sixt. For that his discourse to
proue that there is a God, and but one true
Religion, and that there is a heauen, &amp; hell
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:22711:119"/>
among Christians already well persuaded,
is impertinent. The seauenth. For that yt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
is diuided into speculation and practice: <hi>as
yf</hi> (saith he) <hi>a man could practise that is not entred
into the exercise of Religion; or as yf resolution were
not farre differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from practise.</hi> The eight &amp; last,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>
for that yt is fraught with idle discourses, &amp;
the principall point so weakely proued, that
yt will rather make Christians to doubt of
Religion, then atheists to beleeue.</p>
            <p>These are <hi>Sutcliffes</hi> reasons,<note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</note> which shew
the mans depth; and conforme to these, are
his obiections picked out of the forsaid two
books about allegation, wherof I would
gladly haue sett downe some halfe adozen
at least for example, so to haue seene the
weight and substance therof, but that I am
forced to make an end, referring my selue
to a fuller exame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when his reply shall come
forth. Now then only I am to aduertise the
Reader, that he weigh with himselue what
manner of man <hi>Sutcliffe</hi> is, in these his wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
he vaunteth and chalengeth as yow
see, as yf he were agyant, and when he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to the gryping he is iust nothing: he
offereth to answere for all, as <hi>Iewell, Fox, Peter

els yow will besides, but when yt cometh

shall find them for the most part fraught, &amp;
furnished only with bare assertions of his

where hauing to speake of matters
testified by Catholike wryters both ancient
and new, he maketh ostentation of many
quotations, and allegations of authors,
(though little to the purpose) and might
haue done of many more out of euery one
of his fellowes note-bookes; but when he
goeth from that fountaine, &amp; must add any
thing of his owne inuention, there shall he
find him, very cutted, obscure, dry, and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,
as may appeare by his aunswers before
examined, both of <hi>Plessis Mornay</hi> &amp; himselfe:
and yow may see the same confirmed more
largely, by only lookinge ouer the pages of

            </p>
