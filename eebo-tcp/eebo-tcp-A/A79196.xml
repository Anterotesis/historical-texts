            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE ſhall not rip up the cauſes of unhappy differences betwixt Our Royall Father and the Two Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It ſhall be Our Studie that they be for ever buryed, and that Our Subjects of ENGLAND may returne to their Obedience they owe Us, as their lawfull king, and to the Ancient and happy Government of this Kingdome by King, Lords, and Commons, (wherein they and their Anceſtors have lived ſo long, ſo happily) without the effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of more blood. With theſe Thoughts We are now entering into Our Kingdome of ENGLAND, with an Army, by the bleſſing of God able to protect Our Loyall Subjects, who ſhall joyne with Us, and aſsist Us in doing Juſtice upon the Murtherers of Our Royall Father, and to defend Us from the violence of ſuch as will continue the excluſion of Us from Our Juſt Rights, the Sub-verſion of the Lawfull Government of this Kingdome, and the Oppreſsion of Our good Subjects, by Armies and exorbitant Impoſitions: And before We enter the Kingdome, We have thought fit by this ſhort Declaration to let Our good-Subjects there know, That Our Deſires are not more to be reſtored to our Owne Rights, than to maintaine and procure to them their Freedom. And as We have given full and entire Satisfaction to Our Subjects of SCOTLAND both in what might concerne Religion, their Lawes and Liberties, (which God willing we ſhall inviolably preſerve to them) So it ſhall be Our Studie,(and would be Our greateſt Joy) that we might Attayne the ſame happyneſſe in <hi>England.</hi> And becauſe we think our ſelves bound to Looke more to the Glory of God, then our Owne Intereſt,</p>
            <p>We doe in the firſt place declare, That we ſhall faithfully endeavour in our Station and Calling, as we are bound by Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, to ſettle Religion, in Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline and Government, according to the Word of God, and the Example of the beſt reformed Churches.</p>
            <p>We ſhall alſo endeavour that Parliaments may be reſtored to their Freedome, and priviledges, by whoſe adviſe, we doe declare Our Reſolutions are to governe and ſettle all differences and diſtempers, that Our people may enjoy their Liberty, and Property, Free from Army, Quarterings, or illegall Impoſitions.</p>
            <p>Theſe being Our cleare Intentions and Reſolutions, We doe expect and invite all Our good Subjects of ENGLAND, and Dominion of WALES, to Concur with, and Aſsiſt Us according to their Duty and Allegeance: and ſuch as are in Armes either in SCOTLAND, or in ENGLAND, under <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> preſently after knowledge hereof, to lay them downe, or to come in and joyne with Us in Our Army, where they ſhall receive Protection, and full aſsurance of Satisfaction in their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reares.</p>
            <p>And to evidence how far We are from Revenge, or continuing the unhappy differences betwixt Us and Our Subjects, We doe Declare and Engage Our Selfe to give Our Conſent to a full Act of oblivion and Indempnity for the ſecurity of all Our Subjects of ENGLAND, and Dominion of WALES, in their Perſons, Freedomes, and Eſtates, for all things done by them relating to theſe Wars theſe ſeven yeeres paſt, and that they ſhall never be called in queſtion by Us for any of them.</p>
            <p>Provided that immediately after knowledge of this our Gracious offer and Declaration, they deſiſt from aſsiſting the uſurped Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the pretended Common wealth of <hi>England,</hi> and returne to their Obedience to Us, excepting onely from this Our Gracious offer, <hi>Oliver Crumwell, Henry Ireton, John Bradſhaw, John Cooke,</hi> their pretended Solicitor, and all others who did Actually ſit, and Vote in the Murther of Our Royall Father.</p>
            <p>And ſince in this Service, We have made uſe of the affection and aſsiſtance of Our Loyall Subjects of Our Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who cannot poſsibly maintaine their whole Army in <hi>England,</hi> Wee doe require ſome of quality, or Authority, in each County, where We ſhall March, to come to us, that Neceſſary proviſion may be regularly brought in to the Army: And We doe Declare, that the Counties from which ſuch ſhall come, ſhall receive no other prejudice, except ſuch as doe oppoſe Us. And becauſe it ſhall be Our maine endeavour, that the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> may be ſafe in their Perſons, free in their Goods, and as little burthened as poſsible can be: This We are reſolved, To permit no Plundering, or Rapines, or taking any mans perſon, (who is not in actuall Oppoſition of Us) which We ſhall not with all ſeverity puniſh: So if Our Army ſhould be forced to be more burthenſome to ſome places and perſons then to others, It ſhall be Our Endeavour, that as ſoone as is poſsible they may receive proportionall ſatisfaction, and the Burthen be made equall.</p>
            <p>And Laſtly, we doe Declare that the Service being done, the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Army ſhall Quickly retire, that ſo all Armies may be Disbanded, And a laſting Peace ſetled with Religion and Righteouſneſſe.</p>
