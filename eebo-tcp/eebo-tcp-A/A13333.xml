            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE citie of Rome was in the beginning gouerned by Kings. Libertie and the Conſulſhip <hi>L. Brutus</hi> brought in.

               <p>AFter that <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſsius</hi> were ſlaine, and no armes now publikely borne; <hi>Pompey</hi> defeated in Sicilie; <hi>Lepidus</hi> diſarmed; <hi>Antonie</hi> killed; and no chiefe leader of <hi>Iulius Caeſars</hi> faction left, but onely <hi>Augustus:</hi> he would no longer be called <hi>Triumuir,</hi> but in ſhew contented with the dignitie of a Tribune to defend the people, bearing himſelfe as Conſul: after he had wound into the fauour of the ſoldier by giftes; of the people by prouiſion of ſuſtenance; and of all in generall with the ſweetenes of eaſe and repoſe; by little and little taking vpon him, he drew to himſelfe the affaires of Senate; the dutie of magiſtrates and lawes, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction of any: the ſtowteſt by war or proſcriptions alreadie ſpent, and the reſt of the nobilitie, by how much the more ſeruiceable, by ſo much the more bettered in wealth, and aduanced in honors: ſeeing their preferment to growe by new gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, did rather chooſe the preſent eſtate with ſecuritie, than ſtriue to recouer their olde with danger. That forme of gouernment the prouinces diſliked not, as miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſting the Senates and peoples regiment by reaſon of noble mens factions; co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſnes of magiſtrates: the lawes affoording no ſecuritie, being ſwaied hither
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:18166:5"/>
and thither by might, ambition, and corruption. Beſides this, <hi>Augustus</hi> labouring by ſome ſtay, to ſettle the ſoueraigntie, aduanced <hi>Claudius Marcellus</hi> his ſiſters ſonne being very yoong, to the pontificall dignitie and Aedilſhip: and <hi>M. Agrippa</hi> meanly deſcended, but in martiall exploites warlike, and a companion in his victories, to be twiſe Conſul togither; and after <hi>Marcellus</hi> death choſe him to be his ſonne in lawe. And his owne houſe not failing, he beſtowed the title of Emperor vpon <hi>Tiberius Nero</hi> and <hi>Claudius Druſus</hi> his wiues children; and adopted <hi>Caius</hi> and <hi>Lucius, Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paes</hi> children: and making ſhew to the contrarie; yet his earneſt deſire was, they ſhould be called Princes of youth, and choſen Conſuls elect, before they had caſt off their praetext or infants garments. But when <hi>Agrippa</hi> was dead, and <hi>Lucius</hi> going into Spaine to take charge of the armie, and <hi>Caius</hi> returning wounded out of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia, by haſtie fate or trecherie of their ſtepmother <hi>Liuia: Druſus</hi> alſo dead long before, onely <hi>Nero</hi> was left of all <hi>Augustus</hi> ſonnes in lawe. Vnto him all men now crowched and fawned; being receiued the adopted ſonne of <hi>Augustus;</hi> copartner of the empire; aſſociate of the Tribunitian dignitie; ſhewen to the campe as ſucceſſor; not as before by ſecret deuiſes and practiſes of his mother, but openly perſwading the Emperor thereto. For ſhe had ſo enthralled the ſillie olde man, that <hi>Agrippa Posthumus</hi> his onely nephew, he had confined in the Iland Planaſia: in deede, badly trained vp in liberall ſciences, and ſottiſhly bragging of his ſtrength and actiuitie of bodie; but yet neuer detected of any notorious vice. He gaue <hi>Germanicus</hi> ſonne vnto <hi>Druſus,</hi> charge ouer eight legions, by the riuer of Rhene; and commanded <hi>Tiberius</hi> (albeit he had a ſonne of his owne) to adopt him, the better to eſtabliſh the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with mo ſtaies than one. Wars there were none at that time, but onely againſt the Germans; not ſo much in regard of enlarging the empire, hope of bootie or reward, as to blot out the diſhonor receiued, when he loſt his armie with <hi>Quincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Varo.</hi> All was quiet in the citie; the old names of the magiſtrates vnchanged; the yoong men borne after the victorie at Actium, and the greateſt part of the old, during the ciuill wars: how many were there which had ſeene the ancient forme of gouernment of the free Common-wealth? Thus then the ſtate of the citie turned vpſide downe, there was no ſigne of the olde laudable cuſtomes to be ſeene: but contrarie, equalitie taken away, euery man endeuored to obey the prince; miſdoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting nothing whileſt <hi>Augustus</hi> yet ſtrong in bodie, was able to defend himſelfe, his houſe, and peace. But when he grew olde and feeble with ſicknes, and that the end of his gouernment, and hope of a new was not far off: ſome few, but in vaine, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſt of the commodities of libertie; ſome feared war; ſome deſired it: but the greateſt part vſed lauiſh ſpeeches, and ſpred rumors againſt the next coniectured ſucceſſor. <hi>Agrippa</hi> they accounted by nature cruell, and through the indignitie of his late diſgrace eaſily kindled; yoong, and rawe in ſtate matters; vnable for ſo great a charge. In deede, <hi>Tiberius</hi> was of conuenient and ripe yeeres, expert in feates of war; but poſſeſt with the hereditarie pride of the <hi>Claudian</hi> familie: yea manie appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſparkles of crueltie did burſt out in him, howſoeuer he went about to ſuppreſſe them. Beſides, he was brought vp in a houſe, which knew how to raigne: the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhip was more than once caſt vpon him with triumphes. During the time that he was at Rhodes (cloking his exile vnder colour of retiring himſelfe) he dreamte of nothing but reuenge, diſſimulation, and ſecret meanes of licentious luſts: withall, he had his mother at hand; vntolerable in all imperfections incident to the ſexe: and thereby they were to obey a woman, and two yoong men, which would in the meane ſpace oppreſſe, and in time rent in peeces the Common-wealth.</p>

                  <hi>II.</hi> The death of <hi>Auguſtus:</hi> and <hi>Tiberius Nero</hi> made Emperour.</head>
               <p>WHileſt they thus debated the matter, <hi>Augustus</hi> maladie increaſed; and as it was ſuſpected by ſome, through the lewde practiſe of his wife. For not many months before a rumor was ſpread, that <hi>Augustus</hi> with the priuitie of a few, accompanied only with <hi>Fabius Maximus,</hi> had conueyed himſelfe to the Iland <hi>Planaſia,</hi> to viſite his nephew <hi>Agrippa,</hi> both weeping tenderly at their meeting, with manifeſt tokens of loue, and a hope conceiued that the yong man ſhould be recalled and reſtored to his Grandfathers houſe. <hi>Fabius</hi> diſcloſed this to <hi>Martia</hi> his wife, and ſhe to <hi>Liuia,</hi> and <hi>C. Nauus</hi> to <hi>Caeſar:</hi> for not long after <hi>Fabius</hi> (doubtfull whether by his owne procurement or not) being deceaſed, his wife <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> among other her lamentations at her husbands funerall, was ouer-heard to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe her ſelfe, as the cauſe of her husbands death. But howſoeuer the matter paſſed, <hi>Tiberius</hi> had ſcarſe put foote in Illyricum, when by letters from his mother he was recalled in poſt haſte: not being well knowne, when he arriued at <hi>Nola,</hi> whether there were any breath yet left in <hi>Augustus</hi> or not. For <hi>Liuia</hi> had beſet the houſe with a watchfull and ſtraight gard, ſometimes giuing out that <hi>Augustus</hi> was on the mending hand; and ſo hauing made all ſure on all hands, as the time and occaſion required: the ſame rumor which not long before gaue ioyfull newes of <hi>Augustus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, now publiſhed that he was dead, and <hi>Nero</hi> in poſſeſſion of the Empire. The firſt exploit this new Prince did, was the murdering of <hi>Poſthumus Agrippa;</hi> whom a Centurion reſolute and appointed for the purpoſe, and taking him vnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and miſdoubting nothing, yet could hardly diſpatch. <hi>Tiberius</hi> made no words of this to the Senate, but pretended that it was done by his fathers appointment; who (as he ſaid) had giuen charge to the Centurion which had the garding of him, to make him away incontinently after he had intelligence of his death. Little doubt but <hi>Augustus,</hi> complaining of the yong mans vntowardly behauior, cauſed his exile to be confirmed by decree of the Senate: but yet he neuer perſiſted long in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring the death of any of his; neither was it credible that to aſſure the eſtate to his wiues ſonne, he would ſeeke the bloud of his owne nephew. But very likely it is, that the yong mans death was haſtened by <hi>Tiberius</hi> feare, and <hi>Liuiaes</hi> hatred: the one as iealous, leaſt he ſhould bandie for the ſoueraigntie: the other through the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall hatred incident to all ſtepmothers. When the Centurion brought him word (as the manner of ſeruice was) that he had fulfilled his commandement, he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red preſently, that he commanded him no ſuch matter, and that he ſhould anſwere it before the Senate. When this newes came to <hi>Criſpus Sallustius</hi> eares (who being inward in greateſt ſecrets with <hi>Tiberius,</hi> had by letters giuen the Centurion order how to proceede) fearing leaſt his owne turne ſhould be next, dangerous to him alike: to confeſſe the truth, or to ſtand to a lye: aduiſed <hi>Liuia</hi> that ſhe ſhould not in any wiſe diuulgate the ſecrets of her houſe, the counſell of friends, and ſeruices of ſouldyers; and that <hi>Tiberius</hi> ſhould beware of weakening the power of ſoueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, in referring all things to the Senate: the qualitie of abſolute rule being ſuch, that it could not ſtand but in one alone. Now at <hi>Rome</hi> the Conſuls, the Senators, and Gentlemen ranne headlong to ſeruitude; and the more nobler the fairer ſhew, and the more haſtie; but with a compoſed and ſetled countenance, leaſt they ſhould ſeeme ouerglad of the death of the laſt, or diſcontented with the new Prince; they tempered their griefe with ioy, and lamentation with flatterie. The two Conſuls
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:18166:6"/>
                  <hi>Sext Pompeius,</hi> and <hi>Sext. Apuleius</hi> did firſt ſweare allegeance to <hi>Tiberius Caeſar:</hi> and after into their hands, <hi>Seius Strabo,</hi> and <hi>C. Turrianus,</hi> the one Captaine of the Gard, the other chiefe officer for prouiſion of corne. After them the Lords of the Senate, the ſouldiers, and the people. For <hi>Tiberius</hi> would haue all things begun by the Conſuls, as the manner was in the ancient free common wealth: as though he had not reſolued with himſelfe whether it were beſt for him to accept of the Empire or not. No not ſo much as the Edict to call the Lords of the Senate to counſell, but was proclaimed in vertue and authoritie of a Tribune; which dignitie he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in <hi>Augustus</hi> time. The words of the Edict were not many, and deliuered in modeſt termes. That he would only conſult what pomp and honor were fit to be done for his father: and that he would not depart from the body: which ſhould be the onely publike charge he would vndertake. Neuertheleſſe when <hi>Augustus</hi> was dead, he gaue the watchword to the gard: placed the watch: diſpoſed of the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: managed all the affaires of Court, as if he had been Emperour. The ſouldiers waited on him to the place of publike aſſemblies; to the Senate houſe; and diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched letters to the Camp; as though he had bene in full poſſeſſion of the ſtate; irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute in nothing, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſhould ſpeake in the Senate. The chiefeſt cauſe procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of feare; leaſt <hi>Germanicus,</hi> who had ſo many legions at commaundement; ſuch ſtrong aides of confederates; and ſo exceedingly beloued of the people; ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hold, then expect the poſſeſſion of the Empire. He ſtoode on his reputation likewiſe, and ſeemed rather to be called and choſen by the Common-wealth, then creepe in by the canuaſing of a woman, and adoption of an old man. It was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward further knowne, that he vſed that lingering doubtfulnes, the better to ſound the affection of the Nobilitie; for obſeruing their countenance, and wreſting their words to the worſt, he bare them all in minde. In the firſt meeting of the Senate, he would haue nothing debated, but <hi>Augustus</hi> laſt will and teſtament; which being brought in by <hi>Vestaes</hi> Virgins, declared <hi>Tiberius</hi> and <hi>Liuia</hi> to be his heires: and that <hi>Liuia</hi> was adopted into the <hi>Iulian</hi> familie, and entituled by the name of <hi>Augusta.</hi> After them he ſubſtituted his nephews, and nephews ſonnes: and in the third place the Peeres of the citie, which in generall he hated: yet he did it to win fame and glory with poſteritie. His legacies were moderate, like vnto other citizens, ſauing that he gaue as well to the common ſort, as the reſt of the people, foure hundred and thirty fiue thouſand nummos: <note n="*" place="margin">Three pound uen ſhillings 11. pence q. cee.</note> to euery ſouldier of the Pretorian band a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand; <note n="*" place="margin">7. li. 16. s. 3. d.</note> to euery one of the legionary cohorts which conſiſted of citizens of Rome, three hundred <note n="*" place="margin">46. s. 10. d. ob.</note>.</p>

               <p>AFter that, conſultation was had concerning the pomp and ſolemnities of the funerals; among which the moſt honorable and magnificent were iudged to be theſe. <hi>Gallus Aſinius</hi> thought it meete that the dead corps ſhould be brought through the triumphall gate; and <hi>L.

Who being demanded of <hi>Tiberius</hi> whether he had commaundement from him ſo to aduiſe? anſwered, that he did propound it of his owne free motion: and that in matters concerning the common-wealth, he would vſe no mans aduiſe but his own, although it ſhould be with danger
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18166:6"/>
and offence: ſo farre had flattery ſpread it ſelfe, that that only kinde remayned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practiſed. The Lords of the Senate after that cryed with one voyce, that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues would carry the corps to the funerall fire on their ſhoulders: which <hi>Caeſar</hi> did yeeld vnto with a modeſty, yet ſauoring of arrogancie. And admoniſhed the people by Proclamation, that they would not (as in times paſt they had diſturbed the buriall of <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> of famous memory) carried away with ouergreat affection, ſo deſire now that <hi>Augustus</hi> body ſhould rather be burnt in the place of publicke aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, then in Campus Martius, a place deputed to that vſe. The day of the funerals being come, the ſoldiers were placed as it were a gard to the body, when as ſuch as had eyther ſeene, or heard their fathers report, of the freſh and late yoke of cruell ſeruitude vnluckely attempted to be ſhaken off, and recouer their auncient libertie: then I ſay when the murdering of <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> the Dictator, ſeemed vnto ſome a wicked, and vnto others a worthy deede; laughed to ſee that now an old Prince which had raigned ſo many yeares, and prouided heires to ſucceede him in might and wealth, ſhould neede a gard of ſouldiers quietly to celebrate his funerals. This bred ſundry ſpeeches of <hi>Augustus,</hi> many maruelling at vaine and friuolous things: as that his death fell on the ſame day he was made Emperour: that he dyed at <hi>Nola</hi> in the ſame houſe and chamber, that before him his father <hi>Octauius</hi> did: they made it a great matter that he alone had been as oft Conſull, as <hi>Valerius Coruinus,</hi> and <hi>C. Marius</hi> both together: that he had continued Tribune ſeuen and thirtie yeares; had beene honored with the name of Emperour one and twentie times; with many other old and new dignities beſtowed or inuented for him. But among the better ſort his life was diuerſly commended or diſcommended: Some ſayd, that the loue of his father, and the care of the Common-wealth, at that time when all lawes were daſht, droue him to ciuill warres, which can neuer be begun or proſecuted by any good meanes: and that he had yeelded in many things to <hi>Antony,</hi> and to <hi>Lepidus</hi> in like maner, becauſe he would reuenge his fathers death. For ſeeing the one grew careleſſe with age, and the other waſted with laſciuiouſnes, there was no other meanes left to redreſſe all diſcords in the common-wealth, then to bring her vnder the obedience of one alone, who ſhould gouerne; neuertheleſſe not as King or Dictator, but as Prince. The Empire he had bounded with the Ocean, and other Riuers farre off: the Legions, Prouinces and Nauie, were linked and knit in peace and vnitie: iuſtice was miniſtred in the cities: the allies intreated with modeſtie: the citie beautified with ſumptuous building: and if any rigorous dealing had bene vſed againſt ſome few, it was for ſetling of quietnes in the whole. Contrarily ſome ſayd, that the loue of his father, the corruption of times, ſerued him but for a cloake and colour: and that he had ſtirred vp the old ſouldyers by gifts and bribery, through ambition and deſire of rule; that being yet but yong and a priuate perſon, he had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered a power; corrupted the legions of the Conſuls; that he made a ſhewe only of fauouring <hi>Pompeius</hi> ſide: but had no ſooner gotten by order of the Senators the <hi>faſces</hi> or knitch of rods, and the Pretorſhip; after the death of <hi>Hircius</hi> and <hi>Panſa,</hi> (both ſlaine by the enemie, or <hi>Panſaes</hi> wound poiſoned, and <hi>Hircius</hi> murdered by the ſouldyers, or by <hi>Caeſar</hi> the contriuer of the feate) but he ſeaſed on both their forces, extorted the Conſulſhip, mauger the Senators; and the power aſſigned him to ſubdue <hi>Antony,</hi> he conuerted againſt the Common-wealth. He baniſhed the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, diuided their lands, and gaue away their goods, which were things by the doers themſelues diſcommended. In deede, the reuenge and purſuing his fathers death vpon <hi>Caſsius</hi> and <hi>Brutus</hi> maybe tolerated (albeit it had bene conuenient for a publick benefit to haue layd aſide priuate grudges) but he deceiued <hi>Pompey</hi> vnder
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18166:7"/>
colour of peace, and <hi>Lepidus</hi> vnder a ſhadow of friendſhip. Afterward he tolled on <hi>Antony</hi> with the treatie of Tarentum and Brunduſium, and mariage of his ſiſter, which deceitfull alliance he payed with the loſſe of his life. Doubtleſſe a peace enſued this, but a bloudie one, as may witnes the death of <hi>Lollius</hi> and <hi>Varus,</hi> and in <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe, of <hi>Varro, Egnatius</hi> and <hi>Iulus.</hi> Neither did they forbeare to diſcourſe of his domeſticall affaires: as that he tooke <hi>Neroes</hi> wife from him, &amp; asked the opinion of the Pontife in a ſcoffe, whether there might be a lawfull marriage betwixt them, ſhe being with childe by her other husband, but not yet deliuered. They forgat not <hi>L. Atedius,</hi> and <hi>Vedius Pollios</hi> riot and laſciuiouſnes. Finally, that <hi>Liuia</hi> was an intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable and burdenſome mother to the common wealth, and to the houſe of the <hi>Caeſars</hi> a dangerous ſtepdame. There was no honor left for the gods, ſeeing hee would himſelfe by the Prieſts and Flamines be worſhipped in the temples, with all the ornaments belonging to the gods. Neyther was <hi>Tiberius</hi> choſen ſucceſſor to the State for loue of himſelfe, or care of the Common-wealth, but deepely inſeeing into his loftie and bloudie diſpoſition, he would by being ſo vnequally compared with ſo outragious a mate, win glory afterward to himſelfe. And although <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi> had not many yeeres before vttered honorable ſpeeches in <hi>Tiberius</hi> behalfe before the Lords of the Senate, when he ſued to make him once againe Tribune: yet he interlaced ſome things among, touching his attire and behauiour, which in the excuſing of him, ſeemed to turne to his diſgrace and reproch.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>AVgustus</hi> funerals being ended according to the vſuall manner; a temple and religious ceremonies were inſtituted in honor of him: from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward all ſutes and requeſts were made to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who diſcourſing diuerſly of the greatnes of the empire, and in modeſt termes of his owne inſufficiencie, thought <hi>Auguſtus</hi> wiſedome onely capable of ſo weightie a charge; that himſelfe being aſſumed by <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> as an aſſociate and partner in the ſtate, had by good proofe learned, how hard a matter, and how ſubiect vnto fortunes change: rule and ſoueraigntie was. And ſeeing the citie was repleniſhed with ſo many famous and woorthie perſonages, better it were and more eaſe, that manie, ioining their ſtudies and cares togither, ſhould vndertake the charge, than caſt all vpon one mans ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. This ſpeech carried greater maieſtie than truth: for <hi>Tiberius</hi> either by nature, or by cuſtome, yea euen in thoſe things which he would haue knowen, ſpake alwaies darkly and doubtfully; but then of ſet purpoſe endeuoring to hide his drifts, wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped himſelfe more than euer, in a darke cloud of vncertaintie and ambiguitie. But the Lords of the Senate fearing all one thing (which was leaſt ſome perill might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, if he ſhould doubt that they perceiued his diſſimulation) began to lament; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine; offer vp vowes; and lift vp their hands to the gods; to <hi>Auguſtus</hi> image, and to his owne knees; vntill he commanded the booke of remembrances to be brought foorth and read. That booke contained the wealth of the publike treaſure; how many citizens and allies were in armes; what ſtrength there was by ſea; how manie kingdomes, prouinces, and countries yeelded obedience to the empire; what tribute was leuied; what cuſtomes; what neceſſarie charges iſſued out; what giftes; and al written with <hi>Auguſtus</hi> owne hand. Withal he gaue a politike inſtruction (yet whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for feare or enuie vncertaine) how to reſtraine the empire within bounds and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18166:7"/>
limits. Whileſt theſe things were a handeling, and the Senators in moſt lowe and humble maner intreating, that he would accept the charge: <hi>Tiberius</hi> letting ſlip a word by chaunce, that as he was vnable to take charge of the whole; ſo he would vndertake the protection of any one part they ſhould aſſigne him. <hi>Aſinius Gallus</hi> asked him, what part, <hi>Caeſar,</hi> wouldeſt thou haue committed to thy charge? Who being ſtroken into amaze with this vnlooked for demand, ſtood mute a while: then gathering his ſpirits to him, anſwered; That it ill befitted his modeſtie, to chooſe or refuſe any one part of that, from all which he deſired to be excuſed. <hi>Gallus</hi> replied (for by his countenance he coniectured he was offended) that he did not therefore demand that queſtion, as thought he would ſeuer that, which was inſeparable; but by his owne confeſſion conuict him, that the Common-wealth was but one bodie, and therefore to be gouerned by ones onely wiſedome. And continuing his ſpeech added many things in commendation of <hi>Auguſtus:</hi> and called to remembrance <hi>Tiberius</hi> owne victories, and diuers notable things done for many yeeres in time of peace. But all this could not appeaſe the Princes inueterate hatred againſt him: as though by marrying <hi>Vipſana</hi> daughter to <hi>M. Agrippa,</hi> once wife to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> he had carried too loſtie a courage, and higher aſpiring minde, than the priuate calling of a citizen; and ſauoring of the headie and fierce humor of <hi>Aſinius Pollio</hi> his father. After that <hi>L. Aruntius</hi> vſing ſpeeches not vnlike vnto <hi>Pollio,</hi> offended alike. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he bore <hi>Aruntius</hi> no old grudge, yet bicauſe he was wealthie, bold, learned, and in reputation with all men, he had him in iealouſie. When <hi>Auguſtus</hi> drew to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his later end, diſcourſing who were likelieſt to poſſeſſe the place after his death; who would refuſe it although they ſhould be choſen as meete: who being vnmeete and vnable, yet would deſire it: who could diſcharge it, and would vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it: ſaid that <hi>M. Lepidus</hi> was for his ſufficiencie able, but would refuſe: <hi>Gallus Aſinius</hi> greedie to laie holde on it, but was inſufficient: <hi>L. Aruntius</hi> was not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woorthie, and if occaſion were giuen would venter for it. All men agree that the two firſt were ſo named, but for <hi>Aruntius</hi> ſome put <hi>Cn. Piſo:</hi> and howſoeuer it was, all ſauing <hi>Lepidus,</hi> through <hi>Tiberius</hi> practiſe, for ſundrie pretended crimes were made awaie. <hi>L. Haterius</hi> likewiſe, and <hi>Mamercus Scaurus</hi> troubled his iealous head: the one by ſaieng, How long <hi>Caeſar</hi> wilt thou ſuffer the common-wealth to want a head? The other bicauſe he hoped that the petitions of the Senators ſhould take effect, ſeeing he did not as he might, withſtande the relation of the Conſuls by being Tribune. He inuaied ſharply, and that incontinently againſt <hi>Haterius,</hi> but let go <hi>Scaurus</hi> without any word: although he were more implacably offended with him then the other. And being wearied with the clamors of all ingenerall, and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of ſome in particular, by little and little yeelded vnto their requeſts: not ſo much bicauſe he would confeſſe, he tooke the charge of the Empire on him; as to make an end of refuſing, or being any more entreated. Certaine it is, that as <hi>Hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> went to the pallace to craue pardon of <hi>Tiberius;</hi> he narrowly eſcaped from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſlaine of the ſoldiers: bicauſe that caſting himſelfe at his knees as he was walking; either by chance, or happily hindered by <hi>Haterius,</hi> the Emperor fell: yet that danger did nothing mitigate his wrath: vntill <hi>Haterius</hi> making entreaty to <hi>Auguſta,</hi> by hir earneſt ſute was protected. Exceeding great flatterie was vſed towards hir by the Senators, ſome being of opinion that ſhe ſhoulde be called the foundres of the common-wealth, ſome the mother: and many that beſides the name of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Iulia</hi> ſhould be added. But <hi>Tiberius</hi> anſwered that titles of honor ought to be moderately giuen vnto women: and that he would vſe the ſame moderation in ſuch, as ſhould be beſtowed on himſelfe. This he did vpon enuie and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18166:8"/>
iealouſie: and therefore thinking hir greatnes to be his owne abaſement, would not ſuffer hir to haue a ſergeant before hir, or an altar to be dedicated in memorie of hir adoption, nor any ſuch like honor. He entreated neuertheleſſe that proconſularie authoritie might be giuen <hi>Germanicus Caeſar,</hi> which was ſent him by ambaſſadors, with commandement to comfort him for the death of <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> The reaſon why the like was not demanded in fauour of <hi>Druſus,</hi> was bicauſe he was there preſent and Conſul elect. And as <hi>Auguſtus</hi> had ordained before, he did nominate twelue competitors, for the Pretorſhip, and bound it with an oath he woulde not paſſe that number, although the Senators exhorted that they might be increaſed. That was the firſt time that the election of Magiſtrates was taken from the people, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the Lords of the Senate. For although vntill that daie all matters were ſwaied as beſt liked the Prince: yet ſome things were left to the fauour and voices of the Tribes. Neither did the people but with a vaine rumour complaine, that their right was taken from them; and the Senators ſeeing themſelues deliuered of manie bribes and vnſeemely ſutes, were well contented to accept the authoritie: <hi>Tiberius</hi> ſo moderating the matter, that he commended onely fower competitors, which ſhould be elected without ſute or feare of repulſe. The Tribunes of the people made requeſt, that it might be lawfull for them to ſet foorth plaies at their owne coſts, and recorde them in the Calendar of the Citie, and call them Auguſtales, by the name of <hi>Augustus.</hi> The Playes were graunted: but the coſts and expenſes were to riſe out of the publicke Treaſury: and that it ſhould be lawfull for them to vſe the triumphall robe in the race, but not be carried in a Chariot. Not long after the annuall celebration of theſe Playes, was caſt vpon the Pretor, which was iudge betweene the citizen and the forrener.</p>

Herevpon the ſouldyers began to grow licentious and quarelſome, and gaue eare to the moſt diſſolute and diſordered: and in fine, hunted after riot and eaſe; ſet nought by all military diſcipline, and refuſed trauell and labour.

whileſt he is new, and not fully ſetled in the ſtate? they had through cowardlines held their toong many yeares, ſome thirtie, ſome fortie in pay, ouergrowne with age, and many their limmes loſt in ſeruice. And after they were licenſed to depart, yet they were not at an end of ſeruice; but detayned vnder enſignes, indure as great toyle as before vnder a new name. And if any eſcaped ſo many hazards aliue, they were drawne into ſundry countries, where vnder a colour of ſome lands, eyther mooriſh bogs, or barren mountanous crags were alotted to their ſhare. Beſides, ſeruice was painefull in it ſelfe and vnprofitable; their liues and bodies valued but at ten aſſes <note n="*" place="margin">7. pence ob.</note> a day: hauing no better allowance to furniſh themſelues with weapons, apparell, and tents; and redeeme themſelues from the cruell vſage of the Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; pay fees of vacations from ſeruile miniſteries: yet their ſtripes, wounds, hard winters, ſcorching ſommers, bloudie battels, and fruitles peace had no end: and hope of redreſſe there was none, vnleſſe certaine lawes were ſet downe for ſuch as enter into ſeruice; as that euery ones pay ſhould be bettered to a deniere <note n="*" place="margin">9. pence, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the dena<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rius as 12. aſſes.</note> a day; and none bound to ſerue aboue ſixteene yeares; that from that time forward, they ſhould not be detayned vnder enſignes, but receiue in the ſame camp they ſerued, their recompence in readie coyne. What? did the Pretorian bands, which receiued two deniers <note n="*" place="margin">18. pence.</note> a day, and at the end of ſixteene yeares were ſent to their houſes, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelues to greater dangers then they? yet he did not ſpeake this to depraue or diminiſh the credite of the citie-gard, but becauſe they ſhould conſider what a hard part they were offered; yet he for his owne part being lodged among ſauage and barbarous people, did from his cabine ſee the enemie euery howre. The baſer</hi> ſort came murmuring about him, and ſtirred vp others with diuers encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: ſome reprochfully ſhewing the wales of their ſtipes; ſome their gray haires; ſome their ragged torne coates; ſome their naked bodies. At laſt they grew into ſuch a fury and rage, that they purpoſed of three legions ſhuffled together to make one: but they changed that deuiſe very quickly, euery one through emulation coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that honor for his owne legion: and pitched the three ſtandarts and enſignes together: withall they threw vp mounds of turfes, and placed on it a Tribunall, to the end the ſeate might be more conſpicuous. As they haſtned to finiſh the worke, <hi>Blaeſus</hi> came in among them, rebuking ſome, and hindering now one, now another, <hi rend="margQuotes">and crying alowde, In my bloud rather embrue your hands; for it is a leſſer offence to ſlay the Lieutenant, then fall from the obedience of the Emperour. I will either with my life keepe the legions in faithfull allegeance; or being ſlaine by you, haſten your repentance. Neuertheles they held on their worke vntill they had brought it breaſt high;</hi> when at laſt being ouercome with his importunacy, they gaue ouer their enterpriſe: then <hi>Blaeſus</hi> did in good and eloquent manner ſhew vnto them, <hi rend="margQuotes">that it was not conuenient that ſouldyers petitions ſhould be caried to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour by mutinie and rebellion. Neyther did the old ſouldyers vnder Emperours in times paſt, nor yet they themſelues demaund of <hi>Augustus</hi> ſuch vnlawfull and new requeſts; and that in an vnſeaſonable time: the new Prince was burdened with cares in the beginning of his Empire. Notwithſtanding, if their purpoſe was to obtayne that in a time of peace; which being conquerors in ciuill warres, they neuer attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; yet why do they contrary to the dutie of allegeance, and order of ſeruice vſe force? they ſhould rather depute ſome Embaſſadors to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> with publicke com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, to declare their requeſts.</hi> They all cryed immediately, that <hi>Blaeſus</hi> ſonne a Tribune, might vndertake the Embaſſie, and intreate that all ſuch as had ſerued ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yeares, ſhould be diſmiſſed and ſent home: which being graunted; then they would enioyne him the reſt of his charge. The yong man being departed with this

meſſage, they ſurceaſed their rebellion. But the ſouldiers grew prowde that the Lieutenants ſonne vndertooke to pleade the common cauſe; as being an euident token that they had wrung out that by force, which by modeſt demeanour they ſhould neuer haue obtained.</p>

               <p>IN the meane ſeaſon, certaine bands of ſoldiers ſent to Nauportum before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion began, to ſee the waies cleere, the bridges ſafe, &amp; other conueniences for the warre: vnderſtanding of the mutinie growen in the campe, ſnatched vp their enſignes; and ſacking villages adioining, &amp; Nauport it ſelfe, which might haue paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for a reaſonable free town; iniuried &amp; reuiled the Centurions which went about to bridle them; firſt with ſcoffes and reprochful termes; then with blowes &amp; ſtripes. But they had an eſpeciall hart-burning againſt <hi>Aufidienus Rufus,</hi> the campe-maſter; whom they pulled out of his chariot, and loaded with a fardell of ſtuffe, &amp; made him march formoſt of all the companie: now &amp; then asking him in a mockerie, whether he bare ſo great a burden willingly or not; or whether ſo long a iourney ſeemed not tedious vnto him? This <hi>Rufus</hi> had long been a common ſoldier; then a Centurion; then the Camp-maſter: and ſought to renew the ancient rigor of ſeruice: and being himſelfe hardned to beare any labor and trauel, was ſo much the more cruel, bicauſe himſelfe had endured the like. Theſe companies ioining with the other legions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to rebell afreſh; and ſtragling ſome one waie, ſome another; deſtroy and waſte al about them. <hi>Blaeſus</hi> to terrifie the reſt, commanded ſome few, and eſpecially ſuch as had the greateſt pillage, to be apprehended, whipt and caſt into priſon; for euen then the Centurions, and the better ſort of the ſoldiers were obedient to the Lieutenant. But the priſoners drew backe, and reſiſted ſuch as led them, catched holde and embraced the knees of the ſtanders by; calling euerieman by his name, or by the name of the band he ſerued vnder, or cohort, or legion; crieng that they ſhoulde drinke all of the ſame cup: withall, they heaped iniurie vpon iniurie againſt the Lieutenant: called to witnes the heauens and the gods; and left nothing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done or vnſaide, which might ſerue to ſtirre hatred, mooue compaſſion, breed feare, or prouoke anger. The ſoldiers cluſtered all togither, brake open the priſons, ſet at libertie the priſoners, and ſhuffled in among themſelues, the fugitiues and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of capitall crimes. This kindled the rage of the ſoldier: and more ringleaders ioined with them. Among whom one <hi>Vibulenus</hi> a common ſoldier, lifted on the ſhoulders of the ſtanders by, before <hi>Blaeſus</hi> Tribunall, began to ſpeake vnto the <hi rend="margQuotes">diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered and attentiue ſoldiers in this maner. You haue giuen light and life to theſe innocent and miſerable wretches; but when will you reſtore life to my brother; and my brother to me? who, being ſent vnto you from the Germane campe, to entreat of the common profit and good, was this laſt night murdered by his Fencers, which he hath alwaies readie armed to cut the ſoldiers throtes: anſwere <hi>Blaeſus,</hi> where haſt thou throwne his bodie? for the enimies themſelues enuie not that I ſhould burie him? And when I ſhall haue filled my griefe with kiſſing, and weeping ouer him, command me to be murdered alſo: ſo as theſe our companions burie him and me; ſlaine for no other offence, but bicauſe we furthered the common good and profit of the Legions.</hi> He inflamed his words with teares, beating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe on the face and breſt: then thruſting them from him on whoſe ſhoulders he was caried, and throwing himſelfe at euery mans feete, droue them all into ſuch amaze,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:18166:9"/>
and ſtirred ſuch hatred, that part of the ſouldiers laid hands on <hi>Blaeſus</hi> Fencers, and bound them; part on the reſidue of his familie; and part ran hither and thither, to ſeeke for <hi>Vibulenus</hi> brothers body. And if it had not appeared incontinently, that there was no ſuch body found; if his ſlaues by torture had not denied any ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended murder to haue beene committed; and further, that <hi>Vibulenus</hi> neuer had any ſuch brother: the ſoldiers would hardly haue ſpared the Lieutenants life. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, they thruſt out the Tribune and Camp-maiſter, ſpoiled &amp; robbed ſuch as fled, ſlew <hi>Lucillius</hi> a Centurion, whome the ſouldiers by a nickname called <hi>Cedo alteran,</hi> giue me another, becauſe that when he had broken vpon a ſouldiers ſhoulders his vine wand, his manner was to call alowde, giue me another; and when that was broken, another. The reſt were ſaued by hiding themſelues; only <hi>Iulius Clemens</hi> they kept aliue, becauſe that hauing a readie and quicke wit, they thought him a meete man to be employed as an Embaſſador in the ſouldiers behalfe.

                  <hi>VII. Druſus</hi> is ſent to appeaſe the rebellion in Pannony: and the ringleaders puniſhed.</head>
               <p>WHen <hi>Tiberius</hi> had intelligence of theſe mutinies; although he were cloſe, and a great diſſembler of bad tidings; reſolued to ſend his ſonne <hi>Druſus</hi> vnto theſe legions, with certaine of the principalleſt Gentlemen of the citie, and two Pretorian bands; without any limited commiſſion, but to determine there, as occaſion beſt required. Theſe bands were of extraordinary choiſe men, and ſtronger then any other were vſed to be, and a great part of his gard of horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and the ableſt Germans of his owne gard. <hi>Aelius Seianus</hi> alſo Captaine of the gard was ſent with him, once an aſſociate and companion to <hi>Strabo</hi> his father, and a man highly in credit with <hi>Tiberius;</hi> as well to be a guide to the yong Prince, as to ſhew vnto others the danger or reward of ill or well doing. When <hi>Druſus</hi> was come neere vnto them, the legions met him as it were to do their dutie; but not as the manner was, cheerefully with glittering enſignes, but in baſe and abiect habit; and in countenance although pretending ſadnes, yet in deede were neerer wilfull ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacie. After he was entered the trench of the camp, they ſet a ſtrong gard at the gates, commanded ſome troupes to attend at certaine places of the camp, and the reſt came and enuironed the Tribunall in huge multitudes. <hi>Druſus</hi> ſtoode vp, and with his hand commaunded ſilence to be made. When the ſouldiers beheld what a multitude they were, they made a dreadfull noiſe with hideous tunes; then anon turning their eyes towards <hi>Caeſar,</hi> they quaked for feare: after that, they made a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe murmuring and buzzing; then a cruell outcry; and on a ſuddaine all was huſht againe; which bred as men were diuerſly affected, either a feare in themſelues, or in others. At laſt the tumult ceaſing, he read his fathers letters, which contained what a ſpeciall care he had ouer thoſe moſt valorous legions, with whome he had ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned many battels; and that as ſoone as his minde could be at reſt, and the mourning for his father paſt, he would deale with the Lords of the Senate concerning their demaunds: that in the meane ſpace he had ſent his ſonne which ſhould graunt without delay, as much as for the preſent could conueniently be yeelded: and that the reſt ſhould be reſerued to the conſideration of the Senate, whom it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18166:10"/>
ſhould iudge as well what deſerued fauour, as rigor and ſeueritie. They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered all in generall, that <hi>Clemens</hi> the Centurion had charge to propound their demaunds: he began with licence to depart after ſixteene yeares, with recompence after the end of their ſeruice: and that their wages might be a denarius a day; that the old ſouldiers ſhould not be conſtrained to continue vnder enſignes. But when <hi>Druſus</hi> began to pretend, that theſe were fit matters to be referred to the Lords of the Senate, and his fathers conſideration; they cut off his ſpeech with clamors, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulating: <hi rend="margQuotes">That ſeeing he had no authority to augment their pay; nor eaſe them of their labor; nor benefit them any way; to what purpoſe was he come thither? But to beate and put them to death, euery man had authoritie. It was an old trick of <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> to fruſtrate the legions deſires, with the name of <hi>Augustus:</hi> and <hi>Druſus</hi> doth now put the ſame in practice. Shall they neuer haue any ſent them, but ſuch as are vnder the power of another? It was ſtrange, that the Emperour ſhould referre only that to the knowledge of the Senate, which concerned the ſouldiers commoditie. It were as requiſite the Senators aduiſe ſhould be knowne, when a ſouldier ſhould be puniſhed, or brought to fight in battell. Did it ſtand with reaſon, there ſhould be maiſters appointed, to diſpoſe of their rewards and recompence; and that without any iudge their puniſhments ſhould be arbitrary?</hi> At laſt they go from the Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and threaten with their fiſts thoſe they met, of the gard, or <hi>Caeſars</hi> friends and familiars, as deſirous to pick quarrels, and raiſe ſedition. But they bare a ſpeciall grudge vnto <hi>Cn. Lentulus,</hi> becauſe that he, for his yeares, and experience in martiall feates, in greater reputation then the reſt; was thought to animate <hi>Druſus</hi> againſt the ſouldiers, and firſt of all reiect their licentious demaunds. Whom not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (foreſeeing the danger he was in) going with <hi>Caeſar</hi> to the ſtanding camp, they enuironed him, asking whither he went? towards the Emperour, or towards the Senate? whether there he would be alſo againſt the legions profit? And withall comming fiercely vpon him, and throwing ſtones at him, all embrued in bloud, and certaine of preſent death, yet was ſuccoured by ſuch as came with <hi>Caeſar.</hi> That night, which menaced great diſorder, and outragious behauiour, was quieted by a meere chaunce. For the Skie being cleere and bright, yet the Moone ſeemed to be eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on a ſudden; which the ſouldiers, being ignorant of the cauſe, conſtrued as a preſage of preſent ill lucke: and comparing their attempts, to the eclipſe; were of opinion that their ſucceſſe ſhould be proſperous, if the goddeſſe ſhould become cleere and bright againe. Whereupon they began with Trompets, Cornets, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther brazen inſtruments, to make a lowd noiſe, now ioyfull, now ſad, as the Moone appeared either cleere or darke. But when the black clowdes, riſing, tooke from them the ſight of the Moone, ſuppoſing ſhe had bene hidden in darknes, and vtterly loſt her light: as troubled minds fall eaſily into ſuperſtition, they began to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine and lament, that, that portended their labours ſhould haue no end; and that the gods turned their faces from their wickednes. <hi>Caeſar</hi> thinking it expedient to make his profit of their feare; and gouerne that by wiſedome, which fortune had offered; commaunded the Pauillions to be viewed; <hi>Clemens</hi> the Centurion to be called, and ſuch others, as for their laudable vertues were beſt liked of the common ſort: who thruſting themſelues into the watch, the wardes, and gate-keepers, increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſometimes their feare, and ſometimes promiſed hope, ſaying: <hi rend="margQuotes">How long ſhall we beſiege the Emperors ſonne? what ſhall be the end of our reuolt? ſhall we ſweare allegeance to <hi>Percennius</hi> and <hi>Vibulenus?</hi> ſhall we looke for our pay at their hands? ſhall they reward the old ſouldiers with lands? to be briefe, ſhall they take vpon them the gouernment of the Romane Empire, in <hi>Neroes</hi> and <hi>Druſus</hi> ſtead?
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:18166:10"/>
were it not better that as we were the laſt which offended; ſo we ſhould be the firſt to repent? Demaunds in common are ſlowly graunted: a priuat fauour is no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner deſerued, then obtained.</hi> Theſe ſpeeches troubled their mindes, and bred a miſtruſt among themſelues: the yong ſouldiers forſooke the old: and one legion parted from an other. By little and little they returned to their allegeance; went from the gates which before they poſſeſſed: carried to their vſuall places the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, which in the beginning of their rebellion they had pitched together. <hi>Druſus</hi> the next morning calling an aſſembly, although he were no great Orator; yet the worthines of his birth ſupplying that want, he condemned their former, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended their preſent behauior. Aſſured them that he was not to be ouercome with feare and threatning: but if he perceiued in them a modeſt cariage, intreatie of pardon with ſubmiſſion; he would write vnto his father, that forgetting that which was paſt, he would giue eare to the legions ſuites. At their intreatie <hi>Blaeſus,</hi> and <hi>L. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pronius,</hi> a Gentleman of Rome, and one of <hi>Druſus</hi> company, and <hi>Iustus Catonius</hi> a chiefe Centurion, were ſent againe to <hi>Tiberius.</hi> This done, <hi>Druſus</hi> counſellers diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreed in opinions: ſome holding it expedient, that expecting the Embaſſadors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne; the ſouldiers in the meane ſeaſon ſhould be gently intreated: ſome that ſharp remedies ought to be vſed: affirming that there was no meane in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people; and vnleſſe they were kept in awe, they would keepe others vnder. That they might eaſily be dealt withall whileſt they ſtoode in feare; and therefore it was needefull that they ſhould be brideled by their Generals authoritie: the ring-leaders of the reuolt executed, whileſt yet the ſuperſtition held them in aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Hereupon <hi>Druſus</hi> being naturally of a rough diſpoſition, cauſed <hi>Percennius</hi> and <hi>Vibulenus</hi> to be put to death. Some ſay they were murdered in the Gouernors tent; others that their bodies were throwne out of the rampire to the terror of the reſt. After this, a ſearch was made for the principall captaines of the conſpiracie: whereof ſome roming about the camp, were ſlaine by the gard: others the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers themſelues deliuered, as a teſtimonie of their allegeance, into <hi>Druſus</hi> hands. But there did nothing more augment the ſouldiers diſtreſſed caſe, then an vntimely win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, continuall and cruell raines; that they could neyther put foote out of their tents; nor meete together: nor hardly keepe vp their ſtandarts, through boiſterous windes, and ſtormie ſhowers, toſſing them hither and thither. They were not yet rid of the feare, the heauens ire ſtroke them into: imagining that the ſtarres grew not darke in vaine againſt their wickednes; and that the tempeſts fell vpon them for their lewde and villanous demeanor. There was no comfort left, but to abandon thoſe vnlucky, and diſloyall camps; and being purged of their offence by ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory ſacrifice, each legion to repaire to his ſtanding camp. The eight legion departed firſt; then the fifteenth. The ninth cried that they ought to tarry for <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> anſwere: but being diſcomfited by the others departure, preuenting imminent neceſſitie, voluntarily went away. <hi>Druſus</hi> not expecting the Embaſſadors returne, ſeeing all quiet for the preſent, went back to Rome.</p>

be maſter of all. There lay by the riuer of Rhene two armies: the one called the higher, vnder the Lieutenant <hi>C. Silius:</hi> the other the lower, vnder <hi>A. Caecina.</hi> But the Lord generall ouer them all, was <hi>Germanicus,</hi> then greatly buſied in leuying of ſubſidies and taxations in Gallia. Thoſe which <hi>Silius</hi> commanded, wauering and irreſolute, looked into the ſucceſſe of others reuolt: but the lower armie grewe into a rage and furie: the conſpiracie beginning by the one and twentith and fift legions, which drew alſo to their ſide the firſt and the twelfth: all of them being in the ſame ſommer campes, in the confines of Vbium, idle, or in very eaſie ſeruice. Aduertiſement being come of <hi>Augustus</hi> death, a multitude of citie-borne bond-men, and after made free, newly muſtered to be ſoldiers, giuen to licentiouſnes, and impatient of labour: began to fill the mindes of the ruder ſort, with theſe ſpeeches. That the time was now come, that the olde ſoldier might demand a ſhorter time of ſeruice; the new greater pay; and all in generall an end of their miſeries: and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie giuen to reuenge the crueltie of the Centurions. This was not ſpoken by one alone, as when <hi>Percennius</hi> incited the legions of Pannonie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor vnto daſtards looking that men of better courage than they ſhould begin: but many ſeditious mouthes and voices, were at once heard to ſay; that the whole Romane ſtate was in their hands; that by their victories it was growen great: and that of them the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors tooke their ſurname. The Lieutenant, the rage of the multitude hauing ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away his conſtancie, durſt not reſiſt them: when on the ſudden like frantike men, with their ſwords drawen (a very olde ſubiect of quarrell and hatred in ſoldiers, and a beginning of crueltie) they fell on the Centurions; threw them along; laide them on with ſtripes; three ſcore to one, to make euen number with the Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And hauing thus mangled and torne them, and ſlaine ſome, they threw them out of the trench, or into the riuer of Rhene. Among others <hi>Septimius</hi> fled to the Tribunall, and caſt himſelfe at <hi>Caecinaes</hi> feete: but was with ſuch importunacie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, that he could not but deliuer him to the butcherie. <hi>Caſsius Chaerea</hi> (famous afterward to poſteritie for murdering <hi>C.

After that neither Tribune, nor campe-maſter was obeied; the watch and warde, and whatſoeuer the preſent time required, was ordered, and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted among themſelues. Thoſe which deepely looked into the diſpoſition of ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; iudged it a ſtrong argument, of a great and implacable reuolt, that they were not ſcattered and diuided; nor any attempt giuen by a few; but grew inſolent alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither: were quiet at once: with ſuch a moderation and conſtancie, that thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt haue thought they had been gouerned by one head. In the meane ſeaſon, newes was brought to <hi>Germanicus</hi> (who as I haue ſaid, was leuying of ſubſidies and tributes in Gallia) that <hi>Augustus</hi> was departed. <hi>Germanicus</hi> had married <hi>Auguſtus</hi> niece <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippina,</hi> and had by hir many children, and was <hi>Druſus, Tiberius</hi> brothers ſonne, and nephew to <hi>Auguſta:</hi> but greatly perplexed, by reaſon of his vncles and grandmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſecret hatred towards him; ſo much the more deepe and deadly, bicauſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt. This proceeded of the good will and remembrance which the people of Rome had of <hi>Druſus:</hi> all of them certainly beleeuing, that if he had gotten the ſoueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, he would haue ſct libertie on foote againe: and hoping the like of <hi>Germanicus,</hi> bare him the like affection. This yoong Prince was of a milde diſpoſition, very cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, nothing at all reſembling <hi>Tiberius</hi> in countenance, or couert and arrogant ſpeech. Beſides this, womens quarrels were mingled among, <hi>Liuia</hi> (as is the maner of all ſtepdames) exaſperating <hi>Tiberius</hi> againſt <hi>Agrippina:</hi> a woman indeede eaſily mooued: but through hir chaſtitie, and loue towards hir husband, though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18166:11"/>
of an inuincible ſtomacke, yet turned all to the beſt. But the neerer <hi>Germanicus</hi> was to the higheſt hope, the more he labored to ſettle <hi>Tiberius</hi> in the ſtate: compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Sequans adioining, and the cities of Belgia to ſweare their allegeance vnto him. Then vnderſtanding of the hurly burly of the legions, departing in all ſpeede, met the ſoldiers out of their campe, hanging downe the head; repenting them of that they had done. He was no ſooner within the trench, but there was heard a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe lamentation and complaint among them: ſome taking him by the hand as it were to kiſſe it, thruſt his fingers into their mouthes, that he might feele they were toothleſſe: others ſhewed their crooked bodies with age. Who perceiuing them confuſely ſhuffled togither, commanded to ſeparate themſelues into companies, the eaſier to heare his anſwere: and beare their enſignes before them; the better to diſcerne their bands: wherein they obeied ſlowly ynough. <hi>Germanicus</hi> beginning with the reuerence of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> fell by little and little into the praiſe of the victories and triumphes, and eſpecially the famous exploites <hi>Tiberius</hi> had done in Germanie with thoſe legions. Then extolled the vnitie of Italie; the loyaltie of Gallia; and how all other partes of the empire were quiet. The ſoldiers gaue eare vnto all this with ſilence, or with a ſmall murmuring: but as ſoone as he began to touch their mutinies; expoſtulating; <hi rend="margQuotes">What was become of the modeſt behauiour of ſoldiers? where was the honor of ancient diſcipline? whither they had driuen their Tribunes and Centurions?</hi> they all vnclothed themſelues, ſhewed him their wounds, ſcars, and marks of their ſtripes: then with a confuſe note, how deerely they bought their eaſe and vacations; found fault with their ſmall pay; the intolerable paines they were put to in working: by name condemning the rampires, trenches, ſeeking of ſtower, carrying of ſtones &amp; timber, and all other prouiſions, either neceſſarie in the campe; or to keepe the ſoldiers from idlenes. But the greateſt clamors were heard to proceede from the old ſoldiers; whereof ſome hauing ſpent thirtie yeeres in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, ſome more; beſought him to prouide for ſuch ouer wearied poore ſoldiers; and not ſuffer them to end the reſt of their daies, in miſerie and paine: but deliuered of ſuch labor and toiles, that they might at length enioie repoſe without penurie. Some demanded the legacie bequeathed by <hi>Auguſtus</hi> wil, and wiſhed <hi>Germanicus</hi> all good fortune; offering themſelues to his deuotion if he would take vpon him the empire. Whereat, as though he had beene diſtained with ſome villanie; he leapt from the Tribunall: and as he would haue departed: the ſoldiers turned their weapons to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him in menacing wiſe: vnleſſe he would go backe againe. But crying that he would rather die, than falſifie his faith: drew his ſword from his ſide; bent the point of it towards his breſt, readie to haue thruſt it in; if ſome which were neere him by catching hold of his hand, had not withheld him by maine ſtrength. That part of the throng which was fartheſt behinde, and which is ſcarce credible, ſome other getting neerer &amp; neerer, encouraged him to ſtrike boldly; and one called <hi>Caluſidius,</hi> offered him his naked ſword; ſaying that it was better pointed than his. But that euen to the moſt furious, was thought a barbarous and ſauage part, and an euill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident. <hi>Caeſars</hi> friends had time to conduct him to his pauilion: there they conſulted what was beſt to be done; bicauſe newes came, that the ſoldiers were in hande to diſpatch embaſſadors to the higher armie, to drawe them to the ſame attempt: and that they had determined to ſacke Colen; and hauing imbrued their hands with that pray, run on to pill and waſte Gallia.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>GErmanicus</hi> feared ſo much the more, bicauſe he knew the enimie woulde not faile to inuade, as ſoone as he vnderſtood of the diſſenſion within Rome, and that the riuers ſide was vndefended. On the other ſide, if the allies and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates ſhoulde arme themſelues againſt the legions, it was to begin a new ciuill war. And that it was to the ſtate dangerous a like; to vſe either ſeueritie or liberalitie: and no leſſe, to graunt the ſoldier all thing or nothing. The matter being thus deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on both ſides, it was thought good, that letters ſhould be written in the princes name, containing: that ſuch as had ſerued twentie yeeres, ſhould be fully diſmiſſed: and ſuch as ſixteene, diſcharged alſo; with condition onely to remaine vnder en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, and repulſe the enimie. That their legacies left them by <hi>Augustus,</hi> ſhould be doubled and paied. The ſoldier perceiued that thoſe were ſleights to win time; and therefore vrged a preſent execution: licence of departure was preſently yeelded by the Tribunes; but paiment deferred. The fift, and one and twentieth legion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to go to any ſtanding campe; vntill they had their paie in the ſame camps they ſerued in. Which they receiued of ſuch prouiſion, as <hi>Caeſar</hi> could either make by his friends, or had to ſerue his owne turne. <hi>Caecina</hi> the Lieutenant brought backe to Vbium, the firſt, and the twentieth legion, in baſe &amp; diſorderly aray: carying between the enſignes and ſtandarts, maſſes of money, extorted from the Emperos treaſure. <hi>Germanicus</hi> went to the vpper armie, and there without delaie, tooke the oath of allegeance, of the ſecond, thirteen, and ſixteenth legion; the fowerteenth yet reſting doubtfull what were beſt. But they had all their diſcharge and money offered them vnasked. At the ſame time, certaine vexiliarie ſoldiers which continued vnder en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, and were placed for a guarde to the countrey, of two legions which before were at iarre, began a tumult in the countrey of the Chauceans: which was quickly ſuppreſſed by putting to death two of the ſoldiers. Which <hi>Mennius</hi> the Camp-maſter commanded rather for example, then right of his office. But the tumult growing hot, <hi>Mennius</hi> fled; and being found out, perceiuing that there was no ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in lurking, tried what boldnes coulde auaile: ſaying; That they bent not their forces againſt the Camp-maſter; but againſt <hi>Germanicus</hi> their Generall, and <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> the Emperor: perceauing that thoſe words daunted ſuch as would haue hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, ſnatching vp an enſigne, went to the riuer ſide; and denouncing him a fugitiue and traitor which refuſed to follow; brought them to the winter ſtanding campe, aſtonied, and not daring to attempt any thing. In the meane ſeaſon the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors ſent from the Senate to <hi>Germanicus,</hi> found him at Vbium, at the place cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Altar. Where two legions, the firſt and the twentieth wintered, with the old ſoldiers lately diſmiſſed and kept vnder enſignes. The timorous and troubled in conſcience, were ſurpriſed with a ſudden feare, leaſt ſome were come by comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the Senate, to make fruſtrate all, they had wrung out by rebellion. And as the manner of the people is, alwaies falſely to accuſe ſome one or other whom they ſuſpect: ſo now they laide all the blame, on <hi>Munatius Plancus;</hi> who had beene Conſull and chiefe in the Embaſie: affirming him to be the author of that decree. And in the dead of the night, went to <hi>Germanicus,</hi> importunately demanding an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne which was in his houſe: and flocking togither brake downe the gates: entered his houſe; drew <hi>Germanicus</hi> out of his bed; and threatening to kill him, forced him
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:18166:12"/>
to deliuer the enſigne. Then running vp and downe, they met with the embaſſadors, hearing of the deſperate tumult, going to <hi>Germanicus:</hi> the ſoldiers iniuring them, and readie to kill them: and aboue others <hi>Plancus,</hi> who in regarde of his dignitie coulde not flee: hauing no other refuge left in diſtreſſe and danger, then to flie to the campe of the firſt legion: where imbracing the ſtandard and enſignes, founde ſafetie as in a religious place. And had not <hi>Calphurnius,</hi> the ſtandard bearer, garded him from the furie of the ſoldiers (a thing which ſeldome hapneth, euen among the enimies) an embaſſador of the people of Rome, in the Romans campe, had with his bloud polluted the altars of the gods. Aſſoone as it was daie, that the L. Generall, the ſoldier, and the attempts might be knowen; <hi>Germanicus</hi> entered the campe: and commanding <hi>Plancus</hi> to be brought to him, placed him in the Tribunall by him. Then ſharpely rebuking their fatall rage, ſtirred vp by the wrath of the gods, and not the ſoldiers will: he openeth vnto them the cauſe of the embaſſadors comming: their priuiledges: bewailing with great eloquence, <hi>Plancus</hi> vndeſerued hap; and the diſcredit of the legions. And hauing rather rauiſhed then quieted the aſſemblie, ſent away the embaſſadors with a garde of auxiliarie horſemen. During this feare, euerie man blamed <hi>Germanicus,</hi> that he went not to the vpper armie, where he ſhoulde haue both obedience, and aide againſt the rebels: that his fault had beene great inough, in diſmiſſing the ſoldiers with money in their purſes, and vſing them ſo curteouſly. And if he made no greater reckoning of his owne perſon; yet he had no reaſon to leaue his yoong ſonne, and his wife great with childe, as a praie to furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and mad men; breakers of all humane lawes. And that he ſhould preſerue them, at the leaſtwiſe, for their grandfather, and the common-wealth. He then weighing long what he were beſt to reſolue: his wife refuſing to forſake him; alleaging, that ſhe was deſcended from <hi>Augustus,</hi> and proteſting that ſhe would neuer degenerate from hir bloud, whatſoeuer danger might be preſented: at laſt embracing both hir and the child, with manie teares conſtrained hir to depart. Away then packt this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable companie of women; and the Generals wife: fleeing with his little ſonne in hir lap, with a heauie troupe of hir friends wiues about hir, lead away with hir for companie: thoſe which remained behinde, no leſſe ſorrowfull then they. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled not a triumphing <hi>Caeſar,</hi> marching out of his campe: but the bewailing and lamentation of a citie, conquered and ſackt of the enimie. Which piercing the eares of the ſoldiers: they went out of their cabbines; enquiring what that dolorous tune was? and from whence proceeded that lamentable noiſe? And perceiuing thoſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dames to go without any Centurion or ſoldier, to garde them; and their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours wife deſtitute of hir accuſtomed traine, going towards Treuers, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit hirſelfe to the mercie of ſtrangers: were ſtroken into ſhame and compaſſion: when they called to minde <hi>Agrippa</hi> hir father, <hi>Augustus</hi> hir grandfather, and <hi>Druſus</hi> hir father in lawe: and how ſhe hir-ſelfe was for hir chaſtitie and childe bearing, honored of al: and how ſhe had had, a childe borne and brought vp in their campe: whom by a militarie name they called <hi>Caligula:</hi> bicauſe that to win the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the common ſoldier, he wore the ſame kinde of ſtocking or buskin as he did. But nothing did mooue them more, then the hatred to thoſe of Treuers: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore began to intreat, and hinder their going; praying hir that ſhe would returne and remaine with them.

                  <hi rend="margQuotes">NOt my wife, or ſonne, are deerer vnto me, then my father and the Common-wealth: but him, his owne Maieſtie; the Empire, the other armies ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend. I do now remoue my wife and children (which neuertheles I would willingly offer vnto death, were it to your glory and honor) from the ſight of raging mad men: that all your lewd actions be purged with my bloud only; leaſt if you ſhould murder <hi>Augustus</hi> nephewes ſonne, and <hi>Tiberius</hi> daughter in law, you ſhould become guiltie of moe hainous crimes: for what haue you not dared to attempt theſe daies paſt? or what haue you left vnuiolated? By what name ſhall I call this aſſembly? Shall I call you ſouldiers, who haue beſieged your Emperors ſonne euen within the trench? or ſhall I call you citizens, by whom the authoritie of the Senate is ſo little regarded? You haue broken that law which one enemy obſerueth to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: violated the ſacred freedome of Embaſſadors, and the lawe of Nations. <hi>Iulius</hi> of famous memory, repreſſed a ſedition in his army with one bare word: cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſuch Quirites, which drew back countrary to their oath of allegeance. <hi>Auguſtus</hi> of ſacred memory, daunted the legions at Actium, with his looke. And as for vs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we be neither of them, yet being extract from them, we thinke it ſtrange and vnmeete, that the Spaniſh or Syrian ſouldier ſhould contemne vs. Thou the firſt legion, and thou the twentith, the one hauing receiued enſignes of <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> and the other a companion in ſo many battels, and enriched with ſo many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compences, do you thus guerdon your Generall? Is this the meſſage I ſhall carry my father (who receiueth but good tidings from all other Prouinces) that neither the yong, nor old ſouldier, can be ſatisfied with licence to depart, nor money in their purſe? And that heere only, the Centurions are murdered, the Tribunes driuen away, the Embaſſadors ſhut vp? that the tents and riuers are ſtained with bloud? and that I my ſelfe, hold my life but at the curteſie of ſuch as hate me? Why did you ſnatch out of my hands, the ſword which I meant to thruſt through my breaſt, the firſt day of our meeting? O vnaduiſed friends: yet he dealt better and more louingly with me, which offered me his ſword; for by that meanes I ſhould haue ended my life, before I ſhould haue ſeene ſo many outrages in my army. You ſhould haue made choiſe of a Generall, which would haue left my death vnpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; yet haue reuenged the death of <hi>Varo,</hi> and of the three legions. The gods forbid, that the Belgians, though offering themſelues, ſhould carry away the credit and the honor of ſuccouring the Romanes, and brideling the Germans. Let thy ſoule, <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi> of ſacred memorie, receiued into heauen, thy image father <hi>Druſus,</hi> and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of thee, together with theſe ſouldiers whom ſhame and glory do enter into, wipe away this blot, and conuert this priuate rancor, to the deſtruction of the enemie. And you, in whom I perceiue another countenance and another will, if you purpoſe to reſtore the Embaſſadors to the Senate; yeeld dutifull obedience to the Emperour; and me, my wife and ſonne: withdraw your ſelues from the contagion of the ſeditious, and go from them which haue beene the authors of this rebellion: that ſhall be a ſure token of your repentance, and a bond of fidelitie.</hi> With theſe ſpeeches the ſouldiers humbling themſelues, confeſſed all to be true which was vpbraided them: and beſought him that he would puniſh the faultie, and pardon thoſe which were ſeduced, and bring them againſt the enemie: recall his wife and the legions child; and not deliuer him to the Gaules for an hoſtage. <hi>Germanicus</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:18166:13"/>
excuſed the returne of his wife by the neerenes of her time, and winter; yet that his ſonne ſhould returne againe: and as for other things, that they themſelues ſhould ſee them performed. The ſouldiers then, being better perſwaded, ran from place to place, layd hands on the moſt diſordered perſons, and brought them bound before <hi>C. Cetronius,</hi> Colonel of the firſt legion: who gaue iudgement and puniſhment on euery of them in this manner. The legions called together, ſtoode with their ſwords drawne before the Tribunal: and the offender ſhewen by the Tribune out of a high ſeate: and if the ſouldiers did cry that he was guiltie, he was immediately throwne downe headlong, and cut in peeces: the ſouldier reioyſing in theſe maſſacres, as though himſelfe thereby had bene acquited. <hi>Germanicus</hi> did not hinder them at all, ſeeing, that being done without his commaundement, as well the fact, as the enuie of it, ſhould light vpon their owne necks. The old ſouldiers following that preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, were anon after ſent to Raetia, vnder colour of defending the prouince, from the inuaſion of the Sweuians: but in deede, to draw them from thoſe garriſons; yet breathing of crueltie, no leſſe by that cruel meanes of redreſſe, then memorie of their former outrages. This done, he tooke a ſuruey of the Centurions: who being called by the Captaine, told their names, degrees, and countrey, what payes they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, and how many yeares: what exploits they had done in ſeruice, and with what donatiues rewarded. If the Tribunes and legions approued their valour and integritie, they kept their roomes: if by common conſent, couetouſnes, or crueltie were laid to their charge, they were caſſirde. Things thus ſetled for the preſent, there aroſe immediately, a matter of no leſſer waight then the former, through the headie inſolencie of the fift, and one and twentith legion, lodged in winter ſtandings threeſcore miles off, at Vetera. For they firſt led the daunce, and with their owne hands, committed the lewdeſt outrages: Nothing terrified with their fellowes puniſhment, continued impenitent, and ſtill harbored anger in their breaſts. Whereupon <hi>Caeſar</hi> gathereth forces, prepareth a Nauy with confederates and allies, to ſend downe the Rhene: purpoſing if they were obſtinate, to try it out in a maine battell. No tidings being all this while brought to Rome, of the ſucceſſe in Illyricum: and vnderſtanding of the riſing of the Germaine legions; the citie trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling with feare, began to blame <hi>Tiberius,</hi> that counterfeiting a doubtfulnes of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on him the Empire, mocked the Lords of the Senate, the weake &amp; vnfurniſhed common people, and ſuffered the ſeditious in the meane time to rebell, which by the weake authoritie of two yong men could not be ſuppreſſed. That he ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue gone himſelfe in perſon, and oppoſed his imperiall maieſtie againſt them; at whoſe ſight they would preſently haue yeelded, being by long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence skilfull, and carrying with him power to puniſh, or reward. If <hi>Augustus</hi> ſtriken in yeares, could make often iourneies into Germanie: ſhould <hi>Tiberius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a ſtrong and able bodie, ſit in the Senate, carping the Senators words? He had taken good order how to keepe the citie in ſeruitude: and that it was now time to applie ſome medicine to the ſouldiers minde, to induce them to a diſpoſition of peace. Notwithſtanding <hi>Tiberius</hi> ſtanding ſtiffe in his determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, reſolued not to forſake the head of the empire, and hazard himſelfe and the whole ſtate. Many things troubled his minde: as that the Germane armie was the ſtrongeſt: and the Pannonian neere at hand: the one leaning to the ſtrength of the Gaules: the other, lying in the confines of Italie: doubtfull himſelfe which firſt to go to; leaſt the other being poſtpoſed ſhould take it in diſdaine. But his ſonnes, might viſit both: as a thing ſtanding well with imperiall maieſtie, bearing grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtate fartheſt off. The yoong men might be excuſed if they referred ſome things
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:18166:14"/>
to their father: and if they ſhould reſiſt <hi>Germanicus</hi> and <hi>Druſus,</hi> he ſhould be able to appeaſe or ouerthrowe them. But if they ſhould ſet light by the Emperor, what remedie could be then looked for? Neuertheles as though he would depart out of hand, he made choiſe of his followers, prouided his carriages in a readines, prepared ſhipping; then excuſing himſelfe, now with the hardnes of the winter; now with this, now with that: he deceiued firſt the wiſe, then the vulgar ſort, and the prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces a very long time.</p>

               <p>BVt <hi>Germanicus,</hi> although he had an armie in a readines to reuenge vpon the rebels: thinking it conuenient neuertheles, to giue them ſome reſpite; to ſee whether they would be reclaimed by the example of the other legions: ſent letters before to aduertiſe <hi>Cecina,</hi> that he was comming with a power: and that if they would not puniſh the offenders before his comming, he would without any reſpect make a generall ſlaughter of them all. Theſe letters <hi>Cecina</hi> ſecretly imparted to the ſtandard and enſigne bearers, and the better ſort: perſwading them to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all in generall from infamie, and themſelues from death. For in time of peace each mans cauſe and merit was waighed; but in warre, the guiltie and guiltleſſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed alike. They then ſounding the mindes of thoſe they thought fitteſt, and finding the greater number of the legionarie ſoldiers to continue dutifull; follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lieutenants aduice, ſet downe a time when to cut off the lewdeſt, and moſt ſeditious among them. Then the watch-word giuen, they breake into their tents; ſlue them; none priuie to the cauſe but ſuch, as were of counſell in the enterpriſe: neither imagining the beginning, nor the ende of this butcherie. The ſtrangeſt manner of ciuill warre that euer happened was this: for without order of battell; not ſallying out of diuers ſtandings; but out of the ſame beds, in which they had eaten by day, and ſlept by night: they banded into factions; lanced their dartes: outcries were heard; wounds giuen; blood ſhed; but the cauſe vnknowen: fortune ruled the reſt, and ſome honeſt men were ſlaine among. But it was no ſooner knowne againſt whom this watch was intended, but the worſt perſons ſnatched their weapons likewiſe: no Lieutenant, nor Tribune preſent to bridle them: but euery man licenced to reuenge his fill. <hi>Germanicus</hi> anon after entering the camp, with many teares calling that a butchery, and not a medicine, commaunded the bodies to be burnt. The bloudie ſouldiers thirſted after the enemie, as a ſatisfaction of his furie: ſuppoſing that the ghoſts of their companions could by no other meanes be appeaſed, then by receiuing honorable wounds in their wicked breaſts. <hi>Caeſar</hi> followed the ſouldiers heate, and building a bridge ouer the riuer, paſt ouer twelue thouſand, drawen out of the legions; ſixe and twentie cohorts of allies: and eight wings of ſuch horſemen, as during the mutinie, were of good and modeſt cariage. The Germanes not farre off were iocand: whileſt we for the death of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus,</hi> and by ciuill diſcords, kept holy day. The Romane army marching with ſpeede, paſt the wood Caeſia; and the bound begun by <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and encamped vpon it: fortifying the front and the back with a trench, and the ſides with loppings of trees. From thence they marched through darke forreſts, and conſulting of two waies, which was beſt: the ſhort and vſuall: or the vnbeaten and hardeſt: and therefore leaſt doubted of the enemie. And hauing made choiſe of the longeſt, they
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:18166:14"/>
haſtened other things the more. For the ſcoutes had brought word, that the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans would ſpend that night in ſolemne feaſting and banquetting. <hi>Cecina</hi> had charge to leade the way with a cohort lightly armed, and make plaine the paſſage of the wood; whom the legions immediately followed. The ſtarre-light helped them, till they came to the villages of the <hi>Marſies:</hi> whom they beſet round; being yet either a bed, or at table; without feare, and no watch ſet. So farre had they left all things at randon; nothing miſdoubting warre; nor, being drunke, greatly caring for peace. <hi>Caeſar</hi> deuided the legions greedy of pillage to waſte the more ground, into foure pointed battels; and deſtroyed with fire and ſword, fiftie miles; neither age nor ſexe, mouing him to pitie: profane and ſacred places, and the temple called Tanfana, a place of great fame among thoſe people, he battered to the ground: the Romanes receiuing no wound, but ſlaying the enemie halfe a ſleepe; or vnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and ſtragling without order or aray. That ſlaughter ſtirred vp the Bructeri, Tubantes, and the Vſipetes; who beſet the wood, that way the army ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne. Whereof the Captaine being aduertiſed, he marſhalled his men in order at once, both to march and fight. Part of the horſemen with auxiliary cohorts lead the way: after them followed the firſt legion: the cariages incloſed in the middeſt, had on the left ſide the 21. legion; on the right, the fift: in the rereward, the twentith; and after them the reſt of the confederates. But the enemie ſtirred not whileſt the Romane camp marched through the wood: then lightly skirmiſhing with the flanks and the formen; ſet amaine on the hindmoſt: who being but ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly appointed, and amazed with the thick troupes of Germans, were readie to ſhrinke: had not <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſtepped to the twentith legion; crying alowd, that now was the time to blot out the infamies of their former conſpiracies: and ſhew valoure; and make haſte to turne their former fault into glory and honor. This ſpeech ſo infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med their courages, that breking in ſuddainly vpon the enemies, droue them to an open place, and hewed them in peeces: and the vantgard getting out of the wood, began incontinently to fortifie and intrench. After that, they marched without diſturbance: emboldened with their late ſucceſſe, and forgetting what was paſt, were brought to their ſtanding camps. Theſe newes made <hi>Tiberius</hi> both glad and ſory: glad, that the ſedition was ſuppreſſed: ſory, that <hi>Germanicus</hi> had purchaſed the ſouldiers fauour by largeſſe, and timely diſmiſſing them: not alittle grieued alſo with the glory that <hi>Germanicus</hi> got in that warre. Yet he imparted theſe newes to the Senate, highly commending his exploites: rather in colour and ſhew of words, then beleeued that he ſpake from the hart. <hi>Druſus</hi> he commended alſo; and the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of the Illirian rebellions, in fewer words, but more vnfainedly, and with better affection; yet confirmed all that <hi>Germanicus</hi> had graunted; and gaue the like to the armies in Pannonie. The ſame yeare <hi>Iulia</hi> dyed: confined firſt by <hi>Augustus</hi> her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for her vnchaſt life, in the Iland Pandateria: then in Rhegium, a towne ſeated vpon the Sicilian ſea. She had beene <hi>Tiberius</hi> wife, whom ſhe contemned as an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit match for her; whileſt <hi>Caius</hi> and <hi>Lucius</hi> flouriſhed: which was the very inward and ſecret cauſe, why <hi>Tiberius</hi> withdrew himſelfe to Rhodes. But hauing gotten to be Emperour, and that by the death of <hi>Agrippa Poſthumus,</hi> her hopes were cut off; baniſhed and infamous, with great want hungerſtarued her: perſwading himſelfe that her long baniſhment, would haue ſmothered the ſpeech of her death.

wife: incenſing her to diſobedience and diſlike. Diuers ſuppoſing that the bitter letters, which ſhe ſent to <hi>Augustus</hi> her father againſt <hi>Tiberius,</hi> were of his inditing. Whereupon being baniſhed to Cercina, an Iland in the Affrican ſea, after foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yeares exile: the ſouldiers ſent to put him to death, found him on the ſhore as one expecting bad tidings. Of whom he requeſted ſome ſhort time, to write his laſt will to <hi>Alliaria</hi> his wife; which being done, he offered his neck to the executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: in the conſtancie of his death, not vnworthy the Sempronian name; though in his life he had degenerated. Some gaue out, that thoſe ſouldiers were not ſent from Rome, but from <hi>L. Aſprenas,</hi> Proconſull of Affrike, by <hi>Tiberius</hi> appointment; hoping though in vaine, that the infamie of the murder ſhould redound to <hi>Aſpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> diſcredit. This yeare were inſtituted new ceremonies, by founding a ſocietie of Prieſts, called Auguſtales: as in times paſt <hi>T.

One and twentie of the chiefeſt of the citie were drawne by lot, and <hi>Tiberius, Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, Claudius,</hi> and <hi>Germanicus</hi> added to the number. Theſe playes at their firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, were diſturbed by a contention riſing betwixt ſtage players: <hi>Augustus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe fauoring the ſport, to pleaſe <hi>Mecaenas;</hi> who was exceedingly caried away with affection towards <hi>Bathillus,</hi> and himſelfe not diſliking them, thought it no vnciuill matter, to ſhew himſelfe at thoſe diſports, amongſt the common people.

                  <hi>DRuſus Nero</hi> and <hi>C.

For a rumor bred a hope, that the enimies were banded into factions, ſome fauoring <hi>Arminius;</hi> and others <hi>Segestes:</hi> the one moſt loyall; and the other moſt diſloyall vnto vs. <hi>Arminius</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted Germanie: <hi>Segeſtes</hi> diſcouered often to <hi>Varus,</hi> but eſpecially in the laſt ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, after which armes were taken, a rebellion intended: and counſelled him to caſt himſelfe, <hi>Arminius</hi> and the chiefeſt of the conſpirators into priſon: the people not daring any attempt, the ringleaders being taken away; and that he ſhould haue time thereby to ſift out the offenders from the innocent. But <hi>Varus</hi> by deſtinie, and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius</hi> violence died. And although <hi>Segestes</hi> was by common conſent drawen to the war, yet he ſhewed himſelfe very backward by his priuate grudge againſt <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> increaſing more and more; bicauſe he had taken away by force his daughter betrothed to another. Thus then the ſonne in lawe being odious to the father: the fathers in lawe at vtter defiance betwixt themſelues; that which ſhould ſerue for a bond of friendſhip among friends, ſerued here for a prouocation of wrath and malice. Whereupon <hi>Germanicus</hi> committed fower legions to <hi>Cecinaes</hi> charge, fiue thouſand auxiliaries, and certaine Germain bands leuied in haſte, inhabiting the hither ſide of Rhene. Himſelfe conducted the like number of legions, with twiſe as many confederates: and hauing builded a fort on the hill Taunus, where his father before him had appointed a garriſon, led his armie without encombrance againſt

the Chatti; leauing <hi>L. Apronius</hi> behinde him, to mend and make ſure the paſſages by land and riuers: for by reaſon of a drought, and lowneſſe of the waters (a thing ſeldome ſeene in that countrie) they had marched a good way without danger; but feared raine and riſing of the water at his returne. But his comming was ſo ſudden vpon the Chatti; that the weaker ſort by age, or ſexe, were preſently either taken or ſlaine: the yoong men ſwam ouer the riuer Adrana, and draue backe the Romans, which began a bridge: But at laſt driuen away themſelues with ſhot of arrowes and other engins, entreating in vaine of conditions of peace: ſome fled to <hi>Germanicus:</hi> the reſt abandoning their villages and houſes, diſperſed themſelues in the woods. <hi>Germanicus</hi> hauing burned Mattium the capitall citie of the countrey, returned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Rhene: the enimie not daring to ſet on him as he retired, as his manner is, when he gaue grounde, rather vpon policie then feare. The Cheruſci woulde willingly haue ſuccoured the Chatti; but <hi>Caecinaes</hi> armie fleeting from place to place, kept them in awe: and ouerthrew the Marſi, which ventured to ioine battell with him. Shortly after embaſſadors came from <hi>Segeſtes,</hi> to craue aid againſt the violence of his countriemen, which had beſieged him: <hi>Arminius</hi> bearing grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſway, bicauſe he incited them to warre. For among barbarous people, the more audacious a man ſheweth himſelfe, the more loiall he is reputed; and the fitteſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in troubled times. <hi>Segestes</hi> ioined his ſonne <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> to theſe embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors; but being touched in conſcience, was vnwillingly drawn to it: bicauſe that when the Germans rebelled, being prieſted at the altar of the Vbians, he brake his head-bande, which was the marke of his calling, and fled to the rebels. Yet truſting in the Romans clemencie, fulfilled his fathers commandement; and being courteouſly, receiued was conueied with a garde, to the ſhores of Gallia. After this <hi>Germanicus</hi> thought it conuenient, to conuert his power againſt thoſe which beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Segestes,</hi> whom he deliuered, with a great number of his kindred, and followers. Among whom there were many noble dames, and <hi>Segestes</hi> daughter, <hi>Arminius</hi> wife; affecting rather hir husband than father; and being taken, not once falling a teare, nor crauing fauor, ioining hir hands on hir breaſt, looked down vpon hir great belly. The ſpoiles of <hi>Varus</hi> ouerthrowe were at the ſame time brought in and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed, as a bootie to the greateſt part of ſuch, as had yeelded themſelues with <hi>Segestes.</hi> Who with a comely maieſtie, and bolde courage, and loyaltie to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, began a ſpeech in this maner. <hi rend="margQuotes">This is not the firſt day that the people of Rome, hath had experience of my conſtancie and loyaltie: for ſince <hi>Augustus</hi> of famous memorie, gaue me the priuileges of a citizen of Rome; I made choiſe of ſuch friends or enimies, as might ſtand you in ſtead: not for any hatred to my countrie (for traitors are odious euen to thoſe whoſe inſtruments they be) but bicauſe I iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it profitable alike to the Romans and Germans: and preferred peace before war: for this cauſe I accuſed <hi>Arminius,</hi> rauiſher of my daughter, and infringer of the league concluded with you, before <hi>Varus</hi> the generall. But when I was by the ſlacknes of the generall deferred to a farther day of hearing, hauing ſmall hope of ſupport in lawes; I beſought him earneſtly, that he would commit me, <hi>Arminius,</hi> and the reſt of the conſpirators, to ſtraight cuſtodie. I call to witnes that night (which if it had pleaſed the gods I would it had been my laſt) in which thoſe things enſued, which deſerue rather to be bewailed, than maintained. In fine, I laide irons on <hi>Arminius,</hi> and ſuffered the ſame in my ſelfe, by his faction. But ſeeing you haue vouchſafed me your preſence; I prefer old quietnes before new garboiles; not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping for any reward thereby; but onely to excuſe my ſelfe from diſloyaltie, and to ſerue for a conuenient meanes of reconciliation for the German nation, if they will

And that the enſignes, which he had taken from the Romans, were to be ſeene in the woods of Germanie, offered vp in honour of their countrey gods. Let <hi>Segestes</hi> inhabite the conquered banks; and reſtore his ſonne to his prieſtlie dignitie: that the Germans coulde neuer excuſe it: that the Romans haue beene ſeene to beare their roddes, their axes, and gownes betweene Abbis and Rhene. Other nations being ſtrangers to the Romane gouernment, could ſpeak nothing, of their cruell puniſhments and grieuous tributes: and ſeeing they had ſhaken off thoſe burdens; and that, that <hi>Augustus</hi> whom they placed among the gods, and <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> choſen after him, loſt their labour; they ſhoulde not feare an vnexperien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced yoong man, nor his mutinous companie. If they preferred their countrey; their kindred; their auncient life, before newe lordes, and newe colonies; they ſhould rather follow <hi>Arminius,</hi> protector of their glory and libertie, then <hi>Segestes</hi> the author of reprochfull ſeruitude.</hi> Theſe ſpeeches incenſed not only the Cheruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, but the neighbors adioyning alſo; and drew <hi>Inguiomerus,</hi> a man once in credit with the Romans, and vncle to <hi>Arminius</hi> by the fathers ſide, to their partie, which increaſed <hi>Caeſars</hi> feare the more. And therefore leaſt the whole waight of the warre ſhould at once fall vpon him: he ſent <hi>Caecinna</hi> with fortie cohorts of Romanes, to ſeauet the power of the enemie through the Bructeries countrey, to the riuer of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſia. <hi>Pedo</hi> the Camp-maiſter had the conducting of the horſemen, by Friſia: him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe embarqued foure legions, and lead them through the lakes: all the horſemen, footemen, and the whole nauie meeting together at the ſaid riuer; and receiued the Chauceans among them, who had promiſed them ayde.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:18166:16"/>
thence the armie marched to the vtmoſt confines of the Bructeri, all the countrey waſted betwixt the riuer Amiſia, and Luppia: not farre from the foreſt Tentoburgh; where the reliques of the legions which <hi>Varus</hi> lead, were reported to lye vnburied. Whereupon <hi>Caeſar</hi> had a great deſire to celebrate the captaines, and ſouldiers fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals; all the armie moued to compaſſion: ſome calling to minde their kinsfolks; ſome their friends: and ſome in conſideration of the hazards of warre, and the ſlipperie eſtate of man ſubiect vnto fortunes change. And hauing ſent <hi>Caecina</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to ſearch out the ſecret places of the foreſt, and caſt bridges and cauſeyes ouer the moiſt and deceiptful paſſages of the bogs, they marched thoſe dolefull wayes, yrkſome to behold, and dreadfull to remember. <hi>Varus</hi> firſt encamping ſeate, by the large circuit of ground it contained, and dimenſions of the <note n="*" place="margin">Principia, the place in the camp where the ſtandard and enſignes are pitched. Sav. in mar. lib. 1. cap. 7.</note> Principia, did ſhew that the incloſure was capable of three legions: then by a rampire halfe broken downe, and a ſhallow trench, they perceiued where the ouertoyled remnant was retired. In the middle of the field lay white bones, either ſcattered, or on a heape, as they had eyther reſiſted or fled: hard by, trouncheons of weapons, and horſes ribs; and before them mens heads, faſtened vpon the bodies of trees. In the woods were their barbarous altars, on which they ſacrificed the Tribunes and chiefe Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Thoſe which eſcaped aliue, or broke priſon after the butchery, tould that here the Liutenants were ſlaine; there the ſtandards taken: where <hi>Varus</hi> receiued his firſt wound; where with his owne vnluckie hand he ſlew himſelfe. On what Tribunall <hi>Armin ius</hi> made his oration. How many gibbets he had ſet vp for captiues, and what ditches: and with what prowde diſdaine he skoffed at the enſignes and ſtandarts. The Romanes then which were preſent, ſixe yeares after the ſlaughter, oppreſſed with griefe, yet more then euer kindled with rage againſt the enemie; couered with earth the bones of the three legions: as if they had been all their friends or kindred; howbeit it was vncertaine whether they buried the ſtranger or friend. <hi>Caeſar</hi> to ſhew a gratefull memory of the dead, and himſelfe to be partaker of their griefe, with his owne hands put the firſt turfe on their tombes; which <hi>Tiberius</hi> miſliked: either as conſtruing all <hi>Germanicus</hi> actions to the worſt; or becauſe the ſight of the dead, vnburied, would make the ſouldiers more fearefull of the enemie, and leſſe forward to fight: and becauſe a Generall honored with the Augurall dignitie, and deuoted to moſt ancient ceremonies, ought not to meddle in mortuaries. But <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manicus</hi> purſuing <hi>Arminius,</hi> alreadie crept into inacceſſible places; as ſoone as he found conueniencie, thruſt his horſemen on him, and recouered the field which the enemie occupied. <hi>Arminius</hi> gathered his men together; and commaunding them to draw neere the wood, turned ſhort on the ſudden, and gaue them the watch-word which he had hidden there before, to breake out. Whereat the horſemen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, and the cohorts ſent for a ſupplie, borne backe with thoſe which fled; augmenting their feare, were almoſt thruſt into the bogs, well knowne to the conquerors, and dangerous to the Romanes; had not <hi>Caeſar</hi> come on with the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions in battell aray. Which ſtroke a terror into the enemie, and aſſured the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of the ſouldier: both the armies in the end parting on euen hand. Anon after the armie being brought to the riuer Amiſia, he conducted the fleete and the legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons back againe, in the ſame manner they came thither. Some of the horſemen were commaunded to returne to the riuer of Rhene, ſtill coaſting the Ocean ſhore. <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cina</hi> who conducted another companie, although he was skilfull in the wayes, yet was charged to returne with all diligence by the long bridges; which was a narrow cauſey betwixt wide mariſhes, throwne vp in times paſt by <hi>L. Domitius.</hi> The reſt of the countrey was miry, and full of faſt binding clay, with ſome doubtfull brookes.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:18166:17"/>
Round about were woods, aſcending little and little, which <hi>Arminius</hi> had filled, by a neerer way, and light armie, preuenting the Romans, loden with armour and carriages. <hi>Caecina</hi> doubting how he ſhould at once, repaire thoſe bridges, alreadie decayed with age, and driue back the enemie; thought it beſt to encamp in the ſame place; that whileſt ſome were fortifying, others might skirmiſh with the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie. The barbarians vſed all force to breake the wardes, and make way to the trench-makers: ſet on them, compaſſed them in; ranne from place to place; lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing nothing vndone, to diſturb them. The laborers and the fighters made one confuſe cry: nothing proſpering on the Romans ſide. The place was nothing but a deepe mire, not firme to tread on, and ſlipperie to march: the waight of their corſelets an hinderance, and they vnable to launce their iauelins in the waters. Contrarily the Cheruſcians being a great limmed people, and accuſtomed to fight in bogs, were with huge ſpeares able to hurt a farre off. To be briefe, the night deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the legions from an vnluckie battell. The Germaines through proſperous ſucceſſe, nothing wearied, but forbearing from reſt; turned all the waters which roſe in the mountaines, into the vnder grounds: whereupon the plaine being drownd, and ſo much of the worke ouerthrowne as they had caſt vp, the Romaine ſouldier was put to a double labour.</p>

For betwixt the hils and the marſhes, there ſtretched out a plaine, capable of a ſmall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. The legions were ſo placed, that the fift ſhoulde be in the right flancke; the one and twentieth in the left; the firſt to lead; and the twentieth to defende, if they were purſued. The night was vnquiet for diuers reſpects: the barbarous enimie, in feaſting and banketting, ſongs of ioie, and hideous outcries filled the valleies and woods, which redoubled the ſounde againe. The Romans had ſmall fires, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken voices, laie neere the trenches, went from tent to tent, rather diſquieted, and not able to ſleepe, then watchfull. The generall had that night a heauie dreame; which droue him into a feare: for he thought that he had ſeene <hi>Quinctilius Varus,</hi> riſing out of thoſe bogs, embrued all in bloud, calling him by name, and ſtretching out his hand towards him; which he thruſt backe refuſing to follow. At daie breaking, the legions appointed for the flankes, either for feare, or contempt, abandoned their ſtandings; and ſeaſed on the fielde adioining beyond the marſhes. <hi>Arminius</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee might ſafely haue, aſſaulted them, yet forbare a time. But he no ſooner perceiued their bag and baggage to ſticke in the mire, and ditches, and the ſouldiers troubled about it, disbanded and out of order, and the enſignes confuſedly diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; as it falleth out in ſuch times, euery man buſie to helpe himſelfe, and deafe to harken what was commanded; but he encharged the Germaines to breake in, cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng aloud. Behold <hi>Varus,</hi> and the legions once againe vanquiſhed by the ſame deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. Hauing thus ſaide, accompanied with a choiſe band of horſemen, breaketh the rankes of the Romans, and eſpecially woundeth their horſes: which ſlipping, by reaſon of their owne bloud, and moiſture of the bogs; ouerthrowing their maſters,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18166:17"/>
either trode vnderfeete, or ſcattered all they met. Much a doo they had about the enſignes, which they could neither beare vp, the ſhot came ſo thicke: nor pitch on the ground, it was ſo mirie. Whileſt <hi>Caecina</hi> maintaineth battell, his horſe was kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnder him; from which being fallen, he had been taken by the enimie, if the firſt legion had not oppoſed herſelfe. The greedines of the enimie was ſome helpe vnto them; being more thirſtie of pillage then bloud: whereby the legions had leiſure to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the euening, to win the open firme land. And yet their miſeries did not thus end: They had defences to make: and ſtuffe wherewithall, to ſeeke: their tooles to caſt vp earth, or cut turfes, were almoſt all loſt: tentes they had none to couer them: nor medicaments to heale the wounded: and diuiding their meate partly ſtained with bloud, or beraied with dirt, they bewailed that vnfortunate darknes; and that onely daie left for ſo many thouſands to liue. By meere chance a horſe brake looſe in the campe, and praunſing vp and downe, affrighted with noiſe, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw all he met in his waie: which ſtroake ſuch a feare and terror in the ſouldiers harts, that thinking the Germans had broken vpon them; ran all to the gates of the campe, and eſpecially to the Decumana, which was fartheſt from the enimie, and ſafeſt to flee awaie. <hi>Caecina</hi> being aſſured that it was but a vaine feare, yet not being able either by his authoritie, entreatie, or forcible meanes to ſtaie their fleeing; caſt himſelfe a croſſe the gate; and ſo mooued them to pitie, ſtopping the paſſage; bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not tread on their captaines bodie. The Tribunes and Centurions ſhewed them withall, that their ſeare was falſe and without cauſe. Then aſſembling them in the Principia, and commanding ſilence, admoniſhed them of the time and neceſſitie they ſtoode in. <hi rend="margQuotes">That their ſafetie onely conſiſted in their weapons; which yet they were to moderate by diſcretion: keeping ſtill within their trench, vntill the enimie, with hope to breake vpon them, ſhould drawe neere: and that then they ſhoulde ruſh out on euerie ſide, and ſo get to the riuer of Rhene. Whereas if they ſhould flie, they ſhould paſſe through more woods, finde deeper bogs, and the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie more cruell then euer: but by conquering they ſhoulde purchaſe glorie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowme: putting them in mind of thoſe things which were eſteemed deere at home, and of credit in campe: not once mentioning their diſgraces and aduerſities.</hi> This done, he aſſigned to the moſt couragious a horſe: beginning with his owne; then with the Tribunes and Centurions, not reſpecting calling or quality: to the end that they ſhould firſt inuade the enimie, and the footemen follow. The Germains, what with hope, what with greedines of praie, what with diſgreeing opinions of captaines; were as much diſquieted as the Romaines. <hi>Arminius</hi> thought it beſt to ſuffer them come out of their fort, and ſet on them in the bogs and marſhes: but <hi>Inguiomerus</hi> aduiſe, though more cruell, was moſt pleaſing to the barbarians: which was, that they ſhould beſiege the campe: perſwading that by that means, the aſſault would be eaſier; more captiues taken; and the bootie entire and vntouched. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoone then as it was day, they beate down the trenches, filled them vp with hurdles, grappled vp to the toppe of the trench, fewe ſouldiers reſiſting them, and thoſe all ſtocke ſtill in amaze. The cohorts within had the alarum giuen; the cornets and trumpets ſounded; and with a great clamour ſallied out couragiouſlie, and hemmed the enimie in: caſting in their teeth, that heere there were neither woods nor quag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miers, but the places and the gods indifferent to both. The enimies imagining it but an eaſie conqueſt, and that there were but a fewe to reſiſt, and thoſe but halfe armed; hearing the ſound of the trumpets, and ſeeing the glittering of the armour; which ſeemed ſo much the greater, by how much the leſſe they were eſteemed: on a ſudden were beaten downe and ſlaine, as men in proſperitie greedy, and in aduerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,

vncircumſpect. <hi>Arminius</hi> and <hi>Inguiomerus</hi> fled, th'one not hurt, and the other greeuouſly wounded. The common ſort were ſlaine as long as the daie and anger laſted: the legions returned at night to their forte.

                  <hi>XV.</hi> The danger the legions vvere in vnder <hi>Vitellius. Tiberius</hi> renevveth the lavv of treaſon.</head>
               <p>IT was noiſed abroad in the meane ſeaſon, that the legions were beſieged; and that the Germaine hoſt was entering Gallia. And if <hi>Agrippina</hi> had not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the pulling downe of the bridge ouer Rhene; ſome through feare would haue ventured ſo lewde an action. Who being a woman of a great courage, tooke vpon hir for ſome daies the office of a Captaine: relieued the ſoldiers, as they had moſt need, with apparell and medicine. <hi>C. Plinius</hi> a writer of the Germaine warres, recounteth; <hi rend="margQuotes">that ſhe went to the ende of the bridge and there ſtaied, praiſing and thanking the legions as they returned. A matter which entered deepely into Tiberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us minde: imagining with himſelfe that it was not for nought, that ſhe vſed ſuch care and curteſie: that ſhe ſought not the fauour of the ſoldier againſt the ſtranger. That there was nothing left for the Emperors to do, if a woman tooke once vpon hir to viſit the bands, go to the enſignes; and ſeeke meanes to corrupt the ſoldier? As though it had beene but a ſmall point of ambition, to carrie her ſonne about the campe in the attire of a common ſoldier, and call him <hi>Caeſar Caligula.</hi> That <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pina</hi> was now of greater credite with the armie, than the Lieutenants and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines; and that a woman had ſuppreſſed a ſedition, which <hi>Caeſars</hi> name and power could not do.</hi> All this was aggrauated by <hi>Seianus,</hi> well acquainted with <hi>Tiberius</hi> humour; and who had long before ſowen ſeedes of hatred: which for the time he ſmoothered, bicauſe they ſhould burſt out the greater in the end. But <hi>Germanicus</hi> gaue <hi>P. Vitellius</hi> charge of the ſecond &amp; fowerteenth legion, which he had brought by ſea, to conduct by land: to the ende the ſhippes might in the lowe water ſaile more eaſilie, or in the ebbing lie a ground more lightly. <hi>Vitellius</hi> had a quiet begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his iourney, a drie ſhore, and ſmall flote: but by and by through a gale of northren winde, the aequinoxe falling out the ſame time, and the ſea ſwelling ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily; his armie was toſſed hither and thither: the face of the earth was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with waters, the ſea, the ſhore, the fields, were all but one. The vncertaine ſands coulde not be diſcerned from firme lande: nor the ſhelues from the deepe ſeas: their horſes and cariages were drawen vnder water, and ſwallowed in the gulfes: dead bodies flotted and met one another: the ſoldiers diſorderly mingled, now breaſt, now chin high in water; and ſometimes looſing footing, either drowned or ſcattered. Encouragments tooke no place: &amp; being thus toſſed with waues, the valiant man was not diſtinguiſhed from the coward: the wiſe not knowen from the foole; nor no difference betwixt counſell and chance; but all wrapped vp in like vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. In the end <hi>Vitellius</hi> hauing gotten the higher ground, brought the reſt of his companie thither, where they paſſed all that night without vtenſiles, or fire: the greateſt part either naked, or moiled, in no leſſe miſerable a taking, then the beſiged by the enimie: for the end of thoſe is glorious, and the death of theſe without ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. The day ſhewed them land, and they paſſed to the riuer Viſurgis, where <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> was arriued with the whole fleet: into which he receiued the legions, repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18166:18"/>
to haue beene drowned, and neuer beleeued to be aliue, vntill they ſawe <hi>Caeſar</hi> and the armie returned. Now <hi>Stertinius</hi> ſent before to receiue <hi>Segeſtes</hi> brother <hi>Segimerus,</hi> who had yeelded himſelfe; brought him and his ſonne to Colen; and both pardoned; though <hi>Segimerus</hi> eaſlier then his ſonne: becauſe it was layd to his charge, that he had skoffed at <hi>Quinctilius Varus</hi> body. But to ſupplie theſe loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which the armie had ſuſtained; Gallia, Spaine, and Italie, ſtroue who ſhould furniſh moſt; offering armour, horſes, gold, and ſuch things as they had moſt in a readineſſe. <hi>Germanicus</hi> commending their loue and affection, accepted only their armour and horſes, and furniſhed the reſt with his owne charges. And to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and mitigate the remembrance of their ouerthrow, with ſome courteous vſage; he went about to viſite the wounded: praiſing in particular euery ones va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantnes, and looking on their wounds; fed one with hope, and an other with praiſe: woon all by good words, and care, and made them conſtant to himſelfe, and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute to fight. The ſame yeare by decree of Senate, the markes of triumph were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for <hi>A. Caecina, L. Apronius, C. Silius,</hi> for their noble exploites atchieued vnder <hi>Germanicus.</hi> And <hi>Tiberius</hi> refuſed the Title, of father of his countrey, which the people had often caſt vpon him. Nor would not ſuffer any to ſweare, to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of his ordinances, although the Senate were thereto conſenting: affirming, that all mortall things were mutable and vncertaine; and the higher he ſhould clime, the ſlipperer his eſtate ſhould be. Notwithſtanding all this, they could not be perſwaded that he meant well to the citizens; becauſe he had put on foote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the law of treaſon, knowen to the ancients by the ſame name. But by vertue of that law other things were brought into queſtion: as if any had betrayed the armie; ſtirred the people to ſedition: badly managed the affaires of the common-wealth: impaired and weakened the maieſtie of the people of Rome. But then deedes only were puniſhed, words went ſcotfree. <hi>Augustus</hi> was the firſt, who vnder colour of this law, comprehended the examination of infamous libels: moued thereto by the inſolent behauiour of <hi>Caſsius Seuerus,</hi> who had defamed honorable perſons, both men and women, with ſcandalous writings. <hi>Tiberius</hi> alſo, when <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peius Macro</hi> the Pretor asked whether iudgement ſhould be giuen, touching the ſaid crime, made anſwere; that the lawes were to be obſerued. <hi>Tiberius</hi> was the more exaſperated, through certaine verſes caſt abroad by an vncertaine author, againſt his crueltie, pride, and diſagreeing with his mother. It ſhall not be amiſſe, if I rehearſe, with what pretended crimes, <hi>Falanius</hi> and <hi>Rubrius,</hi> both meane Gentlemen of Rome were charged: to make it knowne by what beginnings, what ſleights of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> an vtter ruine of the common-wealth was intended, then ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; afterward reuiued againe, and in the end, ouermaſtered all. <hi>Falanius</hi> accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer obiected againſt him, that amongſt other worſhippers of <hi>Augustus</hi> (for ſuch fellowſhips there were almoſt in euery houſe as it had beene Colleges) he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued one <hi>Caſsius</hi> a ſtage-player, and infamous of his bodie: and that with his gardens he had ſould <hi>Augustus</hi> image. <hi>Rubrius</hi> was accuſed to haue violated an oath made in <hi>Augustus</hi> name. When theſe things were brought to <hi>Tiberius</hi> notice, he anſwered: <hi rend="margQuotes">That his father had not a place aſſigned him in heauen by decree of Senate, becauſe that honor ſhould be conuerted to the ouerthrow of the citizens. That <hi>Caſsius</hi> the ſtage-player, was wont to be admitted with others of the ſame trade, to the playes which his mother had conſecrated to <hi>Augustus</hi> memorie. That there was nothing done againſt religion, if his image was ſould, as the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfets of other gods were, in the ſale of their gardens and houſes. And as for <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brius</hi> oath, it was to be held in the ſame accompt, as if he had deceiued <hi>Iupiter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:

               <head>XVI. An accuſation againſt <hi>Granius Marcellus,</hi> Orders againſt ſuing for dignities.</head>
               <p>NOt long after, <hi>Granius Marcellus</hi> Pretor of Bithynia, was accuſed of treaſon by <hi>Caepio Criſpinus</hi> his Quaeſtor: <hi>Romanus Hiſpo</hi> ſubſcribed thereto: who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into a courſe of life, which the calamities of times, and mens boldnes made famous. For being needie, obſcure, and a buſie companion, by ſecret informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he ſo crept into the cruell humor of the Prince, that he was able in ſhort time to endanger the eſtate of the beſt in the citie: thereby getting credit and authoritie with one, and hatred of many. He gaue an example, which many following, of beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers became rich, of baſe and contemptible perſons, feared; procuring deſtruction to others, and in the end to themſelues. He accuſed <hi>Marcellus</hi> to haue vttered bad ſpeeches againſt <hi>Tiberius:</hi> which was an accuſation ineuitable; becauſe that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing choſen out the greateſt blemiſhes of <hi>Tiberius</hi> life and manners, becauſe they were true; were beleeued. <hi>Hiſpo</hi> added, that <hi>Marcellus</hi> image was placed higher then thoſe of the <hi>Caeſars;</hi> and that the head of another of <hi>Augustus</hi> being cut off, <hi>Tiberius</hi> image was put vpon it: which ſo incenſed him, that breaking ſilence, he cried out that he would himſelfe, and that ſworne, giue open ſentence in that cauſe: to the end the reſt ſhould be inforced to do as he had done; for as yet there were ſome marks of dying libertie left in the Senate. Then ſaid <hi>C. Piſo.</hi> What place wilt thou take <hi>Caeſar</hi> to deliuer thy cenſure? If thou wilt ſpeake firſt, I ſhall haue a preſident to follow: if laſt, I feare I ſhall ſwarue from thee vncircumſpectly. Aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with this, the hotter vnaduiſedly he had growne, the more repenting; he ſuffered the arraigned of treaſon to be quit. As concerning the extorſions, the cauſe was put ouer to the delegates. And not contented with the iudgements of the Senators, he aſſiſted in the hearing of cauſes himſelfe, and ſate in the end of the Tribunal, leaſt he ſhould put the Pretor out of his chaire. Many orders were giuen in his preſence againſt canuaſing for offices, and noblemens ſuites: but whileſt he laboured for iuſtice, libertie went to wracke. Whileſt theſe things were adoing, <hi>Pius Aurelius</hi> a Senator, complained that his houſe was decayed and growne to ruine, by the rayſing vp of a publick way, and conueyance of water: and craued aide of the Lords of the Senate in that behalfe. And where the Treaſurers oppoſed themſelues againſt it, he was relieued by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who payed him the value of his houſe: deſirous to employ his money in honeſt actions: which vertue he long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained after he had ſhaken off al others. He beſtowed <note n="*" place="margin">About 7. thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twelue pounds ten ſhillings.</note> ten hundred thouſand ſeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Propertius Celer,</hi> once Pretor, and now crauing licence to giue vp his roome, by reaſon of the pouertie his father left him in; and commanded others which made the ſame ſute, to make it knowen to the Senate, that their petition was true: deſirons to be accounted ſeuere in things well done: which cauſed others rather to indure their pouertie with ſilence, then by acknowledging it, receiue a benefit at his hands. The ſame yeere, through continuall raines the riuer Tibris roſe ſo high, that it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered all the flat places of the citie; and in falling, there inſued a great ruine of men and buildings. Whereupon a remedie being conſulted of in Senate, <hi>Aſinius Gallus</hi> was of opinion, that the bookes of the Sybils ſhould be ſearched: which <hi>Tiberius</hi> hindered; as one who would hide from them, as well things diuine as humane. But he committed that charge vnto <hi>Ateius Capito,</hi> and L. <hi>Arruntius.</hi> Achaia and Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:18166:19"/>
complaining of their heauie taxations: it was agreed in Senate, that they ſhould no longer be gouerned by a proconſull, but by <hi>Caeſar. Druſus</hi> being made ouerſeer of a play of fencers, ſet foorth in his owne and his brother <hi>Germanicus</hi> name; becauſe he ſeemed to take ouer great pleaſure in ſhedding of blood; ſtroake a feare into the peoples minds, and as it is reported, was diſliked of his father. Why <hi>Tiberius</hi> forbare to ſee this ſpectacle, it was diuerſly conſtrued: ſome thought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he loathed to be in great aſſemblies: ſome becauſe he was of a melancholy ſad diſpoſition: and alſo miſdoubting leaſt ſome ſhould fall into compariſon, betwixt him and <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> who was woont to be preſent at ſuch plaies with courteous and milde cariage. I cannot thinke that his meaning was, to giue his ſonne occaſion to ſhew his crueltie, and mooue the people to offence; although ſome haue ſo repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The licentiouſnes begun in the Theator the laſt yeere, grew now to a farther outrage: many not onely of the common people ſlaine; but ſoldiers and Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and a Captaine of the guarde, whileſt they went about to bridle the inſolencie of the people, and hinder them from vſing lauiſhing ſpeeches againſt magiſtrates. That ſedition was debated in Senate: many being of opinion that it it was conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, that the Pretor ſhould haue authoritie to whip the ſtage-plaiers. But <hi>Hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Agrippa</hi> Tribune of the people contradicted him: whom <hi>Aſinius Gallus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked in an oration: <hi>Tiberius</hi> holding his peace; ſuffering the Senate to vſe that ſhadow of libertie. Yet <hi>Haterius</hi> preuailed, bicauſe <hi>Auguſtus</hi> had once declared the ſtage-plaiers to be free from ſtripes: and therefore not lawfull for <hi>Tiberius</hi> to infringe it. Many orders were layd downe touching the moderation and charges beſtowed vpon plaies: and againſt the inſolent behauiour of their fauourers; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the chiefeſt are theſe. That no Senator ſhould enter into a plaiers houſe: that the gentlemen of Rome ſhould not accompanie them in publike places: that it was not lawfull to ſee their plaies but on the Theater. And that the Pretor ſhould haue authoritie to baniſh ſuch lookers on, as behaued themſelues diſorderly. The Spaniards had licence graunted them, at their requeſt, to erect a Temple in honour of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> in the free towne of Tarracon; which was a preſident for all the other prouinces to follow. The people making ſupplication, that they might be vnburde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the impoſition of one in the hundred of all things bought and ſold, which began after the wars were begun: <hi>Tiberius</hi> anſwered by an edict that it was the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtay of ſouldiers wages: and that the ſtate would be ouercharged if the olde ſoldiers ſhould not be diſmiſſed after twentie yeeres ſeruice: and by this meanes, the order wrunge out to appeaſe the ſoldiers, that the ſoldiers ſhoulde be diſmiſſed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſixteene yeeres ſeruice, was abrogated. After this it was propounded in Senate by <hi>Arruntius</hi> and <hi>Ateius,</hi> whether for the repreſſing of the inundations of Tiber, it were conuenient to diuert the courſe of the riuers and lakes, which were cauſe of his riſing. Vpon this occaſion, the ambaſſadors of other free townes and colonies were heard: and eſpecially the deputies from the citie of Florence; requeſting that Clanis might not be turned out of his owne chanell into Arne, as a matter greatly to their hurt. The like ſpeech the Interamnates vſed, ſhewing that the fertileſt tract of Italie ſhould be loſt, if (as it was intended) the riuer Nar ſhould be cut into manie branches; and ſo all become a ſtanding poole, if the new chanels were not capable of ſo much water. The Reatins did not in this caſe hold their peace: no way yeelding that the mouth of the lake Velinus ſhould be dammed vp, where it diſcargeth it ſelf into Nar: for ſo it would ouerflow al about it. And that nature had wel prouided for the neceſſitie of mans vſe: hauing giuen all riuers, their courſe and mouth, and as well their bounds, as beginnings. That the religion of their allies was to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18166:20"/>
who conſecrated vnto the riuers of their countrey, woods and altars. Yea that Tiber would not be depriued of his neighbour-riuers, and ſo run his courſe with leſſer glory. In the end either through the intreatie of the Colonies, or difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the worke, or ſuperſtition, <hi>Piſoes</hi> opinion was approued, which was, that there ſhould be nothing changed. <hi>Poppaeus Sabinus</hi> was continued in the gouernment of <hi>Maeſia,</hi> and Achaia and Macedonia added to his charge. For it was <hi>Tiberius</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to continue men in their office and charge, either of warre, or iuriſdiction, ſometimes during their life; whereof there were diuers reaſons giuen. Some ſaid he did it, to auoid the tedious care of often prouiding; and that he would haue that to continue which he had thought once well done: ſome did interpret it to be done of enuie, becauſe many ſhould not enioy them: ſome, that as he was of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile wit, ſo of no reſolute iudgement; as not chooſing men of excellent vertue: and on the other ſide, hating vices. He feared leaſt the beſt would attempt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what againſt him, and the worſt diſhonor the ſtate. Which doubtfulnes brought him to that paſſe at laſt, that he gaue the gouernment of prouinces to ſome, which he would not ſuffer to depart the citie. Concerning the election of Conſuls, which was firſt obſerued vnder this Prince, and afterward by others, I dare aſſure nothing: not only the authors, but the Prince himſelfe doth ſo much differ in his orations. For ſometimes not naming the ſuters, he deſcribed euery mans beginning, life, and what pay he had receiued; that a man might eaſily geſſe who they were. At ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, not touching any of thoſe particulars, he perſwaded the ſuters, not to diſturbe the elections, by bribing and canuaſing: promiſing that himſelfe would be a meane for them. And oftentimes he ſayd, there were no more which pretended to be ſuters, but ſuch only, whoſe names he had preſented vnto the Conſuls: and that others might bring in their names likewiſe, if they would truſt either to their merit or fauor. But all was but faire words, and in deede deceiptfull and without ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: and by how much the more they were masked with a colour of libertie, by ſo much the heauier and greeuouſer a ſeruitude they were like to bring after them.</p>

After the death of <hi>Phrahates,</hi> and other ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Kings, through murthers committed among themſelues: Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors came to the citie, from the chiefe noble men of Parthia, to demaunde <hi>Vonones</hi> the eldeſt ſonne of <hi>Phrahates. Caeſar</hi> thinking that to be an honor to himſelfe, enduing him with great riches deliuered him: and the barbarians, as their maner is at the change of a new Prince, receiued him with great ioy. Not long after the Parthian grew to be aſhamed, that he had ſo much degenerated, as to demaund a Prince from another countrey; trained vp in the ſleights of their eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. That now the royall ſeate of the Arſacides was giuen and accounted among the Romane prouinces. Where is the glorie of thoſe which murdered <hi>Craſſus,</hi> and chaſed away <hi>Antonie;</hi> if <hi>Caeſars</hi> bond ſlaue after ſo many yeeres ſeruitude ſhould commaund and rule ouer the Parthians? He himſelfe kindled their difdainefull minds, by ſwaruing from his predeceſſors manner of life; as going ſeldome a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; being careleſſe of horſes; carried in a charriot in the ſtreetes; and loathing their countrey fare: his Grecian followers were ſcorned, and himſelfe laughed at, for keeping vnder his ſeale his baſeſt vtenſiles. But the free acceſſe vnto him, his courteſie towards all men; vnknowen vertues to the Parthians; were accounted new vices: and bicauſe they were not vſed of their anceſtors, were odious alike to the good and bad. Whereupon <hi>Artabanus,</hi> one of the Arſacides blood, brought vp with the Dahes, was raiſed againſt him: who in the firſt encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ouerthrowen, recouered newe forces, and enioyed the kingdome.

Yet <hi>Tigranes</hi> raigne dured but a ſhort time, nor his childrens: although they were, as the maner of ſtrangers is, linked in marriage with the Armenians.

                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:18166:21"/>
was appointed their King, and afterward driuen out: not without a great ſlaughter of our men. After that <hi>Caeſar</hi> was choſen to ſettle the affaires of Armenia; who with the good liking of the Armenians, appointed <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> deſcended from the <hi>Medes,</hi> to be their King: a man greatly reckoned of for the comelines of his perſonage, and valiant courage. <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> dying by misfortune, the Armeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans would endure none of his race: but tried the regiment of a woman called <hi>Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> whom they expulſed in a ſhort time: and lead an vncertaine and looſe kinde of life, rather without a Lord, then in libertie: and in the ende receiued the fugitiue <hi>Vonones</hi> againe. But when <hi>Artabanus</hi> began to vſe threatning; and that ſmall aide was to be expected of the Armenians: and yet if he ſhould be defended by our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; it were to enter into war againſt the Parthians: <hi>Creticus Silanus</hi> gouernour of Syria ſent for <hi>Vonones:</hi> and appointed him a guarde: and ſuffered him to inioy all pompe and ſumptuouſnes, and name of a King: from which mockerie how he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to deliuer himſelfe, we will ſet downe in his place.</p>

               <p>BVt it diſpleaſed <hi>Tiberius</hi> nothing at all, that the Eaſt parts were in an vprore; bicauſe that vnder that pretext he might draw <hi>Germanicus</hi> from his accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med legions, and by giuing him charge ouer new prouinces, expoſe him to trecherie and hazard. But he, by how much the more affectionate the ſouldiers were towards him, and his vnkle backward; by ſo much the more earneſt he was to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten the victory; and laide all the plots he could to giue the enimie battell: Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing with himſelfe, what fortunate or vnfortunate ſucceſſes had happened vnto him thoſe three yeeres paſt, which he had ſpent in war amongſt them: that the Germans in a pitched field and indifferent places would eaſily be vanquiſhed: that they tooke aduantage of woods, bogs, ſhort ſommers, and timely winters: that his ſouldiers receiued not ſo great hurt by wounds, as by long iourneies and waight of their armor: that Gallia was wearied with furniſhing horſes: the long traine of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was ſubiect to ambuſhes; and not eaſily defended. But if he ſhould take ſea, the poſſeſſion was open for him, and vnknowen to the enimie. Withall, that ſo the war might be ſooner begun: the legions and victuals brought togither: the horſes and horſemen conueied by channels and mouthes of riuers into the hart of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie. Hauing thus reſolued, he ſent <hi>P. Vitellius,</hi> and <hi>Scantius</hi> to leuie the ſubſidies of Gallia: <hi>Silius Anteius,</hi> &amp; <hi>Caecina</hi> had charge of all preparation by ſea. A thouſand ſhips were thought to ſuffice: which were made ready with ſpeed. Some were ſhort, and narrow at the fore &amp; hinder part, &amp; broad in the middle, as ſtronger againſt the waues. Some were flat bottommed, to land without danger. Many had rudders at both ends, that the rowers altering their ſtroke on a ſudden; might driue to land at either end. Many of them had bridges ouer, to carrie both their engins, horſes, and prouiſion: ſwift of ſaile, and nimble with oares; in ſhew gallant and fearefull to the enimie, by reaſon of the ſoldiers cheerfulnes. The place appointed to meete at, was the Iland of the Batauians, as a place of eaſie arriuall; and fit to receine the armie: and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence to tranſport them to the place of battell. For the riuer of Rhene kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping one chanell, or elſe enuironing but fewe Ilands, at the entering of Batauia, is diuided into two riuers, and keepeth his name and ſwiftnes through Germanie vntill he fall into the Ocean.

Whileſt the ſhips were a putting from ſhoare: <hi>Caeſar</hi> commandeth the Lieutenant <hi>Silius,</hi> with a bande of men lightly appointed, ſuddenly to inuade the Chatti. And himſelfe vnderſtanding that the fort of Lup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia vpon the riuers ſide, was beſieged, conducteth thither ſixe legions. <hi>Silius</hi> by reaſon of ſudden raines, did little elſe then bring away, ſome ſmall bootie, and the wife and daughter of <hi>Arpas,</hi> prince of the Chatti. Neither did thoſe which had beſieged the forte, ſtaie to fight; but ſlipt away, when <hi>Caeſars</hi> comming was noiſed. Yet they had throwne downe the tumbe, lately built in honor of <hi>Varus</hi> legions, and the old altar erected for <hi>Druſus.</hi> The altar, the Prince reedified; and in memorie of his father, he and the legions ran a horſe race; but thought it not conuenient to ſet vp the tumb againe: but fortified all paſſages betwixt the fort, Aliſo, and Rhene, with new mounds and bulwarks. By this time the Fleete was come: and hauing ſent before all prouiſion, and aſſigned the legions and confederates their ſhipping; him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe entered the ditch, called the Druſian ditch, where he made a prayer to <hi>Druſus</hi> his father, that hauing vndertaken the ſame enterpriſe, that he had done; he would willingly and benignly further him, with the example and memorie of his counſels and exploites. From thence he ſailed proſperouſly, by the lakes and Ocean, vntill he came to the riuer Amiſia, where the nauie was left, leauing the riuer on the left ſide of it. Wherein there was an ouerſight, that they brought the ſhipping no higher, the ſouldiers being afterward conſtrained to land on the right ſide: whereby many dayes were ſpent in making of bridges to paſſe them ouer.

               <p>AS <hi>Caeſar</hi> was planting his camp, word was brought, that the Angriuarians were reuolted behinde him. And <hi>Stertinius</hi> was incontinently diſpatched away with a companie of light horſemen, which reuenged their treaſon with fire and ſword. Betwixt the Romaines and the Cheruſcians ran the riuer Viſurgis, and on the banke ſide was <hi>Arminius,</hi> with the reſt of the nobilitie: who inquiring whether <hi>Caeſar</hi> were come; and anſwere giuen him that he was: intreated that he might haue licence to ſpeake with his brother <hi>Flauius,</hi> who was in the camp: faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and truſtie to the Romaines: and who not many yeares before, had loſt one of his eyes, vnder <hi>Tiberius.</hi> His requeſt was graunted him: and as <hi>Flauius</hi> came neere, <hi>Arminius</hi> ſaluted him. And cauſing his followers to withdraw themſelues, reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted that our archers which were placed in order on the banke ſide, ſhould ſtand farther off; who being gone away, he asked his brother how he came to that ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh in his face. He named both the place and the battell. He asked him further, what rewards he had receiued? <hi>Flauius</hi> telleth him that his pay was augmented, ſheweth his chaine, his crowne, and other military gifts: which <hi>Arminius</hi> skorned as baſe rewards of ſeruitude. After that, they grew to farther communication, the one extolling the greatnes of the Romans: <hi>Caeſars</hi> wealth: the grieuous puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inflicted on the conquered: and the clemencie vſed to ſuch as yeelded: that neither his wife nor ſonne were intreated as enemies. <hi>Arminius</hi> alleaged the dutie of his countrey: their auncient libertie: the gods of the inward parts of Germanie:
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:18166:22"/>
that his mother and himſelfe beſought him; that he would not rather chooſe to be a traitor and forſaker of his countrey, then a captaine of his kindred, allies and nation. Growing from thence by little and little to hard words, although the riuer was betwixt them, they had coped; if <hi>Stertinius</hi> had not run in, and held backe <hi>Flauius,</hi> full of anger, calling for his armour and horſe. <hi>Arminius</hi> was heard to threaten on the other ſide, and denounce battell: intermingling ſome latine words: for once he commaunded his countriemen; and receiued pay in the Romaine campes. The next day, the German armie preſented it ſelfe in battell aray beyond Viſurgis. <hi>Germanicus</hi> not thinking it the part of a commaunder, to hazard the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, not hauing firſt made bridges, and appointed gards to defend them, paſſed ouer the horſemen at the foord. <hi>Stertinius</hi> and <hi>Aemilius,</hi> ſometime captaine of the principall enſigne, were the leaders: who ſeperated themſelues farre one from the other, to deuide the enemies forces. <hi>Carioualda,</hi> Captaine of the Batauians, where the riuer was ſwifteſt ſallied out: the Cheruſci making as though they fled, tolled them to a plaine, enuironed with woods: and there turning againe, and ſpreading abroad, droue back thoſe which made head; hotly purſued thoſe which ſhrunke: then being gathered round in a ring, ouerthrew them; ſome neere, ſome farre off. <hi>Carioualda</hi> hauing long ſuſtained the brunt of the enemie; exhorted his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers cloſely together, to breake into the enemie troupes: himſelfe venturing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the thickeſt, was beaten downe with darts; and his horſe killed vnder him, and many noble men about him. The reſt either through their owne valour, or aide of the horſemen, with <hi>Stertinius</hi> and <hi>Aemilius,</hi> eſcaped danger. When <hi>Caeſar</hi> had paſſed the riuer Viſurgis, he vnderſtoode by a fugitiue from the enemie campe, what place <hi>Arminius</hi> had choſen to giue battell: and that other nations were aſſembled in a wood conſecrated to <hi>Hercules,</hi> with intention to aſſaile the camp by night. The runnagate was beleeued: lights were ſeene: and the eſpiales getting nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, reported they heard a great confuſe noiſe of men and horſes. Being therefore at a iumpe to hazard all, thinking it conuenient to founde the ſouldiers minde, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought himſelfe what was the fitteſt expedient to trie the truth. The Tribunes and Centurions brought him oftener, pleaſing then true newes: the freed men were of a ſeruile diſpoſition: in friends therewas flatterie: if he ſhould call an aſſembly, that which a few ſhould begin, the reſt would applaude. That their minds would be beſt knowen, when they were by themſelues; not ouerlooked: in eating and drinking they would vtter their feare or hope. As ſoone as it was night, going out at the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gural gate, accompanied with one alone, in ſecret and vnknowen places to the watch: caſting a ſauage beaſts skin on his backe, he went from one place to another: ſtoode liſtning at the tents: and ioyeth in the praiſe of himſelfe: ſome extolling the nobilitie of their Captaine; others his comely perſonage: many his patience, and courteſie: that in ſports and ſerious matters, he was ſtill one man: confeſſing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they thought it their parts, to make him ſome requitall in this battell, and ſacrifice the traitors and peace-breakers to reuenge and glory.</p>

once come to ioine battell with them: ſaying, that they would take poſſeſſion of the Germans lands, and bring away their wiues by force. They accepted of their words as a preſage, and vowed they would haue their wiues and money for a bootie. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the third watch the enimie aſſailed the campe, but threw no dart: bicauſe he perceiued many in a readines to defend their fortes: and no man remiſſe in his charge. The ſame night <hi>Germanicus</hi> in a pleaſant dreame, thought he had beene offering of ſacrifice, and that his pretext or robes of his infancie, had beene ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled with holy blood, and that he receiued another at the hands of <hi>Auguſta</hi> his grandmother. Emboldned with that dreame, and the Augures foretelling lucky ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, concurring with it: he called the ſoldiers to an aſſembly: and declared vnto them what things by wiſedome he had foreſeene: and what he thought expedient for the imminent danger of the battell. <hi rend="margQuotes">That not onely the open fields were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious for the Romans to fight in, but the woods alſo and foreſts; if they procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by diſcretion. Neither were the barbarous huge targets, and long pikes ſo handſome, among trees and low ſhrubs; as darts and ſwords; and armour cloſe to the bodie. They ſhould therefore lay on thicke load; and ſtrike at their faces with their ſwords. That the Germans had neither coat of fence nor helmet: and their bucklers were not ribbed with iron, or ſinewes, but with oſiars, or painted thinne boord. Their firſt rancke was in ſome ſort appointed with pikes: but the reſt had but ſhort weapons burnt at the point. And although they were grim in counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and of ſome courage for a ſhort fit: yet being once wounded they would flee and be gone without ſhame of diſcredit, or care of their Captaine: in aduerſitie faint harted and timorous: but in proſperitie, vnmindfull both of diuine and humane lawes. If they deſired an end of their weariſome iournies, and ſea; in this battell they might eaſe themſelues. Albis was now neerer then Rhene: Neither was there any further warre to be made, if in that place treading the ſteps of his father, &amp; vncle, they would make him Conqueror.</hi> The heat of the ſoldier being inflamed with this ſpeech of the Captaine, the ſigne of battel was giuen. Neither did <hi>Arminius</hi> nor the reſt of the Germa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nobility omit to incourage theirs on the other ſide, ſaying: <hi rend="margQuotes">Theſe are the Romans which fled from <hi>Varus</hi> campe: who for fear of ioining battel, had rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

They tooke ſea, and choſe out the bie-waies of the Ocean, leaſt they ſhould haue beene encountered as they came, or purſued, after they were repulſed. But when they ſhall come to handi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrokes, they ſhall find ſmall refuge in the winde and oares. That now they ſhould call to minde their coueteouſnes, crueltie, and pride: was there any thing els to be done, then to maintaine their libertie; or die rather then be brought to ſeruitude?</hi> Thus encouraged, and demaunding battell, they were brought into a place called Idiſtauiſum, betwixt Viſurgis and the hils: not of one breadth, but now wide, now ſtraight, as the riuer or iutting out of the hils did ſuffer. Behinde them was a wood of high trees: and betweene thoſe trees a plaine and eeuen ground, which the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians had poſſeſſed with the entrance of the wood: the Cheruſci put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues on the tops of the hils, to fall furiouſly vpon the Romans in the heat of the fight. The order of our battell was this. The aides of Gallia, and the Germans were placed in the front: followed with the foote archers: after them fower legions; and <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelfe with two Pretorian cohorts: and a choiſe troupe of horſmen. After them ſo many legions more, with light horſemen, &amp; bow men on horſeback: and the reſt of the confederates: all of them, moſt carefull to keepe their order and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:18166:23"/>
aray. <hi>Germanicus</hi> perceiuing the Cheruſcians troupes to come fiercely toward the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; commanded the ableſt horſme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to charge him on the flanke, and <hi>Stertinius</hi> with the other ſquadrons of horſme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to enuiron him, and ſet on him behind: promiſing to be himſelfe at hand if neede required. In the meane ſeaſon, eight Eagles (a very luckie ſigne) were ſeene to flee towards the entrance of the wood. Which the Emperour perceiuing; cried that they ſhould march on, &amp; follow the Roman birds; the peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar gods of the legions. Wherupon the footmen brake in, &amp; the horſmen ſent before charged them on the flanke and on the backe. And which is ſtrange to report, two companies of the enemie tooke a contrary flight: thoſe which kept the wood, ran to the plaine: and thoſe which held the plaine, haſtened to the wood. The Cheruſci being betweene both, were thruſt downe from the hils: amongſt whom with great valour, <hi>Arminius</hi> maintained the battell, with his hands, voice, and wounds. All his might he bent againſt the archers, to haue burſt out that way, if the cohorts of Gallia, of Raetia; and the Vindelicians, had not oppoſed themſelues with their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes. Neuertheles, by ſtrength of bodie, and courage of his horſe, he eſcaped; hauing firſt died his face with bloud, leaſt he ſhould be knowne. Some report that he was knowne to the Cheruſci, which were among the auxiliarie bands of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, and let paſſe by them. The ſame either valour or guile, gaue <hi>Inguiomerus</hi> meanes to eſcape; the reſt were ſlaine on euery ſide. And moſt of them endeuoring to ſwim ouer Viſurgis, were either with the darts throwne after them, or force of the riuer, or waight of ſuch as lept after, or with the banks which fell, killed or ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed. Some cowardly fleeing away, ſought to clamber the tops of trees, and there hiding themſelues in the boughes, were ſhot through by the archers in a mockerie: and others bruſed by the ouerturning of the trees. The victory was great, and vnto vs not bloudie. From fiue of the clock, vntill night, the enemies were ſlaine, which filled ten miles of ground with dead carcaſſes, and armour. Some chaines were found among their ſpoiles; brought to empriſon the Romans: as not doubting a proſperous ſucceſſe. The ſouldiers ſaluted <hi>Tiberius</hi> by the name of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, in the ſame place where the battell was fought: and erected a mount of earth, as a token of victory: and put on it the armour of the enemie: and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath the names of the nations which they had conquered.</p>

               <p>THe wounds which the Germans receiued, and their ouerthrow, did not ſo much fret and greeue them as this ſpectacle: in ſo much that thoſe which were on the point to abandon their dwellings, and make preparation to paſſe the riuer Albis; catche vp their weapons, and demaund battell. The common ſort, the chiefe Gentlemen, yong and old, aſſaile and endanger the Romans. At laſt they choſe a place; enuironed with woods and a riuer, which had a narrow wateriſh plaine within it. The woods were enuironed likewiſe with a deepe marſh: ſauing on one ſide, where the Angriuarians had raiſed vp a broad cauſey, by which their ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories were ſeparated from the Cheruſci. The footemen ſtayed there: the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men hid themſelues in the woods adioyning: that when the legions ſhould enter the wood, they might charge them on the back. <hi>Caeſar</hi> was informed of all their plots: he knew their deſeignments, their places, their open and ſecret deuiſes, and turned the enemies fraud to his owne deſtruction. The charge of the horſemen and the plaine he committed to <hi>Seius Tubero</hi> Lieutenant: part of the footemen marched
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:18166:23"/>
in order of battell to the wood: and part went about to win the cauſey: the hardeſt he vndertooke himſelfe; and the reſt he committed to the Lieutenants. They vnto whom the plaine fell, did eaſily enter it: but thoſe which were to aſſault the cauſey were ſore gaulded, &amp; put backe, with blowes from aboue as if they had ſcaled a wall. The Captaine perceiuing that the enemy had the aduantage by fighting ſo neere, cauſed the legions to retire a little: and commaunded the ſling-caſters and ſtone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſters to let freely at them, and driue them from their fence. Many darts and ſpeares were ſhot out of engins; and the more the enemies were in ſight, the more wounds they receiued. The cauſey being taken, <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelfe with his gard, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly entered the woods, and fought with the enemy hand to hand: who had behinde him a marſh; and the Romans a riuer or mountaines: the place brought a neceſſitie of fighting to both partes: their hope conſiſted in their manhoode: and their ſafetie in the victory. The Germans were no leſſe couragious: but they were ouercome by the aduantage of weapons, and manner of fight. For being a great multitude, and the place narrow, they could neither thruſt out, nor draw back thoſe long pikes; nor vſe any nimblenes of body in running in, and ſtepping back: but were forced to fight, and not mooue a foote. Contrarily the Roman ſouldier, his ſhield cloſe to his breaſt: his ſword in his hand: gored the wide ſided, and open faced barbarian: and by their ſlaughter opened a way through them. <hi>Arminius</hi> being now courageles, by reaſon of continuall danger, or freſh bleeding wound lately receiued: but <hi>Inguiomerus</hi> flue vp and downe the army, wanted rather fortune then courage. And <hi>Germanicus</hi> to be the better knowne, vnlaced his helmet, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought them to continue the ſlaughter: captiues there was no neede of: only the generall butchery of the nation, would make an end of the warre. And in the eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he draweth out one legion from the army; to make ready the camps: the reſt filled themſelues vntill night with the bloud of the enemie. And for the horſemen, it is hard to geſſe which had the better. Then <hi>Caeſar</hi> hauing praiſed the valour of the conquerors in an aſſembly, made a great heape of armour with this prowd title. <hi rend="margQuotes">The people betwixt Rhene and Albis being vanquiſhed, <hi>Tiberius Caeſars</hi> army doth dedicate thoſe monuments to <hi>Mars, Iupiter,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus.</hi>
                  </hi> Of himſelfe he added no word, for feare of enuie: or becauſe the memory of the fact was ſufficient teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie for him. Immediately after he commaunded <hi>Stertinius</hi> to make warre againſt the Angriuarians, vnleſſe they would preſently yeeld: who humbly intreating and yeelding to all that was demaunded, receiued generall pardon. But the ſommer being now far ſpent, ſome of the legions were ſent back to the ſtanding camps; and <hi>Germanicus</hi> embarking many, conueyed them to the Ocean, by the riuer Amiſia. At the firſt they had a quiet &amp; calme ſea: no noiſe heard, but the noiſe of the oares of a thouſand veſſels; which ſomtimes likewiſe were driuen with ſailes: by and by haile powring downe out of blacke and thicke clouds; and ſundry ſtormes and tempeſts, ariſing from all parts; and vncertaine raging ſurges depriued them of all foreſight, and skill in gouerning their ſhipping. And the ſouldier fearfull and vnacquainted with the dangerous aduentures of ſea, whileſt he troubleth the mariners, or vnſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably goeth about to helpe; hindered the office of the more skilfull. In the ende, the heauen, and all the ſea gaue place to the ſouthwind: which more and more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing, through the mountaines of Germanie, deepe riuers, and huge clouds; and growing more violent and boiſterous through the cold of the North, neer which it is: toſſed and ſcattered the ſhipping into the wilde Ocean, or rockie Ilands, or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and vnknowen quickſands. Which being a little, but with much a doe eſcaped, by the changing of the ſea, they went whither the wind droue them. They
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:18166:24"/>
could neither caſt anchor; nor pumpe out the water which came in on them.

By how much the Ocean is more violent, then any other ſea; and Germany exceedeth other countries in roughnes and ſharpnes of aire: by ſo much that misfortune exceeded others, in ſtrangenes and greatnes: happening at the ſhores of the enimies land, or in ſo deepe and wide a ſea; that it hath beene belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be the laſt, and beyond which there is no land. Some of their ſhips were drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; many caſt vpon Ilands far off: the ſouldiers, the countrey being vnhabited, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by famine: vnleſſe it were ſuch as releeued themſelues with the horſes as were caſt a land. <hi>Germanicus</hi> gallie onely arriued at the Chauceans countrey: who ſeeing himſelfe all thoſe daies and nights vpon rocks, and points; crying that he onely was guiltie of the caſting away of ſo many perſons: could hardly be kept and ſtaied by his friends, from caſting himſelfe into the ſame ſea. At length the ſea growing lower, and the wind more fauourable; the lame and vntackled ſhippes, with a fewe oares, or their garments ſpread in ſtead of ſailes, or drawen at the taile of ſtronger, returned.

               <p>BVt the fame of the nauie loſt; as it did put the Germans in a hope, of beginning a new warre: ſo did it giue <hi>Germanicus</hi> ſtomack to curbe them. Wherupon he comanded <hi>C. Silius</hi> to goe againſt the Chatti, with thirtie thouſand footemen, and three thouſand horſmen: and himſelfe inuaded the Marſi with ſtronger forces. Their Captaine called <hi>Malouendus;</hi> who not long before had yeelded himſelfe, gaue notice how, that not far off, an enſigne of <hi>Varus</hi> legion was buried, and kept but with a ſlender guarde. A band of men was ſent thither out of hand: with direction, that ſome ſhould toll them out, and aſſaile them in the front; and others by inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roning them behind, to open the earth and take out the enſigne: fortune ſhewing hir-ſelfe fauourable to both the companies. This made <hi>Caeſar</hi> more forward, and ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth further into the land: waſteth, forrageth, rifleth the countrey; the enimie not daring to encounter him: or if at any time he did reſiſt; he was ſtraight driuen back: neuer (as they vnderſtood by certaine captiues) fearing more in their liues. For they gaue out, that the Romans were inuincible, and not to be daunted with any misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; ſeeing that hauing loſt their nauie, and armor; and after that the ſhores were couered, with the carcaſſes of their men and horſes; they inuaded them a freſh, with the ſame courage, and like fiercnes: yea as if they had increaſed their number. From thence the ſouldiers were brought backe to their winter ſtanding camps: glad that they had recompenſed their misfortune by ſea, with ſo proſperous a victorie. <hi>Caeſar</hi> vſed great largeſſe, recompenſing euerie man, to the value of the loſſe he had

ſuſtained. Little doubt, but the enimie grew faint harted, and began to conſult, how he might intreat a peace: and that if the next ſommer the wars ſhould haue beene continued, there would be an ende of all. But <hi>Germanicus</hi> was ſollicited by often letters from <hi>Tiberius,</hi> to returne and receiue the triumphe which was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for him: <hi rend="margQuotes">that he had paſſed through many chaunces and accidents: that he had had proſperous ſucceſſe in many battels: that he ſhould reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber what grieuous and cruell loſſes he had ſuſtained, not by any ouerſight of the Captaine, but by the winds &amp; waues of the ſea: that he had bin ſent nine times into Germanie by <hi>Auguſtus</hi> of famous memorie: where he had atchieued more noble exploites by counſel then force. So he had receiued the ſubmiſſion of the Sigambri: ſo the Sueuians, and the King of the Maroboduans were inforced to make peace: that the Cheruſci and other rebellious nations, ſeeing the Romans had had a ſufficient reuenge on them, might be left to war one againſt another.</hi> But <hi>Germanicus</hi> intreating for one yeere longer, to finiſh the enterpriſes he had begun; <hi>Tiberius</hi> aſſaulted his mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie more earneſtly; offering him the conſulſhip once more: which he ſhould exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute in perſon. He added further, that if there were any more wars to be enterpriſed, he ſhould reſerue that ſubiect, for the glorie of his brother <hi>Druſus:</hi> who no other enimy being left, could not but by warring againſt the Germans, get the title of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, or win the crowne of laurell. <hi>Germanicus</hi> made no longer ſtay, although he knew well that thoſe were but colours, ſought through enuie, to draw him from the glorie he had alreadie purchaſed.</p>

                  <hi>VII. Libo</hi> accuſed of treaſon, killeth himſelfe.</head>
               <p>ABout the ſame time <hi>Libo Druſus,</hi> one of the Scribonian familie, was accuſed for practizing againſt the ſtate. The beginning, the order, and the end of that buſines, I will ſet downe: becauſe thoſe things came then firſt to light, which for ſo many yeares had conſumed and eaten the common-wealth. <hi>Firmius Cato</hi> a Senator, and one of <hi>Liboes</hi> inward friends, induced this vncircumſpect yong man, and eaſily led to vanities, to giue credit to the Chaldeans promiſes, Magicians cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and interpreters of dreames: vainely and boaſtingly putting him in minde, that <hi>Pompey</hi> was his great grandfather; <hi>Scribonia,</hi> who had been <hi>Auguſtus</hi> wife, his aunt; the <hi>Caeſars</hi> his coſen germans: and that his houſe was full of images and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of his predeceſſors. He incited him further to licentious riot: to take vp and borrow money, making himſelfe a companion of his want on luſts and familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, the better to wrap and conuince him with many euidences. When he had found witneſſes ſufficient, and ſuch alſo of his ſeruants which were priuie to the whole matter, he deſired he might be admitted to the ſpeech of the Prince: and by meanes of <hi>Flaccus Veſcularius,</hi> a Gentleman of Rome, and one of <hi>Tiberius</hi> famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, diſcouered the matter, and the man. <hi>Caeſar</hi> was content with the accuſation, yet denied conference with <hi>Firmius</hi> the accuſer: ſaying, that by the ſame meſſenger <hi>Flaccus,</hi> their ſpeech might paſſe from one to the other. In the meane ſeaſon he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noreth <hi>Libo</hi> with the Pretorſhip, inuiteth him to his table, neuer changed his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance towards him, nothing paſſionate in words (ſo skilfull he was in concealing his anger) and although he could haue preuented both his words and enterpriſes; yet he deſired rather to know the manner of his proceedings: vntill one <hi>Iunius,</hi> ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to conuince and raiſe infernall ſpirits by inchantments, vttered the matter to <hi>Fulcinius Trio,</hi> one amongſt the promoters, compted quick and readie witted, and careleſſe of diſcredit. This <hi>Trio</hi> accuſed immediately the partie: went to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls:
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:18166:25"/>
and required that the Senators would heare the matter. The Senators were aſſembled, and giuen to vnderſtand that they were to deliberate of an important and waightie affaire. <hi>Libo</hi> in the meane time changing his attire, went with certaine noble women from one houſe to an other, intreated his coſens, and craueth their good word in his extremitie: but all of them refuſed; ſome pretending one excuſe, ſome another; fearing leaſt they ſhould be thought partakers of the ſame crime. The day come that the Senate ſate; being through feare, or as ſome report, faining himſelfe ſick, weake and weary, was brought to the court gates in a chariot, leaning on his brother, and holding vp his hands, craued pardon of <hi>Tiberius;</hi> who receiued him, neuer once changing countenance. Then <hi>Caeſar</hi> read the libels alowd, &amp; their authors; ſo moderating himſelfe, that he was not thought either to mitigate or ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauate any way the crimes. Beſides <hi>Trio</hi> and <hi>Catus,</hi> there ſtepped foorth two other accuſers, <hi>Fonteius Agrippa,</hi> and <hi>C. Liuius,</hi> ſtriuing which had beſt right to pleade againſt him; vntill <hi>Liuius</hi> (becauſe they would not yeeld the one to the other, and <hi>Libo</hi> came without any aduocate) promiſed that he himſelfe would ſet downe ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally euery crime by him committed. Then he produced ſuch ſottiſh declarations, that among other things, they contained, how <hi>Libo</hi> had conſulted with the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, whether he ſhould euer haue money enough, to be able to couer the Appian way, from Rome to Brunduſium; with many ſuch ſimple &amp; friuolous matters, and more mildly to tearme them, pitifull. Yet the accuſer enforced one thing more: that in one writing of <hi>Liboes</hi> owne hand, there were added certaine dangerous and vnknowne characters, to the names of the <hi>Caeſars</hi> and Senators. And the partie ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned denying it; it was thought good, that his bondmen which knew his hand, ſhould be examined vpon the rack. And becauſe that by an ancient decree of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, it was not lawfull to torture a bondman againſt the life of his Lord; <hi>Tiberius</hi> a ſubtile deuiſer of new lawes, commaundeth them all to be ſold to a publick Actor, that without preiudice of the decree, they might be tortured, as not being <hi>Liboes</hi> bondmen. Whereupon <hi>Libo</hi> deſired that the matter might be deferred to the next day. And being at his houſe, intreated his neere kinſman <hi>P. Quirinius,</hi> to make the laſt interceſſion for him to the Prince: who had anſwere giuen him that he ſhould intreate the Lords of the Senate. In the meane ſeaſon his houſe was beſet with a gard of ſouldiers, who in the entry made ſuch a noiſe, that they might eaſily be both heard and ſeene. When as <hi>Libo</hi> loathing the very ſight of the dainties miniſtred for his laſt comfort, began to call for ſome one to murder him: and taking his bond-mens right hands, and putting a ſword in them; whileſt they trembling with feare, and refuſing to do it, ran from one place to another: ouerthrew the light on the table: in that mortall and deadly darknes, he thruſt himſelfe twiſe in the guts. At the grone when he fell, his freed men came running about him: but the ſouldiers ſeeing the murder, ſtoode aloofe. Notwithſtanding, the accuſation was proſecuted with like aſſeueration, and <hi>Tiberius</hi> ſwore, that if he had not voluntarily haſtened his owne death, he would haue begged his life, although he had beene guiltie. His goods were diſtributed among the accuſers, and Pretors roomes were extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily giuen to ſuch as were of the Senate. Then <hi>Cotta Meſſallinus,</hi> gaue his opinion, that <hi>Liboes</hi> image ſhould not be carried in the funerals of his poſteritie. <hi>C. Lentulus,</hi> that none of the Scribonian familie ſhould take vpon him the ſurname of <hi>Druſus.</hi> By the aduiſe of <hi>Pomp. Flaccus,</hi> certaine daies of generall proceſſions were ordained. <hi>L. P.</hi> and <hi>Gallus Aſinius,</hi> and <hi>Papius Mutilus,</hi> and <hi>L. Apronius,</hi> were of opinion, that gifts ſhould be offered to <hi>Iupiter, Mars,</hi> and the goddeſſe of Concord; and that the Ides of Septemb. when <hi>Libo</hi> killed himſelfe ſhould be kept holy day. The dignities

and flatteries of theſe men, I haue thought good to regiſter, that it might be knowne that that was alwayes an old diſeaſe in the common-wealth.</p>

Pituanius</hi> was throwen headlong from the Tarpeian rocke: and the Conſuls puniſhed <hi>P. Martius</hi> without the Eſquilin gate, with the ſound of trumpets, according to the auncient cuſtome. At the next meeting of the Senate, <hi>L. Haterius</hi> once Conſull, and <hi>Octauius Fronto,</hi> who had beene Pretor, ſpake much againſt the ſuperfluous exceſſe of the citie. Where it was decreed, that they ſhould not ſerue at their tables veſſell of beaten gold, nor men weare ſilke aboue their degree. <hi>Fronto</hi> went further, and demaunded that there might be an order ſet downe touching their plate, houſhould ſtuffe, and number of ſeruants: for it was yet a thing in vſe; for the Senators to lay downe that for a decree, which they thought expedient for the common wealth. <hi>Gallus Aſinius</hi> ſpake to the contrary: ſaieng, <hi rend="margQuotes">that with the greatnes of the Empire, priuate mens wealth was increaſed: which was no new matter, but of old times receiued likewiſe: that the wealth in <hi>Fabricius</hi> time differed from that in Scipioes; and yet all referred to the common wealth: which being but in meane eſtate, the citizens houſes were thereafter. But now that it is growen to that magnificence; the eſtate of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar men is bettered alſo. Neither is there anything too much or too little, either in plate, number of ſeruants, or other furniture of houſhold, but in reſpect of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the owner. The reuenewes of a Senator were diſtinguiſhed from a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans: not bicauſe they differed in nature; but as they were preferred in place, degrees, and dignities, th'one before th'other. Theſe things are procured for the recreation of the minde, or health of bodie. Vnles peraduenture they would that the moſt noble, ſhould take moſt cares vpon them, and hazard their perſons in moſt dangers; and yet want thoſe pleaſures and comforts, which beſt ſerued to lenifie and make them more eaſie.</hi> The acknowledging of vices vnder honeſt termes, and the likenes of affections in the hearers mindes, cauſed <hi>Gallus</hi> to haue an eaſie aſſent. <hi>Tiberius</hi> added, that that was no time for reformation: &amp; if there were any diſſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in maners, there ſhould not want one to redreſſe it. Among theſe things, <hi>L. Piſo</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the ambition vſed in places of iudgement, corruption of iuſtice, crueltie of aduocates, the threats of accuſers; proteſted he would be gon &amp; forſake the citie, and lead his life far off in ſome retired and ſolitarie place in the countrie: and in ſo ſaying went out of the Senat houſe. <hi>Tiberius</hi> was mooued at this; and did what he could to pacifie him with faire words: and withall, was earneſt with his neereſt kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to ſtay him, either by intreatie or authoritie. Not long after the ſame <hi>Piſo,</hi> gaue no leſſe free teſtimonie of his griefe, by ſommoning <hi>Vrgulania</hi> to appeere in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; whom the fauour of <hi>Augusta</hi> had priuiledged aboue the courſe of lawes: But <hi>Vrgulania</hi> diſobeying the ſommonce being conueied into <hi>Caeſars</hi> houſe, made ſmall reckoning of <hi>Piſo:</hi> yet he deſiſted not, although <hi>Auguſta</hi> complained her credit was touched therein, and her calling embaſed. <hi>Tiberius</hi> thinking it a part of curteſie, ſo far to yeelde vnto his mothers requeſt, as to promiſe he would goe to the Pretors Tribunall to defend <hi>Vrgulania:</hi> went out of the pallace, the ſouldiers being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to follow a far off. The people which met him in the face, marked with what a ſetled countenance he went forward, protracting the time &amp; the way with diuers
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:18166:26"/>
diſcourſes, vntill that <hi>(Piſoes</hi> friends labouring in vaine to diſſwade him from the ſuite) <hi>Auguſta</hi> had commaunded the money which was demaunded to be brought to the Tribunall. That matter was ſo ended, not without ſome glory to <hi>Piſo,</hi> and greater fame to <hi>Caeſar.</hi> But <hi>Vrgulaniaes</hi> credit and authoritie was ſo ouer great in the citie, that ſhe diſdained to come, and giue witnes in a matter which was handled before the Lords of the Senate. And therefore the Pretor was ſent to examine her in her houſe: when as the auncient cuſtome was, that euen the Veſtall virgins were examined as witneſſes, in the common place of pleading and iudgement. I would not recite the matters propounded that yeare, but that the diuerſitie of opinions, betwixt <hi>Gn. Piſo,</hi> and <hi>Aſinius Gallus</hi> in that point is worthie the knowing. For <hi>Piſo</hi> was of opinion, that although <hi>Caeſar</hi> had promiſed he would be preſent, that ſo much the rather he would proſecute his cauſe againſt <hi>Vrgulania:</hi> and that in the abſence of the Prince, the Senators and Gentlemen might execute their charge, as a thing well beſeeming the dignitie of the common wealth. <hi>Gallus,</hi> becauſe <hi>Piſo</hi> had firſt taken vpon him the colour of libertie, held, that there was nothing done with maieſtie, and anſwerable to the dignitie of the people of Rome; but what was done in <hi>Caeſars</hi> preſence: and therefore, the aſſemblies of Italie, and meetings of Prouinces, were to be reſerued vntill he would be preſent. Theſe things were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated very hotly on both ſides, <hi>Tiberius</hi> giuing them the hearing, and holding his peace, and in the end they were deferred. There aroſe another controuerſie betwixt <hi>Gallus</hi> and <hi>Caeſar.</hi> For <hi>Gallus</hi> was of opinion, that the aſſemblies for creation of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, ſhould be from fiue to fiue yeares: and that the Lieutenants of the legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who had executed that charge before they had been Pretors, ſhould then be choſen Pretors elect: and that the Prince ſhould euery yeare nominate twelue. Little doubt but this aduiſe went deepe, and reached to a ſecret of ſtate. <hi>Caeſar</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, as though his authoritie ſhould thereby be made greater, ſaid, <hi rend="margQuotes">that it ſtoode not with his modeſtie to chooſe ſo many, and defer ſo many. And if the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection ſhould be euery yeare, hardly could it be choſen, but ſome would be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, although ſuch as had the repulſe, might be comforted with hope to be choſen the next yeare. And how would they hate me, which ſhould be deferred aboue fiue yeares? how could it be knowne in ſo long a time, what euery mans minde is, what his houſe, and fortune: If men grow too prowd in one yeare, what would they be if they ſhould be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued for fiue yeares? Magiſtrates ſhould ſo be multiplied fiue for one: and lawes ſubuerted: which haue preſcribed a time for ſuters to exerciſe their induſtrie, and to procure and inioy dignities.</hi> With this ſpeech, in ſhew plauſible, he confirmed the ſtate to himſelf: he bettered the reuenews of certain of the Senators: and therefore it was the more to be maruelled that he accepted no better of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of <hi>M.

               <p>THe ſame yeere, an audacious part of a bondſlaue had ſhaken the whole ſtate with ciuill wars and diſcord; had it not beene preuented in good time.

In the mean time it was commonly reported throughout Italy, and beleeued at Rome, that <hi>Agrippa</hi> by the goodnes of the gods was preſerued aliue. In ſo much that being arriued at Hoſtia: there great multitudes, and in the citie ſecret aſſemblies ſhewed ſignes of ioy: <hi>Tiberius</hi> being doubtfull and perplexed, whether he ſhould make away his bondman by ſouldiers; or ſuffer that vaine credulouſnes to vaniſh away with time. Thus wauereing betwixt ſhame and feare: ſometimes thinking it no policie to make light of any thing: and ſometime leſſe to feare all things: in the end committed the matter to <hi>Salluſtius Criſpus.</hi> He chuſeth two of his followers (or as ſome ſaie ſouldiers) and perſwadeth them, as though they had fled for ſome of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to goe to him; offer him money; promiſe him loyaltie; and that they would ſtand to him in all dangers. They fulfilling his commaundement, eſpieng a night when he had no guarde: with aide ſufficient, bound him, ſtopped his mouth, and drew him to the pallace. And when <hi>Caeſar</hi> asked him, How he was made <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa:</hi> it is reported hee anſwered, As thou waſt made <hi>Caeſar.</hi> He could not bee brought by any meanes to diſcloſe his confederates. Neither durſt <hi>Tiberius</hi> puniſh him openly; but in a ſecret part of the pallace commaunded him to be murdered; and his bodie priuily to be conueied away. And although many of the Princes own houſe, Senators, and gentlemen, were reported to haue ſuſtained him with their goods, &amp; aided him with their counſell; yet there was no further enquirie made. In the end of this yeere a triumphall arch was erected neere to <hi>Saturnus</hi> Temple, for the recouerie of the enſignes loſt with <hi>Varus,</hi> vnder the conduct of <hi>Germanicus,</hi> and <hi>Caeſars</hi> good fortune. And a Temple built alſo of ſtrong fortune, neere Tyber in the gardens which <hi>Caeſar</hi> the Dictator had bequeathed to the people of Rome: and a Chappell dedicated to the Iulian familie; and an image to <hi>Auguſtus</hi> at Bouilles.</p>

               <p>C. <hi>Coelius,</hi> and <hi>L.

In which triumph were caried the ſpoiles, and captiues, and counterfeit of the mountaines, riuers, and battels; and ſo the warre was taken as ended, becauſe he was forbidden to proſecute it any further. The comlines of his perſon, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphall chariot, loaden with fiue of his children, made the ſhew more gallant. But when they thought with themſelues how vnluckie the peoples fauour was in his father <hi>Druſus:</hi> that his vncle <hi>Marcellus</hi> was taken from them in the flowre of his youth, &amp; heate of the peoples loue: that the affection of the people of Rome was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, and of ſmall continuance, they were all ſecretly ſtriken into a feare. And although <hi>Tiberius</hi> gaue in <hi>Germanicus</hi> name, to euery one of the people * three <note place="margin">About 46. 1. 10. d. ob.</note> hundred ſeſterces a man, and made him his copartner in the Conſulſhip; yet could neuer be accompted a ſincere friend, but that he went about to remoue the yong man, vnder colour of honor, and forged pretences; or greedily taking hold of ſuch

as were offered by chaunce. King <hi>Archelaus</hi> had now fiftie yeares enioyed Cappa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docia, greatly diſliked of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> becauſe that during his being at Rhodes, he had vſed no ſhew of dutie towards him: which <hi>Archelaus</hi> did not omit through pride, but becauſe he was ſo admoniſhed by <hi>Auguſtus</hi> familiareſt friends. For whileſt <hi>C. Caeſar</hi> yet flouriſhed, and managed the affaires of the Eaſt, <hi>Tiberius</hi> friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was ſuſpected, as dangerous. The houſe of the <hi>Caeſars</hi> was no ſooner extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and that himſelfe was in poſſeſſion of the Empire, but he tolleth <hi>Archelaus</hi> by his mothers letters to Rome: who not diſſembling her ſonnes diſpleaſure, offered him all gentle intreatie, if he would come to him with ſubmiſſion. He then ignorant of the trechery, or miſdoubting violence if he ſeemed to perceiue it, maketh haſte to the citie: where being churliſhly receiued, and anon after accuſed in Senate; not for the crimes which were pretended, but by anguiſh of minde, or feeblenes of age; and becauſe not only baſe, but alſo things indifferent are ſtrange and vnuſuall to kings; he either willingly or naturally ended his life. The kingdome was afterward redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into a prouince: and <hi>Caeſar</hi> declaring, that with the reuenews thereof, the tribute of one in the hundred might be eaſed; made a decree, that from thence forward one ſhould be leuied in two hundred. At the ſame time <hi>Antiochus,</hi> king of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mageni, and <hi>Philopater,</hi> king of the Cilicians being dead, thoſe nations were deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded among themſelues, ſome deſiring to be gouerned by the Romans, and others by Kings. And the prouinces of Syria and Iudaea, ouercharged with taxes, made ſupplication that their tributes might be diminiſhed. Theſe things therefore, with thoſe which I haue rehearſed of Armenia, <hi>Tiberius</hi> ſheweth to the Lords of the Senat: and that the tumults of the Orient, could no way be pacified but by <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus</hi> wiſedome. As for himſelfe, he was ſtriken in age, and <hi>Druſus</hi> was not yet of ripe yeares. And thereupon by decree of Senate, <hi>Germanicus</hi> had the charge giuen him ouer all the prouinces, deuided by ſea, and a greater commaunde whither ſoeuer he went, then any, which either by lot or Princes ſending receiued gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now <hi>Tiberius</hi> had before remoued from Syria <hi>Creticus Silanus,</hi> who was by marriage allied to <hi>Germanicus,</hi> his daughter being promiſed in marriage to <hi>Nero Germanicus</hi> eldeſt ſon; &amp; in his roome had appointed <hi>Gn. Piſo</hi> to be Lieutenant, a man both raſh and headſtrong: not knowing what it was to obey, as hauing that fiercenes of courage naturally from <hi>Piſo</hi> his father: who during the ciuill warres, ayded in moſt eager manner the ſides which roſe in Affrike againſt <hi>Caeſar:</hi> then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſsius</hi> faction; and licence graunted him to returne, forbare all dignities, vntill he was wooed to accept the Conſulſhip, offered him by <hi>Augustus Caeſars</hi> owne motion. But beſides the hereditary courage of his fathers, the nobilitie and wealth of <hi>Plancina</hi> his wife, made him grow ſo inſolent, that he would ſcarſe yeeld to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and contemned his children as far inferior to himſelfe: not doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at all but that he was choſen gouernor of Syria, to bridle and keepe vnder <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manicus</hi> hopes. And ſome beleeued that he had had ſecret commaundement by <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi> ſo to do: and without all peraduenture <hi>Auguſta</hi> had put it into <hi>Plancinaes</hi> head, (emulation being a vſuall matter amongſt women) to contend and quarrell with <hi>Agrippina.</hi> The court was deuided, ſome ſecretly fauouring <hi>Druſus,</hi> ſome <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manicus.

               <p>NOt long after, <hi>Druſus</hi> was ſent to Illyrium, to be trained vp in feates of warre, and to win the ſouldiers harts. And <hi>Tiberius</hi> thought it better, that the yong man luſtly giuen, by the wanton laſciuiouſnes of the citie, ſhould be better faſhioned in the camp, and himſelfe in more ſecuritie, both his ſonnes being commaunders ouer the legions. But the colour was, that the Sweuians did craue aide againſt the Cheruſci: for being rid of the Romans, and voide of forren feare, through emulation of glory, a thing vſuall in that countrey, they turned their armes againſt themſelues. Ods there was none in the ſtrength of the nations, or valour of Captaines, but that the name of a king, which <hi>Maroboduus</hi> tooke vpon him, was odious to the common people: and <hi>Arminius</hi> fauoured becauſe he fought for libertie. And therefore not only the Cheruſci, and their confederates: <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> olde ſouldiers tooke armes: but the Sweuian nations alſo of <hi>Maroboduus</hi> kingdome. The Semnones and the Longobards tooke part: and ioyning with <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> had preuailed; if <hi>Inguiomerus</hi> with a ſtrong companie of his vaſſalles, had not fled to <hi>Maroboduus</hi> for no other cauſe, but onely being old and vncle to <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> diſdained to obey him being but yoong and his brothers ſonne. They pitcht their battell with like hope on both ſides: not vſing rouing incurſions, or skirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing in ſcattered troupes, as the manner of the Germans in times paſt had beene: but by long warring againſt vs, they had accuſtomed themſelues to follow their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, ſtrengthen and aide one another, and obey their Captaines. <hi rend="margQuotes">Then <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> viewing his armie on horſebacke vaunted to all he met, that their libertie was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered; the legions ſlaine: &amp; ſhewed in the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of many of the ſoldiers, the ſpoiles and armour which by force they had taken from the Romans. Contrarily he called <hi>Maroboduus</hi> a runnagate, vnskilfull in warres; that he had ſaued himſelfe in the lurking holes of <hi>Hercynia:</hi> and then by gifts and embaſſies, entreated an agreement: that he was a traitor to his countrey, and one of <hi>Caeſars</hi> followers: therefore that they ſhould thruſt him out; with no leſſe hatred then they had ſlaine <hi>Varus Quincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius:</hi> that they ſhould now call to minde ſo many battels: by ſucceſſe of which; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in the ende driuen out the Romans; it is eaſilie ſeene who ſhould haue the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hand.</hi> Neither did <hi>Maroboduus</hi> on his ſide forget to vaunt himſelfe, or inueigh againſt his enimie: but taking hold of <hi>Inguiomerus,</hi> told them that all the honours of the Cheruſci conſiſted in that body: and that all that fell out luckily, was atchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by his counſell. <hi rend="margQuotes">That <hi>Arminius</hi> a ſot; vnexpert in matter of warre; attributed others glorie to himſelfe: becauſe he had entrapped by guile, three vnfurniſhed le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions with their Captaine, nothing miſdoubting their fraude; to the great loſſe of Germanie, &amp; his owne ignominie; ſeeing his wife, &amp; his ſon do yet endure ſeruitude. But as for him, he had maintained the honor of Germanie vnſtained, being aſſailed by twelue legions, vnder the conduct of <hi>Tiberius;</hi> and in the ende parted with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable conditions. Neither did it repent him that it was yet in their choiſe; either to make war againſt the Romans, or accept of peace without bloudſhed.</hi> Both parts being incenſed with theſe ſpeeches; yet other peculiar cauſes did more inflame them. Conſidering that the Cheruſci, and the Longobardi, did fight for their aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:18166:28"/>
honours, or freſh libertie: and contrarily the others to inlarge their domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. A fiercer encounter then this there was neuer ſeene: nor a more doubtfull iſſue: the right wings on both ſides being ſlaine. And a new fight was hoped for, if <hi>Maroboduus</hi> (an euident token of a faint hart) had not retired to the hils: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomwhat weakned, by the back ſliding of Traitors, withdrew himſelf to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comans, and ſent Ambaſſadors to <hi>Tiberius</hi> to craue aide. Vnto whom it was anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that he had no reaſon to craue the Romans aide againſt the Cheruſci; ſeeing he aided the Romans nothing at all, when they fought againſt the ſame enimie. Yet as we haue ſaid, <hi>Druſus</hi> was ſent to make a peace. The ſame yeere twelue famous cities of Aſia, were deſtroied by an earthquake in the night: a calamitie ſo much the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by how much the leſſe looked for. The vſuall meanes of ſauing themſelues in in like caſes, by fleeing to the open fields, doing them no good at all; bicauſe they were ſwallowed vp by the opening of the earth. It is reported that huge mountaines were laide flat, and plaines raiſed vp into high hils: and fier flaſhed out among thoſe ruines. And the diſaſtre being more grieuous among the Sardians, then elſewhere; greater co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſion was had on them: for <hi>Caeſar</hi> promiſed them <note n="*" place="margin">About 78 125 pound.</note> an hundreth hundred thouſand ſeſterces: and releaſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for fiue yeeres ſpace of all that they were to pay to the common treaſurie. Next vnto them endomaged and relieued, were the Magnetians, neere vnto Sipylus. It was thought expedient for the ſame ſpace, to diſcharge of all tributes, the Temnians, Philadelphians, Aegetians, Appolonienſes and ſuch as are called Moſcenians, or Macedonians, of Hyrcania, and Hierocaeſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea, Myrina, Cymen, Tmolum; and to ſend ſome of the Senators, to view and relieue their preſent eſtate. This charge was committed to <hi>M. Aletus</hi> once Pretor; leaſt if one who had been once Conſull ouer Aſia, ſhould haue beene deputed; there might ſome emulation haue riſen betwixt equals; and thereby the buſines hindered. <hi>Caeſar</hi> did with no leſſe gratefull bountie, ſhew his liberalitie when he beſtowed the goods of <hi>Aemilia Muſa,</hi> a rich woman, fallen to the fiſque; vpon <hi>Aemilius Lepidus,</hi> of whoſe houſe ſhe ſeemed to haue been. And the like when he gaue the inheritance of <hi>Patuleius,</hi> a rich gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Rome (albeit he was inſtituted heire in part) to <hi>M. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uillius,</hi> whom he found to haue beene written in the firſt not ſuſpected teſtament: hauing declared before, that both their nobilities were to be holpen with money. Neither did he at any time take any inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, vnleſſe he had deſerued it by friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. He did reiect all ſuch, as being vnknowen to him; and for hatred vnto others, declared the Prince to be their heires. And as he did relieue the honeſt pouertie of the innocent: ſo the prodigall and needie through their owne behauiour, he put from the Senat, or gaue licence to depart: as to <hi>Vibidius Varro, Marius Nepos, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius Appianus, Cornelius Sulla, Q.

But as for the adulterie, there was ſufficient order taken by the law <hi>Iulia:</hi> yet <hi>Caeſar</hi> requeſted that the treaſon might be diſtinguiſhed from the other crime: and that ſhe might be puniſhed, if ſhe had ſpoken irreligiouſly againſt <hi>Augustus.</hi> As for that which ſhe had ſpoken againſt himſelfe, he would not haue it brought into examination. And being asked by a Conſull, what he thought of thoſe things ſhe was accuſed of, againſt his mother; he held his peace. But the next time the Senate met, he intreated in his mothers name, that ſuch words as ſhe had vttered againſt her, might not be conſtrued for a fault. Of treaſon alſo he acquited her: and intreated that the puniſhment of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, might not be ſeuerely enforced againſt her: perſwading her friends, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the example of their auncetors, they would remoue her from her kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred aboue two hundred miles: and <hi>Manlius</hi> the adulterer was baniſhed Italie and Affrike. When <hi>Vipſanius Gallus</hi> was dead, there aroſe a ſtrife in ſubrogating a Pretor in his roome: <hi>Germanicus</hi> and <hi>Druſus</hi> both then being at Rome, fauoring <hi>Haterius A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa,</hi> neere kinſeman to <hi>Germanicus:</hi> and ſome laboring to the contrary, deſired that according to the lawes, amongſuters ſuch ſhould preuaile as had the greateſt number of children: <hi>Tiberius</hi> reioycing, that the Senate debated the matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his children and the lawes. Without doubt the law was ouercome: but ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by and by; nor with a few ſuffrages; but after the ſame manner, as when the lawes were in greateſt force. The ſame yeare the warre began in Affrike, <hi>Tacfari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> being the captaine of the enemies. This <hi>Tacfarinas</hi> was a Numidian borne; and being an aide ſouldier, receiued pay vnder the Romans: then a forſaker of them gathered together certaine wandering companions, inured to robberies, thefts, and pillage: whom he marſhalled into companies, and deuided into enſignes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the manner of ſeruice: and at laſt was reckoned a leader not of a diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly multitude, but captaine of the Muſulanians: which being a ſtrong nation neere vnto the deſert of Affrike, hauing no dwelling in townes, tooke armes, and drew their neighbours the Moores with them, vnder their captaine <hi>Mazippa.</hi> Their armie was ſo deuided, that <hi>Tacfarinas</hi> ſhould encamp himſelfe with choſen men, armed after the Roman manner, and traine them vp in diſcipline and obedience. <hi>Mazippa</hi> with a companie lightly armed, ſhould roue vp and downe, burne, ſlay, &amp; terrifie. They had alſo perſwaded the Cinithians, a nation not to be deſpiſed, to the like: When as <hi>Furius Camillus</hi> Proco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſul of Affrike, hauing gathered a legion, &amp; the confederates which were vnder enſignes (a ſmall power if you reſpect the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Moores and Numidians) and lead them againſt the enemie: and doubting nothing more then leaſt they ſhould ſhift off the battell for feare, with a hope of victory tolled them on, and in their hope ouerthrew them. <hi>Furius</hi> placed a legion in the middle, the cohorts lightly appointed, and two companies of horſemen in the wings. <hi>Tacfarinas</hi> refuſed not to ioyne battell: but the Numidians were vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; and the Furian name, after ſo many yeares recouered the reputation of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors.

Other ſtale matters he obiected alſo againſt them; as that they had not proſperous ſucceſſe againſt the Macedonians; and vſed violence againſt their owne citizens: bearing them alſo a ſpeciall grudge, bicauſe that at his requeſt they woulde not deliuer on <hi>Theophilus</hi> condemned of forgery, by the counſel of the Areopagites. From thence ſailing with all celeritie by the Cyclades, and ſeeking out the ſhorteſt cuts, at the Iland of Rhodes, he ouertooke <hi>Germanicus:</hi> nothing ignorant how he
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:18166:30"/>
had backbitten him: yet neuertheleſſe ſuch was his milde diſpoſition, that when <hi>Piſo</hi> was driuen through tempeſt againſt the rocks, and that his miſcarieng might haue beene imputed to chance, he ſent gallies to ſuccour him, and ſo deliuered him from danger. But all this did not mollifie <hi>Piſoes</hi> hart, but ſcarſe enduring one daies ſtaie, forſaketh and preuenteth <hi>Germanicus.</hi> For being come to the legions in Syria; winning the baſeſt of the common ſoldiers with gifts: he began to diſplace the old Centurions, and ſeuere Tribunes: and beſtowe their roomes on his followers, or to the moſt lewdeſt: ſuffered idlenes in the campes: licentiouſnes in the citie: vagrant and riotous ſouldiers to range the countrey: whereby they grew to ſuch corruption, that among the common ſort, he was called the father of the legions. Neither did <hi>Plancina</hi> containe hir ſelfe within the bounds of womanly modeſtie: but woulde be preſent at the horſemens exerciſe, as the running of the cohorts: and vſe reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſpeeches againſt <hi>Agrippina,</hi> and <hi>Germanicus:</hi> ſome of the better ſort of ſoldiers, readie to follow hir humour, in bad actions; bicauſe there was a ſecret rumour ſpred that thoſe things were not done with diſlike of the Emperour. <hi>Germanicus</hi> knew all this: but his greateſt care was to preuent the Armenians. That nation was in times paſt doubtfull and vncertaine to the Romans, not onely through their diſpoſition and affection; but alſo through the ſituation of their countrey: which ſtretching into our prouinces, reacheth euen to the Medes. And being ſeated betwixt great kingdomes, are often in wars, through hatred to the Romans, and enuie to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians. King at that time they had none; <hi>Vonones</hi> being expulſed. But the nation fauoured <hi>Zeno, Polemon</hi> king of Pontus ſonne, bicauſe that from his infancie, he had imitated the cuſtomes and attire of the Armenians; their hunting and banqueting, and other exerciſes of the Barbarians greatly eſteemed: thereby winning the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour as wel of the nobilitie, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people. <hi>Germanicus</hi> then in the city Artaxata, the noble men approouing it, in the preſence of a multitude, crowned him King: &amp; the reſt doing him honor as their King, ſaluted him after the name of the city by the name of Artaxias. The Cappadocians being reduced to the forme of a Prouince; receiued <hi>Q Veranius</hi> for their Lieutenant: and to giue them a good hope of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man gouernment, ſome of the tributes vſually before paid to the Kings, diminiſhed: &amp; ouer the Comageni, then firſt reduced vnder the regiment of a Pretor, <hi>Q.

               <p>ALbeit, all the affaires of the allies were ſetled in good order: yet <hi>Germanicus</hi> was nothing the more at his eaſe; by reaſon of <hi>Piſoes</hi> pride: who being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded either by himſelfe, or by his ſonne, to conduct part of the legions to Armenia, neglected both. At length they both met at Cyrrum, where the tenth legion wintered: <hi>Piſo</hi> with a reſolute countenance againſt feare: and <hi>Germanicus</hi> as I haue ſaid the milder of the two, leſt he ſhould be thought to threaten.

                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:18166:30"/>
and light ones to <hi>Piſo</hi> and the reſt: He was heard to ſay, that that banket was made to the ſonne of a Romane Prince, and not to the ſonne of a king of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia: and withall threw away his crowne, vttering many ſpeeches againſt the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluitie of the banket: which although <hi>Germanicus</hi> could hardly digeſt, yet indured all patiently. Whileſt theſe things were adoing, Embaſſadors came from <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus,</hi> king of the Parthians, calling to minde their friendſhip and alliance with the Romans, and deſiring that they might renew right hands: and that in honor of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manicus,</hi> he would come to the banke of Euphrates.

               <p>WHen <hi>M. Silanus,</hi> and <hi>L. Norbanus</hi> were Conſuls, <hi>Germanicus</hi> went to Aegypt, to ſee the antiquities of the countrey; but pretended a care of the prouince: where he opened their ſtorehouſes, and brought downe the price of corne: and did other things, to win the fauour of the people: as to go without ſouldiers; weare open ſhoes: apparell himſelfe like the Grecians: imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>P. Scipio,</hi> whom we haue heard to haue done the like in Sicily, when the war was hotteſt againſt the Affricans. <hi>Tiberius</hi> hauing lightly blamed him for his behauior and apparell, did moſt ſharply rebuke him, that contrary to <hi>Augustus</hi> order, &amp; without the princes licence, he had entered Alexandria. For <hi>Augustus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other ſecrets of ſtate, had reſerued Aegypt; and forbidden all Senators, Noblemen, and Gentlemen, to enter into it, but with permiſſion, leaſt Italy ſhould be oppreſſed with famine: who ſoeuer ſhould be maiſter of that prouince: being the key of the ſea and land: and eaſily defended with a ſmall power, againſt a ſtrong hoſt. But <hi>Germanicus,</hi> not knowing that his voiage was miſliked, went vp Nilus, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the towne Canopus, which the Lacedemonians built: becauſe <hi>Canopus</hi> the gouernor of their ſhip was buried there, when <hi>Meuelaus</hi> going backe to Greece, was carried to a contrary ſea, and land of Libya. The next mouth of the riuer from thence, is dedicated to <hi>Hercules;</hi> the firſt of which name was borne there, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants do report; and of whom all which come after him, of like valour and vertue, tooke their ſurname. After that, he viſited the great monuments of aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Thebes: where yet were to be ſeene Aegyptian letters in old buildings, which contained their ancient wealth. And one of their auncienteſt Prieſts, being commaunded to interpret thoſe letters in the countrey language; related, that in times paſt there had dwelt in that citie, ſeauen hundred thouſand perſons, of age fit to beare armes: and that with that armie King <hi>Rhamſes</hi> had conquered Libya, Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia, Media, and Perſia, Bactria, and Scythia, and the countries which the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, and the Armenians, and the Cappadocians, their next neighbours inhabited: and that their dominion reached from the Bithynian to the Lycian ſea. There were alſo read the tributes impoſed ouer nations, the weight of ſiluer and gold, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:18166:31"/>
and furniture of horſes and armour: the gifts giuen to the Temples, the Iuory, ſweete ſauours: and what plentie of corne; what vtenſiles euerie nation was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to furniſh; which were no leſſe magnificall, then are now commaunded, by the forces of the Parthi: or power of the Romans. But <hi>Germanicus</hi> was yet tied to other miracles: whereof the chiefeſt was, the image of <hi>Memnon</hi> made of ſtone; when it was ſtroken with the ſunne beames yeelding a ſound like a mans voice: and the Pyramides as great as mountaines, on the not paſſable ſandes; built a vie by Kings in times paſt to ſhew their riches: and the ditches wrought by handie worke to receiue the ouerflowing of Nilus; ſo narrow in ſome places, and ſo deepe in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that the bottome cannot be found by any ſearch. From thence he came to Elephantines, and Syenes, in times paſt the bounds of the Roman Empire, which now openeth to the red ſea. Whileſt <hi>Germanicus</hi> ſpent that ſommer, in viſiting ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Prouinces, <hi>Druſus</hi> gate no ſmall honour, by ſowing ſedition in Germanie: and incenſing them to purſue <hi>Maroboduus</hi> already weakened, euen to his vtter ruine. Among the Gotones, there was a noble yoong man called <hi>Catualda,</hi> who through <hi>Maroboduus</hi> violence hauing before fled his countrey; things ſtanding nowe in doubtfull termes; ventured a reuenge. And with a ſtrong power, entered the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of the Marcomans: and hauing corrupted the chiefe noble men to his confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracie, forceth the Kings pallace, and a caſtle hard by. Where he found the olde ſpoiles of the Sueuians and the baſe raſcals of our Prouince: and certaine mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants; whom intercourſe of Marchandice, and a deſire of increaſing their wealth; or laſt of all a forgetfulnes of their countrey; had drawen from their own dwellings to the enimies countrey. <hi>Maroboduus</hi> being forſaken of all hands: had no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge left, but the mercie of the Romans. And hauing paſſed the riuer of Danub, where it coaſteth the Prouince of Notica; wrote vnto <hi>Tiberius,</hi> not as a fugitiue and ſuppliant, but putting him in minde of his former fortune and eſtate: alleaging that when ſundrie nations inuited him to their alliance, being ſometimes a renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned King, he preferred the amity of the Romans before them al. <hi>Caeſar</hi> anſwered him, that he ſhould haue a ſure and honorable dwelling in Italie, if he liſted to remaine there: but if any thing of greater aduauncement ſhould happen vnto him, that he ſhould depart with the ſame ſafe conduct he came thither. Afterward he declared in Senat, that the Athenians had no ſuch cauſe to feare <hi>Philip;</hi> nor the people of Rome, <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> and <hi>Antiochus,</hi> as this man. An oration of his is yet extant, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he extolleth his power; the ſtrength of the nations he had vnder him; and how neere an enimie he was to Italie; and what plots he had deuiſed to roote him out. <hi>Maroboduus</hi> was receiued at Rauenna; that if at any time the Sueuian ſhould waxe inſolent; he was in ſight as it were alwaies readie to returne. But he departed not Italie the ſpace of eighteene yeeres, and grew old with loſſe of reputation, through ouer great deſire of liuing. The like hope had <hi>Catualda,</hi> and no other refuge: for not long after being driuen out by the Hermunduri, vnder the conduct of <hi>Vibilius,</hi> he was receiued and ſent to Forum Iulij, a colonie of Gallia Narbonenſis. The bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous people which followed both theſe; leſt being mingled among others, ſhould diſturbe the quiet Prouinces: were placed beyond Danubium betwixt the riuers Marus, and Cuſus; and a King giuen them of the Quadian nation.</p>

               <p>NEwes being come that <hi>Artaxias,</hi> was by <hi>Germanicus</hi> made King of Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia: the Lords of the Senat ordained that <hi>Germanicus</hi> and <hi>Druſus</hi> ſhould enter into the citie ouant, or with a ſmall triumphe; and that arches ſhould be erected about the ſides of the Temple of <hi>Mars</hi> the Reuenger, with the images of the two <hi>Caeſars: Tiberius</hi> being more glad that he had eſtabliſhed a peace by wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; then if he ſhould haue ended the war by a maine battell. Now he determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by ſome ſubtiltie to ſet vpon <hi>Rheſcuporis</hi> King of Thrace. That countrey once hauing beene vnder <hi>Rhoemetalces:</hi> after his death, <hi>Auguſtus</hi> gaue part of it to his brother <hi>Rheſcuporis,</hi> &amp; part to his ſonne <hi>Cotys.</hi> In that partition, the erable grounds, the cities, and places adioining to Greece fell to <hi>Cotys</hi> ſhare. That which was vnha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, wilde, and lying neere the enimie; to <hi>Rheſcuporis.</hi> The diſpoſitions alſo of thoſe Kings were ſuch, that the one was tractable and of a milde condition; this ſtout, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueteous, and impatient of a companion: and both at the firſt liuing in cunning and diſſembled concord. Then <hi>Rheſcuporis</hi> began to exceed his bounds; and draw that to himſelfe which was giuen <hi>Cotys,</hi> and vſe violence if he reſiſted: but not ſo hotly in <hi>Augustus</hi> time; whom he feared being the author of both kingdomes, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge if he were deſpiſed. But vnderſtanding of a chaunge of the Prince, he ſent in troups of theeues, beat downe his caſtles, and ſought occaſions of warre. Nothing did more trouble <hi>Tiberius,</hi> then that thoſe things which were once ſetled, ſhould now be diſturbed: and therefore making choiſe of a Centurion diſpatcheth him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to ſignifie to the Kings, that they ſhould not in any caſe enter into armes: and thereupon <hi>Cotys</hi> diſmiſſed preſently the aide he had prepared. <hi>Rheſcuporis</hi> with a fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned modeſtie, requeſteth a place of meeting, to ende their controuerſie by confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: neither did they long doubt of the time, place, and conditions; the one yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to all with a facilitie of nature; the other accepting all with a fraudulent mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. <hi>Rheſcuporis</hi> as he pretended to conclude this agreement; maketh a banket: &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the night was far ſpent with great myrth, much eating &amp; quaffing of wine; he loaded vncircumſpect <hi>Cotys</hi> with chaines: who perceiuing the treaſon, beſought him by the ſacred ceremonies of the kingdom, the gods of the ſame familie, &amp; by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of his table, he would vſe no ſuch violence. Hauing thus made himſelfe maiſter of all Thrace, he wrote to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> that there were conſpiracies wrought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and the contriuer of them preuented. And withall, pretending warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Baſtarnians, and the Scythians, maketh himſelfe ſtrong with a new power of footemen and horſemen. <hi>Tiberius</hi> wrote to him coldly againe, that if there were no fraude in his doing, he might truſt to his innocencie: but neither he nor the Senate could diſcerne the right from wrong, vnleſſe they knew the cauſe: &amp; therefore that he ſhould deliuer vp <hi>Cotys,</hi> and come to them, and purge himſelfe of the enuie of the crime. Thoſe letters <hi>Latinius Pandus</hi> Propraetor of Moeſia ſent with the ſouldiers, vnto whom <hi>Cotys</hi> ſhould be deliuered. But <hi>Rheſcuporis</hi> balancing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene anger and feare, and deſirous to be guiltie rather of the fact committed, then only attempted; commandeth <hi>Cotys</hi> to be ſlaine: and vntruly gaue it out, that he had killed himſelfe. Yet for all this, <hi>Caeſar</hi> altered not his intended courſe, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Pandus</hi> deceaſe, whom <hi>Rheſcuporis</hi> accuſed to haue beene his back friend, made <hi>Pomponius Flaccus</hi> an old ſouldier, and with whom the king was very inward, and therefore a more fit inſtrument to deceiue, for the ſame cauſe eſpeciall gouernor
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:18166:32"/>
of Moeſia. <hi>Flaccus</hi> being gone to Thrace, by way of great promiſes, perſwaded him, although doubtfull, and calling to minde his owne wickednes: to enter into the Romane garriſon, where he was garded with a ſtrong companie, vnder colour of honor. He had Tribunes and Centurions at hand to counſell and perſwade him: and the further he went, the greater gard: and at laſt knowing in what termes of neceſſitie he ſtoode, they brought him to the citie: where being accuſed in Senate by <hi>Cotys</hi> wife, he was condemned to be kept far from his countrey. Thrace was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward deuided betwixt <hi>Rhaemetalces</hi> his ſonne, who was knowne to be an enemie to his fathers proceedings, and <hi>Cotys</hi> children: which not being of full age, <hi>Trebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienus Rufus,</hi> who had beene Pretor in the meane ſeaſon, was made gouernor of the kingdome: following the example of our predeceſſors, who ſent <hi>M. Lepidus</hi> into Aegypt, to be gardian to <hi>Ptolemeus</hi> children. <hi>Rheſcuporis</hi> was caried to Alexandria, and there going about to eſcape, or becauſe it was ſo fathered on him, was killed. At the ſame time <hi>Vonones,</hi> who (as we haue ſaid) was confined in Cilicia, hauing corrupted his keepers, vnder colour of going a hunting; attempted all meanes to eſcape to the Armenians; from thence to the Albanians, and Heniochians, and to his Coſen the king of Scythia. And forſaking the ſea coaſts, gote into bywayes and forreſts: and by the ſwiftnes of his horſe, poſted with all ſpeede to the riuer Pyramus. The borderers vnderſtanding the kings eſcape, hauing broken down the bridges, &amp; he not able to paſſe at any foord, was taken by the riuers ſide, and bound by <hi>Vibius Fronto,</hi> captaine of the horſemen. Anon after <hi>Remmius Euocatus,</hi> vnto whoſe charge the king was firſt committed, as it had bene in an anger, thruſt him through with his ſword. Wherupon it was the eaſlier beleeued that he had ſo ſlaine <hi>Vonones,</hi> as one guiltie and conſenting to his eſcape, and therefore fearing he ſhould be bewraied and accuſed.</p>

Whereupon <hi>Piſo</hi> determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to depart Syria: but ſtaying a time by reaſon of <hi>Germanicus</hi> ſicknes; when he heard of his amendment, and that the vowes were accompliſhed for his health: he droue away by his ſergeants the beaſt brought to the altar, and diſturbed the preparation made for the ſacrifice, and the ſolemne meeting of the people of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch. Then he went to Seleucia, expecting the euent of his ſicknes which he fell againe into: the rage thereof ſo much the more greeuous, through an opinion that <hi>Piſo</hi> had poiſoned him: for there were found pulled out of the ground, and wals, charmes, verſes, and enchantme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: and <hi>Germanicus</hi> name engrauen in ſheetes of lead: aſhes halfe burned, and tempered with corrupt bloud, and other ſorceries, by which it is thought, that ſoules are dedicated to the infernall powers. Some alſo were accuſed to haue bene ſent from <hi>Piſo,</hi> to eſpie in what ſtate he was in. That droue <hi>Germanicus</hi> both into anger and feare, conſidering with himſelfe: if his houſe ſhould be beſieged; if he ſhould loſe his life in the ſight of his enemies: what ſhould happen after to his wofull wife, and his yong children? he ſaw that the poiſon ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſlow in working: but <hi>Piſo</hi> haſtened, that he might alone haue the gouernment of the legions and the prouince. But <hi>Germanicus</hi> was not ſo deſtitute of friends,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:18166:32"/>
that the murderer ſhould inioy the rewards of the murder. And hereupon enditeth a letter to him, in which he renounceth his friendſhip. Some adde, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded him to depart the prouince. <hi>Piſo</hi> made no longer delay, but looſeth anker, and moderated his courſe to returne the ſooner, if <hi>Germanicus</hi> death ſhould open him a way to Syria. <hi>Germanicus</hi> being a little amended, and in ſome hope: then growing feeble againe; when his end was at hand, he ſpake to his friends about him in this manner. <hi rend="margQuotes">If I ſhould die a naturall death, yet ſhould I haue iuſt cauſe of griefe againſt the gods: that by an vntimely death, they ſhuold take me in my youth from my kinsfolks, children, and countrey. But now being brought to this paſſe by the lewde practiſe of <hi>Piſo</hi> and <hi>Plancina,</hi> I leaue in your breaſts for my laſt prayers; that you ſignifie vnto my father and my brother, with what crueltie torne, with what fraude circumuented, I haue ended my miſerable life, with a moſt naughtie death. If the hopes conceiued of me haue moued any; if neerenes in bloud any: yea, if enuie towards me when I liued: they will weepe, that he who hath ſometimes flouriſhed, and eſcaped ſo many battels, ſhould now end his life by the guile and treachery of a woman: you ſhall haue occaſion to complaine to the Senate, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund the execution of lawes. This is not the chiefeſt dutie of friends, to ſhew their affection towards the dead, by a ſlow and dull complaint; but remember and execute that which they commanded. Yea, ſuch as knew not <hi>Germanicus,</hi> wil weepe for him: If you did rather loue me then my fortune, you will reuenge my death. Shew the people of Rome <hi>Augustus</hi> neece, and the ſame my wife, and my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren which are ſixe in number: the accuſers themſelues will haue compaſſion; and thoſe which pretend wicked commaundements, ſhall either not bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued, or not pardoned.</hi> His friends taking him by the right hand, ſwore they would rather loſe their life, then omit reuenge. Then turning to his wife, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated hir by the memorie of him, and by the children common betweene them, that ſhe would lay aſide all haughtines, and ſubmit her courage to raging for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: leſt returning to the citie, ſhe ſtirred not with emulation of greatnes more powerable then her ſelfe againſt her. Thus much he vttered openly, and other things in ſecret; whereby it was coniectured he ſtoode in feare of <hi>Tiberius.</hi> Not long after he yeelded vp the ghoſt, with great lamentation of the Prouince and countries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout; forren nations and Kings lamented alſo: ſo great was his courteſie to his allies; and mildnes to his enimies. He was no leſſe venerable to thoſe which ſawe him, than to thoſe which heard of him: and did ſo well temper the greatnes of high eſtate &amp; grauitie; that he auoided both enuie &amp; arrogancie. His funerals although he had neither images nor pompe: yet by the commendation and memorie of his vertues, were honoured of all men. Some there were which compared his fauour, his age, and manner of death, by reaſon of the vicinitie of the places wherein they died, vnto <hi>Alexander</hi> the great. For being both of a comely ſtature, noble paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, not much aboue thirtie yeeres of age: they died in ſtrange countries, by the trecherie of their owne people. But this man was courteous towards his friends, moderate in pleaſures, &amp; his children certaine, begotten in marriage by one woman. Neither was he to be counted a leſſe warrior then the other: although he were not raſh, &amp; hindered to reduce vnder the yoke of ſeruitude the Germans daunted with ſo many victories. And if he alone had, had the ſupreme managing of affaires, and power, &amp; a name of a King: ſo much the ſooner he would haue carried away the priſe &amp; renowne of warfare, by how much he did excel him in clemencie, temperancie, &amp; other good vertues. His bodie before it ſhould be burned, was laid naked in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket place of <hi>Antioche,</hi> which was the place appointed for his buriall. Whether he

               <p>IN the meane ſeaſon a meſſenger, ouertaketh and aduertiſeth <hi>Piſo,</hi> at the Iland Cous, that <hi>Germanicus</hi> was departed. Which tidings he receiued intemperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, offered ſacrifices, viſited the temples, nothing moderating his ioy; and <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cina</hi> growing more inſolent, then firſt changed the mourning weede, ſhe ware for the death of hir ſiſter, into a ioifull attire. The Centurions flocking about him, told him, that he had the good will of the legions, at his deuotion; that it was his beſt to returne to the prouince, wrongfully taken from him, and now voide of a gouernour. Whereupon taking aduiſe what was beſt to be done; his ſonne <hi>M.

The variance betweene him and <hi>Germanicus,</hi> was woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie perhaps of ſome rebuke, but not puniſhment: and by taking the prouince from him, his enimies were ſatisfied. But if he ſhould returne, <hi>Sentius</hi> being againſt him, a newe ciuill warre would begin. Neither would the Centurions and ſouldiers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue on his ſide; with whom the freſh memory of their captaine, and the loue deepely printed in their harts towards the <hi>Caeſars</hi> woulde preuaile. <hi>Domitius Celer,</hi> one of his inwardeſt friends, perſwaded the contrarie. <hi rend="margQuotes">That he ought to take the time when it was offered: that <hi>Piſo</hi> and not <hi>Sentius</hi> was made gouernour of Syria: vnto him were the faſces, and dignitie of Pretor giuen, to him the legions commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

forward enough of himſelf to haughtie attempts, was with ſmall adoe drawen to this opinion. And ſending letters to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> accuſeth <hi>Germanicus</hi> of riot and pride: and that himſelfe was driuen out of the prouince, bicauſe there might be a way made open to innouation: that he had againe taken charge of the armie, with the ſame fidelitie, as he had alreadie gouerned it. Withall, he commanded <hi>Domitius,</hi> with a galley to ſaile into Syria: and auoiding the coaſting of the ſhoare, and letting paſſe the Ilands, take wide and open ſea. Then marſhalling and arming runnagates, and raſcall baſe companions, and ſailing ouer to the continent, he intercepted an enſigne of yoong and rawe ſouldiers, which were going to Syria. And writeth alſo to the Lords of Cilicia, to ſend him aide: the yoong man <hi>Piſo</hi> being nothing ſlacke in the ſeruice, although he was againſt the vndertaking of the warre. Wherefore paſſing by the coaſt of Lycia, &amp; Pamphylia, meeting with the ſhips which had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueied <hi>Agrippina</hi> to Rome, each ſide hating one another; made themſelues readie to fight: yet both ſides fearing the one the other, they proceeded no further then to hard words. <hi>Mirſus Vibius</hi> ſommoned <hi>Piſo</hi> to come to Rome to anſwere for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: who ſcoffingly anſwered him againe, that he would come and appeere, when the Pretor which was to inquire of poiſonings, would appoint a day as well for the plaintif, as defenda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. In the meane time <hi>Domitius</hi> being ariued at Laodicea, a citie in Syria; and going to the ſtanding camp of the ſixt legion, as moſt fit for new enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, was preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted by the Lieutena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t <hi>Pacuuius. Sentius</hi> openeth that by letters to <hi>Piſo;</hi> warning him not to go about to tempt the armie with corrupters, nor raiſe any war in the Prouince. And ſuch as he knew to haue <hi>Germanicus</hi> in minde, or were aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries to the enimies, he aſſembled togither: putting them ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in mind of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the Emperor, and how the common-wealth was aſſailed; and thereupon ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth a ſtrong power readie to fight. Yet neither <hi>Piſo,</hi> nor his ſide, although his enterpriſes fell out otherwiſe, than he expected; did let ſlip that which was of moſt ſafetie for the preſent; but putteth himſelfe in a verie ſtrong caſtle in Cilicia, called Celenderis. For by ſorting and medling togither the runnagates, the new and raw ſoldier lately taken, his owne and <hi>Plancinaes</hi> ſlaues, and the aides which the Lords of Cilicia ſent, he marſhalled them in forme of a legion. <hi rend="margQuotes">And then affirmed that he was <hi>Caeſars</hi> Lieutenant: but drouen out of the Prouince committed to him; not by the legions, for they called him thither; but by <hi>Sentius,</hi> which cloaked his priuate malice with falſe crimes: therfore that they ſhould ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſtoutly to the battel; bicauſe the ſoldiers would not fight, when they ſhould ſee <hi>Piſo</hi> whom heretofore they called their father. If they would proceed by order of iuſtice, the right was on his ſide: if by armes, he wanted not ſtrength.</hi> Then he diſplaied his companies in order of battell, before the caſtle on a ſteepe craggie hils ſide: the reſt being inuironed with ſea. On the contrarie ſide the old ſoldiers, with their ſupplies were marſhalled into rankes. On this ſide was the ſtrength of ſouldiers: one that of place. In courage and hope there was great oddes alſo: and on their ſide no weapons, but rude and clowniſh, prepared for a preſent ſhift. And when they came to handie ſtrokes; there was no lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger doubt who ſhould haue the vpper hand, but til the Roman cohorts could win the plaine ground: which done, the Cilicians ſhewed their backs, &amp; ſhut themſelues in their fort.

                  <hi>XIX.</hi> Great bewailing for <hi>Germanicus</hi> death: ſtrange religions ſuppreſſed: looſe life reſtrained in women of account.</head>
               <p>BVt when <hi>Germanicus</hi> ſicknes was noiſed at Rome; and as in newes it falleth out, the farther it goeth, augmented to the worſer: all men burſt out into anger, griefe, and complaints: ſaying, that therefore he was ſent to forren countries: that was the reaſon why <hi>Piſo</hi> had the prouince committed to him: this was the effect of <hi>Augustaes</hi> ſecret conference with <hi>Plancina:</hi> that the auncient men ſaid moſt truly of <hi>Druſus,</hi> that the courteous and modeſt diſpoſition of children doth diſlike ſuch as raigne. Neither were they made away for any other reaſon, but becauſe, libertie reſtored; they had a meaning to reduce the people of Rome to a certain equalitie. Theſe ſpeeches of the common people, the newes of his death did ſo much kindle; that before any edict of Magiſtrates, before any decree of Senate was made, vacation being taken of themſelues; the places of iudgement were aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned; houſes ſhut vp; ſilence and mourning euery where: nothing of all this counterfeited or done for oſtentation. And although they did not abſtaine from outward tokens of mourning, yet in their harts they mourned much more. Certaine Merchants returning by chaunce out of Syria, <hi>Germanicus</hi> yet liuing, bringing ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full tidings of his health, were preſently beleeued, and ſpread abroad: and as they met one another (although they had ſcarſe heard the tale to the end) yet they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported it againe, and they againe to others, ſtill making it more, and increaſing their ioy. They ran vp and downe the citie, went about to wreſt open the gates of the temples: the night furthered their credulouſnes, and in the darke euery man more readie to affirme. Neither did <hi>Tiberius</hi> gainſay theſe falſe reports, but let them vaniſh away with time. But then the people, as though he had beene a ſecond time taken from them, greeued more bitterly. Such was his funerall pomp done in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of him, as either mens loue, or pregnancie of conceipt could inuent: as that his name ſhould be ſung in a Salarian verſe, which <hi>Mars</hi> prieſts were wont to ſing: that in the roomes of the Auguſtall prieſts, chaires of eſtate ſhould be placed, with garlands of oake: that his image grauen in Iuory, ſhould be caried before the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſian plaies: and that none ſhould be created Flamen or Augur in <hi>Germanicus</hi> place, vnleſſe he were of the Iulian familie. At Rome, and at the banke of Rhene, and on the hill Amanus in Syria, were erected arches, with an inſcription of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploites: and that he died for the common wealth: a ſepulchre at Antioch where his bodie was burnt: a tribunal at Epidaphna, where he ended, his life. It would be hard to number the images and places in which he was honored. And when ſome thought it conuenient that he ſhould haue a ſheeld of exquiſite gold and greatnes, dedicated him among the authors of eloquence: <hi>Tiberius</hi> ſaide he ſhould haue none but ſuch as was vſuall, and equall to the reſt: for neither was eloquence to be iudged of by fortune: and that it was a ſufficient honor for him, if he were put in the number of auncient writers. That which before was called the band of yong men,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:18166:34"/>
the Gentlemen called <hi>Germanicus cuneum,</hi> or pointed battell: and ordained that the ſquadrons of horſemen ſhould follow his image the Ides of Iuly. Many of theſe ceremonies yet remaine; ſome were preſently left off; and ſome, time wore out. But whileſt this griefe was yet freſh in euery mans memorie; <hi>Liuia Germanicus</hi> ſiſter, and <hi>Druſus</hi> wife, was at once deliuered of two ſonnes: which being a thing rare, and welcome, euen to meane families, did ſo reioice the Prince, that hee could not containe (for euen caſuall things he attributed to his glorie) but muſt needes bragge before the Lordes of the Senate, that no other of the Romans of his greatnes, had euer before had two male children at a birth. But in ſuch a time euen that alſo, brought griefe vnto the people; as though that <hi>Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> increaſe of children, would the rather depreſſe <hi>Germanicus</hi> houſe. The ſame yeere womens laſciuious life, was puniſhed by ſeuere decrees of Senat; and ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that none ſhould put their bodies to ſale, whoſe grandfather, father, or husband had beene a gentleman of Rome. For <hi>Vistilia</hi> deſcended of a pretorian familie, had made hir looſe licentious life knowen to the Aediles; according to a receiued cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome among the auncients; who thought it a ſufficient puniſhment for vnchaſte women, if publickly they confeſſed their lewdnes. And <hi>Titidius Labeo, Viſtilias</hi> huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, was called into queſtion, bicauſe he had not inflicted the puniſhment of the law, on his wife manifeſtly taken in the offence. But he for his excuſe, alleaged that the three ſcore daies giuen to deliberate, were not yet paſt; and therefore thinking it enough to puniſh <hi>Vistilia;</hi> ſhe was confined in the Iland Seriphon. It was deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Senat touching the rooting out of the Aegyptian &amp; Iudaical ceremonies: &amp; a decree made that fower thouſand libertines of competent age, infected with that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, ſhould be conueied into the Iland Sardinia, to ſuppreſſe robberies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted there: and if they ſhould die through the vnwholeſomnes of the aire, the loſſe were but vile and ſmall: and that the reſt ſhould depart Italie, if before a certain day they would not forſake thoſe prophane rites. When thoſe things were done, <hi>Caeſar</hi> propounded, that another virgin ſhould be receiued in the roome of <hi>Oecia;</hi> who with verie great integritie, ſeuen and fiſtie yeeres, had beene gouerneſſe of the ceremonies of the Veſtall virgins: and gaue thankes to <hi>Fonteius Agrippa,</hi> and <hi>Domitius Pollio;</hi> who offering their daughters, ſtroue in dutie to the common wealth. But <hi>Pollios</hi> daughter was preferred for no other reaſon, but bicauſe her mother had continued wife to her firſt husband: <hi>Agrippa</hi> hauing diminiſhed the reputation of his houſe with diuorcement. Yet <hi>Caeſar</hi> in regard the other was preferred, did comfort her with <note n="*" place="margin">About 78. 2. pound. 10 ſhil.</note> ten hundred thouſand ſeſterces for her dowrie. The people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of a dearth of corne, he put downe a price for the buier; promiſing to paie of his owne in euerie buſhell <note n="*" place="margin">Three pence ob. q.</note> two nummos. Yet for all this, he would not take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him, the title of father of his countrey, before offered him: but did ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie rebuke them, who had called his affaires diuine, and him Lord. And therefore vnder a Prince which feared libertie, and hated flatterie; all ſpeeches ought to be briefe; and yet can hardly eſcape captious conſtruction. I finde in auncient writers of that time, that <hi>Adgandeſtrius</hi> Prince of the Chatti, letters were read in Senat, promiſing <hi>Arminius</hi> death, if poiſon were ſent him to commit the deed. And that it was anſwered him, that the people of Rome vſed not to reuenge on their enimies by treachery and priuie meanes; but openly and armed. Wherein <hi>Tiberius</hi> equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led himſelfe to the old Roman Captaines, which did forbid king <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> to be poiſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but diſcloſed it vnto him. Now <hi>Arminius,</hi> the Romans being departed, and <hi>Maroboduus</hi> expulſed, earneſtly coueting the kingdome, had the people as defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their libertie againſt him: and being aſſailed, and fighting with doubtfull

fortune, was ſlaine by the fraud of his own neerſt familiars. Doubtleſſe the deliuerer of Germanie; and who prouoked, not as other Kings &amp; Captaines had done, the firſt ſpringing vp of the people of Rome; but when they flouriſhed moſt in rule and Empire. In his battels, he had doubtfull fortune, ſometimes luckie, ſometimes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckie; but neuer was ouercome in war. He liued full ſeuen and thirtie yeeres, and was Prince twelue. To this day he is famous amongſt barbarous nations; but in the Annales of the Greeks, which admire nothing but their own dooings vnknown; and not greatly ſpoken of among the Romans.

In the meane time, her arriuall knowen, her deereſt friends, and eſpecially ſouldiers which had ſerued vnder <hi>Germanicus;</hi> and manie alſo which ſhe knew not, from the townes round about: ſome thinking it to be their dutie towards their Prince; and many following them flocked to Brundiſium, being the neereſt and ſafeſt place of landing. And as ſoone as her ſhips were diſcerned a far off: not onely the hauen and places neere the ſea ſide; but the walles and houſe tops, and other places, from whence a man might fartheſt kenne; were filled with a mourning and heauie multitude of people: asking (as not knowing what was fitteſt for the time) one another, whether they ſhould receiue her with ſilence, or acclamation, when ſhe came out of her ſhip. But when by little and little the ſhips drew neere, they ſawe no cheerefull rowing, as the manner was wont to be: but all of them compoſed to ſadnes. But being come to land with her two children; holding the funerall pot with her husbands aſhes in her hand, and her eies fixed on the ground: all men began to bewaile and lament alike. Neither couldeſt thou haue diſcerned the lamentation of kinsfolkes from the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; nor the women from the men: ſauing, that the freſh griefe of ſuch as went to meete her, exceeded the lamentation of her traine, alreadie wearied with long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of ſorrow. <hi>Caeſar</hi> had ſent two companies of his guarde to meete them: and gaue further charge, that the magiſtrates of Calabria, the Apuleians, &amp; Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panians, ſhould ſolemniſe the laſt obſequies in memorie of his ſonne. The aſhes were carried on the Tribunes and Centurions ſhoulders; the enſignes vntrimmed; and the faſces or knitch of rods, turned downewards, went before: and when they paſſed by any colonies, the common people in mourning weede, and gentlemen in their attire called Trabea, according to the wealth of the place, burnt garments, ſweete odors: with other accuſtomed funerall ſolemnities. Yea ſuch whoſe townes were far off, yet met them; erected altars; offered ſacrifices to the infernall gods; witneſſing their dolour with teares and cries. <hi>Druſus</hi> went to Terracina with his brother <hi>Claudius,</hi> &amp; <hi>Germanicus</hi> children, which had remained in the citie. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls, <hi>M. Valerius,</hi> &amp; <hi>M Aurelius</hi> (who began then to enter into office) the Senat and a great part of the people filled vp the way, ſcattered hither &amp; thither, weeping, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery mans affection was. Flattery there was none: all men knowing, that the death of <hi>Germanicus,</hi> ioyfull to <hi>Tiberius;</hi> could badly be diſſembled, howſoeuer he counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited the contrary. <hi>Tiberius</hi> and <hi>Augusta,</hi> abſtained from mourning in publicke: iudging it a thing, vnder their maieſtie, if they ſhould be ſeene openly to lament: or leaſt, the eies of all men obſeruing their countenance, ſhould eſpie they did but counterfeit. I finde not in any author, or diurnall regiſter, that his mother <hi>Antonia</hi>

I ſhould eaſlier haue beleeued, that <hi>Tiberius</hi> and <hi>Augusta,</hi> which kept within doores, made hir do the like: that their griefe might be iudged equall: and that the grandmother and vncle, ſhould ſeeme to haue kept in, by the example of the mother. The day that the aſhes were put in <hi>Augustus</hi> tombe, was ſometimes with ſilence deſolate and ſtill; and on the ſudden vnquiet with weeping: all paſſages of the citie were full: Campus Martius ſhined with burning torches. There the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier with his weapons; the magiſtrates without the markes of their dignitie and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; and the people gathered into tribes and companies cried: that the common-wealth was fallen to ground; and no hope left: and that ſo openly, and boldly, that thou wouldeſt haue beleeued, they did not remember by whom they were gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Yet nothing went ſo neere <hi>Tiberius</hi> hart, as the ardent affection men bare <hi>Agrippina:</hi> calling hir the honour of their countrey; the onely bloud of <hi>Augustus;</hi> the patterne of antiquitie: and turning towards the heauen, and the gods, praied that hir iſſue might long continue, and ouerliue the wicked. Some deſired that the funerals might be celebrated with publike pompe: comparing the magnificence and honors that <hi>Augustus</hi> had vſed for <hi>Druſus, Germanicus</hi> father. And, that he in the hardeſt time of winter, went as farre as Ticinum: and how neuer once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from the bodie, accompanied it to the citie. That about the coffin were the images of the Claudians and Iulians: that he was bewailed in the place of publike aſſemblies: praiſed with an oration before the people: and all honors done him, which either our aunceſtors or later times could inuent. But <hi>Germanicus</hi> had not ſo much as the vſuall ſolemnities done for him: his body through diſtance of place, was in ſome ſort burnt, in ſtrange lands: but by ſo much the more, honours ſhoulde nowe haue beene beſtowed vpon him, bicauſe fortune had denied him the firſt. His brothers went to meete him but one daies iourney: his vncle not ſo farre as to the gate. Where are the auncient cuſtomes become? why was not his image put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Beere; and verſes ſung in memorie of his vertues? why was he not praiſed, and bewailed, with the vſuall repreſentation of mourning? All this was well known to <hi>Tiberius;</hi> and to ſuppreſſe the ſpeech of the common people, he admoniſhed them by edict. <hi rend="margQuotes">That although many notable Romans had died for the common-wealth: yet none had euer beene bewailed with ſuch an ardent affection.

               <p>THe vacation ended, euery man returned to his buſines: and <hi>Druſus</hi> went to the armie of Illyricum: the people bent to demaund a reuenge of <hi>Piſo;</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained that he in the meane time now here, now there, in the pleaſant coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of Aſia, and Affrike, with a prowd and ſubtill delay, did ſhift off the proofes brought againſt his lewdnes. For it was commonly rumored, that <hi>Martina,</hi> as I haue before ſaid, a woman infamous for poiſoning, was ſent to Rome by <hi>C. Sentius,</hi> and being ſuddenly dead at Brundiſium, had no token vpon her that ſhe had taken her owne bane; and that the poiſon was found hidden in a knarle of her haire. But <hi>Piſo</hi> hauing ſent his ſonne before him to the citie, with leſſons how to pacifie the Prince, went towards <hi>Druſus,</hi> not hoping to finde him cruell in his behalfe, for the death of his brother, but rather fauorable, as being rid of ſuch a concurrent. <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> to make a ſhew of vpright dealing, hauing entertained the yong man courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, vſed the like liberalitie towards him as he was accuſtomed to do to the noble mens children of ſuch as he was familiar with. <hi>Druſus</hi> anſwered him, that if the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations layd againſt him were true, the greateſt griefe ſhould be his: and for his owne part he could wiſh they ſhould be falſe and vaine; and that <hi>Germanicus</hi> death might be preiudiciall to none. Theſe words were openly vttered, and not in ſecret; neither was it doubted at all, but that <hi>Tiberius</hi> had before hand taught him his leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; when as being plaine, ſimple, and yong, yet ſhewed the cunning of the old man. <hi>Piſo</hi> hauing paſt ouer the Dalmatian ſea, and left his ſhips at Ancona, went by Picenum, and after by the Flaminian way, ouertooke the legion which was brought from Pannony to Rome, to lye in garriſon in Affricke: being common in euery mans mouth, how in the campe and in the way he did often ſhew himſelfe to the ſouldiers. From Narnia (whether it were to auoide ſuſpition, or becauſe ſuch as ſtand in feare are irreſolute in their determinations) being conueyed by Nare, and anon after by Tiber, he increaſed the euill will of the people towards him, becauſe he landed neere the <hi>Caeſars</hi> tombe: on a day when the ſhore was full of people: many followers after him: and <hi>Plancina</hi> accompanied with a traine of women, both, pleaſant and cheerefull in countenance. Among other cauſes of enuie and hart-burning, <hi>Piſoes</hi> houſe was one, looking on the market place, trimmed to feaſt and banket in, where nothing could be hidden. The next day <hi>Fulcinius Trio,</hi> accuſed <hi>Piſo</hi> before the Conſuls. <hi>Vitellius</hi> and <hi>Veranius,</hi> and the reſt which had followed <hi>Germanicus,</hi> alleaged that that was their office, and that <hi>Trio</hi> had no part therein: and that as witneſſes and openers of the cauſe; and not as accuſers, they were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that which <hi>Germanicus</hi> had giuen them in charge. <hi>Trio</hi> relinquiſhing the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, obtained licence to accuſe his former life: and the Prince intreated to receiue the hearing of the cauſe to himſelfe: which the defendant refuſed not, as miſdoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Senators, and peoples good will: and contrary, being well aſſured that <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi> regarded not rumors, but would leane to his mothers conſcience: and that the truth; or things beleeued and wreſted to the worſt, might eaſilier be diſcerned by one iudge: whereas hatred and enuie beare the ſway where there are many. <hi>Tiberius</hi> was not ignorant, how waightie a cauſe he vndertooke, and how diuerſly he was cenſured: and therefore calling ſome of his familiar friends about him, hearing the menaces of the accuſers; then the requeſt of the partie arraigned, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the whole cauſe to the Senate. In the meane ſeaſon, <hi>Druſus</hi> returning from Illyrium: although the Senators had decreed, that for receiuing of <hi>Maroboduus,</hi>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:18166:37"/>
and exploits done the ſommer paſt, he ſhould enter the citie, ouant, or with a ſmall triumph: yet deferring that honor for the time, he entered priuately. After that <hi>Piſo</hi> had demauded <hi>T. Arruntius, Fulcinius, Aſinius Gallus, Aeſerninus, Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, Sext. Pompeius</hi> for his aduocates; and all of them alleaging diuers excuſes, <hi>M. Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidus, L. Piſo,</hi> and <hi>Liueneius Regulus</hi> vndertooke his defence: the whole citie being attentiue to know how <hi>Germanicus</hi> friends would ſtick vnto him; what hope the partie arraigned had; whether <hi>Tiberius</hi> were able to maiſter his affections, or would ſhew himſelfe. All theſe things were greedily expected of the people: neuer ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelues more attentiue, nor at any time licencing themſelues a more ſecret ſpeech of the Prince, or ſuſpicious ſilence. The day that the Senat met, <hi>Caeſar</hi> made a premeditate oration, tempered in this ſort, ſaying: <hi rend="margQuotes">That <hi>Piſo</hi> had beene his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Lieutenant and friend, and giuen by him to <hi>Germanicus</hi> as a coadiutor, by the authoritie of the Senate, in the adminiſtration of the affaires of the Eaſt: but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had there exaſperated the yong Prince, through diſobedience and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and whether he had ſhewed himſelfe glad of his death: or villanouſly had made him away; that they ſhould iudge of that with vpright conſciences. For if being Lieutenant, he hath gone beyond the bounds of his office: and ſhaken off his dutie to his lord generall: and reioyſed in his death, and my griefe: I will hate him, and eſtrange him from my houſe, and reuenge, not the Princes, but priuat grudges. If any villanous deede be detected in him worthie of reuenge, euen in the death of any priuat perſon, affoord your ſelues, and <hi>Germanicus</hi> children, and vs, his father, reaſonable and iuſt comfort. And examine alſo whether ſeditiouſly and muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly <hi>Piſo</hi> hath ſtirred vp the armie: whether by ambition he hath ſought to win the fauour of the ſouldiers: whether he returned into the prouince by force of armes: or whether theſe things be falſe; and made greater then they are, by the accuſers: with whoſe ouergreat affection I haue iuſt cauſe to be offended. For to what purpoſe ſhould his body be ſhewen naked; be handled of the common people; and bruted abroade among ſtrangers, as though he had beene empoiſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; if theſe things be yet vncertaine, and are to be inquired of? I lament true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and am greeued for my ſonne, and alwaies ſhall. But I hinder not the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, to alleage all he can, for the purgation of his innocencie: or if <hi>Germanicus</hi> had any fault woorthie of reprehenſion. And I beſeech you, not to take the crimes as already prooued, bicauſe the cauſe is ioined with my ſorrow. If either his neernes in bloud, or his owne faithfulnes, hath yeelded him anie to defende his cauſe; helpe him, as much as in you lieth, either by your eloquence or care, in this his extremitie. To the ſame labour and conſtancie, I exhort the accuſers. <hi>Germanicus</hi> this onely priuiledge we will affoord aboue the lawes: that his death ſhall be rather inquired of in the Curia, then in the Forum: before the Senat, then other Iudges. Let all the reſt be debated with like modeſtie, nothing regarding <hi>Druſus</hi> teares: or my griefe: or if anie ſlaunders be forged againſt me.</hi> After that, the accuſers had two daies gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them to bring in their accuſations; &amp; after ſixe daies were paſt, the defanda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t had three more to iuſtifie himſelfe. Then <hi>Fulcinius</hi> began with ſtale and friuolous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: as that he had gouerned Spaine ambitiouſly, and couetouſly. Whereof being conuicted, he could not be intereſſed; if he could purge himſelfe of the later crimes: nor if he could defend himſelfe from that accuſation; yet was he not acquitted, if greater matters were laide to his charge. After him <hi>Seruaeus,</hi> and <hi>Veranius,</hi> and <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellius</hi> with like affection; but <hi>Vitellius</hi> with greater eloquence obiected that <hi>Piſo,</hi> for hatred to <hi>Germanicus</hi> and deſire of innouation, had ſo farre corrupted the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſoldier with licentiouſnes and iniuries towards the confederates: that of the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:18166:37"/>
lewdeſt ſort, he was called the father of the legions. Further, that he had vſed cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie againſt euery good man; and eſpecially againſt <hi>Germanicus</hi> followers &amp; friends: in the end, that he had killed him with poiſon and inchantments. Then, that he and <hi>Plancina</hi> vſed wicked ceremonies and ſacrifices: that he had borne armes againſt the common-wealth: that he woulde neuer haue appeared in iudgement, had he not been ouercome in battell. In manie things his defence was weake: for he coulde not denie but that he had woone the ſoldier by ambition: or that he had not expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the prouince as a praie, to the lewdeſt ſort: nor the iniurious ſpeeches againſt the generall. Onely he ſeemed to haue purged himſelfe of the empoiſoning: which indeed the accuſers did not ſufficiently prooue: accuſing him to haue empoiſoned <hi>Germanicus</hi> meate with his hand, which was infected, as he ſate aboue him at a ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet. For it ſeemed abſurd, that he ſhould dare ſo bold an attempt, amongſt other mens ſeruants, in the ſight of ſo many ſtanders by, and in <hi>Germanicus</hi> owne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. And thereupon he offered his familie, and was verie earneſt that his ſeruitors might be examined vpon the racke. But the Iudges were implacable for diuers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects: <hi>Caeſar</hi> bicauſe he had made warre againſt the prouince: the Senators, bicauſe they could neuer beleeue, but that <hi>Germanicus</hi> died by trechery: and that they had expoſtulated the matter by letters the one to the other. Which <hi>Tiberius</hi> did no leſſe denie then <hi>Piſo.</hi> Withall, the outcrie of the people was heard before the Senate houſe, that they woulde not temper their hands, if he eſcaped by ſentence of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. And they had drawen <hi>Piſoes</hi> images to the Gemonies; and broken them in peeces, if they had not beene ſaued, and put in their places againe, by the princes commaundement. <hi>Piſo</hi> was caried backe in a chariot, by a Tribune of the Pretorian band, diuerſly rumored: whether he followed him as a garde for his ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or executioner of his death. The like hatred was toward <hi>Plancina,</hi> but greater fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour: and therefore it was doubted, how farre <hi>Caeſars</hi> authoritie woulde reach in hir behalfe. As long as there was any hope left for <hi>Piſo,</hi> ſhe promiſed to take part of whatſoeuer fortune with him: and if it ſo fell out, to be his companion in death. But ſhe was no ſooner pardoned through <hi>Auguſtaes</hi> ſecret intreatie, but ſhe began by little and little, to ſeparate hir-ſelfe from hir husbande, and bring hir defences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part. The which when <hi>Piſo</hi> perceiued, to aboade his vtter deſtruction: doubting whether he ſhould make any further triall in iudgement: his ſons perſwading him, he hardneth himſelfe, and goeth once againe to the Senate. Where his accuſation being renewed, and the Senators voices againſt him; and hauing endured all things aduers and cruell: he was amazed at nothing more, then that he ſaw <hi>Tiberius</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pitie, without anger, reſolute, and not ſwaied with any affection. Being brought home from thence, as though he had premeditated ſome iuſtification for the next day: he writeth, ſealeth, and deliuereth ſome fewe lines vnto a freed man. This done, he gaue himſelfe to the accuſtomed care of his bodie. Then the night being farre ſpent, his wife going out of the chamber; he commaundeth the doores to be ſhut: and the next morning earely, he was found with his throte cut, the ſword lying on the ground. I remember I haue heard of auncient men, that <hi>Piſo</hi> was often ſeene to haue a little booke in his hands which he publiſhed not: but as his friends ſaid, it contained <hi>Tiberius</hi> letters, &amp; Commiſſion againſt <hi>Germanicus:</hi> and that he had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to diſcloſe it to the Lords of the Senat, and accuſe the Prince; had he not beene deluded by <hi>Seianus</hi> vaine promiſes: and that he killed not himſelfe, but that ſome one was ſent to murder him. But I will not aſſure, either of thoſe things: although I ought not to conceale it to haue been vttered by thoſe, which liued vntil I came to mans eſtate.</p>

By the ſeruice of fiue &amp; fortie yeares, by the fellowſhip of the Conſulſhip which we bore together, once liked of <hi>Augustus</hi> the father, and a friend to thee; I recommend vnto thee as my laſt requeſt, my vnfortunate ſonnes life.</hi> Of <hi>Plancina</hi> he added no word. After this, <hi>Tiberius</hi> excuſed the yong man of the ciuill warres, becauſe the ſonne could not diſobey the fathers commaundement: withall, he had compaſſion on the noblenes of his houſe, and his owne heauie fortune, howſoeuer he had deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.

Shall not that haue place in <hi>Germanicus,</hi> which the law doth permit all other citizens? <hi>Caeſar</hi> was bewailed by <hi>Vitellius</hi> and <hi>Veranius: Plancina</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by the Emperour and <hi>Augusta:</hi> that now ſhe might conuert her skill and poiſons which ſhe had ſo happely experimented, againſt <hi>Agrippina</hi> and her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and ſatiat the good grandmother and vncle with the bloud of a moſt miſerable houſe.</hi> Two dayes were ſpent vnder colour of examining the cauſe: <hi>Tiberius</hi> vrging <hi>Piſoes</hi> children, to defend their mother: and when the accuſers and witneſſes, had ſpoken a vie againſt her, and no man anſwered for her, pitie increaſed more then enuie againſt her. <hi>Aurelius Cotta</hi> being firſt demaunded his opinion (for <hi>Caeſar</hi> propounding the caſe, the magiſtrates ſpake firſt) gaue his cenſure that the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of <hi>Piſo</hi> ſhould be blotted out of the Chronicles: that part of his goods ſhould be confiſcated; and part beſtowed vpon <hi>Gn.

He hindered both, alleaging that thoſe things were to be dedicated and offered for forren victories, and that domeſticall aduerſities ought to be buried in ſorrow. <hi>Meſſallinus</hi> added, that thanks ſhould be giuen to <hi>Tiberius</hi> and <hi>Augusta,</hi> to <hi>Antonie</hi> and <hi>Agrippina,</hi> and to <hi>Druſus</hi> for <hi>Germanicus</hi> reuenge, not once mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Claudius.</hi> And <hi>L.

               <p>BVt <hi>Druſus</hi> being gone out of the citie, once more to learne future things by the flieng of birds; entereth in againe, with a ſmall triumphe. And a fewe daies after, <hi>Vipſania</hi> his mother died, onely of all <hi>Agrippas</hi> children, of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall death: becauſe it was certainely beleeued, that ſome died by the ſword; others by poiſon or famine. The ſame yeere <hi>Tacfarinas,</hi> who as I haue ſaide was the laſt ſommer driuen out by <hi>Camillus,</hi> renueth the warre in Affricke: at the firſt by ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing pillages; vnreuenged by reaſon of his ſudden comming; then by waſting of vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages; and carrieng away great booties; and laſt of al not far from the riuer Pagyda he beſieged a Roman cohort. One <hi>Decrius</hi> was Captaine of the fort, a luſtie man, and of good skill in matters of warre: who taking that beſieging as a diſgrace to himſelfe; encourageth his ſouldiers to fight in open fielde; and marſhalled his armie in order of battell before the fortreſſe. The cohort being beaten backe at the firſt brunt: he runneth in among the weapons of ſuch as fled; rebuking the ſtandard bearers, that a Roman ſouldier would ſhew his back, to a few vntrained raw traitors. And hauing receiued wounds, and an eie ſtroken out; yet put himſelfe in the face of the enimie; neuer leauing of fighting, vntill he was forſaken of his companie and ſlaine in the place. Which when <hi>L. Apronius</hi> (who ſuceeded <hi>Camillus)</hi> vnderſtood: being more perplexed with the ſhame of his own people; then glory of the enemie: he draweth out by lot (a rare matter in thoſe daies though in old times practiſed) euerie tenth perſon of the diſhonorable band, &amp; beateth him with cudgels to death. Which ſeueritie wrought ſo great good, that an enſigne of old ſouldiers, in number not aboue fiue hundred; defeated <hi>Tacfarinas</hi> armie, going about to aſſault a fort cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Thala. In which battell <hi>Ruffus Heluius,</hi> a common ſouldier, got the credit of ſauing a citizens life: on whom <hi>L.

                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:18166:39"/>
had not giuen it by his proconſularie authoritie. But <hi>Tacfarinas</hi> perceiuing the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midians to be daunted, &amp; refuſing to beſiege any longer, ſcattered his war; giuing ground when he was purſued: and following a freſh when their backes were turned. Which maner of fight vſed by the Barbarian, moleſted and kept the Roman plaie, to no purpoſe. But after that greedy of pray, he drew to the ſea coaſtes, and there encamped. <hi>Apronius Ceſianus</hi> being ſent thither by his fathers appointment, with a troupe of horſmen and aid cohorts; adding vnto them the rudeſt of the legions; had a proſperous fight, and droue the Numidian to the deſarts. <hi>Lepida,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the honor of the Aemilian familie, from which ſhe was deſcended; had L. <hi>Sulla,</hi> and <hi>Cn.

For perceiuing the offence to be common in the mouth both of man and woman; and terming it by a rigorous name, of religion

violated, or treaſon; he paſſed the bondes of his aunceſtors clemencie, and his owne lawes. But I will lay downe the endes of others, and what hath hapned in that age: if hauing finiſhed this which I haue begun I ſhall haue longer life, to vndertake farther matter. <hi>Decius Silanus,</hi> who was accuſed to haue commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted adulterie with <hi>Augustus</hi> Neece, although there was no ſeuerer puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment decreed againſt him, then that he ſhoulde be depriued of <hi>Caeſars</hi> friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; yet interpreting that to be a baniſhment, durſt neuer intreate pardon of the Senate and the Prince, vntill <hi>Tiberius</hi> came to be Emperour; and that by his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>M. Silanus</hi> credit and authoritie, for his great nobilitie and eloquence highly eſteemed. But <hi>Silanus</hi> thanking <hi>Tiberius:</hi> he anſwered before the Lords of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that he was glad of his brothers returne from a long peregrination: and that he might lawfully ſo do, becauſe he was not expulſed by decree of Senate or law: yet that the offence committed againſt his father, was entire: and that by <hi>Silanus</hi> returne, thoſe things were not made fruſtrate which <hi>Augustus</hi> had decreed. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained after this in the citie, but as a priuat man without office. After this, they debated the matter concerning the moderation of the law Papia poppaea, which <hi>Augustus</hi> ſtroken in yeeres, had ordained after the Iulian lawes, for augmenting the puniſhment of ſingle life, and enriching the publick treaſure. Neither for all that, were marriages and education of children the more frequented: the ſingle life hauing taken ſtrong roote: whereby the multitude of the endangered by the law, growing greater, moſt houſes were ſubuerted by the interpretations of enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers: and as heretofore through lewdnes of life; ſo now by lawes the eſtate of many was ouerthrowne. This giueth me occaſion to ſpeake more at large of the beginning of lawes; and by what meanes we are come to ſuch an infinite multitude and varietie of them. In moſt auncient times no diſordinate deſire raigned: euery man liued without reproch and vice; and therefore without puniſhment and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of lawes; neither was there any neede of reward, when as euery man deſired honeſt things of his owne will: and where nothing was demanded againſt cuſtome, nothing was forbidden by feare. But after that equalitie was baniſhed, and that ambition and violence crept in, in ſtead of modeſtie and ſhame; rule and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion tooke footing, and continued for euer among many nations. Some preſently, or after they were weary of kings, deſired rather lawes: which at the firſt were ſimple, mens minds being yet rude. And aboue the reſt, fame commended thoſe of the Cretenſians which <hi>Minos</hi> gaue: and thoſe of the Sparteans, which <hi>Lycurgus:</hi> and not long after <hi>Solon</hi> preſcribed more, and more exquiſite, to the people of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. <hi>Romulus</hi> ruled vs as pleaſed himſelfe: then <hi>Numa</hi> bound the people with ceremonies, and diuine lawes: ſome were found out by <hi>Tullus</hi> and <hi>Ancus:</hi> but the chiefeſt law-maker was <hi>Seruius Tullius,</hi> which kings themſelues were bound to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey. <hi>Tarquinius</hi> being driuen out; the people made many againſt the factions of the Senators, to defend their libertie and eſtabliſh concord. Then ten men were choſen, to collect all the beſt lawes of other countries; out of which they compoſed twelue tables: the end of lawe and equitie. As for the lawes which followed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were ſometimes made againſt malefactors for their miſdemeanors; yet notwithſtanding for the moſt part, they were brought in, through the diſſention of the communaltie and noble men: for getting of vnlawfull dignities: or driuing out of noble men; or other diſorders. By this occaſion, the <hi>Gracchi,</hi> and the <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nini</hi> were diſturbers of the people: and <hi>Druſus</hi> no leſſe prodigall vnder pretence of the Senators name, corrupted his companions with hope, or mocked them by ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie oppoſitions againſt them. Neither did they omit in the warre of Italie, nor in
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:18166:40"/>
the ciuill warre, to make many lawes: vntill <hi>L. Sulla</hi> the Dictator, the former lawes either aboliſhed or changed: after he had added many vnto them; forbare ſometime from making any more, though not long by reaſon of <hi>Lepidus</hi> turbulent demaunds: and becauſe that not long after, licence was yeelded the Tribunes to mannage the people, as themſelues luſted. And now not in generall, but againſt particular men lawes were ordained: and thereby in a common wealth moſt corrupt; lawes vpon lawes were multiplied. Then <hi>Cn. Pompeius</hi> being a third time Conſull, and choſen for reformation of manners; being more ſeuere in puniſhing then the offence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued; was the author and ouerthrower of his owne lawes: and loſt thoſe things by armes, which he had defended by armes. From that time forward there was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall diſcord twentie yeares together: no cuſtome; no law obſerued: the moſt lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt enterpriſes eſcaped vnpuniſhed: and many vndone for well doing. At length <hi>Augustus Caeſar</hi> being the ſixt time Conſull, and ſetled in the ſtate, aboliſhed thoſe things, which being Triumuir himſelf had commaunded: and gaue new lawes to be obſerued in time of peace and vnder a Prince. Straighter lawes were made by him; and ſpies appointed to watch the tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſgreſſors: and many induced through reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes graunted by the lawe Papia poppaea; that if any forbare from the priuileges of parents, ceaſt from marriage, and had no children: that then the people who was the common father of all, ſhould inherit their goods. But the pickthanks went farther, and informed againſt many, not only in the citie, but alſo through all Italie, and where ſoeuer elſe the citizens were: and ouerthrew many mens eſtates, and droue a terror into all: if <hi>Tiberius</hi> in prouiding a remedie had not choſen by lot, fiue ſuch as had beene Conſuls, fiue as had beene Pretors, and ſo many of the reſt of the Senators, which ſoluing many intricate quirks of this lawe, were ſome eaſe for the preſent time.</p>

                  <hi>VI. Nero</hi> is recomended by <hi>Tiberius</hi> to the Senat: and marrieth with <hi>Iulia, Druſus</hi> daughter.</head>
               <p>ABout the ſame time, he recomended <hi>Nero,</hi> one of <hi>Germanicus</hi> children, now entered into his youth, to the Lords of the Senat: and requeſted that he might be diſpenſed with for the office of Vigintiuirat: and (which to all men ſeemed ridiculous) be lawfull for him to demaund the Queſtorſhip, fiue yeeres ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then the lawes did permit: pretending that the ſame was graunted him and his brother at <hi>Augustus</hi> requeſt. But I doubt not, but at that time, ſome ſecretly laughed at that demaund. Yet theſe were the firſt beginnings of <hi>Caeſars</hi> riſing; and the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cuſtome more in euerie mans eies: and a lighter band of alliance, helde to be betwixt the father in lawe, and his wiues children; then the granfather and his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew. The Pontificall dignitie was likewiſe beſtowed vpon him: and the firſt time he entered the place of common aſſemblies; he gaue the people a donatiue: verie ioyfull to ſee <hi>Germanicus</hi> ofspring now of full age. Their ioy was augmented by <hi>Neroes</hi> marrieng of <hi>Iulia, Druſus</hi> daughter. And as theſe things were gratefull to the people; ſo went it againſt their ſtomacks, that <hi>Seianus</hi> ſhould be deſtined father in law to <hi>Claudius</hi> ſon, as a diſparagement to their nobility: &amp; that at their own motion they exalted <hi>Seianus,</hi> who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued ouer great hopes in his mind. In the end of that yeere died <hi>L. Volutius,</hi> &amp; <hi>Sal.

firſt gatherer of riches, whereby that houſe roſe to that greatnes. <hi>Criſpus</hi> was a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman borne, and ſo called and adopted by that excellent writer of the Roman Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie <hi>C.

But he, although he had a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die entrance for obtaining of dignities; yet following the example of <hi>Maecenas</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer once being Senator, had greater authoritie and power, then many which had triumphed and beene Conſuls. Yet differed from his aunceſtors in manner of life; as being neat, fine, and bountifull, very neere riotouſnes; and was of a great capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, and in courage able to performe great matters: and ſo much the more liuely; by how much in vtter ſhew he ſeemed drouſie and heauie metled. Therefore whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt <hi>Maecenas</hi> liued, next vnto him his credit was beſt: and after his death, truſted with greateſt ſecrets of ſtate; and priuie to the murdering of <hi>Posthumus Agrippa;</hi> and growne into yeeres, helde rather a ſhadowe of the Princes friendſhip, then the ſubſtance. Euen ſo fell it out with <hi>Maecenas;</hi> either ſo by the courſe of the heauens decreed, that Princes fauour is ſeldome euerlaſting; or bicauſe both haue their fill: thoſe when they haue giuen all they can; theſe when there is nothing left to deſire. Now followeth the fourth time <hi>Tiberius;</hi> and the ſecond that <hi>Druſus</hi> was made Conſull: a thing woorthie of remembrance, that the father and the ſon were fellow officers: for two yeeres before, <hi>Germanicus</hi> had the ſame dignitie with <hi>Tiberius:</hi> but that was no ioie to the vncle; neither he ſo neere in blood vnto him. In the beginning of that yeere <hi>Tiberius</hi> went to Campania, vnder colour of getting his health; yet indeed by little and little to abſent himſelfe; or elſe that the father being away, <hi>Druſus</hi> might alone mannage the whole Conſulſhip. It fell out by meere chance, that a matter of ſmall moment growing to a waightie contention, brought the yoong man to great credit. <hi>Domitius Corbulo,</hi> who had beene Pretor, complained before the Lords of the Senat, on <hi>L. Sulla</hi> a noble yoong man, that he gaue him not the place at a play of fencers. For <hi>Corbulo,</hi> made his age; the cuſtome of the countrey; and the fauour of the auncient men: on the other ſide, <hi>Mamercus Scaurus,</hi> and <hi>L.

               <p>NOt long after, <hi>Tiberius</hi> ſent letters to the Senate; aduertiſing them that by <hi>Tacfarinas</hi> incurſions, Affrike was againe in armes: and that with the aduiſe of the Lords it were needfull, that a Preconſull were choſen, skilfull in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of warre; of an able bodie, and a ſufficient man for this war. Which entrance <hi>Sextus Pompeius</hi> hauing gotten, of vttering his malice againſt M. <hi>Lepidus;</hi> accuſed him to be a coward, beggerly, and a diſhonour to his aunceſtors; and therefore not to be admitted to lot, for the gouernment of Aſia. The Senators were on his ſide; who thought <hi>Lepidus</hi> rather meeke then a coward; and the ſmall wealth
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:18166:41"/>
left him by his father; and his nobilitie paſt without reproch, rather they iudged a credit, then an ignominie. And therefore he was ſent into Aſia. And touching Affrica, it was decreed that <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhoulde chuſe one himſelfe for that charge. Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt theſe things were a dooing, <hi>Seuerus Caecina</hi> was of opinion, that no magiſtrate vnto whom ſhould fall the gouernment of a Prouince, ſhoulde haue his wife follow him: hauing firſt often repeated, the good agreement betwixt him and his wife: that he had ſixe children by hir: and that he propounded nothing publikely to be executed, which he had not obſerued at home: not ſuffering his to go out of Italie, <hi rend="margQuotes">although he had had commanderie in wars fortie yeeres in many prouinces. It was not in vaine, ſaid he, ordained in times paſt, that wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould not be drawen to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates and forrein nations. For it was incident where women followed, that in peace they were a hinderance by riot and ſumptouſnes: in warre by feare; and made the Romane armie, like the Barbarians going to warre. That ſexe was not onely weake and vnable to take paine; but if it got the bridle, cruell, ambitious and greedy of rule. To marche among the ſouldiers, to haue the Centurions at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; we haue ſeene a woman of late: and to ouerſee the cohorts exerciſe, and the legions horſeraces. That they ſhould conſider, that as oft as any were accuſed of extortion and polling, more was obiected againſt their wiues, then themſelues. That the lew deſt perſons of the prouinces, did by and by cleaue vnto them. They woulde intermeddle and conclude of all affaires: by this meanes two were courted, and two iudgement ſeats. Women being wilfull, commaund proudly; and brideled by the Oppian and other lawes; now hauing gotten the raines in their hands, rule houſes, places of iudgements, and armies.</hi> This was heard but with the good likin of a fewe: many interrupting him, and ſaying, that that was not the matter propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: nor <hi>Caecina</hi> a fit cenſurer to ſwaie a matter of ſo great importance. <hi>Valerius Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſallinus,</hi> ſonne vnto <hi>Meſſalla,</hi> in whom appeared the image of his fathers eloquence, anſwered immediately as followeth. <hi rend="margQuotes">Many hard and irkſome cuſtomes of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, haue beene changed into the better and pleaſanter. Neither was the citie beſieged as in times paſt: or the prouinces at defiance with vs; and ſome few things are graunted to womens neceſſities: which are ſo farre from ouercharging the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates; that they are not burdenſome to their husbands houſes. Other things were common as well to the husband as the wife; and no hinderance at all therein to peace. True it is, that warres are to be vndertaken by armed men: but vnto ſuch as returne after their labours, what more honeſter ſolace then a mans wife? But ſome haue fallen into ambition and couetouſnes. What? of magiſtrates them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, are not many of them ſubiect vnto ſundry affections? yet it cannot be, that none ſhould be ſent into the prouince. But oftentimes the husbands haue beene corrupted by the naughtines of their wiues: are therefore all ſingle men vncorrupt? The Oppian lawes were once in vſe, the ſtate of the common wealth ſo requiring; but afterward ſomewhat of their rigor was remitted and mitigated, becauſe it was then expedient. It was in vaine to couer our cowardlines with new names; for it was the husbands fault, if the woman exceeded the meane. In fine, it were not well done for the weakenes of one or two, to take from husbands their companion in proſperous and aduerſe fortune: and withall, a ſexe <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony could hardly be kept vndefiled, their husbands being preſent: what would become of them, if they ſhould be forgotten for many yeares, as it were by diuorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? therefore they ſhould ſo preuent faults committed abroad, that they forget not the diſhonors of the citie. Druſus</hi> added ſomewhat of his owne matrimony,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:18166:41"/>
and that Princes moſt often viſit the remoteſt parts of their Empire. How oft had <hi>Augustus</hi> of famous memory gone to the Eaſt and Weſt, accompanied with Liuia? That himſelfe, had gone to Illyrium; and if it were expedient, was readie to go into other countries: but yet not alwayes willingly, if he ſhould be drawne from his moſt deere wife, and mother of ſo many children, common betweene them both.

               <p>THe next day that the Senat met, <hi>Tiberius</hi> hauing courtly rebuked the Lords of the Senate by letters, becauſe they did caſt all the cares on the Princes neck, nominated <hi>M.

Whereupon <hi>C.

That the lawes were aboliſhed and vtterly ouerthrowne: ſeeing that <hi>Annia Rufilla,</hi> whome he had condemned of fraude before the iudge, did threaten, and vſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prochfull ſpeeches againſt him, in the place of aſſemblies and before the Curia: he not daring to trie the lawe with her, becauſe ſhe had <hi>Caeſars</hi> image ouer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her.</hi> Others muttered the like, or bitterer ſpeeches then theſe; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought <hi>Druſus</hi> that he would ſhew exemplarie puniſhment vpon her: and being called and conuicted, was condemned to priſon.

                  <hi>IX.</hi> The Galli vnable to pay their taxations rebell: <hi>Iulius Florus</hi> and <hi>Iulius Sacrouir</hi> being their Captaines.</head>
               <p>THe ſame yeere the cities of Gallia, by reaſon they were greatly indebted, began a rebellion: the chiefeſt firebrand among the Treueri being <hi>Iulius Florus,</hi> and with the Aedui <hi>Iulius Sacrouir:</hi> both nobly deſcended, and whoſe aunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors had atchieued valiant acts; and therfore made citizens of Rome: then a rare thing, and a guerdon onely of vertue. They by ſecret conferences, hauing drawen to them the moſt audacious; or ſuch whoſe pouertie, or feare of puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts for their miſdeeds, were ready to plunge themſelues into any enterpriſe: reſolued that <hi>Florus</hi> ſhould ſtir vp the Belgi, and <hi>Sacrouir</hi> the French neerer at hand. In their conuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles therfore &amp; meetings; they began to caſt out ſeditious ſpeeches of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual tributes; the greatnes of vſury; the cruelty &amp; arrogancy of gouernors; &amp; that the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers fell togither by the eares when they heard of <hi>Germanicus</hi> death. That that was a notable time offered, of recouering their libertie: if now in their flouriſhing eſtate they woulde weigh, howe poore Italy was; howe weake the citie ſouldier; and no ſtrength in the armies, but what was in ſtrangers. There was almoſt no citie which was not infected with the ſeedes of that commotion. The Andecauians, and the Turonians were the firſt which burſt out: of which the Andecauians were ſubdued, by the Lieutenant <hi>Acilius Auiola;</hi> with a bande of men which laie in garriſon at Lugdunum. The Turonians were ouerthrowne by the legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onarie ſouldier; which <hi>Viſellius Varro,</hi> Lieutenant of lower Germanie, ſent vnder the ſame captaine <hi>Auiola:</hi> and certaine of the chiefe gentlemen of Gallia, which brought him aide; the better thereby to cloake their reuolt, and when occaſion ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, rebell with more aſſurance. <hi>Sacrouir</hi> was ſeene to demaund battell of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans bare headed, as he ſaide to ſhewe his valour: but the captaines ſaid he did it to make himſelfe the better knowne; thereby to be ſpared from their darts. <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> being conſulted vpon that point, made no reckoning of the diſcloſing of it; but nouriſhed the warre by doubting. <hi>Florus</hi> in the meane time helde on his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; enticed a wing of horſemen, enrowled at Treuers, and trained vp in our ſeruice &amp; diſcipline; that hauing ſlaine the Roman merchants, which there vſed trafficke; he might begin the warre: fewe of the horſemen were corrupted; but moſt continued in their alleageance. Other rude indebted perſons, or followers, tooke armes; and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:18166:42"/>
went towarde the forreſt called Arden: but the legions from both armies; which <hi>Viſellius,</hi> and <hi>C. Silius</hi> had ſet to croſſe them, droue them backe. <hi>Iulius Indus</hi> being of the ſame citie; and an enimie to <hi>Florus</hi> (and therefore more foreward to ſhew his valour) being ſent before with a choiſe power; ſcattered and defeated that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered multitude. <hi>Florus</hi> eſcaped the conquerours hands, by vncertaine lurking holes; and at laſt perceiuing the ſouldiers to ſet on his places of refuge, ſlewe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with his own hands. And that was the end of the rebellion of thoſe of Treueri. It was a matter of great difficultie to ſuppreſſe the Aedui; by reaſon their city was more wealthie; and the aide which ſhould haue ſubdued them farther off. <hi>Sacrouir</hi> had with certaine armed cohorts, gotten poſſeſſion of Auguſtodunum, the chiefe citie of the countrey; and taken the nobleſt mens children of all Gallia, which there followed their ſtudies; as a pledge to win and binde their parents and kindred: and withal, ſecretly diſtributed weapons which himſelfe had cauſed to be made, to al the youth. They were in number forty thouſand; the fift part armed as the legions were: the others with hunting ſtaues, hangers, &amp; ſuch other weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ters vſe. To theſe were added certaine ſlauiſh fencers; couered according to the countrey faſhion, from top to toe, in armour of iron; vnapt and vneaſie to ſtrike; but to withſtand impenetrable, whom they call <hi>Crupellarij.</hi> Theſe forces were augmented, though not by any open co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent of cities adioining; yet with euery mans particular good wil: the Roman captaines ſtriuing &amp; doubting who ſhould haue the conducting of the warre; both deſiring it. But <hi>Varro</hi> being old and feeble, yeelded to <hi>Silius,</hi> who was in his prime. It was currant in Rome, that not onely the Treueri, and the Aedui, but alſo that threeſcore and fower cities of Gallia had reuolted; and the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans ioined with them: that Spaine was wauering; and all (as the nature of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port is) beleeued, more then it was. Euery good man with a care of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth was greatly grieued: many diſliking the preſent ſtate, and deſirous of alteration, reioyſed euen in their owne harmes: and blamed <hi>Tiberius</hi> that in ſo great a hurlyburly, he woulde ſtill ſpende his labour in hearing accuſers libels. What (ſaide they) ſhall <hi>Iulius Sacrouir</hi> bee condemned of treaſon in Senate? at laſt ſome were founde, which with armes woulde ſuppreſſe theſe bloudy libels of accuſers: that a miſerable peace was well changed for warre. <hi>Tiberius</hi> ſo much the more compoſed to a careles ſecuritie, changed neither place nor countenance; paſſed ouer thoſe dayes after his accuſtomed woont, either through haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of courage; or becauſe he knewe the matter to be lighter then the report. In the meane time <hi>Silius</hi> marching on with two legions, hauing ſent a power of allies before, waſteth the villages of the Sequans, which were borderers and confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates with the Aeduans. Anon after he marcheth ſpeedily with his armie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes Auguſtodunum: the ſtandard-bearers ſtriuing who ſhoulde make moſt haſte: and the common ſouldier fretting, and chaſing likewiſe, leaſt he ſhould reſt the night as he was wont: only that they might ſee the enemie, and be ſeene, that would be enough for the victorie. Twelue miles off, <hi>Sacrouir</hi> appeared in the champian countrey. In the front he had placed his men couered with iron: his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts on the wings: and thoſe which were halfe armed in the rereward: himſelfe mounted on a goodly courſer, amongſt the chiefeſt of the citie; went to the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and put them in minde of the ancient glory of the Galli; and how oft they had defeated the Romans. How honorable a thing libertie was to the conquerors: and how intollerable ſeruitude would be, if they ſhould be vanquiſhed againe. This exhortation was not long nor pleaſing: for the legions drew neere in battell aray: the towneſmen wanting diſcipline, and ignorant of ſeruice, did neither ſee nor
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:18166:43"/>
heare what was beſt for them. <hi>Silius</hi> on the contrary ſide, although his hope had taken away all occaſions of encouraging them, yet cried: <hi rend="margQuotes">That it was a ſhame for them, being conquerors ouer the Germans, to be brought againſt the Galli, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt enemies: and that of late one cohort had vanquiſhed the rebellious Toro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians; one wing the Treueri: a few troupes of horſemen of this ſame armie, had put to flight the Sequans. By how much the richer the Aedui are in money, and abounding in pleaſures, the leſſer courage they had. Breake then in vpon them, and binde them, and flee to thoſe which run away.</hi> At that all of them giuing an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry, the horſemen compaſſed them in: the footemen ſet on the point: and the wings made ſmall reſiſtance. Thoſe in complet yron harnes, ſtuck ſomewhat to it: their plates reſiſting, and beating back the darts and ſwords: but the ſouldier ſnat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his hatchets and axes, as though he were to breake through a wall, hewed their couering and carcaſſes. Some with poles or forks ouerthrew this ſluggiſh lump: leauing them for halfe dead lying on the ground, not once going about to riſe. <hi>Sacrouir</hi> goeth firſt to Auguſtodunum; then, for feare leaſt it ſhould be yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to the next village, with a few of his truſtieſt friends; where he ſlew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with his owne hands, and the reſt one another: and the village being ſet on fire ouer them, they were all burnt together. Then at laſt <hi>Tiberius</hi> wrote to the Senate, that the warre was begun and ended: neither adding nor taking away from the truth. And that the Lieutenants had behaued themſelues faithfully and valorouſly; and himſelfe directed them with counſell. And withall yeelded the reaſons, why neither he nor <hi>Druſus</hi> went to the war; magnifying the greatnes of the Empire: and that it was not meete that Princes, if ſome one or other towne rebell, ſhould forſake Rome; from whence all other gouernment was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued. Now bicauſe there was no cauſe of feare, he would goe ſee and ſettle the preſent eſtate of things. The Lords of the Senat derceed vowes and proceſſions for his returne, with other conuenient ceremonies. <hi>Dolabella Cornelius</hi> onely whileſt he went about to exceed others, falling into abſurd flatterie, thought it meete that he ſhould from Campania enter into the citie, ouant. Wherupon <hi>Caeſar</hi> wrote, that he was not ſo needie of renowne, that hauing vanquiſhed moſt ſtout and prowde nations; and receiued or refuſed in his youth ſo many triumphes; he would in his old age hunt after a vaine reward of a voiage neere the citie.</p>

               <p>ABout the ſame time, he made requeſt vnto the Senat that <hi>Sulpitius Quirinius</hi> death, might be ſolemniſed with publicke funerals. <hi>Quirinius</hi> was not of the auncient patritian familie of the <hi>Sulpitians;</hi> but borne at Lanuuium a free towne: a valiant warrior; and forwards in all his charges: was Conſull vnder <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi> of famous memorie.

In the end of the yeere a cari-tale, accuſed <hi>C. Lutorius Priſcus</hi> a gentleman of Rome; who had compoſed notable funerall verſes vpon

Thoſe verſes <hi>Lutorius,</hi> vpon vaine glorie had read in <hi>P. Petronius</hi> houſe, in the preſence of <hi>Vitellia,</hi> his mother in lawe, and many other noble women. As ſoone as the pickthanke had ſhewed himſelfe; the reſt forced by feare to giue witnes: onely <hi>Vitellia</hi> ſtood to it, that ſhe had heard nothing. But more credit being giuen to ſuch as teſtified to his ouerthrow: ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death was pronounced againſt him, by <hi>Haterius Agrippa</hi> Conſull elect. Againſt whom <hi>M.

But if lewd and heinous facts be without meane: yet the moderation of a Prince; your own and your aunceſtors examples do mollifie the puniſhments and remedies of them: vaine things do differ from wicked; and words from villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous deedes. And therefore iudgment may be giuen; by which neither this mans offence goe ſcot-free; &amp; we not repent vs, either of our clemencie or ſeueritie.

As his ſtudies were full of follie and without ſence, ſo they are likewiſe vaine, and quickly at an end. Neither is there any cauſe to feare any great or ſerious matter in him; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraying his owne imperfections; doth creepe not into mens, but womens breaſts.

                  <hi>XI. Tiberius</hi> letter touching reformation of abuſes.</head>
               <p>THe yeere following, <hi>C. Sulpitius,</hi> and <hi>D. Haterius,</hi> were created Conſuls: all being quiet from forrein troubles: but ſeueritie againſt ſuperfluities ſuſpected at home: which was growen to exceeding exceſſe in all things, wherein mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is lauiſhly ſpent. Some of their expences, although more vnreaſonable; yet were cloaked, by diſſembling their prices: but gluttonie and belly-cheere, euerie man commonly ſpeaking of; put them in feare, leaſt the prince ſhoulde rigorouſlie proceed according to the ancient prouident frugalitie. For <hi>C. Bibulus</hi> beginning; the other Aediles ſhewed alſo, that the law co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning exceſſe of expences, was nought ſet by; and the ſumptuouſnes of moueables which was forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, daily increaſed: and that it coulde not be redreſſed by any reaſonable meanes. And the Lordes of the Senate being demanded their aduiſe, referred the whole matter to the prince. But <hi>Tiberius</hi> often pondered with himſelfe, whether ſuch exorbitant luſtes coulde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brideled or not: whether the brideling of them would not bring more hurt, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:18166:44"/>
to the common-wealth: how vnſeemely and diſhonorable it would be, to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake that which could not be effected: or if it could, with the ignominie or infamie of noble men: and in the end he ſent letters to the Senate to this purpoſe. <hi rend="margQuotes">It would be peraduenture conuenient, Lords of the Senate, that in other matters, I ſhould be demaunded my opinion in your preſence: and ſpeake what I thought to be behouefull for the common wealth: but in this relation it was better to withdraw mine eyes; leaſt that you, noting the countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and the feare of euery one of ſuch, which ſhould be deprehended of this ſhamefull lauiſhing; I ſhould alſo ſee them, and take them as it were in the fault. If the Aediles vigilant and carefull men, had before hand asked my aduiſe; I know not whether I ſhould rather haue perſwaded them, to let paſſe ſtrong and rooted vices, then go ſo far; that it ſhould be knowne how vnable we be to redreſſe ſome kinde of abuſes. But they truly haue done their dutie, and I wiſh that other magiſtrates would alſo fulfill theirs. To me it is neither honeſt to hold my tongue; nor eaſie to ſpeake: becauſe I haue neither the office of an Aedile, Pretor, nor Conſull. Some greater matter is required of a Prince, and of greater importance: and when as euery man attributeth to himſelfe the prayſe of things well done: the faults of all men in generall redounde to the diſlike of the Prince alone. What ſhall I begin firſt to forbid, and reduce to the auncient cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome? your huge and ſpacious countrey houſes? the number of your ſeruitours of diuers nations? the quantitie of ſiluer and gold? your painted tables, and braſen images of maruellous and exquiſite workemanſhip? ſuperfluouſnes of apparell both in men and women? and thoſe things which are proper vnto women, as pretious ſtones, for which our money is tranſported to forren nations, or enemies? I am not ignorant that theſe things are blamed in bankets and meetings, and a meane wiſhed for. But if any would make a lawe, or lay downe a puniſhment for them; thoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues which complaine, will exclaime that the citie is ouerthrowne; that the ruine of the nobilitie is ſought for: and that there is none free from this crime. But we ſee that old inueterate diſeaſes of the body cannot be cured, but by ſharp and rough re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies: the corruptor and the corrupted; the weake and burning deſire, is to be quenched with no lighter remedies; then the diſordinate appetites were, which kindled the minde. So many lawes inuented by our aunceſtors; ſo many made by <hi>Augustus;</hi> thoſe by obliuion, theſe (which is a greater offence) aboliſhed by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, haue cauſed all ſuperfluities, to be more bold, and practiſed. For if thou wouldeſt do that which is not yet forbidden, feare leaſt thou be forbidden it. But if thou haſt without puniſhment tranſgreſſed things forbidden, there is neither fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhame nor feare left. Why then in times paſt was prouident ſparing vſed? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe euery man did moderate himſelfe: becauſe we were citizens of one citie: and our dominions not reaching out of Italy, we had not the ſame prouocations: by victories had againſt ſtrangers, we haue learned to conſume other mens goods; by ciuill wars our owne. How ſmall a matter is that whereof the Aediles do admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh vs? how little to be reckoned of, if we regard other things? But truly no man doth put vs in minde, that Italy doth want the ayde of forren nations; that the life of the people of Rome, is toſſed with the incertaintie of ſea and tempeſt: and if the ſtrength of the prouinces ſhould not aide and ſuccour the Lords, ſlaues, and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: our woods forſooth, and our farmes, would they maintaine vs? This burden, Lords of the Senate, the Prince doth ſuſtaine: which being omitted, the common-wealth would fall to the ground. In other things, euery man muſt giue himſelfe a lawe: let ſhame amend vs: neceſſitie the poore; ſacietie the rich. Or if there be any of the magiſtrates, which doth promiſe vs ſo much induſtrie, and ſeueritie, that he
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:18166:44"/>
can preuent and redreſſe theſe things: I do both praiſe him, and confeſſe that I ſhall be vnburdened in part of my labour. But if they will accuſe faults; and hauing gotten glory thereby, raiſe priuie hatred, and leaue it on me: beleeue me, Lords of the Senate, I am not deſirous of diſpleaſures: which although I run into, and that very greatly, and for the moſt part vniuſtly, for the common wealth: yet by good reaſon, I refuſe them, and intreate that thoſe be not thruſt on me, which will be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther profitable for me, nor you.</hi>

                  <hi>CAEſars</hi> letters being heard, the Aediles were diſcharged of that care: and the ſumptuouſnes of their tables, which from the end of the war at Actium, vntill the wars in which <hi>S. Galba</hi> got the ſoueraigntie for an hundred yeeres, lauiſhingly vſed, began by little and little to be left off. The cauſes of this chang it ſhall not be amiſſe to ſeeke out. In times paſt, rich and great houſes of noble men fell to decay through their magnificence; being then lawfull to winne the fauour of the people, of confederates, and Kings, to court and be courted. And as euerie man was moſt ſumptuous in his houſe, furniture, and prouiſion: ſo he was accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted moſt honorable, and followed with a greater traine. But after they began to murder one another, for priuat quarrels, proceeding of this pompe; and that their greatnes was their ruine; the reſt tooke a wiſer courſe. And withall, new men which were often taken out of free townes, colonies, and Prouinces, and choſen to be Senators; brought in with them the frugalitie, which they had vſed before in their owne houſes. And albeit, many of them either by fortune, or their owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie; grew to wealth in their age: yet they kept the ſame minde and cuſtome they brought with them. But <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> was the chiefeſt author of this ſtrict kinde of life; himſelfe obſeruing the auncient manner of liuing: for then a deſire of pleaſing and imitating the Prince, wrought more, then either puniſhment of lawes, or feare. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe peraduenture, we thinke that there is in all things a certaine change: and as there is an intercourſe and change of time; ſo alſo an alteration of cuſtomes and manners. Neither were all things in auncient times better then ours; but our age hath left vnto poſteritie manie things worthie of praiſe and imitation. But let ſuch honeſt contentions between vs and our predeceſſors, ſtil continue amongſt vs. <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi> hauing gotten the fame of moderation, by repreſſing the accuſers: ſent let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the Senat, requeſting the Tribuniciall authoritie for <hi>Druſus.</hi> That terme of higheſt dignitie <hi>Auguſtus</hi> inuented, to auoide the name of King or Dictator: and yet vnder another title ſignified a ſoueraigntie aboue other magiſtrates. After this he choſe <hi>M. Agrippa,</hi> as an aſſociat of that dignitie: and after his death <hi>Tiberius Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> leſt the ſucceſſor ſhould be vnknowen; thinking thereby to cut off others vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hopes; truſting to <hi>Neroes</hi> modeſtie, and his owne greatnes. By which example, <hi>Tiberius</hi> did then aſſure the ſoueraigntie to <hi>Druſus,</hi> when as whileſt <hi>Germanicus</hi> liued, he held his iudgment indifferent betweene them both, not preferring the one before the other. But in the beginning of his letters, hauing humbly prayed vnto the gods, that they would proſper his counſels to the good of the common-wealth: he ſpake ſome few words, and thoſe truly, of the yoong mans behauiour; as that he had a wife and three children; and was of the age that he himſelfe was called by <hi>Augustus</hi> of famous memorie, to vndertake the ſame charge. Neither could it be
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:18166:45"/>
ſaide that haſtily, but after eight yeeres triall; hauing ſuppreſſed ſeditions, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the wars, and triumphed, and beene twiſe Conſull: he was taken to be an aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at of a knowen labour. The Lords of the Senat conceiued the drift of his oration; whereby their flatterie towards him was the more artificiall. Yet notwithſtanding there was nothing newly inuented: but ordained onely, that the images of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; the altars of the gods; Temples and arches; and ſuch vſuall honours ſhould be erected for him. Sauing that <hi>M. Silanus</hi> demaunded and opined that in publicke and priuate monuments, the Conſuls names ſhould not be prefixed; but theirs who had Tribuniciall authoritie; a thing greatly diſhonoring and debaſing the Conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary dignitie. <hi>Q. Haterius,</hi> who had counſelled that the decrees made that day in Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat, ſhould be written in letters of gold; was mocked for his labour: that an olde man ſhould vſe to his infamie ſuch filthie flatterie. Whileſt theſe things were a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the gouernment of Affrica was continued in <hi>Iunius Blaeſus. Seruius Malugine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> a Flamen Dial, or <hi>Iupiters</hi> Prieſt; ſued that he might draw lots for the gouernment of Aſia: ſaying, <hi rend="margQuotes">That it was vainely ſpread abroad, that it was not lawfull for <hi>Iupiters</hi> Prieſts to go out of Italie. And that they had no other law then the Prieſts of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Quirinus.</hi> And if theſe had gouerned the Prouinces, why was it vnlawfull for the Diales? that there was no law of the people, touching that matter, found in the bookes of ceremonies. The high Prieſt had often celebrated <hi>Iupiters</hi> ſacrifices; if the Flamen had beene hindered by ſickenes or publicke affaires. Seuentie and two yeeres, after that <hi>Cornelius Merula</hi> was murdered, no man was put to ſupplie the place; and yet the ceremonies neuer ceaſed. And if his creation could be omitted for ſo many yeeres, without any hinderance to the ſacrifices: how much eaſlier might a man be abſent, with the Proconſularie dignitie for a yeere? In times paſt they were forbidden to goe out of the Prouinces, through the priuat grudges of the high Prieſt: now through the fauour of the gods; the high Prieſt was the ſoueraign aboue all men; not ſubiect vnto emulation, malice, or priuat affection.</hi> Againſt which when <hi>Lentulus</hi> the Augur, and others had diuerſly ſpoken; in the ende they reſolued to expect the cenſure of the high Prieſt. <hi>Tiberius</hi> hauing deferred the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Flamins right, moderated the ceremonies, which were decreed in honor of <hi>Druſus</hi> Tribuniciall dignitie: rebuking by name the inſolencie of that ſentence, which would haue had the decree written in letters of gold, againſt the cuſtome of the countrey. <hi>Druſus</hi> letters were alſo read; which although they ſeemed to tend to modeſty, yet were reputed moſt proude. <hi rend="margQuotes">They complained that things were growen to that paſſe; that the yoong man hauing receiued ſo great honour, yet vouchſafed not to viſit the gods of the citie; nor ſhew himſelfe in Senat; or begin at leaſt his authoritie in his owne countrey. But forſooth, he is let by warre, or hindered in ſome ſtrange countrey; when indeed he ſolaceth himſelfe at his pleaſure, in the ſhores and lakes of Campania. This leſſon had the ruler of the world taught him; this did he firſt learne of his fathers Counſels.

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:18166:45"/>
and priuiledged places increaſed throughout the cities of Greece. The temples were filled with moſt lewd bondſlaues: in the ſame refuges, were receiued debtors againſt their creditors; and ſuſpected of capitall crimes. Neither was there any authoritie able to bridle the ſedition of the people; protecting all villanies, no leſſe then the ceremonies of the gods. Whereupon it was concluded, that the cities ſhould ſend their Embaſſadors with their priuiledges, which ſome left off of their owne accord as falſly vſurped: many truſted to old ſuperſtitions or pleaſures done to the people of Rome. The pomp of that day was great in ſhew: in which the Senators conſidered of the prerogatiues of their predeceſſors; the agreements of confederates; the decrees of kings, which had bene before the Romans had gotten ſuch great power and authoritie: and the religions of the gods themſelues, being yet in the diſpoſition of the Senate, to confirme or alter all; as in times paſt they could haue done. The firſt which ſhewed themſelues in Senate, were the Epheſians; declaring that <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Apollo,</hi> were not borne in the Iland Delos, as the common people did beleeue: and there was in their countrey a riuer called Cenchrius: and a wood called Ortygia, where <hi>Latona</hi> being great with childe; and leaning againſt an oliue tree which is yet in the place, brought forth thoſe two gods: and that by the commaundement of the gods that wood was made ſacred. And that <hi>Apollo</hi> himſelfe did in that place flee from <hi>Iupiters</hi> anger, after he had ſlaine the Cyclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians. After that <hi>Bacchus</hi> the conqueror in warre, pardoned the Amazones, which humbling themſelues there, caught hold of the altar. And that the ceremonie of that temple increaſed by <hi>Hercules</hi> permiſſion, when he inioyed Lydia: which was not diminiſhed when the Perſians had dominion ouer it. After that the Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians; then we had maintained the ſame priuiledges. Next vnto thoſe came in the Magneſians, building their reaſons on <hi>L. Scipio,</hi> and <hi>L. Sullaes</hi> conſtitutions: the one driuing out <hi>Antiochus;</hi> and the other <hi>Mithridates:</hi> and extolled the loyaltie and vertue of the Magneſians; and commaunded that <hi>Diana Leucophrynes</hi> priuiledges ſhould not be violated. Then followed the Aphrodiſienſes, &amp; Stratonicenſes, allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging an order made by <hi>Caeſar</hi> the Dictator; and another later decree of <hi>Augustus</hi> of famous memory, for the pleaſures done them, in taking part with their ſide, during the time of their faction: prayſing them, that they had ſuſtained the aſſaults of the Parthians; nothing at all changing their conſtancie towards the people of Rome. But the Aphrodiſienſes maintained the priuiledges of <hi>Venus</hi> temple: and the Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonicenſes <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Triuias</hi> ceremonies. The Hierocaeſarienſes fetchte their matter from a farther beginning, inducing their <hi>Dianaperſica,</hi> and a temple dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by king <hi>Cyrus:</hi> and told a tale of <hi>Perperna,</hi> of <hi>Iſauricum,</hi> and many other Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; which graunted that holines not only to the temple, but to two miles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pas. Then followed the Cyprians, declaring that they had three temples: whereof the moſt auncient was builded by <hi>Aerias,</hi> and conſecrated to <hi>Venus Paphia:</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond by his ſonne <hi>Amathus,</hi> and dedicated to <hi>Venus Amathuſia:</hi> the third to <hi>Iupiter Salaminius,</hi> built by <hi>Teucer,</hi> when hee fled from his father <hi>Telamon.</hi> The Embaſſadors of other cities were heard likewiſe: with whoſe multitude the Lords of the Senate being wearied, ſome fauoring one ſide; ſome another: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they contended which had merited moſt, they referred the matter to the Conſuls: that looking into the right of the cauſe, if they contained any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret abuſe, they ſhould bring the whole cauſe againe to the Senate. The Conſuls beſides thoſe cities which I haue aboue named, ſpake of another priuiledged place for malefactors, dedicated to <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> at Pergamum: affirming that the reſt were grounded vpon obſcure beginnings, in reſpect of their antiquitie. The Smyrnaeans
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:18166:46"/>
alleaged an oracle of <hi>Apollo,</hi> by which they were commaunded to dedicate a temple to <hi>Venus Stratonicis:</hi> the Tenians a verſe of the ſame <hi>Apollo,</hi> commaunding them to offer an image and temple to <hi>Neptune.</hi> The Sardians brought in matters of later memory; that to be <hi>Alexander</hi> the conquerors gift: and the Mileſians did the like, vſing king <hi>Darius</hi> name for their franchiſe; but both of theſe did worſhip <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Apollo.</hi> The Cretenſians made requeſt that the image of <hi>Augustus</hi> might haue ſome priuiledge: and decrees of Senate were made, by which with great honor, yet moderation was preſcribed vnto all; and commaundement giuen in thoſe very temples to erect altars for a ſacred memorie: yet ſo, that vnder colour of religion, they ſhould not fall into ambition.</p>

                  <hi>XIIII. Iulia Auguſta</hi> falleth ſick: <hi>Seianus</hi> called into question.</head>
               <p>ABout the ſame time, a grieuous ſicknes which <hi>Iulia Augusta</hi> fell into, cauſed the Prince (perfect amitie being yet betwixt the mother and the ſonne, or elſe ſecret hatred) to haſten his returne to Rome. For not long before, when <hi>Iulia</hi> had dedicated an image to <hi>Augustus</hi> of famous memory, not farre from <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi> theatre, ſhe had ſet <hi>Tiberius</hi> name vnder her own: which he (as it was thought) taking as an vnder-valuing of the maieſtie of a Prince, ſmothered vp with a great, but a ſecret hartburning againſt her. But then the Senat had decreede, that there ſhould be proceſſions made to the gods, and the playes called Magni, exhibited by the chiefe Prieſts, the Augurs, the fifteen, togither with the ſeuen, and thoſe of the fellowſhip of <hi>Augustus,</hi> called Auguſtales. <hi>L. Apronius</hi> was of opinion, that the Heraulds ſhould be ouerſeers of thoſe plaies: which <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſpake againſt, making a difference in the rights of the Prieſts, alleaging examples for it. For the Feciales or Heraulds neuer had ſuch high authoritie; and that therefore the Auguſtales were put to them, bicauſe it was a peculiar Prieſthood of that houſe, for which the vowes were made. My meaning is not to laie downe any other opinions; but ſuch as are either notable for their honeſtie, or ſhamefull for their infamie: which I ſuppoſe, to be the chiefeſt point belonging to Hiſtories; that vertues be not ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie paſſed ouer with ſilence; and that men haue a feare of bad ſpeaking and dooing, leaſt he become infamous with poſterity. But thoſe times were ſo corrupted with fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie flatterie: that not only the chiefeſt of the citie were forced in that ſeruile maner to keepe their reputation; but all ſuch as had beene Conſuls; the greateſt part of ſuch as had bin Pretors; &amp; alſo many pedary Senators roſe vp &amp; ſtroue, who ſhould propound things moſt baſe and abiect. It is written, that as <hi>Tiberius</hi> went out of the Curia, he was woont to ſaie in Greeke. O men ready to ſeruitude! as though he, who could of all things leaſt ſuffer publicke libertie; did yet abhorre ſuch baſe and ſeruile ſubmiſſion: falling by little and little from vnſeemely flatteries, to lewder practiſes. <hi>C. Silanus</hi> Proconſull of Aſia, being accuſed for polling the Prouince; was alſo proſecuted by <hi>Mamercus Scaurus,</hi> who had beene Conſull; by <hi>Iunius Otho</hi> Pretor; by <hi>Brutidius Niger</hi> Aedile; all of them layeng to his charge, that he had violated <hi>Augustus</hi> diuinitie, and ſet nought by <hi>Tiberius</hi> maieſtie. <hi>Mamercus</hi> allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged old examples, how <hi>L. Cotta</hi> had bin accuſed by <hi>Scipio Africanus: S. Galba</hi> by <hi>Cato</hi> the Cenſor: and <hi>P. Rutilius</hi> by <hi>M.

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:18166:46"/>
                  <hi>Seianus</hi> authoritie, brought his obſcure beginning, into obloquie by impudent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes. <hi>Brutidius,</hi> a man well qualified; and if he had taken a right courſe, likely to haue come to honorable preferment; ouer much haſte pricked forwardes: and at the firſt went about, to out go his equals; then his ſuperiors; and laſt of all to flee aboue his owne hopes: which hath beene the ouerthrow of good men; who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning that which by a little patience, is had with ſecuritie; haſten to that which gotten before his time, breedeth their ruine and deſtruction. <hi>Gellius Poplicola,</hi> and <hi>M. Paconius,</hi> increaſed the number of informers: the one being <hi>Silanos</hi> treaſurer; the other his lieutenant. Little doubt but <hi>Silanus</hi> was blame woorthie for his cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie, and rauenous dealing: but many other matters came togither, dangerous euen to the innocent: for beſides that, he had ſo many Senators againſt him; he was to anſwere alone, the eloquenteſt of all Aſia: and for that cauſe choſen to accuſe: being himſelfe vnskilful, and appalled with his own danger: cauſe ſufficient, to haue daſht the beſt practized out of matter. <hi>Tiberius</hi> himſelfe not refraining to preſſe him with words and countenance, asked him many queſtions; not giuing libertie to refell or replie: yea oftentimes he muſt confeſſe, leſt <hi>Tiberius</hi> ſhould ſeeme to haue asked in vaine. And withall, the publike actor had bought <hi>Silanus</hi> bondmen, to the end they ſhoulde be examined by torture. And bicauſe none of his kinſmen nor friends might helpe him in his danger, accuſations of treaſon (a bonde and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie to ſtop euery mans mouth) were thruſt among. Whereupon certaine daies of delay being demanded, he let fall his defence: and taking courage ſent letters vnto <hi>Caeſar,</hi> interlaced with intreatie and odious termes. <hi>Tiberius,</hi> that the cauſes he charged <hi>Silanus</hi> with, might haue an example of excuſe; commandeth <hi>Augustus</hi> recordes, touching <hi>Voleſus Meſſalla,</hi> Proconſul of the ſame Aſia, to be recited, and a decree of Senate made againſt him. Then demanded <hi>L. Piſoes</hi> opinion: who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a preamble of the princes clemencie; was of aduiſe that he ſhould be baniſhed to the Iland Gyarus. The reſt gaue the like verdite: ſauing that <hi>C. Lentulus,</hi> thought it meet, that the goods which came by <hi>Silanus</hi> mother (for he was by another mother) ſhould be ſeparated from the reſt, and giuen the ſonne: <hi>Tiberius</hi> according therto. But <hi>Cornelius Dolabella,</hi> hauing rebuked <hi>Silanus</hi> for his behauiour; followed the vaine of his flatterie further: and added. <hi rend="margQuotes">That none, who liued a reprochfull and infamous life, ſhould draw lots for the gouerment of any prouince: &amp; that the prince ſhould be iudge thereof. The lawes did puniſh crimes committed: but howe much better would it be for vs, and our confederates, if we did prouide that no offences ſhoulde be committed? Againſt which, <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelfe ſpake; and ſaid: That he was not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant what the ſpeech had beene of <hi>Silanus:</hi> but that no iudgements ought to be giuen at the rumour of the people. Many had behaued themſelues in the prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, better then was hoped for; and others not ſo bad as it was feared: for ſome by managing of weightie matters, haue beene ſtirred vp to a better carriage and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour: and others haue become more ſlothfull and laſie. And that a prince coulde not comprehend all things in his owne knowledge: neither was it expedient, that he ſhould be drawen to this, and that, by others ambition. That lawes were ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt factes alreadie committed, bicauſe future things are vncertaine. So it was ordained by our aunceſtors, that when the offences had gone before, puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould follow: Therefore they would not alter thoſe things, which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented by wiſedome, and alwaies obſerued. That princes had charge ſufficient, and power inough: if their power grew great, the lawes grew weake. That abſolute au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie was not to be vſed; as long as the lawes were open.</hi> By how much the ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domer <hi>Tiberius</hi> ſhewed any popular behauiour; by ſo much the more ioyfully it was

accepted. And being wiſe (if he were not carried away with anger) in moderating the rigorous cenſures of others: added that the Iland Gyarus was barbarous, and vnhabited: and therefore that they woulde ſhew ſo much fauour to the Iunian fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie; and to one who had beene of the ſame colledge with them; that he ſhoulde rather be ſent to the Iland Cythera: which was alſo the requeſt of <hi>Torquata, Silanus</hi> ſiſter, a virigin of good life: vnto which cenſure they all condeſcended.</p>

               <p>AFter this, the Cyrenenſes were heard: and <hi>Caeſius Cordus</hi> condemned of pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the prouinces, at the ſute of <hi>Ancharius Priſcus. L.

Then there grew a ſcruple: in knowing, in what temple the gift ſhould be placed, which the gentlemen of Rome had vowed to fortune Eque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris, for the health of <hi>Augusta.</hi> For although there were many temples in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, of that goddeſſe: yet there was none which bare that ſurname. In the ende there was one ſo called found at Antium: and all the ceremonies in the townes of Italie, and temples, and images of gods, to be vnder the right, and empire of Rome: and therupon the gift was placed at Antium. And ſeeing the matter was debated touching the religions; <hi>Caeſar</hi> declared the anſwere: which not long before he had deferred, againſt <hi>Seruius Maluginenſis:</hi> and recited the decree of the chiefe prieſtes; which was: <hi rend="margQuotes">That as oft as the Flamen, Dial, or Iupiters prieſt, fell into any ſicknes, he might be abſent from the city; with licence of the chiefe prieſt: ſo as it were not aboue two nights; or in daies of publike ſacrifice: nor oftner then twiſe in one yeere.</hi> Which being ordained in <hi>Auguſtus</hi> time, did manifeſtly ſhew, that the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence for a yeere, or adminiſtration of prouinces, was not graunted to the <hi>Diales.</hi> And the example of <hi>L.

ſtaied, from hurting any more then that one thing: and the Senate ordained an image to be erected in honour of <hi>Seianus</hi> in <hi>Pompeius</hi> theatre. And not long after when <hi>Caeſar</hi> had honored <hi>Iunius Blaeſus,</hi> proconſull of Affrike, with the ornaments of triumph: he ſaid that he attributed that to <hi>Seianus</hi> honour, whoſe vncle he was. Yet <hi>Blaeſus</hi> owne acts deſerued that honour. For although <hi>Tacfarinas</hi> had beene often put to the woorſt: yet renewing his aide in the middle of Affrike, he grewe to that arrogancie, as to ſend embaſſadors to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and require a place for himſelfe, and his armie to inhabite: or elſe threatned an endles warre. It was reported that <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> neuer more grieued, at any diſgrace done vnto himſelfe, or the people of Rome; then that a traitor, and theefe, ſhould deale like an enimie. There was neuer ſo much graunted <hi>Spartacus;</hi> after he had defeated ſo many armies of Conſuls; and burnt Italie vnreuenged; yea when the common-wealth was greatly weakned, by <hi>Serto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> and <hi>Mithridates</hi> great warres: that he ſhoulde be receiued by couenant into ſafe conduct: &amp; therefore much leſſe that <hi>Tacfarinas</hi> a theefe; the Roman empire being in moſt flouriſhing ſtate, ſhould be hired with a peace and lands to inhabite. He committed the whole matter to <hi>Blaeſus,</hi> with charge that he ſhoulde induce the reſt, to lay down their armes; with warrant that they ſhould ſuſtaine no hurt; yet that he ſhould lay holde on the captaine by all means poſſible: through which pardon many came in. Not long after they vſed the ſame maner of fight, againſt <hi>Tacfarinas,</hi> as he had vſed againſt others: for bicauſe he, inferior to the Romans in ſtrength, though better in theeuery; made many inroades; by ſcattered companies, decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his enimie: and laid many traines to intrap him. Their companies were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſet in order, and marched againſt him: of which the lieutenant <hi>Cornelius Scipio</hi> was the chiefe: who lay in waite in that coaſt where <hi>Tacfarinas</hi> did waſte and trouble the <hi>Leptins,</hi> and the Garamantes, places of refuge: On another ſide <hi>Blaeſus</hi> ſon lead his owne power; leaſt the Cirtenſien villages ſhoulde be entiſed to take part with <hi>Tacfarinas,</hi> In the middle, placing fortreſſes and ſtrong holdes, in conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient places; with choiſe ſoldiers: the captaine himſelfe brought the enimie to a narrowe ſtraight, and diſaduantage: bicauſe that which way ſoeuer he ſhould bend; ſome of the Romane ſoldiers were in his face; ſome in his ſides: and often ſome in his backe, and ſo, many ſlaine and intrapped. Then diuideth the three armies againe into many other companies: with centurions of knowen valour ouer them. Neither did he as the cuſtome was; retire his forces in the ende of ſommer; or put them in ſtanding campes of the old prouince: but as it had been in the beginning of warre; his fortreſſes well manned, by light horſemen, and skilfull in thoſe deſerts; he gaue <hi>Tacfarinas</hi> often changing his cabbins ſmall reſt: vntill his brother being taken, he retired in the end with more ſpeede, then was for the allies profit: ſuch being left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde by whom the warre might riſe againe. But <hi>Tiberius</hi> taking this to be an ende of this warre, gaue <hi>Blaeſus</hi> that honour, that he ſhould be ſaluted Emperour by the legions: being an old cuſtome towards ſuch Captaines, as had ſhewen valour for the common-wealth, with ioy and acclamations to be ſaluted by that name by the conquering armies. There were many Emperours at one time, but none aboue an other. <hi>Augustus</hi> had graunted that name to ſome; and <hi>Tiberius</hi> at that time to
<hi>Blaeſus.</hi> That yeere died two notable men, <hi>Aſinius Salonius,</hi> nephew to <hi>M.

skilfull in the ſame ſtudie: for that age had at once two ornaments of peace.

The images of twentie noble houſes, were caried before her; and the names of the Manlians, the Quinctians, and others of like nobilitie.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Aſinius,</hi> and <hi>C. Antistius</hi> being Conſuls; <hi>Tiberius</hi> had nine yeeres managed the affaires; and aduanced his houſe to a flouriſhing eſtate: (for the death of <hi>Germanicus</hi> he reckoned amongſt his proſperities) when as fortune began on a ſudden to worke alteration: in him waxing cruell; or giuing authoritie to ſuch as were. The beginning proceeded from <hi>AElius Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ianus</hi> Captaine of the guarde; of whoſe power and authoritie I haue before ſpoken. I will now lay downe his beginning, and qualities: and by what ſiniſter meanes he went about to clime to the ſoueraignty. He was borne at Vulſinium, ſonne of <hi>Seius Strabo,</hi> gentleman of Rome; and in his firſt youth followed <hi>C. Caeſar, Auguſtus</hi> nephew: not without a rumor, that for money he had ſuffered his bodie to be abuſed by <hi>Apicius,</hi> a rich man and a prodigall. Then by ſundrie ſleights he had ſo wrought <hi>Tiberius,</hi> that being cloſe and ſecret towards others: yet to himſelfe had made him open and vncircumſpect. Not ſo much by his cunning and fraude (for ſuch deuiſes were his owne ouerthrow) as by the anger of the gods againſt the ſtate of Rome; by whoſe ruine and riſing it fell alike. He was of body able to endure labour; of mind bold; in his owne actions ſecret; an infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer againſt others; as proud as flattering; in ſhew modeſt; but inwardly greedie of aſpiring: for which cauſe, he vſed ſometime largeſſe and lauiſhing; but more oftner induſtrie and diligence; meanes dangerous alike, when they are diſſemblingly vſed to win a kingdome. His forces, which at the firſt were ſmall, he augmented by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the cohorts into one campe, which before were ſcattered abroade in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; that they might receiue their charge togither, and by their number &amp; ſtrength, and ſeeing one another, breed a confidence to themſelues; and a feare to others. He pretended that the ſouldier liuing ſcattered, grew riotous: and if any ſudden at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ſhould be enterpriſed, their ſtrength would be greater vnited, then ſeparated: and that they would liue more ſeuerely, if their garriſon were lodged far from the wanton allurements of the citie. As ſoone as his trenches were finiſhed, he began to creepe into the ſouldiers mindes by going vnto them, and calling them by their names: withall, made choiſe himſelfe of Centurions &amp; the Tribunes. Neither did he abſtaine from ambitiouſly courting the Senators; aduauncing his followers with honours, and rule of Prouinces: <hi>Tiberius</hi> being ſo facile and prone to allow of his dooings, that not onely in priuat ſpeeches; but in Senat alſo and before the people, extolled him as an aſſociat of his labours: and ſuffered his image to be ſet in the Theaters, and publike places of aſſemblies, and enſignes of the legions. But <hi>Caeſars</hi> houſe being full; a yoong ſonne; nephewes of full age; hindered his plots: And bicauſe it was not ſafe making away of ſo many at once by violence; his treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie required time to accompliſh his wickednes. He reſolued then to vſe the couerteſt way; and begin with <hi>Druſus;</hi> againſt whom through freſh quarrels he was greatly incenſed. For <hi>Druſus</hi> being impatient of a concurrent, and therefore eaſily mooued:
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:18166:49"/>
a contention riſing by chance betweene them, bent his fiſt to ſtrike <hi>Seianus;</hi> and he his to ſaue himſelfe: <hi>Druſus</hi> daſht him on the mouth. Hereupon leauing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vntried, he thought it the readieſt way to addreſſe himſelfe to <hi>Liuia Druſus</hi> wife. She was <hi>Germanicus</hi> ſiſter, in her youth of a hard fauour; but afterward ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled in beautie. Her <hi>Seianus</hi> counterfeiting an ardent and burning loue enticed to adulterie: and after he had obtained the firſt breach of honeſtie (for a woman ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing once loſt her chaſtitie, what will ſhe refuſe to do?) put her in hope of mariage, and fellowſhip in the Empire; and perſwadeth her to kill her husband. Thus ſhe, who was <hi>Augustus</hi> neece, and <hi>Tiberius</hi> daughter in law; and had children by <hi>Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus;</hi> defiled herſelfe, her aunceſtors, and poſteritie with adulterie by a meane man; leauing an honeſt and preſent eſtate for the hope of a wicked and vncertaine. <hi>Eude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> a friend and Phiſition of <hi>Liuias,</hi> was made priuie to theſe plots; who vnder co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of his arte was often vſed in ſecret conferences. He putteth away <hi>Apicata</hi> his wife, by whom he had three children, leaſt his lemmon ſhould haue her in iealouſie. But the greatnes of the enterpriſe droue them into a feare; bred prolongings; and ſometimes diuers ſorts of counſels. In the meane ſpace in the beginning of the yeere, <hi>Druſus</hi> one of <hi>Germanicus</hi> children, was come to mans eſtate; and thoſe things renewed vpon him, which the Senat had ordained for <hi>Nero</hi> his brother. <hi>Tiberius</hi> made an oration tending to the great commendation of his ſonne; bicauſe he ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his brothers children with a fatherly affection. For <hi>Druſus</hi> (although it be a hard matter for rule and concord to dwell together) ſhewed himſelfe indifferent to the yoong men; or at the leaſt, was not an enimie to them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>TIberius</hi> old, but fained determination of going to the Prouinces, is put on foote againe: pretending that there were a great number of old ſouldiers; and that the armies were to be ſupplied with a new muſter. For voluntarie men now wanted: or if there were anie; they were not of ſo vertuous and modeſt a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: bicauſe that for the moſt part, they are needie and vagrant perſons which voluntarily follow the wars. Withall, he tooke a ſhort viewe of the legions, and what Prouinces they defended: which giueth me occaſion to declare, what ſtrength the Romans had then in armes; what Kings their confederates; and how much leſſe the Empire then was. Italie had in both ſeas two nauies; the one at Miſenum, and the other at Rauenna; &amp; certaine Galleies called roſtratae to defend the coaſt adioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to Gallia: which <hi>Auguſtus</hi> had taken in the victorie at Actium; &amp; ſent to Foro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iulienſe, well appointed with ſea men. But the principall ſtrength conſiſted of eight legions neere vnto Rhene; a ſtaie as well to the Germans, as Galli. Spaine newely ſubdued had three legions. King <hi>Iuba</hi> had the Mauritanians, as a gift giuen him by the people of Rome: the reſt of Affricke had two legions; and Aegypt the like num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Then all from the beginning of Suria vnto the riuer Euphrates, which contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a great countrey, receiueth fower legions: <hi>Hybero,</hi> and <hi>Albanus,</hi> and other Kings being borderers, which by our greatnes are protected againſt forrain Kings. Thrace was vnder the gouernment of <hi>Rhoemetalces,</hi> &amp; <hi>Cotys</hi> children: and the banck of Danubium, two legions garded in Pannonia; and two in Maeſia. The like number was in Dalmatia, which by the ſituation of the countrey lie behinde them: that if on the ſudden Italie ſhould neede aide they were at hand. Albeit the citie had her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſouldiers; three citie cohorts, and nine Pretorian; almoſt all choſen out of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:18166:49"/>
Etruria, Vmbria, old Latium, and old Romans, ſent thither to dwell. The Galleies of confederats lay in the moſt commodious places of the Prouinces; the companies of horſemen; and aides of cohorts; not much inferiour in ſtrength: though not eaſilie laide downe, through their vncertaine flitting hither and thither; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times moe, ſometimes leſſe; as time and neceſſitie required. I thinke it alſo expedient to diſcribe the other partes of the common wealth, and howe they had beene gouerned vntill that daie: being the yeare, in which the ſtate beganne to decline, by <hi>Tiberius</hi> growing woorſe and woorſe. In the beginning, publicke and priuat affaires of greateſt importance, were handled before the Lords of the Senate: and the chiefeſt licenced to opine and debate mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: <hi>Tiberius</hi> himſelfe rebuking them if they fell to flattery. In beſtowing of offices he had regard to their aunceſtors merite in ſeruice abroad; or lawdable acts at home: ſuch only preferred: due authoritie reſerued vnto the Conſuls and to the Pretor: the meaner officers, each one exerciſing his owne function: and the lawes, (matter of treaſon excepted) duly executed. But for prouiſion of corne, and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uying of tributes, and other publick commodities; certaine ſocieties of gentlemen of Rome had charge of. <hi>Caeſar</hi> committed his owne affaires to honeſt and tried per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: and to ſome vnknowne, if they were wel ſpoken of: and ſuch as were once cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, continued ſtill, and grew old in the ſame charge. The people were diſtreſſed with a great dearth of corne; yet no fault thereof in the Prince: but with as great care and diligence as he could, remedieth the ſterilitie of the ground, and rough paſſages of the ſea: and gaue order that the prouinces ſhould not be oppreſſed with new taxations; and the old be borne, without couetouſnes and crueltie of magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates. <hi>Caeſar</hi> had ſmall poſſeſſions in Italie; and a reaſonable number of ſeruitours; and in his houſe a few freed men; and if he had a ſute againſt any priuate perſon, he tried it by law in the place of iudgement: all which he maintained, not with any courteous and mild courſe, but ſternely and feared; vntill by the death of <hi>Druſus</hi> all was turned vpſide downe. For whileſt he liued there was no alteration; becauſe <hi>Seianus</hi> beginning to riſe, ſought meanes to win credit, and feared leaſt <hi>Druſus</hi> would reuenge, who neuer diſſembled his hartburning, but often complained: <hi rend="margQuotes">That his ſonne being aliue, he had another coadiutor in the Empire: and what wanteth that he is not his companion? That the firſt ſteps to ſoueraigntie are hard; but once entred into, there will want no fauorers, nor followers: forts he had built as he liked beſt: charge giuen him ouer ſouldiers: his image was placed amongſt <hi>C. Pompeius</hi> monuments: and that he ſhould haue his nephewes common to the Druſian fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: that hereafter Modeſtie muſt be prayed vnto, that he would be contented with his greatnes. He did not vtter theſe ſpeeches ſeldome or to a few; and his wife be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing corrupted, his ſecrets were bewrayed. Seianus</hi> therefore thinking it time to make haſte, chooſeth a ſlow working poiſon; the better to father his ſicknes vpon ſome caſuall diſeaſe; which was giuen <hi>Druſus</hi> by <hi>Lygdus</hi> an Eunuch: as eight yeeres after it was knowne.</p>

               <p>BVt <hi>Tiberius</hi> all the time of <hi>Druſus</hi> ſicknes, ſhewed no ſigne of feare; perhaps becauſe he would ſhew his conſtancie: yea being dead, but not buried, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the Senate, and put the Conſuls which ſate on a lowe ſeate, as
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:18166:50"/>
a token of their ſorrow, in minde of their honors and calling. And hauing maſtered his owne griefe, comforted the Lords of the Senate, which powred downe teares with a continuall ſpeech, ſaying: <hi rend="margQuotes">That he knew well he might be blamed, for ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe in Senate, in ſo freſh a griefe: when the communication of deereſt friends and kinsfolks was ſcarſe ſeene, nor hardly the day, by many which lamented and mourned. Neither were they to be condemned of weakenes; yet he for his part had ſought for ſtronger comforts, out of the boſome of the common wealth.</hi> And hauing compaſſion on the Empreſſe old age, and tender yeeres of her nephewes, and of his owne decaying age, intreated that <hi>Germanicus</hi> children, the only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of preſent miſeries, might be brought before them. The Conſuls went out, and emboldening the yong men in that which they ſhould ſay, brought them before <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who taking hold of them, ſaid. <hi rend="margQuotes">Lords of the Senate, I deliuered theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therles children to their vncle; and beſought him, although he had iſſue of his owne, that he would bring them vp and cheriſh them, as if they were his owne bloud: and make them worthy for himſelfe and poſteritie. <hi>Druſus</hi> being taken from among vs, I turne my prayers to you, and beſeech you in preſence of the gods, and our countrey, that you would receiue, and gouerne <hi>Augustus</hi> nephewes ſonnes, deſcended of worthie progenitors; and accompliſh therein my dutie and your owne. Theſe <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Druſus,</hi> ſhall be in ſtead of fathers vnto you. You are ſo borne, that all your good and euill appertaine to the common wealth.</hi> With great weeping were theſe words heard, and prayers made that the yong men might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper: and if he had then ended his oration, he had filled the harts of the hearers with compaſſion towards himſelfe, and glory. But being fallen into vaine diſcourſes; as ſuch as had beene often laughed at, of yeelding vp the gouernment: and that the Conſuls or ſome other ſhould take the care vpon him, he diſcredited that which was both honeſt, and true. The ſame ſolemnities which were ordained for <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus,</hi> were appointed for <hi>Druſus;</hi> and as the manner is of the laſt flattery, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things added. His funerall in pomp of images was very magnificent: hauing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in a long proceſſion <hi>Aeneas,</hi> the beginning of the Iulian familie: all the kings of the Albani: and <hi>Romulus</hi> the founder of the citie. After him followed the nobilitie of the Sabins, <hi>Appius Clauſus,</hi> and the images of the reſt of the Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians. In deliuering <hi>Druſus</hi> death, I haue followed that which many true writers haue vttered: but I will not omit a very ſtrong report of thoſe times, yet currant in euery mans mouth, which is, that <hi>Liuia</hi> being alreadie corrupted to all diſhone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie of bodie by <hi>Seianus:</hi> he was ſayd to haue abuſed <hi>Lygdus</hi> bodie likewiſe: in age and beautie highly pleaſing his maiſter, and of all his ſeruitours of beſt credit; who being made priuie to the practiſe, the place and times agreed when the poiſon ſhould be giuen, grew to that audaciouſnes, that he turned all vpon <hi>Druſus</hi> head: and by ſecret aduertiſement, accuſed him to haue gone about to poiſon his father; and gaue <hi>Tiberius</hi> warning, to take heede of the firſt drinke his ſonne ſhould offer him at the table. Whereupon by that fraud, the banket being begun, the old man preſented <hi>Druſus</hi> the cup which he had receiued; who ignorant of the practiſe, like a raw yong man dranke it vp, increaſing thereby the ſuſpition, as though for feare and ſhame, he had ſwallowed that death which he had prepared for his father. This was the common rumor, which wanting a ground, and certaine author, thou mayeſt eaſily refute: for who is he though but of meane wiſedome, much leſſe <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius,</hi> experienced and beaten in waightie affaires, not hearing his defence, would haue offered his ſonne his death, and that with his owne hands; a thing remediles if he ſhould repent it? Why had he not rather tortured the miniſter of the poiſon?
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:18166:50"/>
ſought out the author, and vſed that delay, which vſually he did euen againſt ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, towards his owne ſonne; neuer before detected of any lewd fact? But becauſe <hi>Seianus</hi> was thought to be the inuentor of all bad actions, through the great good will <hi>Caeſar</hi> bore him, and the hate which the reſt bare to both; things were belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, although fabulous, and vncredible; report ſpeaking alwayes the worſt of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces deaths. The order of this fact hath been otherwiſe diſcouered by <hi>Apicata, Seia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> wife, and by torturing of <hi>Eudemus</hi> and <hi>Lygdus:</hi> and no writer found ſo great an enimie to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> although all hath beene ſought that may be ſayd, and inforced againſt him, that hath obiected any ſuch matter. The cauſe why I layd downe and blamed the common rumor, was, that vnder a manifeſt example, I might diſcredit falſe reports; and pray ſuch into whoſe hands our labours ſhall come, that they would not eſteeme more of common, vncredible tales, greedily receiued, then of truth not falſified into miracles.</p>

               <p>BVt whileſt <hi>Tiberius</hi> praiſed his ſonne before the people aſſembled; the Senat and the people rather for a ſhew, then from the hart, put on a mourning coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance: yet in their mindes reioyced, that <hi>Germanicus</hi> houſe began to flouriſh againe: which beginning of fauour, and <hi>Agrippina</hi> their mother not well diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling her hope, haſtened their ouerthrow. For when <hi>Seianus</hi> perceiued that <hi>Druſus</hi> empoiſoners eſcaped vnpuniſhed; and no publicke mourning of the people for his death; emboldned in wicked actions, bicauſe his firſt attempts had good ſucceſſe; began to caſt with himſelfe, by what meanes he might extinguiſh <hi>Germanicus</hi> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the vndoubted ſucceſſors to the Empire. For all three poiſon he could not, by reaſon of their keepers faithfulnes, and <hi>Agrippinas</hi> inuincible chaſtitie. He began therefore to inueigh againſt her obſtinacie, and ſtirre <hi>Augusta</hi> hating her of olde, againſt her; and incenſed <hi>Liuia</hi> with the memorie of her late fact; ſuggeſting that her pride; bearing it ſelfe vppon her fruitfulnes in children, by the fauour of the people gaped after the ſoueraigntie. This plot of his he proſecuted by the helpe of craftie accuſers; amongſt whom he had choſen <hi>Iulius Posthumus,</hi> a man noted of infamous life with <hi>Mutilia Priſca,</hi> a principall fauorite of the grandmother, and fit inſtrument for his practiſes, being highly in <hi>Augustas</hi> bookes: an old woman of her owne diſpoſition deſirous of rule, and therefore eaſily eſtranged from her daughter in law <hi>Agrippina.</hi> He had likewiſe inueighled <hi>Agrippinas</hi> neere kinred, to puffe vp her haughtie ſpirits, and vſe hard ſpeeches of <hi>Augusta.</hi> But <hi>Tiberius</hi> intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting no care of publicke affaires; and embracing buſines for ſolace; heard the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of citizens, and the ſuites of confederates: and by his perſwaſion, decrees of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat were made, that the citie of Cibyratica in Aſia; and Aegiris in Achaia, damni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by an earth-quake, might be relieued by remitting them three yeeres tributes. And <hi>Vibius Serenus</hi> Proconſull of farther Spaine, being condemned for publicke violence, through the crueltie of the time, was baniſhed into the Iland Amorgus. <hi>Carſius Sacerdos</hi> accuſed, as though he had helped the enimie <hi>Tacfarinas</hi> with corne, was quit; and <hi>C.

This <hi>Gracchus</hi> being verie yoong, was carried by his father <hi>Sempronius</hi> to the Iland Cercina, as a companion of his exile: where growing to mans eſtate amongſt baniſhed men, and ignorant of libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall artes; by turning and winding baſe marchandiſe in Affrica and Sicilia, he gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his liuing: and yet he eſcaped not the dangers of greater fortune. And if <hi>AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:18166:51"/>
Lamia,</hi> and <hi>L. Apronius,</hi> which gouerned Affrica, had not defended his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie; through the nobleneſſe of his vnfortunate ſtocke, he had taſted of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers calamities. That yeere came Ambaſſadors from cities of Greece; reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting that the auncient right of priuiledged places, might be confirmed at <hi>Iunos</hi> Temple at Samium, and <hi>AEſculapius</hi> Temple, at Cois. The Samians grounded themſelues on a decree of the <hi>Amphictyons;</hi> to whom belonged the principall exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of all matters; when the Grecians building cities through Aſia, were Lords of the ſea coaſts. The antiquitie of the Coi was not vnlike; hauing withall the merite of the place: for when by King <hi>Mithridates</hi> commaundement, all the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans were ſlaine throughout all the cities and Ilands of Aſia: they ſaued in the Temple of <hi>AEſculapius</hi> as many as they found. After this the Pretors hauing made many complaints, though in vaine againſt the ſtage-players: at laſt, <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſpake of their vnrulines and immodeſt behauiour; as hauing ſeditiouſly attempted many things in publicke, and many vndecently in priuate houſes. And the Oſcian play, a light ſport pleaſing the peoples humor, grew to ſuch inſolencie, that the Lords of the Senate were faine to interpoſe their authoritie, for the ſuppreſſing of it; and then the ſtageplayers were expulſed Italy. <hi>Caeſar</hi> had further griefe the ſame yeere, partly by the death of one of <hi>Druſus</hi> children, and partly by the death of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillius Longus</hi> his friend, and partaker of all his fortunes, proſperous or aduerſe: and among the Senators, his only companion, when he withdrew himſelfe to Rhodes. In regard whereof, the Senate ordained, that although he were but of meane parentage, yet that he ſhould haue the funerals of a Cenſor, and an image in <hi>Augustus</hi> forum: at the charge of the common purſe. For at that time the Senat managed all the affaires; in ſo much, that <hi>Lucillius Capito,</hi> Procurator of Aſia; the Prouince accuſing him, was forced to purge himſelfe before them: the Prince aſſuredlie auouching that he had giuen him no authoritie; but ouer ſlaues, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney matters between partie &amp; partie. But if he had vſurped the authoritie of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, or vſed the ſtrength of ſouldiers, he had therein contemned his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement; &amp; therefore that they ſhould heare the allies: and ſo the matter being heard, he was condemned. For which cauſe; and by reaſon that the yeere before <hi>C.

And for the ſame cauſe <hi>Nero</hi> gaue thankes to the Lords of the Senat, and to his grandfather: with the ioyfull acceptance of the hearers; as repreſenting <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus,</hi> yet freſh in memorie to their mindes: thinking that him they had both heard and ſeene.

And when ſhould he go out of his fathers authoritie, which ſhould obtaine that Prieſthood, or ſhe who was married vnto him? therefore that was to be redreſſed by decree of Senate, or by a law, as <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi> himſelfe had changed ſomewhat of that rude antiquitie, and reduced it to the preſent vſe.</hi> Thoſe things therefore being debated which touched the ceremonies, it was determined that nothing ſhould be altered in the makings of thoſe Prieſts: but a law was ordained, that ſhe who was married vnto a Flamen, by reaſon of the ſacrifices, ſhould be vnder the power of hir husband: and that in other caſes ſhe ſhould be as others were. And <hi>Maluginenſis</hi> ſonne was choſen in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers place. And that the prieſtly dignitie ſhould better be regarded, and they the readier to vndertake the ceremonies; it was ordained that to <hi>Cornelia</hi> the virgin, who was choſen in <hi>Scantias</hi> place, ſhoulde bee giuen <note n="*" place="margin">About ſeauen ſcore and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene pounde, and fiue ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liugs.</note> 
                  <hi>L L.

For <hi>Tiberius</hi> neuer a friend to <hi>Germanicus</hi> houſe, grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued impatiently that the yong men ſhould then be equalled vnto him in his old age: and ſending for the chiefe Prieſts, asked them whether they had done that at <hi>Agrippinas</hi> intreaties or threates: and although they denied it, yet were ſomewhat rebuked: the greateſt part being his neereſt friends, and kin, or chiefe gentlemen of the citie. Neuertheles in Senate he admoniſhed them in an oration, that none ſhould hereafter puffe vp the fickle minds of the yong men to pride, by vntimely and ouer-haſtie dignities. <hi>Seianus</hi> vrged eagerly, that the citie was no leſſe deuided into factions, then in time of ciuill warres; ſome terming themſelues to be of <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinas</hi> ſide; and more would if they were not preuented: and no way to redreſſe a waxing diuiſion, but by cutting off ſome one or two of the forwardeſt. Hereupon he beginneth with <hi>C. Silius,</hi> and <hi>Titius Sabinus, Germanicus</hi> friendſhip being dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to both: to <hi>Silius,</hi> becauſe that hauing had charge of a great armie ſeauen yeeres together, and vanquiſhed <hi>Sacrouir</hi> in Germanie, and obtained the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of triumph, the higher his fall, the greater the feare in others would be. Many were of opinion that <hi>Tiberius</hi> was the more vehemently incenſed, by reaſon of his owne lauiſhing toong, ouermuch vaunting that his ſouldiers had alwayes continued dutifull, when as others had growne to mutinies: and that <hi>Caeſars</hi> ſtate had bene ſhaken, if thoſe legions had bene deſirous of innouation: which <hi>Caeſar</hi> conſtrued as an embaſing to his greatnes, and diſabling him of abilitie to requite: for good turnes are no longer well taken, then they may be recompenſed: when they grow greater, then hope of requitall; in ſtead of thankfulnes they breede hatred and ill will. <hi>Soſia Galla,</hi> was <hi>Silius</hi> wife, badly thought of by the Prince, becauſe ſhe loued <hi>Agrippina.</hi> It was therefore thought conuenient to begin with theſe two, and not meddle with <hi>Sabinus</hi> for a time. The Conſull <hi>Varro</hi> being thruſt in, to accuſe them, vnder colour of a quarrell betwixt his father and <hi>Silius,</hi> became an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to gratifie <hi>Seianus</hi> with his owne diſcredit. The defendants intreating ſome delay, vntill the accuſers Conſulſhip were expired, <hi>Caeſar</hi> denied it, affirming it to be a vſuall matter for magiſtrates to call priuate perſons into queſtion: and that the authoritie of the Conſull was not to be infringed, through whoſe watchfulnes the common-wealth was kept without danger. That was a common tricke with <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:18166:52"/>
alwaies to cloake new coyned miſchiefe with old words. Therefore with great proteſtation, as though he had proceeded with <hi>Silius</hi> by order of law; or the matter belonged to <hi>Varro</hi> as Conſull; or therein conſiſted the ſafetie of the common-wealth: the Senate was called, the partie accuſed not once opening his mouth; or if he began to purge himſelfe, ſtuck not to vtter by whoſe malice he was oppreſſed. He was accuſed to haue had intelligence with the beginners of the warre: that he had diſcredited his victorie by his couetouſnes; and other things againſt <hi>Soſia</hi> his wife, nothing a long time ſpoken of <hi>Sacrouir.</hi> And doubtles the accuſation of polling the prouince could not haue ſerued their turne, had they not proſecuted all vnder treaſon: but <hi>Silius</hi> preuented his imminent condemnation, by his owne vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie death. Neuertheleſſe that contented not, but were greedie his goods ſhould be confiſcate, not to pay the ſtipendaries; for none of them demaunded ought: but becauſe <hi>Augustus</hi> liberalitie was at an end, he tooke a particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of all that was due to the publick treaſure: which was the firſt time that <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi> ſhewed himſelfe greedie of other mens money. <hi>Soſia</hi> was driuen into baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by <hi>Aſinius Gallus</hi> Conſull: who alſo aduiſed that part of the goods ſhould be confiſcate; &amp; part left vnto his children. But <hi>Lepidus</hi> contrarily, that the fourth part of the goods ſhould be giuen to the informers, according to the law; and the reſidue to his children. I finde that this <hi>Lepidus</hi> was in thoſe dayes a graue and wiſe man: who altered into the better many things, which others by cruell flatterie had ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: which he did with ſuch moderation, that he kept in, with <hi>Caeſar</hi> in no leſſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour then authoritie. Which cauſeth me to doubt, whether it happen as in other things by fatall deſtinie and natiuitie, that Princes are fauorably enclined to ſome, and to others hardly bent; or whether anything conſiſt in our counſels, to ſingle out a courſe free from ambition and danger, betweene ſelfewill ſtubbornes, and filthy flattery. But <hi>Meſſallinus Cotta</hi> being no leſſe nobly deſcended, differing from <hi>Lepidus,</hi> was of opinion; that by decree of Senat it ſhould be ordained, that gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of prouinces, though faultles themſelues; yet ſhould be puniſhed for their wiues crimes, no leſſe then for their owne.</p>

               <p>AFter this, they debated <hi>Calphurnius Piſos</hi> caſe, a noble man and of a fierce cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.

But bearing it in minde although the heate of diſpleaſure was cooled, yet he forgat it not. <hi>Granius</hi> alſo accuſed <hi>Piſo</hi> of ſecret ſpeeches, vſed againſt the maieſtie of the emperour: ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that he had poiſon in his houſe; and that he entered the Senate houſe with a weapon. This of the weapon was paſt ouer as not credible: but for other things ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greuated againſt him, he was arrained, but not conuicted; bicauſe he was preuented by death. Afterward <hi>Caſsius Seuerus</hi> cauſe was handeled; a baniſhed man, of baſe parentage, and lewde life; but a great Orator. Who had raiſed ſo many enimies againſt him, that by the iudgement of the Senate ſworne, he was confined to <hi>Creet:</hi> where following the like practiſes, drew on his head old and new hatred: and at laſt being depriued of all his goods, and baniſhed; ſpent the reſt of his life in the Ilande Seriphium. About the ſame time, <hi>Plautius Siluanus</hi> Pretor; the cauſe why, not

Not long after, <hi>Numantina</hi> his firſt wife accuſed, by charms and witchcrafts to haue put hir husband out of his wits, found innocent, is quit by the prince. That yeare the people of Rome was deliuered of a long warre againſt <hi>Tacfarinas</hi> the Numidian. For the captaines which till then had beene ſent againſt him, hauing obtained the markes of triumph: ſought no further how to extinguiſh the enimie. For there were now three images in the citie crowned with baies: and <hi>Tacfarinas</hi> ſtill continued ſpoiling and forraging Affrica; and augmented his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by the aide of the Moores: which vnder <hi>Ptolemy, Iubaes</hi> ſonne, a careleſſe youth, changed their ſeruile ſtate, and gouerment of freed men, into warre. The king of the Garamantes was a receiuer and partaker of his booties, and pillages: not that hee marched with an armie, but onely by ſending light horſemen, which a farre off were thought to be more then indeed they were. And in the prouince it ſelfe; ſome for need; and ſom of a turbulent humor ioined with him: bicauſe <hi>Caeſar</hi> conſidering how well <hi>Blaeſus</hi> had beſtirred himſelfe, called home the ninth legion; as though there had beene no enimies left at all in Affrica. And <hi>Dolabella</hi> Proconſull for that yeere, durſt not ſtaie them; fearing more the commandement of the prince, then the incertaintie and danger of the warre. Vpon this, <hi>Tacfarinas</hi> gaue it out, that the Romans had their hands full; were diſtracted with other nations: and therefore purpoſed by little and little, to retire out of Affrike. And then that the reſt might eaſilie bee ouercome, if all which preferred libertie before ſeruitude, woulde ioine and couragiouſly bend their forces againſt them: and gathering more ſtrength, encampeth before <hi>Thubuſcum,</hi> and laieth ſiege to it. But <hi>Dolabella</hi> draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the forces hee could make into one: partly the name of the Romans ſtriking a terror into their harts; partly bicauſe the Numidian is not able to indure the force of the footemen; at the firſt encounter, leuied the ſiege; fortified the moſt conuenient places: and withall, beheaded the chiefeſt of the Muſulani, which began to reuolt. In the end taught by experience of ſo many battels, that this fleeting enimie was not to be purſued with a maine campe; <hi>Dolabella</hi> ſent for King <hi>Ptolemy</hi> with his countriemen; and diuided his forces into fower companies; vnder the charge of ſeuerall Lieutenants and Tribunes. The out-riders and forragers were conducted by certaine choſen Moores: himſelfe at hand to giue direction to all. Not long after tydings came that <hi>Tacfarinas</hi> had encamped and erected ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins at an old ruinous fort, which himſelfe had once burnt, called Auzea; truſting to the place being inuironed with mightie great woods. Then the light horſemen and wings; not knowing whither, were lead away withall ſpeed. And at the daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the day, with the ſound of trumpets, and a dreadfull noiſe ſet on the enimies, halfe ſleeping, halfe waking; their horſes vnreadie, or diſperſed abroad at paſture. The Romans footemen were cloſe ranked; the troupes of horſemen in good order; all things in a readines for battell. The enimie on the other ſide in all things vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:18166:53"/>
had neither weapons, order, nor counſell, among them: but were haled, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and ſlaine like beaſts. And euerie ſouldier irked with the remembrance of his labours; and how oft deſirous to cope with the enimie he had beene deluded; fild himſelfe with reuenge and blood. Aduertiſement was brought from one compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie to another, to purſue <hi>Tacfarinas</hi> well knowen to them all: and that there would be no ende of that warre, if the Captaine were not ſlaine. But he with a choſen guard about him; ſeeing his ſonne alreadie taken, and the Romans on euerie ſide of him, ruſhing in among their weapons, with the loſſe of his life, eſcaped captiuitie. And that was the end of that warre. <hi>Dolabella</hi> deſiring the honour of triumphe, <hi>Tiberius</hi> denied it him: and gaue it <hi>Seianus,</hi> leaſt his vncle <hi>Blaeſus</hi> commendation ſhould be obſcured. But <hi>Blaeſus</hi> was neuer the more eſteemed; and the denying of the honour to <hi>Dolabella,</hi> augmented his honour: bicauſe that with a leſſer armie he had taken manie notable priſoners; ſlaine the Captaine, and caried away the fame of ending the warre. The Ambaſſadors of the Garamantes, a people ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſeene in the citie, came after the death of <hi>Tacfarinas,</hi> all aſtonied, as being of the conſpiracie to ſatisfie the people of Rome.

               <p>THe ſame ſommer beginnings of warre, attempted in Italie by bond-men, were ſuppreſſed by meere chaunce. The beginner of this tumult was <hi>T. Curtiſius,</hi> ſometimes a ſouldier of a Pretorian band; who at the firſt in ſecret conuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, in Brundiſium and townes adioyning; then by writings publikly ſpread abroad, tolled to libertie, the rude and fierce bond-ſlaues diſperſed in the woods: when by the fauour of the gods, there arriued three Galleies for the vſe of paſſengers in that ſea. And <hi>Curtius Lapius</hi> rent gatherer in thoſe countries; vnto whom by lot fell the Prouince Cales, according to the auncient cuſtome, hauing in a readines a power of ſea ſouldiers; diſcomfited the conſpirators, who then did but begin their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe. <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſent out of hand <hi>Staius</hi> a Tribune, with a ſtrong Power; who brought the Captaine himſelfe, and the ringleaders of this bold attempt to the citie; greatly afeard of the multitude of bond-men, which increaſed to a huge number; the free borne decreaſing dayly more and more. The ſame men being Conſuls, there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened a bloodie example of calamitie and crueltie, the ſonne accuſing the father: both called <hi>Q. Vibius Serenus;</hi> both brought before the Lords of the Senat: the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of baniſhment deformed, poore and vnhandſome, bound in chaines; and his ſonne pleading againſt him: who finely and featly attired with a cheerefull countenance; affirmed that ſecret practiſes had beene wrought againſt the Prince; and certaine firebrands of war ſent into Gallia to raiſe a rebellion; himſelfe being both accuſer and witnes. He charged <hi>Caecilius Cornutus</hi> once Pretor, to haue furniſhed them with money: who through the weariſomnes of trouble, accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the danger his bane, haſtened his owne death. But contrarily the defendant, ſtoutly turning towards his ſonne; ſhaking his irons, called the gods to reuenge; praying that they would ſend him to exile againe; to lead his life far from ſuch cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms; and inflict condigne puniſhment vpon his ſon. And affirmed conſtantly
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:18166:53"/>
that <hi>Cornutus</hi> was innocent, and frighted with a falſe accuſation; which ſhould eaſily be perceiued if ſome others were appeached alſo: for himſelfe could not practiſe the death of the Prince, and an innouation with one only companion. Then the accuſer named <hi>Gn. Lentulus,</hi> and <hi>Seius Tubero: Caeſar</hi> himſelfe being aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, to heare the chiefe of the citie, and his deereſt friends, <hi>Lentulus</hi> very aged, and <hi>Tubero</hi> of a weake body, accuſed of raiſing a rebellion, and diſturbing the common-wealth: and therefore both were incontinently acquited. The fathers bondmen were put to the racke, which made againſt the accuſer: who through the wickednes of his fact, growing halfe frantick, and terrified with the ſpeech of the people, which threatned either to caſt him headlong from the Robur, <note n="*" place="margin">A place in the priſon from whence malefactors were throwne headlong. <hi>Festus.</hi>
                  </note> or draw him in peeces; or puniſh him as a parricide, departed the citie: but brought back from Rauenna, was forced to end his accuſation: <hi>Tiberius</hi> nothing at all diſſembling the old grudge he bare <hi>Serenus</hi> the baniſhed. For after <hi>Libos</hi> condemnation, by letters he vpbraided <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that his ſeruice only was vnrecompenſed; with ſome other things, more peremptorily, then ſafely, to prowd eares, and readie to take offence. Eight yeeres after, <hi>Caeſar</hi> caſt this in his diſh, many waies carping his actions in the meane ſpace: although contrary to his expectation, through the conſtancie of his bondmen, the rack could extort nothing againſt him. When all had giuen ſentence that <hi>Serenus</hi> ſhould be puniſhed, according to the auncient cuſtome; <hi>Tiberius</hi> to bleare their eyes, and diſſemble his grudge, would not allow of the ſentence. <hi>Gallus Aſinius</hi> was of opinion, that he ſhould be confined in Gyarum or Donuſa; which he miſliked alſo, ſaying, that both thoſe Ilands wanted water: and that to whome life was graunted, things neceſſary for life ought to be graunted: whereupon <hi>Serenus</hi> was caried backe to Amorgum. And becauſe <hi>Cornutus</hi> had ſlaine himſelfe, it was propounded in Senat whether the informers ſhould looſe their rewards; if any arraigned only of treaſon and not condemned, ſlew himſelf. Which they had all followed, if <hi>Caeſar</hi> had not ſharply and openly, contrary to his accuſtomed manner, complained in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the informers, ſaying: that by that meanes the lawes would be brought to nothing, and the common wealth run to ruine; and that it were more tollerable to aboliſh the lawes themſelues, then take away the keepers of them. By this meanes the promooters, a race of men found out for a common ouerthrow and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and neuer duly puniſhed, were allured with rewards. Theſe continuall cauſes of ſorrow, were ſauced with ſome ſmall contentment: for <hi>C. Cominius</hi> a gentleman of Rome, conuicted of ſcandalous verſes againſt <hi>Tiberius,</hi> was pardoned at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treatie of his brother a Senator. A ſtrange caſe, that knowing what was beſt (for ſottiſh or ſenſeles he was not) and what fame followed clemencie; yet he deſired ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe of heauines and ſorrow. Neither is it a matter of deepe inſight to know the peoples affection, when they extoll Princes actions from the hart; and when from the teeth outward. And <hi>Tiberius</hi> himſelfe at other times, cunningly premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating his words, and with ſtaggering and ſtammering deliuering his minde: yet when he meaneth good in deed vnto any, findeth his toong readie and looſe. But when <hi>P. Suilius</hi> ſomtimes rent gatherer to <hi>Germanicus,</hi> was conuict for taking of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for giuing iudgment, &amp; therfore expulſed Italie: his opinion was that he ſhould be baniſhed into ſome Iland, and that with ſuch vehemencie, that he bound it with an oath, to be profitable for th ecommon wealth. Which for the preſent time was taken for a rigorous ſentence; but after <hi>Suilius</hi> returne, turned to his commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whome ſubſequent times ſawe mightie, but a ſlaue to money: a long time as he luſted, but neuer as he ought vſing Prince <hi>Claudius</hi> friendſhip. The ſame puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ordained againſt <hi>Catus Firmius</hi> a Senator, as falſly accuſing his ſiſter of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:18166:54"/>
treaſon. <hi>Catus</hi> as I haue alreadie ſaid, had inueighled <hi>Libo;</hi> then betrayed him and brought him to deſtruction. Which ſeruice <hi>Tiberius</hi> not forgetting, though pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending other cauſes, intreated that he might not be baniſhed; but that he ſhould be depoſed from the Senate, he hindered not. I am not ignorant that many of thoſe things which I haue rehearſed, and which I ſhall rehearſe hereafter, will ſeeme of ſmall moment, and not worthy the writing. But I wiſh not that any ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our annales with the writings of the auncient hiſtoriographers of the people of Rome: for they reported with a free diſcourſe, of mightie great warres, winning of townes, of Kings taken and ſlaine: or if they came to domeſticall affaires, they recorded the diſcords betwixt the Conſuls and the Tribunes; lawes concerning diſtribution of lands among the common people; and iarres betweene the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munaltie and nobilitie. But the ſcope of our diſcourſe is ſtreight, and our labour inglorious: the times I write of being peaceable and quiet, or no great warres: the ſtate of the citie dolefull; and the Prince careleſſe in dilating the Empire. Yet it ſhall not bee loſt labour to looke into thoſe things, which at the firſt ſeeme light; oft yeelding inſtruction of greater matters. For all Nations and Cities are gouerned by the people; or Peers; or one alone. A forme of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth conſtituted of one of theſe, may better be praiſed, then found: or if it chaunce to be found, it cannot long continue. Therefore as in times paſt the people bearing ſwaie, or the Lords of the Senate; the humor of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munaltie was to be knowen: and the meanes how with greateſt diſcretion they were to be dealt withall: and they iudged moſt wiſe and experienced; who had deeplieſt entered into the diſpoſition of the Senators &amp; nobilitie: ſo the ſtate being now changed; and the regiment conſiſting in one alone; it ſhall be conuenient to note thoſe things, which vnto that forme of gouernment doth beſt appertaine. For there are but few, which by wiſedome, diſtinguiſh honeſt things from diſhoneſt; and profitable from hurtfull; but moſt men are taught by others euents. And my writings bring more profit then delight; for ſituation of countries; varietie of battels; the death of famous Captaines; do feede and recreat the readers mindes. But we heape vp bloodie commaundements; continuall accuſations; deceitfull friendſhips; the ouerthrow of innocent perſons; and cauſes bringing the like end; matters tedious for want of varietie. The old writers had alſo this aduantage, that they had no detractors of their writing or fewe: not being materiall to any, whether he had praiſed the Affrican or Roman armies. But many are yet aliue, whoſe predeceſſors ſuffered puniſhment or infamie vnder <hi>Tiberius</hi> gouernment. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though their familie be extinguiſhed; yet thou ſhalt find many, which for confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of manners, thinke that others miſdeedes are obiected againſt themſelues. Glorie and vertue haue enimies likewiſe, according to the diſpoſition of euerie mans minde; framing reaſons contrarie to that which his own inclination is neereſt vnto. But I will returne to my firſt purpoſe.</p>

When <hi>M.

The Grecians, whoſe not onely libertie, but vnreſtrained licence eſcaped vnpuniſhed, I ſpeake not of: or if any felt himſelfe greeued, he reuenged words with other words. It hath bin alwaies a matter of free libertie, and leaſt ſubiect vnto detraction, to ſpeake of thoſe whom death had exempted from hatred and fauor. Do I incenſe the peope by orations to ciuill warre, with <hi>Caſſius</hi> and <hi>Brutus</hi> alreadie in armes, and maſters of the Philippian fields? Do not they (who ended their life aboue ſeauentie yeeres agone) as they are knowen by their images which the Conqueror himſelfe hath not pulled downe, ſo retaine ſome remembrance of them by writings? Poſteritie doth render vnto euery man the commendation he hath deſerued. Neither will there want ſome if I be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, which will make mention, not onely of <hi>Caſſius</hi> and <hi>Brutus,</hi> but of me alſo.</hi> Hauing thus ſaide, he went out of the Senat, &amp; ended his life by abſtinence. Order was giuen by the Senators, that the Aediles ſhould burne his bookes, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding were ſtill extant; ſome ſecretly; ſome publickly: which maketh me the willinglier to laugh at the witles vncircumpection of ſuch as thinke with the power and authoritie they haue in their own time, they can alſo extinguiſh the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of future times. But it falleth out contrary, that when good wits are puniſhed, their credit groweth greater: neither haue forraine Kings, or ſuch as haue vſed the like crueltie purchaſed any other thing, then diſcredit to themſelues, and to ſuch wits, glorie. This yeere accuſations were ſo hotly purſued, that euen on the feſtiuall daies of the Latines, <hi>Calphurnius Saluianus</hi> went to accuſe <hi>Marius</hi> before <hi>Druſus,</hi> Proueſt of the citie; as he was entering into the Tribunall to begin his charge: for which cauſe <hi>Saluianus</hi> being publikely blamed by <hi>Tiberius,</hi> was ſent into baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Great negligence was openly layd to the Cyzicenians charge, in not ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſing <hi>Augustus</hi> ſacrifices; and that they had vſed violence againſt the citizens of Rome. For which cauſe they loſt the freedome which they had gotten in the warre when they were beſieged by <hi>Mithridates,</hi> chaſing away the King, no leſſe by their owne manhood, then <hi>Lucullus</hi> aide. But <hi>Fonteius Capito</hi> who had beene Procon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of Aſia, was quit of the accuſation falſely forged againſt him by <hi>Vibius Serenus.</hi> And yet <hi>Serenus</hi> eſcaped vnpuniſhed, being odious generally to all, and therfore in greater ſafetie. For the more bitter an accuſer he was, the leſſe touched, and as it

were a ſacred perſon; but the light and baſe were puniſhed. At the ſame time farther Spaine ſent Ambaſſadors to the Senat, requeſting that by the example of Aſia they might build a Temple in honour of <hi>Tiberius</hi> and his mother. <hi>Tiberius</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king hold of this occaſion, though otherwiſe not greedie of honors, thought it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient to anſwere thoſe who had rumored abroad that he was carried away with ambition, as followeth. <hi rend="margQuotes">I know (Lords of the Senat) that many will accuſe me of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancie, for not deniyng the ſame requeſt vnto the cities of Aſia. I will therefore now declare vnto you the defence of my former ſilence, and what I would haue done hereafter. Seeing that <hi>Augustus</hi> of famous memorie did not hinder thoſe of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamum to erect a Temple in honour of himſelfe, and the citie of Rome: I who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue all his deedes and wordes in ſteed of a law, did the willinglier follow that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued precident; bicauſe the honor done vnto mee, redounded likewiſe to the Senate. But as it deſerueth pardon, once to haue accepted that honour: ſo throughout all the Prouinces with images like vnto gods to be reuerenced, ſauoreth of ambition and pride: and <hi>Augustus</hi> honor would come to naught, if it ſhould by flatterie vſed euerie where be made common. I for my part (Lords of the Senat) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt before you all, and deſire that poſteritie know, that I am mortall, and do like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men; and take it for honour ynough to be Prince. And they ſhall attribute e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to my memorie, which will beleeue that I haue not degenerated from my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors; that I haue beene carefull in your affaires; conſtant in dangers; not fearfull of diſpleaſure for the profit of the common-wealth. Theſe things ſhall be for me, temples in your mindes; theſe beautifull and laſting images: for thoſe which are built of ſtone, if in iudgment of poſteritie they become odious: are contemned for ſepulchers. Therefore I pray our allies, citizens, gods and goddeſſes; theſe, that they would giue me vntill the ende of my life, a quiet minde with the vnderſtanding of diuine and humane lawes; thoſe, that whenſoeuer I ſhall depart out of this life, they would haue me in remembrance with an honorable memory of my deeds, &amp; renown of my name.</hi> And in priuate places afterward diſliked ſuch adoration, which ſome interpreted to proceed of modeſtie; many of diſtruſt; and ſome for baſenes of mind and want of courage; becauſe of mortall men the beſt aſpire higheſt: ſo <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Bacchus</hi> among the Grecians; <hi>Quirinus</hi> among vs, were added to the number of the gods. <hi>Augustus</hi> had done better in hoping to be one.

That he neuer thirſted after high and eminent dignities; but choſe rather to watch and trauell like a common ſouldier for the ſafetie of the Emperour:
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:18166:55"/>
notwithſtanding that he had obtained that which ſeemed to be of all other the greateſt honor: that is, that he ſhould be thought worthy of <hi>Caeſars</hi> alliance; from whence ſprang the beginning of his hope. And becauſe he had heard that when <hi>Augustus</hi> in the beſtowing his daughter, had thought euen of gentlemen of Rome; ſo he beſought him, if a husband were thought vpon for <hi>Liuia,</hi> that he would haue him as a friend in minde, who would be content with the glory only to be allied to him: neuer purpoſing thereby to giue vp the charge impoſed vpon him, nor relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh his vſuall care: but would hold himſelfe ſatisfied, if his houſe might be aſſured againſt <hi>Agrippinas</hi> wicked malice, and that in regard of his children: and as for himſelfe, he deſired to liue no longer then he could employ himſelfe in the ſeruice of his Prince. <hi>Tiberius</hi> hauing praiſed <hi>Seianus</hi> great loue and zeale, and chiefely run ouer the benefits he had receiued of him, demaunding time as it had bene fully to deliberate on the matter, added; That other men conſulted of that only which was for their profit: but the conditions of Princes was of a different qualitie, whoſe ſpeciall drift was to direct their actions to fame: and therefore would not fall into that which was eaſie for him to haue written. That <hi>Liuia</hi> could determine with her ſelfe whether ſhe would marry againe or not, or remaine in the ſame familie: that ſhe had a mother and grandmother as neerer counſellers: he therefore would deale more ſimply, and ſpeake firſt of <hi>Agrippinaes</hi> enmities, which would be farre more incenſed, if <hi>Liuiaes</hi> marriage ſhould deuide <hi>Caeſars</hi> houſe as it were into parts, and breede emulation betweene the women; and conſequently the ouerthrow of his nephewes. What if any variance ariſe in that marriage? Thou art deceiued <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ianus,</hi> if thou thinkeſt to continue in the ſtate thou art now in, if thou marry <hi>Liuia,</hi> who hath beene wife vnto <hi>C. Caeſar,</hi> and afterward to <hi>Druſus;</hi> and imagin that ſhe beareth the minde to paſſe the reſt of her life with a Gentleman of Rome. And if I ſhould agree vnto it, doeſt thou thinke that they would ſuffer it, who haue ſeene her brother, her father, our auncetors in greateſt dignities? Thou wilt continue in the calling thou art now in; but thoſe magiſtrates and noble men which maugre thy teeth mount to authoritie, and determine of all matters, do report it, and that not in hugger mugger, that a long time ſince thou haſt climed higher then the degree of a gentleman, and gone beyond my fathers friendſhip; and for the hatred they beare vnto thee, blame me. But <hi>Augustus</hi> thought once to marry his daughter to a gentleman of Rome. Truly it was to be maruelled, that being diſtracted with ſo many cares, and foreſeeing that he who ſhould match in that place, ſhould by that alliance riſe to great aduancement, he would in familiar conference thinke vpon <hi>Proculeius</hi> and ſome others, which liued a notable quiet life, not medling at all with matters of eſtate. But if we be moued becauſe <hi>Augustus</hi> did doubt, only whether he ſhould beſtow her vpon a gentleman, how much more ought we to conſider that he gaue her to <hi>M. Agrippa,</hi> and then after vnto me. Theſe things I would not hide from thee for the friendſhip which is betwixt vs: but I will not be againſt thine nor <hi>Liuiaes</hi> deſeignments: and will forbeare at this time to ſpeake what I had caſt in minde, and how neerely I purpoſed to linke thee vnto me. I will only ſay, that there is nothing ſo excellent, but thy vertues and good will towardes me doth deſerue it; and when opportunitie ſhall ſerue, I will vtter it either in Senate, or before the people. Seianus</hi> hearing this anſwere was nothing pleaſed, not ſo much in regard of the marriage, as becauſe he feared <hi>Tiberius</hi> ſecret ſuſpitions; the rumor of the people; and enuie which grew faſt vpon him. Yet fearing if he ſhould caſt off thoſe great troupes which daily came to court, him he ſhould weaken his authoritie; and by entertaining them, miniſter matter of crime: the marke he ſhot at was, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:18166:56"/>
                  <hi>Tiberius</hi> to leade his life in ſome pleaſant place far from Rome; wherein he foreſaw many things, as that there could be no acceſſe to the Prince but by him; that all letters being conueied by ſouldiers which were at his deuotion, ſhould paſſe through his hands: that <hi>Caeſar</hi> declining now to age, and growen ſlothfull and effeminat through the quietnes of the place, would disburden himſelfe of cares of ſtate, and commit them to another: and that the enuie borne to himſelfe ſhould be diminiſhed, acceſſe to the Prince being leſſer: and by that meanes all vaine ſhadowes remoued, he ſhould grow mightie in true power and authoritie. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by little and by little he findeth fault with the buſines of the citie, the concourſe of people, the flocking together of multitudes; extolleth highly a quiet and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie life; a life without anguiſh of minde, and free from enuie: moſt fit to thinke on important and waightie affaires. And falling out by chance that <hi>Votienus Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus</hi> cauſe was to be heard, a man of a readie wit; <hi>Seianus</hi> perceiuing <hi>Tiberius</hi> not reſolued to leaue the citie, perſwaded him to be a very inconuenient mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be preſent at the aſſemblies of the Senate; leaſt he ſhould heare railing and reprochfull ſpeeches, but yet true, vttered of himſelfe in his owne hearing.

So the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſians being publikely made arbitrators of the cauſe; and laſt of all, <hi>Atidius Gemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> Pretor of Achaia determined the ſame.

many things of her beginning pleaſing vnto <hi>Tiberius</hi> eares, which mooued him to vndertake willingly the charge, as being of her blood. After that the Maſſiliens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts were heard, and the example of <hi>P.

It was to <hi>Lentulus</hi> a great honour, ouer and beſides that he was Conſull, and triumped ouer the Getuli, that he endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his pouertie patiently; then that hauing gotten great riches without iniuriyng of any, he vſed them temperatly. <hi>Domitius</hi> credit grew by his father, who was lord of the ſea in the ciuill wars; vntill he thruſt himſelf into <hi>Antonies</hi> faction; and after that into <hi>Caeſars.</hi> His grandfather was ſlaine in the Pharſalian battell, taking part with the nobilitie: and himſelfe choſen to marrie <hi>Antonia, Octauius</hi> yoongeſt daughter. After that he paſſed ouer the riuer Albis with his hoſt, and entered farther into Germanie, than any other before him; for which cauſe, he obtained the honour of triumphe. <hi>L.

                  <hi>LEntulus Getulicus,</hi> and <hi>C.

The cauſe of their rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, beſides their naturall diſpoſition, was, bicauſe they would not that any muſter ſhould be made of their ſtrongeſt and ableſt men for ſeruice: neuer accuſtomed to obey their Kings farther then themſelues liſted; or if they did ſend any aide, they appointed the conductor of them; and would make no warre but againſt the borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. There was alſo a rumor then ſpread, that they ſhould be diſperſed and brought into other nations and mingled with them.

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:18166:57"/>
new taxations: but if like vanquiſhed men they ſhould liue in ſeruitude, they had both weapons and youth, and a reſolute courage ether to die or liue in libertie. And therewithall, ſhewed their fortreſſes built on rocks, whither they had conueied their parents and wiues, and threatened an intricat, hard &amp; bloody war. But <hi>Sabinus</hi> giuing milde anſweres, vntill he had gathered his forces together: and when <hi>Pomponius Labeo</hi> was come with a legion out of Moeſia, king <hi>Rhoemetalces</hi> with the aid of his countreymen, which continued ſtill in their alleageance; with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he had at hand, he marched toward the enemie poſſeſſed of the ſtreights of the woods; ſome of the forwardeſt ſhewing themſelues in open place: which, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane captaine hauing ſtole vpon, were eaſily put to flight, with ſmall bloudſhed of the barbarians, by reaſon of their refuges at hand. Then fortifying in the ſame place, ſeaſeth on the mountaine, which was narrow and euen ridged vnto the next fort: garded with great, but vnorderly and confuſe ſtrength; and immediatly ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth before of his choiſe archers againſt the fierceſt of them before the trench, as the manner of the countrey is, ſinging ditties and verſes. They wounded many with ſhot a far off, and drawing neere, by a ſuddaine irruption of the enemie had bene driuen to the worſt; if the Sugambrien cohort which lay not far off, in dangers ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous, &amp; no leſſe fierce &amp; dreadfull in noiſe of ſongs &amp; clattering of armes, had not receiued them at a pinch. After this, <hi>Sabinus</hi> encamped neerer the enemie, leauing the Thracians, which (as I haue alreadie ſaid) came to our ſide at the firſt fort, with warrant to waſt, burne, carry away booties, ſo as they tooke no longer time then the day, and returne at night to ſet a ſure watch and a vigilant ouer the camp. Which at the firſt was obſerued: but afterward through riot, wantonnes, and deſire of riches, neglecting their wards, hunting after belly cheere, and ouertaken with wine, fell heauily all to ſleepe. The enemie vnderſtanding their retchles negligence, deuided his men into two ſquadrons; the one to ſet on the forragers, and the other to aſſaile the Romain camp; not with hope of any ſurpriſe, but by their clamors, and claſhing of weapons, euery man intentiue to his owne danger, they ſhould not heare the noiſe of the other skirmiſh: chooſing the night withall to make the fear the greater. But thoſe which aſſaied the trench of the legion were eaſily repulſed: the aid of the Thracians in the other fort terrified with a ſuddaine aſſault; part of them lying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleepe within the trenches; and part ſeeking prouiſion and ſtouer abroade, were ſo much the more cruelly ſlaine, becauſe they were reckoned to be as fugitiues and traitors, which bare armes to bring themſelues and their countrey into ſeruitude. The next day <hi>Sabinus</hi> ſheweth himſelfe in a place without aduantage to either ſide, to ſee whether the barbarians, glad of the nights ſucceſſe, durſt venter a battell. But ſeeing they went not out of their fortreſſes or hils adioyning, he began to lay ſiege to them with a ſtrong companie, caſting a trench and a parapet foure miles compas about them: after that by little and little, to barre them of water and forrage, ſtreightened his encloſure, the firſt enuironing the laſt: and raiſed vp a bulwarke ſo neere the enemie, that from thence they might throw ſtones, darts, and fires into the enemies camp. But nothing annoyed the enemie more then thirſt, a huge mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of rawe fighting ſouldiers, hauing but one fountaine left them for their vſe: withall, their cattell (as the cuſtome is among barbarous people) ſhut vp with them, died for want of ſtouer: dead carcaſes of men lay along, as well with wounds as thirſt; all corrupted with putrefaction, ſtench, and infection. And to make their troubled eſtate more miſerable, they fell at diſcord among themſelues; of all cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, the full meaſure: ſome readie to yeeld, ſome to die, ſome to ſtrike and kill one another: ſome perſwading couragiouſly to ſallie out, and not periſh without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge;
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:18166:57"/>
and theſe not of the baſeſt alloy, though deuided in opinions. But among the captaines, <hi>Dinis,</hi> a man ſtroken in yeares, and who by long experience had tried as well the ſtrength as clemencie of the Romaines; counſelled them to lay downe their armes, as the only remedie in their diſtreſſe: and was the firſt which yeelded himſelfe, with his wife and children, to the conquerors: the reſt which were weake, either through age, or ſexe, and deſired rather life then renowme, did the like. But the youth betweene <hi>Tarſa</hi> and <hi>Tureſis,</hi> both reſolued to die with libertie, were doubtfully diſtracted: but <hi>Tarſa</hi> crying that death was to be haſtened, and hope and feare to be cut off at once; and giuing example vnto others, thruſt himſelfe through the breaſt, many following the ſame death. <hi>Tureſis</hi> with his companie expected the night: our captaine not being ignorant thereof, and thereupon reenforced the watch. The night being ſtormie and tempeſtuous, the enemie now making a fierce outcry, and on the ſudden vſing a maruellous ſilence; droue the beſiegers into vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties: when as <hi>Sabinus</hi> went about from one place to another, exhorting them not to lay chance open to ſuch as by their doubtfull clamors, and fained ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, layde traines to intrap them; but that euery man ſhould keepe his ſtanding, and take heed he threw no dart in vaine. In the meane ſpace the barbarians cluſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring together by troups, now threw hand-ſtones againſt the rampire, iauelins burnt at the end, and troncheons of oake, now filled vp the ditches with ſhrubs, hurdles, and dead carcaſſes. Some of them hauing before made bridges, and ladders, planted them before the bulwarks, catched hold of them, labored to pull downe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, grapled, fought hand to hand with ſuch as reſiſted: contrarily the Romaine ſouldier beate them downe with ſpeares, thruſt them back with the pikes of their bucklers, lanced darts, and rowled heapes of ſtones from the wall vpon them. The hope of victory alreadie gotten, and that if they ſhould now faint and be ouercome, ſhame and reproch put life and courage into our; in them deſperate hope of life; many hauing their mothers and wiues bewailing and lamenting about them. The night animated ſome to boldnes; droue ſome into a feare: blowes flew on all hands; wounds giuen and taken vnlooked for; no man knowing his fellow from the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and the found of the voices as if it were an eccho rebounding behinde them in the turning and winding of the mountaine, brought ſuch a confuſion, that the Romaines abandoned their ſtandings and holds, as though they had been battered and broken downe: howbeit, a ſmall number of the enemies eſcaped aliue: the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue (the moſt couragious either ſlaine or wounded) at the opening of the day, were chaſed to their fortreſſes, and at length forced to yeeld; willing to accept the firſt conditions the winner would offer: to the reſt, a cruell and timely winter by reaſon of the hill Haemus was a ſafegard, that they could neither be ſubdued by force, nor ſiege.</p>

againſt the Prince. <hi>Agrippina</hi> being of a fell and haughtie diſpoſition, and then more then euer kindled through the danger of her neere coſen, haſteneth to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> whom by chance ſhe found ſacrificing to his father: and taking hold of that of occaſion, told him: <hi rend="margQuotes">it was two mens office to offer ſacrifice in memorie of <hi>Augustus,</hi> and perſecute his poſteritie: that the diuine ſpirite was not transfuſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to dumb ſtatuaes &amp; images: but the true image deſcended of celeſtiall blood felt the ſmart of his poſteritie: and therefore ſhe would take vpon hir the perſon of the partie accuſed: that it was in vaine to take exceptions againſt <hi>Pulchra,</hi> whoſe onely ruine was, that vnconſideratly ſhe had loued and reuerenced <hi>Agrippina:</hi> forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting what had fallen to <hi>Soſia</hi> for the ſame cauſe.</hi> Thoſe words prouoked <hi>Tiberius,</hi> although ſeldome vſing to open the ſecrets of his breaſt: and rebuking her in a Greeke verſe, ſaid, that therefore ſhe was diſpleaſed, bicauſe ſhe could not raigne. <hi>Pulchra</hi> and <hi>Furnius</hi> are condemned: and <hi>Afer,</hi> the excellencie of his wit knowen; and <hi>Caeſar</hi> attributing vnto him praiſe of eloquence, held among the chiefe orators. After this practiſed in accuſing and defending of parties; he was better knowen for eloquence, then honeſtie of life: ſauing that when his eloquence in his latter age decaied, and his ſpirits failed; yet was neuer quiet when if his toong walked not. But <hi>Agrippina</hi> frowardly perſiſting in anger, and incumbred with ſicknes, when <hi>Caeſar</hi> went to viſit her, powring downe in a long ſilence manie teares, at laſt burſt into en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie and entreatie; that he would redreſſe her ſolitarie life: and being yet but a yoong woman, prouide her a husband: Marriage being the only comfort of minds honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giuen: that there were ſome in the citie which would vouchſafe to receiue <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus</hi> wife and his children. But <hi>Caeſar</hi> not ignorant of what importance this requeſt was to the common-wealth; yet leaſt he ſhould openly ſeeme to diſpleaſe or feare her, gaue her though moſt earneſtly demaunding, no anſwere at all. That I finde not in the writers of Annales, but in the Commentaries of <hi>Agrippina</hi> her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who being <hi>Neroes</hi> mother, hath deliuered to poſteritie her life and calamities which fell to her friends. But <hi>Seianus</hi> in this dumpe, ſent her a meſſage vnlooked for, and vnder colour of friendſhip; which was that there was, poiſon prepared for her; and that ſhe ſhould auoide to eate or drinke with her father in lawe. But ſhe not knowing how to diſſemble, ſitting by him at table could not be woon to looke cheerefully, or ſpeake a word, or touch any meate: vntill at laſt <hi>Tiberius</hi> marked it either by chance, or bicauſe he had had ſome inckling of it. And to trie that more certainely, praiſing certaine apples as they were ſerued in, gaue of them with his owne hand to his daughter in law; which augmented <hi>Agrippinaes</hi> ſuſpition, and not once taſting of them, deliuered them to the waiters. Yet openly <hi>Tiberius</hi> ſpake not one word; but turning to his mother, ſaid, that it was no maruell, if he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſeuerely againſt her, ſeeing ſhe had an opinion, he went about to poiſon her. Thereupon a rumor was ſpread, that her deſtruction was ſought for; and that the Emperour durſt not openly attempt it: and therefore ſought ſecret meanes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe it. But <hi>Caeſar</hi> to ſtop that rumor ſhewed himſelfe often in Senat, and gaue the Ambaſſadors of Aſia audience manie daies togeither, when they doubted in what citie they ſhould erect a Temple in honor of him. A eleauen cities of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent power, ſtroue with like ambition for that honour, alleaging that there was not any great difference betwixt them; in antiquitie of time; loue and affection to the people of Rome; in the warres againſt <hi>Perſus</hi> and <hi>Ariſtonicus,</hi> and other Kings. The Hypaepeni &amp; Tralliani, togeither with the Laodiceni, &amp; Magnetiens were ſent away as not ſufficiently grounded. No nor the Ilienſes producing that Troy was the mother of Rome, had any foundation of their reaſonſauing onely antiquitie. But
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:18166:58"/>
ſome doubt was made of the Halicarnaſſi; bicauſe that for the ſpace of a thouſand and two hundred yeeres, their cities had neuer beene ſhaken with any earthquake; and that the foundation of their Temple was built vpon liuely ſtrong ſtone. The Pergameni were anſwered that they had receiued honour enough, in that they had <hi>Auguſtus</hi> Temple amongſt them; ſeeing that thereon they grounded their reaſon. It ſeemeth that the Epheſians and Mileſians had their cities occupied, the one in the ceremonies of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and the other of <hi>Diana:</hi> In ſo much that all the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reſted betwixt the Sardinians and Smyrnaeans. The Sardinians recited a decree of the Etrurians, as being of their blood: for <hi>Tyrrhenus</hi> and <hi>Lydus</hi> King <hi>Atyes</hi> ſons, diuided the land betwixt them, by reaſon of the increaſe of the people. And <hi>Lydus</hi> remained in his countrey, and <hi>Tyrrhenus</hi> went to ſeeke newe countries to inhabit; which were called by the names of their Captaines: they in Aſia, and theſe in Italie: and in progreſſe of time the Lydians growing to farther wealth, ſent people into Greece, which were afterward called Peloponeſians. They told vs alſo of letters ſent them by our Captaines, of treatiſe made with vs in the warre of Macedon; of the number of riuers; the temperature of their countrey; and what a rich territorie they had round about them. But the Smyrnaeans fetching their antiquitie a farre off; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that <hi>Tantalus</hi> from whence they came, was deſcended from <hi>Iupiter;</hi> or from <hi>Theſeus,</hi> iſſued alſo from the ſtocke of the gods; or elſe that ſome one of the Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons had founded them: alleaged farther the ſeruice they had done to the people of Rome; in which they moſt of all relied, and that they had giuen them ſu cour by ſea; not only againſt forreine wars; but alſo the wars of Italie. And that they firſt of all had dedicated a Temple in honor of Rome, <hi>M Porcius</hi> being Conſull. The people of Rome indeed then flouriſhing; but yet not lifted vp to the height of their greatnes: the citie of Carthage yet ſtanding, and many ſtrong Kings liuing in Aſia. They brought in <hi>L. Sulla</hi> for a witnes, whoſe armie being fallen into great danger through the roughnes of the winter, and want of apparell: when newes was brought thereof to the Smyrnaeans as they were aſſembled vpon occaſion; all which were preſent ſent the apparell from their owne backes vnto our legions. Thereupon the Lords of the Senats opinion being demaunded, they preferred the Smyrnaeans. And <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius Marſus</hi> counſelled farther, that ouer and aboue his charge, <hi>M Lepidus</hi> vnto whom the gouernment of that Prouince fell, ſhould haue a deputie appointed to take care of that Temple.

                  <hi>XIII.</hi> Why <hi>Tiberius</hi> abſented himſelfe from the Citie.</head>
               <p>WHileſt theſe things thus paſſed, <hi>Caeſar</hi> hauing deepely thought vpon, and after protracted his determination, at laſt goeth into Campania, vnder colour of dedicating a temple to <hi>Iupiter</hi> Capua, and another to <hi>Augustus</hi> at Nola: but indeede reſolued to leade his life far from the citie. The occaſion of his departure, although following ſome authors, I haue attributed vnto <hi>Seianus</hi> wiles: yet becauſe that after <hi>Seianus</hi> death he continued ſixe yeares in the like retired life, I am often induced to doubt, whether the cauſe be more truly to be referred to himſelfe, as going about to cloake by the place, his crueltie and looſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauior. Some were of opinion, that being through age, ſlender, tall, and crooked, bald headed, and his face ſpect with plaiſters and ointments, was therefore aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ſhew himſelfe in publick. And at Rhodes he was wont to ſhun companie,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:18166:59"/>
liue ſecretly, and hide his laſciuious diſſolute life. Some gaue out that his mothers inſupportable inſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie droue him away, whom as a companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ſtate he could not indure; nor yet be rid of her, bicauſe the ſoueraigntie it ſelf was her gift. For <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was determined to leaue the Empire to <hi>Germanicus</hi> his ſiſters nephew, who had a good report of all men: but being ouercome by his wiues importunate intreatie, he adopted <hi>Tiberius;</hi> and <hi>Tiberius, Germanicus:</hi> which <hi>Augusta</hi> did vpbrayd vnto him, and demanded the Empire againe which ſhe had beſtowed vpon him. He departed with a ſmall traine with him: one Senator who had bene Conſull, which was <hi>Coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceius Nerua,</hi> skilfull in the lawes; one gentleman of Rome beſides <hi>Seianus;</hi> and of noble men only <hi>Curtius Atticus.</hi> The reſt were men indued with liberall ſciences, moſt of them Grecians, with whoſe conference he purpoſed to paſſe the time. Some Aſtrologers gaue out that <hi>Tiberius</hi> departed Rome vnder ſuch a conſtellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he ſhould returne no more; which was cauſe of manies ouerthrow, which coniectured and diuulged that he had not long to liue: for they could not foreſee ſo incredible a matter, as that he ſhould want his countrey willingly eleuen yeeres together. Wherein did appeare not long after how neere coſens their arte and falſhood are; and how truth is diſguiſed and hidden vnder obſcuritie. For it was not ſpoken at aventure that he ſhould not returne againe, although they were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of other things which ſhould happen vnto him: or whether he ſhould quickly die, or not, which was not ſignified by thoſe words of theirs; becauſe he ended his latter yeeres in ſome village not farre off, or on the ſea ſhore, or neere vnto the wals of the citie. At that time a doubtfull and dangerous perill, which by meere chance <hi>Caeſar</hi> fell into, augmented the vaine rumor alreadie ſowne; and gaue him occaſion to put more truſt in <hi>Seianus</hi> friendſhip and conſtancie, then euer he had done before. For as they were eating in a countrey houſe called Spelunca, betwene the ſea Amuclanum, and the hils of Fundani, in a naturall grot or caue, certaine ſtones falling ſuddenly from the mouth of it, ſlew ſome of his ſeruitors; which ſo affrighted the reſt, that they fled all away. But <hi>Seianus</hi> with his knees, his face and hands leaning and hanging ouer <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ſet himſelfe againſt the other ſtones which were falling, and in that plight was found by the ſouldiers which came to ſuccour them. This made him greater then he was: and although he ſhould haue giuen moſt pernitious counſell, yet ſhould haue had fauorable audience, as one nothing caring for ought which might happen to himſelfe. He tooke vpon him the office of a iudge againſt <hi>Germanicus</hi> iſſue, ſuborning ſome to play the parts of accuſers, and inueigh eſpecially againſt <hi>Nero</hi> next in ſucceſſion; although a modeſt yong man, yet oftentimes forgetfull of that which was requiſit for the preſent time, pricked forward by his freed men and followers, which thought it long till he were Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, to ſhew himſelfe bold and ſtout of courage: perſwading him that that the people of Rome deſired, the armie couered, and that <hi>Seianus</hi> durſt do nothing to the contrarie; though now he inſulted alike ouer the patience of the old man, and ſloth and cowardlines of the yong. <hi>Nero</hi> hearing theſe or the like ſpeeches, yet dreamt of no bad practiſe: although ſome wilfull and vnconſiderate ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſlipt now and then from him: which when the ſpies ſet ouer him had augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted &amp; carried to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and <hi>Nero</hi> not ſuffered to purge himſelfe; droue manie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſundrie doubtes. Some ſhunned to meete him; ſome hauing ſaluted him, turned preſently from him; many brake off abruptly their talke. <hi>Seianus</hi> fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers on the other ſide laughed in their ſleeues to ſee it. <hi>Tiberius,</hi> whether the yoong man ſpake vnto him, or held his toong, caſt a malicious eye, or ſmiled diſſemblingly vpon him: and whether he ſpake or helde his toong, it was alwaies a
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:18166:59"/>
crime in him. Neither was he ſecure from treaſon in the night; his wife bewraying his watchings; his dreames; his ſighes to <hi>Liuia</hi> her mother, and ſhe to <hi>Seianus:</hi> who drew <hi>Druſus, Neroes</hi> brother, to his ſide with a hope of the Empire, if he could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue his elder brother which was alreadie downe and out of credit. <hi>Druſus</hi> was of a cruell and fell diſpoſition; and beſides the deſire of rule, and hatred which vſually raigneth betwixt brothers: he was incenſed with enuie to ſee <hi>Agrippina</hi> their mother readier bent to do <hi>Nero</hi> good, then himſelfe. And yet <hi>Seianus</hi> did not ſo much ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Druſus,</hi> but that he proiected in his minde ſome meanes of his ruine: knowing well that he was verie fierce and head-ſtrong; and therefore eaſilie intrapped. In the ende of this yeere two famous men died, <hi>Aſinius Agrippa,</hi> rather of a renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned then auncient ſtocke, himſelfe not degenerating from them; and <hi>Q.

                  <hi>XIIII.</hi> The falling of an Amphitheater, and the hurt which enſued: <hi>Tiberius</hi> reedifieth certaine houſes burnt in the hill Caelius.</head>
               <p>WHen <hi>M. Licinius,</hi> and <hi>L. Calphurnius</hi> were Conſuls, a ſudden and vnlooked for miſchance as ſoon ended as begun, might haue been compared to the calamitie of mightie warres. For an Amphitheater begun at Fidena, one <hi>Atilius</hi> a freed man, to ſet foorth a play offencers; as one hauing neither abundance of wealth, nor ambitious in winning fauour of the people; but by niggardly ſparing to make a baſe gaine in the workmens hire; did neither laye a ſounde foundation, nor faſten the timber frame erected vppon the ſame. Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther flocked many, verie deſirous of ſuch ſhewes, both men and women of all ages; partly by reaſon it was ſo neere vnto them; and partly becauſe that, during <hi>Tiberius</hi> empire, they were barred from ſuch paſtimes; whereby the miſchiefe was the greater. For the pile being great, and filled full with a throng of people, then falling aſunder, whether it fell inwards, or ſpred outwards, it carried downe headlong, and ouerwhelmed a huge multitude of people, intentiue on the ſhew within, or gazing round about. Thoſe which at the beginning were cruſht to death by that hap, eſcaped languiſhing torment. They moſt of all were to be pitied, which being bruſed and broken, yet liued, and in the day knew their wiues &amp; children by ſight, and in the night by lamentable howling &amp; crying. Thoſe which were abſent moued with this report, one lamented his brother; another his neere kinſeman, another his parents: yea they were afraide if their friends and coſens were out of the way, although for other occaſion; doubting ſtill they had been there; and becauſe it was not certainely knowne whom that violent ruine had beaten downe, the vncertaintie ſpread the feare the farther. As ſoone as they began to remoue the frame, they flocked about the dead bodies, ſome kiſſing, ſome imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them; and fell often at debate, in miſtaking one for another, by reaſon they were diſſigured, through ſome reſemblance of countenance, and likenes of yeeres. Fiftie thouſand perſons were ſlaine or maimed by that miſchance: and a decree layd downe by the Senate, that from thence forward no man ſhould exhibit the play of Fencers, who was leſſe worth then <note n="*" place="margin">About 3130. pound.</note> foure hundred thouſand ſeſterces: nor that any amphitheater ſhould be built but in a firme and ſound place: and <hi>Atilius</hi>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:18166:60"/>
was baniſhed. After that freſh calamitie, the houſes of the chiefe gentlemen were open; medicines and phiſitions appointed for the bruſed and mangled: and the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, although heauie and ſad, yet then were like their aunceſtors, which after great battels, did relieue and comfort the wounded with all care and liberalitie. That miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune was ſcarſe paſt, but the rage and violence of a fire conſumed the citie more then euer, and burnt the hill Caelius. That was reported to be an vnluckie yeere, and that the princes abſence was begun in a diſmall houre; as the manner of the people is, to draw caſuall miſhaps to blame, if <hi>Caeſar</hi> had not preuented them, by beſtowing of money to euery man according to his loſſe. For which liberalitie, thanks in Senat were giuen him by the noble men: and the people gaue him a good report, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that without ambition or intreatie of friends, he had of his owne motion helped and called ſtrangers vnto him. And diuers were of opinion, that the mount Caelius ſhould after that bee called mount <hi>Augustus:</hi> becauſe that when all was waſted with fire round about; onely the image of <hi>Tiberius</hi> which was in <hi>Iunius</hi> a Senators houſe, remained vntouched. <hi rend="margQuotes">The ſame happened in times paſt to <hi>Claudia Quinctia;</hi> and therefore her image twice eſcaping violent rage of fires, our aunceſtors did conſecrate in the Temple to the mother of the gods: an argument, that the Claudians are accounted ſacred, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued among the number of the gods: and therefore the ceremonie ought to be augmented in the place, where the gods haue ſhewen ſo great fauour towards ſo mightie a Prince.</hi> It ſhall not be amiſſe to ſhew, how that hill was in old time called Querquetulan, bicauſe it was fertill and abundant with oakes: then <hi>Caelius</hi> of Caele Vibenna, who being Captaine of the Etrurian nation, and ſuccoured the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, obtained that ſeat of <hi>Tarquinius Priſcus,</hi> or of ſome other King; for in that point writers do varie. As for the reſt, it is without controuerſie, that thoſe great companies of ſouldiers did inhabit alſo the plaines, and places adioyning to the place of aſſemblies: and thereupon that was called the Thuſcian ſtreet, of the name of the ſtrangers which came thither to inhabit. But as the beneuolence of noble men, and largeſſe of the Prince, was a great comfort in their aduerſitie; ſo the credit and authoritie of informers more and more increaſing, wrought the ouerthrowe of manie. <hi>Domitius Afer</hi> accuſed <hi>Varo Quinctilius,</hi> a wealthie man and neere kinne to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> hauing before condemned <hi>Claudia Pulchra</hi> his mother: no man maruelling that being long a needie companion, &amp; hauing waſtfully conſumed his late recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, ſhould arme himſelfe to farther miſchiefe. But that <hi>P. Dolabella</hi> was his ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low picthanke, iſſued of noble kinred, and allied to <hi>Varus,</hi> was a miracle ouerthow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by that action himſelfe, and diſtained his nobilitie and blood. Yet the Lords of the Senat would not agree thereto, but thought it conuenient to expect the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours comming: which for the time was the onely ſhift againſt imminent miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes. But <hi>Caeſar</hi> hauing dedicated his temples in Campania, albeit he had giuen warning by edict, that no man ſhuld diſturbe his quietnes; &amp; hindered the concourſe of townſmen by placing of ſouldiers in the way: yet being awearie of townes and colonies, and all places ſituated in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinent, withdrew himſelfe to the Iland Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preas, three miles diſtant by ſea from the fartheſt part of the promontorie of Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum. I eaſily beleeue that, that Iland did fit his humor, hauing neither hauen nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, &amp; thoſe conueied in very little veſſels: no man landing but the watch was preſently acquainted with it. The temperature of the aire is in winter milde, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that a hill oppoſite vnto it, beateth back the force of the windes. In the ſommer ſeaſon it is open to the Weſternwinde, and hath verie pleaſantly the ſea on euerie ſide, and a goodly proſpect towardes the hill Veſuuius, vntill by fire the face of the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:18166:60"/>
place was changed. The report goeth that the Greekes did poſſeſſe that place, and that the Theleboians inhabited the Iland Capreas. But at that time <hi>Tiberius</hi> occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied the place, and ſeated himſelfe in twelue countrey houſes of pleaſure: and how much more in former times he was earneſtly bent vpon the publick good, ſo much the more, now ſecretly he aba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>doned himſelf to looſe life &amp; naughtie idlenes. He was neuer more ſuſpitious &amp; credulous then now: a qualitie which <hi>Seianus</hi> whileſt he was abiding in the citie whetted on; and which did now more then euer diſquiet him: and no longer vſing ſecret treacherie to intrap <hi>Agrippina</hi> and <hi>Nero,</hi> put ouer then ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as it were to record in Chronicles what meſſages they receiued; who reſorted to them; what they did either ſecretly or openly.

               <p>
                  <hi>IVnius Silanus,</hi> and <hi>Silius Nerua</hi> being Conſuls, the yeere had a foule beginning; by reaſon <hi>Titius Sabinus</hi> an honorable gentleman of Rome was drawn to priſon, onely becauſe he was a friend to <hi>Germanicus:</hi> neuer omitting to ſhew all tokens of dutie to his wife and his children; and of all <hi>Germanicus</hi> followers the onely man which viſited them at her houſe, and accompanied them abroad: and therfore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the good, and diſliked by the bad. Againſt him <hi>Latinius Latiaris, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius Cato, Petitius Rufus,</hi> and <hi>M. Opſius,</hi> who had beene ſometimes Conſuls, bent their malice, through a greedines of the Conſulſhip; which they could not obtaine but by <hi>Seianus</hi> meanes: and <hi>Seianus</hi> liking could not be purchaſed, but by ſome notable peece of villanie. They had ſo complotted betweene them, that <hi>Latiaris,</hi> who was ſomewhat allied to <hi>Sabinus,</hi> ſhould lay the ſnare; and the reſt be preſent as witneſſes; and then begin the accuſation. Hereupon <hi>Latiaris,</hi> at the firſt began to caſt out ſpeeches at randon; then to extoll his conſtancie, that he did not as others did, fawne in proſperitie, and ſhrinke from a houſe in aduerſitie; with other honorable ſpeech of <hi>Germanicus;</hi> and bewayling and pitiyng <hi>Agrippinaes</hi> eſtate. And ſeeing <hi>Sabinus</hi> (as mens minds are ſoft and tender in calamitie) to powre downe teares and complaints; <hi>Latiaris</hi> began more boldly to touch <hi>Seianus</hi> crueltie, pride, &amp; the hope he gaped after: not forbearing vnreuerent ſpeeches againſt <hi>Tiberius.</hi> Theſe ſpeeches as though they had beene ſauced with ſomewhat which durſt not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouched, made ſhew of ſtreight friendſhip betweene them: ſo far that <hi>Sabinus</hi> often times ſought out <hi>Latiaris;</hi> frequented his houſe; vttered his griefes vnto him, as to a muſt truſtie &amp; faithful friend. Thoſe whom I ſpake of before, conſulted of ſome meanes how theſe ſpeeches mightbe heard of manie; for the place of their two meetings moſt be priuat: and if they ſhould ſtand behinde the doore, they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraide of being ſeene, or of a noiſe; or leaſt ſome ſuſpition ſhould growe by ſome chance. Betweene the roofe and the ſeeling, the three Senators (the place no leſſe vnſeemly then the treaſon deteſtable) hid themſelues, and laid their eares cloſe to holes and chinkes to liſten what was ſaide. In the meane ſpace <hi>Latiaris</hi> hauing found <hi>Sabinus</hi> in the market place, as if he had ſome new matter to tell him, draweth him home, and into his chamber; beginneth to rip vp things paſt and preſent, which
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:18166:61"/>
yeelded ſtore of matter, and inforceth new occaſions of feare. <hi>Sabinus</hi> doth as much, and more at large: the nature of griefes being ſuch, that when we once enter into the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hardly can we finde an end. This done, they began immediately their accuſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and ſent letters vnto <hi>Caeſar,</hi> declaring the order of their owne lewde practiſe, and ſhamefull act. The citie was neuer in greater perplexitie and feare, then at that time; euery man eſtranging himſelf euen from his neereſt kindred and acquaintance: they auoided all meetings, conferences, eſchuing as well knowen friends, as ſtrangers: yea they haue an eie to mute and ſenceleſſe things, and ſearched the roofes and wals of their houſes. But <hi>Tiberius</hi> requeſting by writing that the ſolemnities of the new yeere might be celebrated in the Kalends of Ianuarie; turned his talke to <hi>Sabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> charging him that he had corrupted ſome of his freede men, to attempt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what againſt his perſon; and therefore boldly demaundeth a reuenge, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay was graunted: and being condemned, he was drawne and haled with his garments turned ouer his head, &amp; almoſt throtled, cried alowd. <hi rend="margQuotes">Is this the beginning of the new yeer? be theſe the ſacrifices which are ſlaine in <hi>Seianus</hi> honor? which way ſoeuer he did caſt his eies, or vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſoeuer he directed his ſpeech, they al fled: the place of aſſemblies &amp; the ſtreets were emptie; ſom came back &amp; ſhewed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, afeard for that they were ſeene to be afeard. For what daie was paſt free from executions; if betwixt the ſacrifices and the vowes, at what time the cuſtom was to abſtaine from prophane ſpeeches, fetters and cordes are ſpoken of? And it was ſaid that <hi>Tiberius</hi> could not through ignorance incur this hatred; but contrarie, that he ſought to haue it knowen, that without any let, new magiſtrates might as well open the priſons, as Temples and altars.</hi> After that he ſent letters of thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, that they had puniſhed an enimie to the ſtate; adding withall, that he ſtoode in feare of his life, and was ielous of his enimies practiſes, though naming none: yet no man doubted but he aimed at <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Agrippina.</hi> If I had not purpoſed to declare the occurrents of the yeeres as they fell out, I could willingly in this place haue ſet downe before his time, what ends <hi>Latinius,</hi> and <hi>Opſius,</hi> and the other contriuers of that lewd practiſe had com vnto; not only after that <hi>C. Caeſar</hi> was come to the Empire, but whileſt <hi>Tiberius</hi> was yet aliue: who, as he would not ſuffer the miniſters of his wickednes to be puniſhed by others; ſo oftentimes hauing had of their ſeruice his fill, and freſh offered to continue the trade; he ſought all meanes to extinguiſh the olde, as perſons odious vnto him. But what puniſhment theſe and others of the like conditions, endured, ſhall be declared in his place and time. Then <hi>Aſinius Gallus</hi> whoſe children <hi>Agrippina</hi> was aunt vnto, thought it conuenient that <hi>Tiberius</hi> ſhould vtter vnto the Senators of whom he ſtoode in feare, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to be remooued. But as it was thought <hi>Tiberius</hi> of all his vertues was fond of none ſo much as of his diſſimulation: and therefore diſliked much that he ſhould be vrged to diſcloſe that which he went about to conceale. But <hi>Seianus</hi> tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered the matter; not for any loue he bare <hi>Gallus;</hi> but bicauſe he would haue the Princes lingring delaies come to light; knowing well that he was ſlow in his delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations: but if he had once ſet them abroch, that his bad ſpeeches were ioyned with cruell deeds. The ſame time <hi>Iulia</hi> died, whom <hi>Augustus</hi> hauing conuicted of adulterie, had exiled into the Iland Trimerus, not farre from the Apulian ſhores: where ſhe indured twentie yeers exile, ſuſtained by <hi>Auguſta;</hi> whoſe maner was by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret practiſes to ſubuert her ſonnes in lawe when they were in proſperitie, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew them pitie when they were in miſerie.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe ſame yeere the Friſians beyond Rhene forſooke their obedience, rather through our couetouſnes, then impatiencie of liuing vnder our ſubiection. <hi>Druſus</hi> in regard of their ſmall abilitie, had impoſed a ſmall tribute on them which was a certaine of oxe hides for the war, no man reſpecting what ſtrength or largenes they were of; vntill <hi>Olennius</hi> a Captaine of a principall enſigne and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernor of the Friſians, made choiſe of the skins of the beaſt called Vrus, &amp; of that hignes. As that had beene a heauie burden for other nations; ſo the Germains could leaſt of all others endure it: whoſe woods although full of huge ſauage beaſts; yet at their houſes haue but ſmall heards: firſt therefore they deliuered theſe oxen; then their poſſeſſions; and laſtly the bodies of their wiues and children into bondage. From hence grew their griefe and complaints: and ſeeing that no man relieued them, they ſought a redreſſe by warre; laid hands on ſuch ſouldiers as receiued the tribute, and hanged them vp. <hi>Olennius</hi> eſcaped the furie of the enimie by flying to a Caſtle called Fleuus, ſtrengthened with no ſmal power of citizens and conſederats; which held the coaſtes of the Ocean in ſubiection. Which when <hi>L. Apronius</hi> Propre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of lowe Germanie vnderſtood, he ſent for the chiefeſt enſignes of the legions of higher Germanie, &amp; aides as wel of the horſme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as footme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; broght both the armies ouer Rheine, into the Friſian land: the rebels forſaking the ſiege of the Caſtle to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their owne. Then <hi>Apronius</hi> maketh cauſeies and bankes, and ſtrong bridges o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the next arme of the ſea, for the huge armie to paſſe ouer. And in the meane time hauing found ſom foords, comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth the wing of the Caninefates, &amp; ſuch footmen as ſerued vnder vs, to hem in the enemie behind. Who raunged into battle aray to fight, droue back the confederates, &amp; legionarie horſmen ſent as an aide. After that were ſent three cohorts lightly armed; then two more: &amp; a little after a ſtrong com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of horſmen. Strength ſufficient, if they had charged couragiouſly togither; but comming ſome after ſome, &amp; dropping in by companies; they neither gaue courage to the fearfull, but carried away themſelues with like feare, ran all away for company. The reſidue of the aides he committed vnto <hi>Cethegus Labeo,</hi> Lieutenant of the fift legion: who perceiuing things to go doubtfull on his ſide, ſent to demaund more aide of the legions. The fift legion couragiouſly iſſuing firſt out with a hot skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, put the enimie to flight; receiued into them the wounded and wearied cohorts. The Roman Captaine ſought neither to reuenge, nor burie the dead bodies; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there had been ſlaine manie Tribunes, Prefects, and diuers Centurions of marke &amp; fame. It was after knowen by the fugitiues, that the fight held on vntil the next day, and that there were nine hundred Romans ſlaine in a wood called Badu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henna: and that another power of 400. which had taken the village of Cruptorix, (which ſometime had receiued pay of the Romains) fearing treaſon, ſlewe one another. This got the Friſians great renowme among the Germains: <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> diſſembling his loſſes, leaſt hee ſhould commit the charge to ſome other: and the Senate, beeing poſſeſſed with domeſticall feare, regarded not much whether the remote part of the Empire went diſhonorably to wracke or not: but ſtroken (as I haue ſayde) into a feare, ſought a remedie by flatterie. And albeit they had propounded many matters to deliberate on, yet they decreed, that all layde aſide, there ſhould be two altars erected, one vnto Clemencie, and another vnto Friendſhip: and that <hi>Caeſars</hi> and <hi>Seianus</hi> images ſhould be ſet
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:18166:62"/>
about them: and intreated moſt earneſtly they would vouchſafe them ſo much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour as that they might ſee him. Neuertheleſſe they went neither to Rome, nor any place there about, but thought it ſufficient if they went out of the Iland, and be ſeene in Campania next adioyning vnto it. Thither reſorted the Lords of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, Gentlemen, and many of the common people, heauie for <hi>Seianus;</hi> vnto whom, acceſſe was hardlieſt obtained, and that with great crouching, by approouing and participating his deſeignments. It well appeared his arrogancie grew greater, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he bluſhed not to ſee ſuch open, baſe, and filthie ſeruilitie vſed. For at Rome it was a vſuall matter for men to walke the ſtreetes, and by reaſon the citie is great, no man knew anothers buſines: but there ſome lying night and day in the field, ſome on the ſea ſhore, without any difference, endured either the pride of the porters, or had fauour as pleaſed them; vntill that that was alſo denied them. Then they returned to the citie with diſcontented feare: and <hi>Caeſar</hi> not hauing vouchſafed either to looke, or ſpeake vnto them: and ſome, whoſe vnfortunate friendſhip with <hi>Seianus</hi> portended their imminent death, were glad in an ill time. <hi>Tiberius</hi> hauing publickly giuen his neece <hi>Agrippina, Germanicus</hi> daughter vnto <hi>Gn. Domitius,</hi> commaunded that the marriage ſhould be ſolemniſed in the citie. He made choiſe of <hi>Domitius,</hi> as well for the antiquitie of his ſtocke, as neereneſſe in bloud to the <hi>Caeſars:</hi> for <hi>Octauia</hi> was his grandmother, and by her, <hi>Augustus</hi> his vncle.</p>

She was firſt married vnto <hi>Tiberius Nero,</hi> and had children by him: who being driuen out of his countrey in the warre of Peruſium, and a peace after confirmed betwixt <hi>Sext. Pompeius,</hi> &amp; the Triumuiri, returned to the citie againe. After that <hi>Augustus</hi> rauiſhed with her beautie (whether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her will or not it is vncertaine) tooke her from her husband, ſhewing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo luſtfull of her, that not giuing her time to be deliuered of her firſt husbands childe, brought her great as ſhe was to his owne houſe. After that ſhe had no iſſue, but being vnited to <hi>Augustus</hi> bloud, by the mariage of <hi>Germanicus</hi> and <hi>Agrippina,</hi> they had nephewes children common to them both. Her behauior was, according to the carriage of auncient times; yet more courteous then women of former ages could well allow; an vntollerable mother, a tractable wife, with the ſubtletie of her husband, and diſſimulation of her ſoone, well medled and compoſed. Her funerals were not ſumptuous, her teſtament long voide. She was praiſed in a funerall oration before the Roſtra, by <hi>C. Caeſar</hi> her nephewes ſonne, who not long after ſucceeded in ſoueraigntie. But <hi>Tiberius</hi> omitting no part of his pleaſures, excuſed by letters his abſence from his mothers obſequies, as though he had been hindered by important affaires; and vnder colour of modeſtie, cut off many honorable ceremonies, which the Lords of the Senate had decreed ſhould be done in memory of her; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that no diuine ceremonie ſhuld be ordained for her, becauſe (ſaid he) ſuch was her will. And in part of the ſame letters he found fault with ſuch as went about to win womens fauor &amp; good will: therein couertly carping the Conſull <hi>Fuſius,</hi> a man highly in <hi>Augustus</hi> grace, &amp; his crafts-maſter in winning of womens fauor, a ieſting mate, &amp; oft accuſtomed bitterly to skoffe at <hi>Tiberius;</hi> a thing which great pote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tates keepe long in memory. But now <hi>Tiberius</hi> began to grow worſe and worſe, &amp; his rule tyranous: for whileſt his mother liued, there was ſome refuge left, becauſe he had a long time accuſtomed to ſhew himſelfe dutifull vnto her; and <hi>Seianus</hi> durſt not croſſe her: but then hauing as it were the bridle in their owne hands, they brake looſe at once, and letters were ſent againſt <hi>Agrippina</hi> and <hi>Nero;</hi> which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people iudged to haue been ſent before, but kept back by <hi>Augusta:</hi> for not long after her death they were read in Senate, containing bitter and ſharp words; yet neuer obiected that he had borne armes, or ſtirred any rebellion againſt him, but only vnnatural loues to yong men, and incontine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t life. But againſt his daughter in law he durſt not obiect ſo much, but only her arrogant and prowd ſpeeches, and obſtinate minde. The Senators were ſtroken into a feare and ſilence, vntill ſome few whoſe hopes depended not on honeſt meanes, but made publick calamities occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of priuat benefits; demaunded that the matter might be referred to voices:

                  <hi>Cotta Meſſallinus</hi> ſhewing himſelfe moſt forward with a cruell ſentence. But the other chiefe gentlemen, and eſpecially the magiſtrates were afraid; for although <hi>Tiberius</hi> had angerly inueighed againſt them, yet he left other things in doubt. There was in the Senat one <hi>Iunius Rusticus,</hi> choſen by <hi>Caeſar</hi> to ſet downe the actes of the Senators (and therefore was thought to know beſt his intent and purpoſe) who either by fatall deſtinie (for before he had giuen no token of his conſtancie) or ſubtle deuiſe, forgetting imminent perils, whileſt he feareth vncertainties, thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth himſelfe among the Conſuls yet wauering and doubting what to do; and aduiſeth them not to put the matter to deliberation, ſaying: that greateſt matters might be turned in a moment: and that ſome ſpace of time ought to be giuen the old man to repent himſelfe: and the people withall carying <hi>Agrippinaes</hi> and <hi>Neroes</hi> images with them, enuiron the Senat houſe, and wiſhing all proſperous fortune to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> crie, that thoſe letters were falſe; and that the ouerthrow of the Princes houſe was intended againſt the Princes will: and ſo there was nothing concluded that day in preiudice of the parties. Certaine counterfeit iudgements were ſpread abroad againſt <hi>Seianus</hi> vnder the Conſuls names. Some men ſecretly, and therefore the more ſaucily practiſing their wits as their fancie lead them, which yeelded <hi>Seianus</hi> farther matter of calumniation, and kindled his anger: ſaying, that the Princes diſpleaſure was nothing regarded: that the commons were at iarre with the Senate: that new orations and new decrees of Senate were heard and read now adayes. What remaineth but to take armes in hand? and chooſe thoſe for their Captaines and Emperours, whoſe images they had followed for their enſignes? Whereupon <hi>Caeſar</hi> reiterating his iniurious ſpeeches againſt his nephewe and daughter in lawe, and rebuking the people by edict; complained to the Senate, that the imperiall maieſtie had bene openly deluded and skorned through the fraude of one of the Senators: and therefore required that the hearing of the cauſe might be reſerued wholy vnto himſelfe. They conſulted no farther on the matter, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the parties, but not to death, becauſe they were forbidden: and proteſted they were readie to execute reuenge, if the Prince had not hindered them.*</p>

Whereupon they were carried to priſon, the ſonne hauing ſome feeling of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger which hung ouer his head; but the daughter was ſo ſimple, that ſhe often asked, whither they would leade her, and for what? that ſhe would do no more ſo; and that it was ſufficient to chaſtice her with the rod like a childe. The writers of that time affirme, that becauſe it was neuer heard of before, that a virgin ſhould be put to death according to the cuſtome of the Triumuiri: that ſhe was deflowred by the executioner immediatly before the halter was put about her neck: and both ſtrangled. The bodies of theſe yong and tender children were caſt into the Gemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, a place where condemned perſons were throwne downe headlong. About the ſame time, Aſia and Achaia were put into a very great fright, though it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued not long, with a rumor that <hi>Druſus, Germanicus</hi> ſonne, had beene ſeene firſt in the Ilands Cyclades, and afterward in the continent. But it was a yong man of like age, whome ſome of <hi>Caeſars</hi> freed men by a ſubtile practiſe followed, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring men in hand, they knew it to be him. Such as knew him not, were drawne by the fame of his name, and the Greekes eſpecially, prone to all new and ſtrange wonders. It was reported he had eſcaped out of priſon and fled to his fathers armie, ſome both faining and beleeuing withall that he would inuade Aegypt or Syria. Youth flocked alreadie to him very cheerefully; many ſignes of loue publickly ſhewen him, feeding themſelues with the preſent vaine hope of what might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. When as <hi>Poppaeus Sabinus</hi> had tidings thereof, who was then occupied in the affaires of Macedonia, had charge alſo ouer Achaia: he therefore, were the report true or falſe, to preuent all things, haſtning ouer the Toronaean and Thermaean cut, and paſſing by Euboea, an Iland of the Aegean ſea, and Piraeum a coaſt of Attique, the Corinthian ſhore, and the ſtreights of Iſthmum; by another ſea came to Nicopolis, a colonie of the Romaines: and there after a carefull examination vnderſtandeth who he ſhould be. He ſaid he was <hi>M. Silanus</hi> ſonne, and that many of his followers hauing forſaken him, he embarked himſelfe, as though he meant to trauell into Italie. Theſe things he ſignified to <hi>Tiberius</hi> by writing: neither haue we found any thing more of the beginning or end of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Towards the end of the yeere a quarrell of certaine Conſuls burſt forth, which had beene a long time a breeding.

and cold humor, did not only anſwere and quaile his fellow Conſull, but brought him within the compaſſe of conſpiracie, and to be examined for it. And although many of the Lords of the Senate intreated them that they woulde ſurceaſe their quarrell, which would grow to their owne ouerthrow; yet they continued their grudge and menaces one againſt the other, vntill they went both out of office.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>N. Domitius</hi> and <hi>Camillus Scribonianus</hi> entered the Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, when <hi>Caeſar</hi> hauing paſſed the ſtreight betwixt Capreas and Surrentum, coaſted Campania, doubtfull whether he ſhould enter into the citie or not: perhaps becauſe he had otherwiſe reſolued in his minde, though making ſhew he would come: oftentimes approching neere the citie, and to the gardens along Tiber, and returning back againe to the rocks, and deſerts of the ſea, to couer the ſhame of his laſciuious life: which ſo vnſtayedly he wallowed in, that, as the manner of the kings was, he defiled and abuſed noble mens ſonnes vnder age; and not only the welfauored and comelyeſt, but the modeſt and well nurtured, and whoſe modeſt behauiour ſhewed the ſtock from whence they grew, ſerued him for prouocation of filth. Then firſt of all were thoſe vnknowen words of Sellaries and Spintries found out of the filthines of the place, and ſundrie ſorts of ſufferance of abuſe. Some of his ſlaues had charge to ſeeke them out, and bring them to him; alluring ſuch by gifts as ſhewed themſelues willing and readie; and threatning ſuch as refuſed: and if either their neere friends or parents went about to detaine them, they vſed violence, and caried them away perforce; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed their willes on them as if they had been captiues. But at Rome in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the yeare ſeuere iudgements were giuen againſt <hi>Liuia,</hi> and againſt her ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and other memories conſecrated in her honor; as if her lewdnes had then firſt come to light, and had not been alreadie puniſhed. The <hi>Scipioes</hi> gaue their opinion, that <hi>Seianus</hi> goods ſhould be taken from the publick treaſury, and put in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces priuat cofers. The Silanians and Caſſians were of the ſame opinion, and vrged it with the ſame tearmes, or not greatly changed: when on the ſudden and vnloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for, <hi>Togonius Gallus</hi> among thoſe noble men, thruſting himſelfe forward, being but of baſe and low calling, had the hearing giuen him, as a matter to laugh at: for he deſired the Prince to chooſe twentie by lot out of a certaine number of Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, to gard and defend his perſon with weapon, as oft as he went to the Senate. He beleeued peraduenture that <hi>Tiberius</hi> had meant good earneſt when he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that one of the Conſuls might conduct and aide him from Caprea to the citie. <hi>Tiberius</hi> neuertheleſſe accuſtomed ſometimes to interlace ſerious matters with skoffes, <hi rend="margQuotes">thanked the Lords for their good will: yet demaunded whom he might omit? or whom he might chooſe? whether alwaies the ſame, or ſometimes others in their ſteede? ſuch as had borne office, or yong men: priuate perſons or magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates? what a goodly ſight it would be to ſee them take a ſword in hand at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie of the councell houſe? neither would he make ſuch accompt of his life, if he were to maintaine it by armes.</hi> This he anſwered to <hi>Togonius,</hi> tempering his words, and perſwaded no farther the diſallowing of that opinion. But he rebuked <hi>Iunius Gallio</hi> very bitterly, who propounded that the ſouldiers of the gard after their ſeruice was ended, might haue a roome in the fortieth ranke of ſeates: and asked
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:18166:65"/>
him <hi rend="margQuotes">as it had been in their preſence, what he had to do with ſouldiers? for whom it was not lawfull either to receiue commaundement or gift, but of the Emperour: or whether he had found out that which <hi>Augustus</hi> of famous memory could not prouide for? It was rather a matter of diſcord and ſedition, ſought for by one of <hi>Seianus</hi> followers, to ſtirre vp rude mindes vnder title of honor to corrupt the cuſtome of ſeruice.</hi> This was the reward which <hi>Gallio</hi> receiued for his artificiall flatterie; and anon after was driuen out of the councell houſe, and then out of Italy. And becauſe it was obiected that he could eaſily indure exile, hauing made choiſe of the famous and noble Ile of Lesbos, he was recalled to the citie, and kept in the magiſtrates houſes. In the ſame letters, to the great contentment of the Lords of the Senate, <hi>Caeſar</hi> touched <hi>Sestius Pagonianus,</hi> who had been ſometimes Pretor, to the quick: audacious, malignant, and prying into all mens ſecrets; beloued of <hi>Seia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and by him employed to lay ſnares to intrap <hi>C. Caeſar:</hi> which being once layd open, all the hatred a long time hatched againſt him burſt foorth; and ſentence of death decreed againſt him, if he had not promiſed to bewray the complices. But when <hi>Acreus</hi> had accuſed <hi>Latinius Latiaris</hi> hated both alike, it was a moſt gratefull ſpectacle vnto all. <hi>Latiaris,</hi> as I haue rehearſed before, was the principall agent of circumuenting <hi>Titius Sabinus;</hi> and then the firſt that receiued puniſhment for it. Among theſe accuſations <hi>Haterius Agrippa</hi> ſetteth vpon the Conſuls of the laſt yeere, asking them why they are now ſo ſtill, and ceaſe from the accuſations begun the one againſt the other? it was feare, and guilt of conſcience which made them friends; but the Lords of the Senate would not ſo put vp that which they had heard. <hi>Regulus</hi> ſaid, he would ſtay for a time of reuenge, and that he would proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the matter before the Prince. <hi>Trio</hi> anſwered, that emulation and enuie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt collegues were better forgotten; and iniurious words if any had paſſed. <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa</hi> vrging on ſtill, <hi>Sanquinius Maximus</hi> one of the Conſuls, deſired the Senators that they would not increaſe the Emperours cares by hunting after matter of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and that he himſelfe was able to redreſſe theſe things; and ſo <hi>Regulus</hi> life was ſaued, and <hi>Trioes</hi> ruine deferred. <hi>Haterius</hi> was ſo much the more odious, becauſe that withered and vnluſtie with ſleepe, or laſciuious watchings, and through his dull drouſie diſpoſition, nothing fearing the Prince, though cruell, euen in his brothell houſes, and looſeſt laſciuiouſnes, dreamt of nothing but how to ſubuert the nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. After that, <hi>Cotta Meſſalinus,</hi> the author of euery cruell ſentence, and hated of old, as ſoone as occaſion was offered, was accuſed to haue vttered certaine things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Caeſar;</hi> and among others, that he was in his ſecret parts both man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and after a banket on the birth day of <hi>Augusta</hi> among the Prieſts, he tearmed that a Nouendinale ſupper, or belonging to a mortuary: &amp; that repining at <hi>M. Lepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> and <hi>L. Arruntius</hi> power and authoritie, hauing a ſute depending againſt them for a money matter, he ſhould ſay, that them the Senate would defend, but me my little <hi>Tiberius</hi> will ſupport. The chiefe of the citie conuicted him without any delay, and purſuing him eagerly, he appealed to the Emperour. And not long after letters were brought from <hi>Tiberius,</hi> in which in manner of a defence, calling to minde the beginning of friendſhip betweene him and <hi>Cotta,</hi> and his many good turnes and ſeruices, requeſted that words might not be hardly wreſted, and that the ſimplicitie of table talk might not be imputed to him as a crime. The beginning of theſe letters
of <hi>Caeſars</hi> was worth the noting, which was this: <hi rend="margQuotes">What I ſhall write vnto you Lords of the Senate, or how I ſhall write, and what I ſhall not write at all, at this time the gods and the goddeſſes confound me worſe then I feele and know my ſelfe daily to periſh, if I know.</hi> So far his villanous demeanor turned to his own ſcourge &amp; puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:18166:65"/>
And therefore that moſt deepe wiſe man did not ſay without cauſe, that if ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants minds were laid open, a man ſhould ſee them torne &amp; rent in ſunder: for as the bodie is rent with ſtripes; ſo the mind is torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted with crueltie, wanton affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; euil counſels. For neither his great fortune, nor ſolitarie places could defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d <hi>Tiberius,</hi> but that himſelf confeſſed the torments &amp; puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which lay hidden in his breaſt. Then the Senators hauing receiued authoritie to determin of <hi>Caecilianus</hi> according to their wils, who had vttered manie things againſt <hi>Cotta:</hi> their iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was that he ſhould receiue the ſame puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that <hi>Aruſeius</hi> &amp; <hi>Sanquinius</hi> had, who were <hi>L. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runtius</hi> accuſers. Then the which nothing euer hapned more honorable to <hi>Cotta:</hi> who being indeed of noble birth, but through riot needie, and infamous for his vices, in honorable puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is made equall to <hi>Arruntius,</hi> a man of ſincere and honeſt life.</p>

                  <hi>QVintus Seruaeus</hi> after this, and <hi>Minutius Thermus</hi> were brought in. <hi>Seruaeus</hi> had beene Pretor and <hi>Gerusanicus</hi> companion. <hi>Minutius</hi> a gentleman, and who in <hi>Seianus</hi> friendſhip had carried himſelfe modeſtly; and therefore both the more pitied. But <hi>Tiberius</hi> contrariwiſe blaming them as principall agents, commaunded <hi>C.

They were accuſed of all they had ſpoken whereſoeuer, either in the place of aſſemblies, or at their table; euerie man making haſte to preuent, and be before another in carriyng of tales; ſome of them to ſaue themſelues; other ſome infected as it were with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe gotten by conuerſing with others. But <hi>Minutius</hi> and <hi>Seruaeus</hi> were condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and their goods giuen the accuſers. <hi>Iulius Africanus</hi> borne at Santon a towne in Gallia, and <hi>Seius Quadratus</hi> were drawen into the like miſhap; but the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion why, I haue not found. I am not ignorant that the dangers and puniſhment of many haue beene omitted by writers being ouer-wearied with multitude; or fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring leaſt thoſe things ſhould be tedious to the readers, which ſeemed ſuperfluous and lamentable to themſelues in rehearſing. There haue come many things to our eares woorthie the knowledge: although other haue not once touched them.

               <p>AFter that <hi>Tiberius</hi> ſent letters againſt <hi>Sext. Vestilius</hi> ſometime Pretor, and welbeloued of <hi>Druſus</hi> his brother, &amp; choſen to be one of his garde. The cauſe of diſpleaſure againſt <hi>Vestilius;</hi> was either bicauſe he had compoſed certaine writings againſt <hi>Caeſars</hi> vncleane life; or falſly fathered vpon him, gaue credit to the reporters: and therupon being baniſhed the Princes court &amp; familiarity, hauing firſt gone about with his owne olde feeble hand to ſlaie himſelfe bound vp his vaines: and in the meane ſpace hauing entreated the Princes fauour, and receiued arigorous anſwere, did at laſt open them. Then at once were accuſed of treaſon, <hi>Annius Pollio, Appius Silanus, Scaurus Mamercus Sabinus Caluiſius,</hi> &amp; <hi>Vicinianus</hi> alſo brought in with his father for companie, all of them well deſcended and ſome in authoritie. The Lords of the Senat quaked for feare; for how manie was there which was not either allied, or a friend of one of thoſe noble men? But <hi>Celſus</hi> Tribune of the citie-cohort, and then an informer deliuered <hi>Appius</hi> and <hi>Caluiſius</hi> from danger. <hi>Caeſar</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred <hi>Pollioes, Vicinianus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Scaurus</hi> cauſe, that himſelfe might haue the hearing of it with the Senators: hauing giuen out alreadie tokens of heauie diſpleaſure againſt <hi>Scaurus.</hi> Not ſo much as women but were partakers of danger: and if not attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for attempting to aſpire to the Empire; yet brought in queſtion for their teares: and <hi>Vitia</hi> an old woman <hi>Fuſius Geminus</hi> mother was put to death, bicauſe ſhe bewai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the death of her ſonne. Theſe things were done in Senat. And where the Prince was, the like was practiſed: <hi>Veſcularius Atticus,</hi> and <hi>Iulius Marinus</hi> two of his moſt familiar friends, which accompanied him to Rhodes, and at Capreas neuer depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from him, were put to death. <hi>Veſcularius</hi> was the Meſſenger to and fro when the treacherie was wrought againſt <hi>Libo. Marinus</hi> was of <hi>Seianus</hi> counſell when he put <hi>Curtius Atticus</hi> to death; moſt men being glad to ſee them taken in the ſnare they
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:18166:66"/>
laid for others. About the ſame time <hi>L. Piſo</hi> high Prieſt died a naturall death, which was a rare matter in thoſe times in a man of ſo great nobilitie: He neuer of himſelfe propounded any matter which ſmelled of flatterie or baſe minds; &amp; if he were forced thereto, he vſed great moderation in doing it. His father, as I haue alreadie ſaide, had beene Cenſor; he liued to the age of fowerſcore; hauing in Thrace deſerued the triumphall ornaments. But his greateſt credit roſe in that, that being newly created Prouoſt of the citie, he did gouerne exceeding moderately all the time of his continuall rule: irkeſome through vnwontednes of obedience. For in times paſt when the Kings or Conſuls went out of the citie, leaſt ſhe ſhould be left without gouernment, there was one choſen for a time able to giue euery man right, &amp; prouide for all ſudden accidents. And it is ſaid that <hi>Dentres Romulius</hi> had the ſame charge giuen him by <hi>Romulus;</hi> after that <hi>Numa Marcius</hi> by <hi>Tullus Hostilius,</hi> and <hi>Spurius Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretius</hi> by <hi>Tarquinius Superbus.</hi> Then that the Conſuls had the charge of commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this office; and a ſhadow of it continueth vnto this day; as oft as the Latine feaſts are folemniſed, one is appointed ouer the reſt to exerciſe the roome of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſull. But <hi>Augustus</hi> in the time of ciuill warres, made <hi>Cilnius Maecenas</hi> a gentleman, Prouoſt ouer Rome and all Italie. Then being Lord and Maſter of the Empire, by reaſon of the greatnes of the people, and ſlow aide which the lawes affoorded; he choſe out one, of ſuch as had been Conſuls, to bridle the bondmen and ſuch citizens as through audaciouſnes would grow troubleſome, vnleſſe they ſtood in awe. The firſt that receiued that authoritie, but kept it but awhile, was <hi>Meſſalla Coruinus,</hi> as vnable to diſcharge it. Then <hi>Taurus Statilus</hi> although he were verie aged, went through it with great commendation. After that <hi>Piſo</hi> was well liked for the ſpace of twentie yeeres; and by order of the Senat honoured with publick funerals. It was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward propounded before the Lords of the Senat by <hi>Quinctilianus</hi> Tribune of the people, concerning the Sibyls booke, which <hi>Caninius Gallus</hi> one of the fifteene, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted might be receiued among other books of the ſame propheteſſe; and deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it might be ſo eſtabliſhed by decree of Senat: which being giuen by common conſent, <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſent letters ſomewhat reprehending the Tribune, as ignorant of the old cuſtome by reaſon of his youth; and vpbraided <hi>Gallus</hi> that being old and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the ſcience and ceremonies; neuertheles had demanded the opinion of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators not fully aſſembled; the author being vncertain, and before the colledge had yeelded their iudgment; neither as the cuſtome was, the verſes hauing been read and waighed by the maiſters. Withall he aduertiſed them, becauſe that many vaine things were publiſhed vnder the name of famous men, that <hi>Augustus</hi> had vnder penaltie ſet downe a day, within which ſuch bookes ſhould be brought to the citie-Pretor; and that it was not lawfull for any to haue them in their priuat poſſeſſion. The like decree was eſtabliſhed by our predeceſſors alſo; and after that the Capitol was burnt in the ciuill war, their verſes were ſought in Samum, in Ilium, Erythrum; through Affrike alſo, Sicily, and the colonies of Italie, whether they were one or many: the buſines being committed to the Prieſts to diſtinguiſh the true prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies from the falſe, as neere as might be by the iudgement of man. And then alſo the booke was referred to the examination of the fifteene. When the ſame men were Conſuls, through a dearth of corne and other prouiſions, they grew almoſt to a commotion: and many things for many dayes together were in the Theater more licentiouſly demaunded with great eagernes, then the manner had beene to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund things of the Emperour. Whereat being moued, he blamed the magiſtrates and Senators that they had not by publike authoritie brideled the inſolencie of the people: and added withall, how farre greater quantitie of corne he had cauſed to be
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:18166:67"/>
brought then <hi>Augustus,</hi> and out of what prouinces. Whereupon a decree of Senate was enacted, to reſtraine the people, according to the auncient ſeueritie, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls being no leſſe forward to publiſh it: his owne ſilence in the cauſe was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued to be a point of ciuilitie as he looked it ſhould be, but was imputed to his pride. In the end of that yeare, <hi>Geminius, Celſus, Pompeius,</hi> Gentlemen of Rome, were put to death for conſpiracies; among which, <hi>Geminius</hi> through prodigalitie and looſenes of life, and a friend to <hi>Seianus,</hi> was a man of nothing. And <hi>Iulius Celſus</hi> a Tribune, looſing the chaine he was bound with at large; then winding it about, and forcing himſelfe a contrary way, brake his owne neck. But <hi>Rubrius Fabatus</hi> deſpairing of the Roman affaires, and fleeing to the Parthians, and brought back ſafe from the ſtreights of Sicilie by a Centurion, had keepers appointed him, not able to alleage any probable cauſes of his long voiages; yet he eſcaped vnpuniſhed rather through forgetfulnes then clemencie.</p>

Then hauing yeelded ſome cauſes of his abſence, but very extrauagant, came to matters of greater mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the diſpleaſures and diſlikes he had incurred for the common wealth: and requeſted that <hi>Macro</hi> the Prouoſt, and ſome few of the Tribunes and Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions, might, as oft as he came to the Senate, enter into the Curia with him. And albeit the Senate made a decree very generall, without preſcribing any number, or qualitie of perſons, he was ſo farre from comming to any publick counſell, that he neuer came ſo much as to the citie; coaſting about it, and for the moſt part in by-wayes, and ſtill auoiding his countrey as much as he could. In the meane ſeaſon, a great rabble of informers roſe vp againſt ſuch vſurers as tooke more for conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their money, then they might by the law made by <hi>Caeſar</hi> the Dictator, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the manner of lending, and holding poſſeſſion within Italie; long neglected heretofore, becauſe the publicke good is leſſe ſet by, then priuate commoditie. Vſury in very deede hath beene an old diſeaſe in the citie; and often a cauſe of ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and diſcords; and for that cauſe hath been reſtrained in auncient and leſſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted times. For firſt it was ordained by the law of the twelue tables, that no man ſhould take aboue one in the hundred; when as before that time, it was as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the monied men. After that, by a Tribunitian law it was brought vnto halfe one in the hundred; and in the end vſury was wholy forbidden: and many lawes made by the people to cut off all fraud; which often repreſſed, reuiued againe by ſtrange ſleights and deuiſes. But then <hi>Gracchus</hi> being Pretor, vnto whom the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining of that queſtion fell, conſtrained by the multitude of ſuch as were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered thereby; propounded the matter before the Lords of the Senate: who
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:18166:67"/>
daunted thereat (for there was not one of them free from that fault) craued reſpite of the Prince: he graunted them a yeere and ſixe moneths: within which time, euery man according to the preſcript of law ſhould ſettle his eſtate, and make vp his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticall accompts. Hereupon euery man calling in his debts, on a ſudden enſued a great want &amp; ſcarcitie of money; and by reaſon ſo many were condemned, and their goods ſold, all the money ready coined we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t either to the princes, or publick treaſury. Beſides this, the Senat ordained that two parts of the vſurie money ſhould be beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lands in Italie: but the creditors diſliked that, and vrged the paiment of the whole, as a matter impayring the credit of the parties conuented, to goe from their word. So at the firſt there was great running hither and thither, and entreaties: then they flocked about the Pretors tribunall: and thoſe things which were founde for a remedie, as ſelling and buying of ſuch mens goods, turned to a contrarie effect, bicauſe the Vſurers had hoorded vp all their money to buie land. And bicauſe the multitude of ſellers, was cauſe that the value of landes was rated at a verie lowe and vile price: how much the more a man was indebted, the loather he was to ſell. And manie were thruſt out of all they had: and the decaie of their wealth carried their credit and fame headlong after; vntill <hi>Tiberius</hi> relieued them by putting a <note n="*" place="margin">About 781250. pound.</note> hundred million ſeſterces in bancke, and lent it for three yeeres ſpace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſideration or intereſt; if the debtor could giue ſecuritie to the people of Rome in landes double the value of the debt. By that meanes their credit was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, and other particular creditors by little and little found: neither was the buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of landes practiſed according to the forme of the decree of Senat, hotly at the beginning purſued, as almoſt all ſuch things are; but in the ende careleſly neglected.</p>

kinſmen and friends to be preſent, to bewaile their caſe; nor yet to come oft to ſee them: but there were watches and ſpies on euery ſide, intentiue to prie what lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation euerie man made; which followed the putrified bodies, vntill they were thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen into the riuer of Tiber. And if any of them were found floting on the water, or driuen to the bankes, no man durſt burne them nor touch them: all familiar ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie and intercourſe of humanitie was loſt through feare and violence: and how much crueltie increaſed; ſo far pitie was baniſhed. About the ſame time <hi>C. Caeſar</hi> bearing his grandfather companie from Capreas, tooke to wife <hi>Claudia</hi> daughter of <hi>M.

Wherupon a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſaying of the orator <hi>Paſſienus</hi> was commonly applied to him: That there was neuer better ſeruant then he, nor woorſer maſter. I will not omit <hi>Tiberius</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of <hi>Sergius Galba</hi> then Conſull: who hauing ſent for him, and ſounded him of ſet purpoſe with diuers ſpeeches; at laſt in Greeke vttered vnto him this ſentence: And thou <hi>Galba</hi> at ſometime ſhalt taſte of the Empire. Signifiyng that his rule ſhould be long a comming, and dure but a ſhort time; as learning that skill of the Chaldaeans arte; for attayning of which he had idle time at Rhodes, and <hi>Traſullus</hi> for his maſter; whoſe cunning he tried by this meanes. As oft as he would conſult with them touching any matter, he went vp to the higheſt part of the houſe with onely one freede man in his companie, vnlearned, but of a ſtrong and able bodie; whom he cauſed to leade him, the way ouer hard and difficult paſſages and broken rockes (for his houſe did hang ouer the rockes) whoſe cunning and arte <hi>Tiberius</hi> did purpoſe to trie: that in returning backe, if any ielouſie of vanitie or treacherie had entered into his minde, he ſhould throw him headlong into the ſea which was vnder him, leaſt he ſhould bewray his ſecrets. <hi>Traſullus</hi> being then brought into thoſe rocks, &amp; moouing <hi>Tiberius</hi> which mooued him many queſtions, &amp; foretelling him verie skilfully future things, and that he ſhould be Emperour; <hi>Tiberius</hi> asked him farther, whether he had found out the howre of his owne natiuitie; and what ſhould happen to himſelfe that yeere, and that ſame day. Who hauing conſidered the aſpects of the ſtars, and meaſured their diſtances, beganne firſt to doubt; and then to feare: and the more he viewed them; ſo more and more he was ſurpriſed with admiration and feare: and at laſt cried out, that he was readie to fall into moſt doubtfull and imminent danger. Then <hi>Tiberius</hi> embracing him, reioyced that he had foreſeene his owne dangers, and promiſed he ſhould eſcape them: and taking thoſe things which he had ſaide for oracles, held him afterward among the number of his deereſt friends. When I heare of theſe and the like things, I can giue no certaine iudgement, whether the affaires of mortall men are gouerned by fate and immutable neceſſitie; or haue their courſe and change by chaunce and fortune. For thou ſhalt finde, that as well thoſe which were accounted wiſe in auncient times, as ſuch as were imitators of their ſect, do varie and diſagree therein: ſome do reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie beleeue that the gods haue no care of mans beginning or ending; no, not of man at all. Whereof it proceedeth that the vertuous are toſſed and afflicted with ſo many miſeries; and the vitious and bad triumphe with ſo great proſperities. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarilie others are of opnion, that fate and deſtinie may well ſtand with the courſe of our actions; yet nothing at all depend of the planets or ſtars, but proeeede from a connexion of naturall cauſes as from their beginning. And theſe graunt withall, that we haue free choiſe and election what courſe of life to follow; which being once
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:18166:68"/>
choſen, we are guided after, by a certaine order of cauſes vnto our end. Neither do they eſteeme thoſe things to be good or bad which the vulgar ſort do ſo call; for many which ſeeme to be oppreſſed with miſerie, are happie if they endure their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie with conſtancie: and many which flow in wealth, in moſt miſerable eſtate, if they vſe their proſperitie vnaduiſedly. And yet of ſome it may be ſaide, that their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinies are knowen at their birth: and if they fal out otherwiſe then hath beene fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolde, it proceedeth of the ignorance of the deceitfull reporter; and ſo the arte is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credited; whoſe cleere and euident proofes, former and preſent times haue tried: for by the ſonne of the ſame <hi>Traſullus, Neroes</hi> Empire was foretold, as in conuenient time it ſhall be declared, bicauſe I will not now digreſſe from my purpoſe.</p>

               <p>THe ſame men being Conſuls, <hi>Aſinius Gallus</hi> died; and no man doubting, but for want of taking ſuſtenance; but whether willingly, or of neceſſitie, that is vncertaine. And <hi>Caeſar</hi> being asked, whether he would ſuffer him to be buried, was not aſhamed to permit it; &amp; further to accuſe chance &amp; fortune, that had taken away the criminall perſon before he had beene openly conuinced; as though that in three yeeres ſpace there wanted time of proceeding to iudgement againſt an old Conſull, and father of ſo many Conſuls. After that, <hi>Druſus</hi> was made away, hauing ſuſtained himſelfe the ſpace of nine daies with a miſerable foode, by eating the flocks of his bed. Some haue written, that <hi>Macro</hi> had order ſent him, that if <hi>Seianus</hi> ſhould attempt to take armes, the yong man ſhould be fetcht out of priſon (for he was kept in the Pallace) and made captaine ouer the people: but becauſe it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently rumored that <hi>Caeſar</hi> would be reconciled to his daughter in law, and nephew, he ſhewed that he deſired rather crueltie, then be ſory for that he had done: yea and hauing inueighed againſt him after he was dead, obiected, he was looſe of life, hurtfull and dangerous to his, and euilly affected toward the common wealth: and withall commaunded all that to be recited, which he had cauſed day by day to be put in writing, both of his words, and deedes: a thing ſo cruell that nothing more, that he ſhould ſo many yeeres haue appointed ſpies to obſerue his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, his lamentation, yea priuat murmurings: and ſcarce credible, that the grandfather could indure to heare it, reade it, and publiſh it, were it not that the letters of <hi>Actius</hi> the Centurion, and <hi>Didymus</hi> his freed man did declare the names of ſuch bondſlaues, which had either ſtroken <hi>Druſus,</hi> or put him in a fright, as he went out of his chamber. Yea the Centurion added his owne words, full of crueltie againſt <hi>Druſus,</hi> as a matter worthy praiſe; and <hi>Druſus</hi> anſwere againe as he fainted and drew towards his end: in which, faining as though he had been diſtracted of his wits, wiſhed <hi>Tiberius</hi> all ill luck and misfortune: and then ſeeing himſelfe paſt all hope of life, curſed him moſt deadly, praying the gods, that as he had ſlaine his daughter in law, his brothers ſonne, and his nephewes, and filled all his houſe with bloud; ſo they would reuenge and puniſh him for an example to his name, his ſtock, predeceſſors, and poſteritie. The Lords of the Senate were troubled with theſe ſpeeches, making ſhew of deteſting them, but they were ſtricken into a feare and admiration; that he, who had been ſo cunning and craftie heretofore in cloking his lewdnes, ſhould now become ſo confident, that (as though the walles were throwne down) he durſt ſhew that his nephew beaten by his Centurion, and ſtrooken by his
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:18166:69"/>
ſlaues, ſhould aske for meate in vaine to ſaue his life. This griefe was ſcarſe gone, but the next newes were of <hi>Agrippina,</hi> whom I thinke ſince <hi>Seianus</hi> death vntill now liued with hope; and ſeeing that crueltie was no whit remitted, willingly ended her life; vnleſſe that famiſhed for want of ſuſtenance, it was falſely giuen out ſhe died that death of her ſelfe. For <hi>Tiberius</hi> layde grieuous crimes to her charge, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing her of vncleanes of life; and that <hi>Aſinius Gallus</hi> was the adulterer; and that ſeeing him dead, ſhe loathed any longer to liue. But in very deede <hi>Agrippina</hi> not contented with reaſon, and greedy of rule, taking vpon her cares fit rather for men then women, had ſhaken off all vices incident to her owne ſexe. She died the ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame day that two yeeres before <hi>Seianus</hi> died; which <hi>Caeſar</hi> thought worthy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord; and vaunted that ſhe had neither been ſtrangled, nor throwne headlong from the Gemonies. For this he had thanks giuen him by the Senate; and order taken that the fifteenth Kalends of Nouember, which was the day they both died, ſome gift ſhould be offered vp to <hi>Iupiter.</hi> Not long after <hi>Cocceius Nerua,</hi> who was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually at the Princes elbow; a man very expert in diuine and humane lawes; being in perfect diſpoſition of body, reſolued with himſelfe to die: which when <hi>Tiberius</hi> vnderſtood, he went to viſit him, ſate by him, and inquired the cauſes of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and intreated him; confeſſing at laſt that it would be a burden to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and a diſcredit, if the chiefeſt of his friends ſhould without cauſe of death ſhew himſelfe weary of life. But <hi>Nerua</hi> diſliking his ſpeech, would take no more ſuſtenance. Thoſe which beſt knew his meaning gaue out, that deepely ſeeing into what calamities the common wealth was like to fall into, moued with anger and feare, whileſt his credit was vntouched, and his perſon vnattempted, would end his life with that honeſt death. <hi>Agrippinaes</hi> ruine drew with it (which is ſcarſe cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible) <hi>Plancinaes</hi> deſtruction. She had beene once wife vnto <hi>Gn. Piſo,</hi> and reioyſed openly at <hi>Germanicus</hi> death; and when <hi>Piſo</hi> was ſlaine, ſhe was ſaued no leſſe by <hi>Augustaes</hi> prayers, then ill will ſhe bare <hi>Agrippina.</hi> As ſoone as hatred and fauour failed, right tooke place; and being accuſed of knowen crimes with her owne hand receiued rather late then vndeſerued puniſhment. Among other griefes in a dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ſad citie, this was one; that <hi>Iulia,</hi> daughter vnto <hi>Druſus,</hi> once <hi>Neroes</hi> wife, married againe into <hi>Rubellius Blandus</hi> familie, whoſe grandfather <hi>Tiburtes</hi> a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Rome moſt men knew. In the end of this yeare, the death of <hi>Aelius Lamia</hi> was celebrated with funerals proper to a Cenſor, who at laſt being diſcharged of the gouernment of Syria which he had in ſhew only, was made gouernor of the citie. He was deſcended of a noble ſtock, and was a ſtrong liuely old man; and the gouernment of the prouince denied him, augmented his woorth. Then <hi>Flaccus Pomponius</hi> Propretor of Syria being dead, <hi>Caeſars</hi> letters were recited, in which he complained, that if there were any notable man, and fit to rule an armie, he refuſed the charge: and therefore he was forced through that neceſſitie to intreate ſuch as had beene Conſuls, to take vpon them the rule of the prouinces; forgetting that <hi>Arruntius</hi> had beene hindered ten yeeres from going into Spaine. The ſame yeere died <hi>M. Lepidus,</hi> of whoſe moderation and wiſedome I haue ſpoken ſufficiently in other bookes; and his nobilitie needeth no farther proofe: for the <hi>Aemilian</hi> family hath brought foorth many good citizens; and although ſome of them haue beene of corrupt manners, yet liued in good and honorable eſtate.</p>

                  <hi>VII.</hi> A Phoenix ſeene in AEgypt: how <hi>Getulicus</hi> eſcaped <hi>Tiberius</hi> crueltie.</head>
               <p>WHen <hi>Paullus Fabius</hi> and <hi>L. Vitellius</hi> were Conſuls, after manie ages were paſt, the birde Phoenix came into AEgypt, and miniſtred matter to the moſt learned of the countrey, and alſo Greekes, of diſputing many things concerning that miracle. Of which it ſeemeth good vnto me to laye downe ſuch things as they agree of, and manie which reſt doubtfull; yet notwithſtanding wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie the knowledge. That that birde is conſecrated to the ſunne; and that it diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the beake, and varietie of feathers from other birds; all do accord which haue deſcribed her ſhape and forme: but of the number of her yeeres there are diuers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports. The common opinion is that ſhe liueth fiue hundred yeeres; ſome affirme that ſhe liueth a thouſand foure hundred threeſcore and one yeere. And the firſt of theſe kindes of birdes flew to the citie called Heliopolis, with a great multitude of other birdes with her, woondering at her new ſhape in <hi>Seſostris</hi> time, after that in <hi>Amaſis</hi> and <hi>Ptolemaeus</hi> raigne, which of the Macedonians was the third King of Aegypt. But antiquitie is darke and obſcure. Betwixt <hi>Ptolemaeus</hi> raigne and <hi>Tiberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> there were ſcarſe two hundred and fiftie yeeres. Whereupon ſome thought that this was no true Phoenix, nor come from the land of Arabia; and that it had nothing of that which antiquitie hath attributed and confirmed to be in that kind. For when they haue ended the number of their yeeres, and that their ende approcheth, they build their neſt in their countrey, and in it caſt ſeede of generation; of which a yong one doth riſe; whoſe firſt care is being growen to ripenes, to burie the olde. And that not at all aduentures, but hauing taken vp a certaine waight of the ſtone Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rha, and tried the carrieng of it a long iourney: when ſhe perceiueth her ſelfe able to indure and carrie ſuch a burthen, and to accompliſh the voiage, ſhe lifteth vp her fathers bodie, and carrieth it to the altar of the ſunne, and there doth burne and ſacrifice it. Theſe things are vncertaine, and fabulouſly augmented. But that that birde is ſeene ſometimes in Aegypt is not doubted. But murders continuing at Rome, <hi>Pomponius Labeo,</hi> whom as I haue ſaid, was gouernor of <hi>Moeſia,</hi> by cutting his vaines, let out with his blood his life, and <hi>Paxaea</hi> his wife followed his example. The feare they had of dying by the hand of the hangman, did cauſe them thus ſo readily to kill themſelues: bicauſe ſuch as were condemned, loſt their goods and wanted buriall: but their bodies which ſlew themſelues were buried, and their teſtaments ſtood good; which was the gaine and reward of making haſte. But <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſent let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters vnto the Senat, declaring it to be a cuſtome among the auncients, that when they intended to breake off friendſhip with any, they forbad them their houſe, and that then the friendſhip ended, which he had done to <hi>Labeo:</hi> who blamed for euill gouernment in the Prouince, and other matters, couered his fault by accuſing others; vainely putting his wife in feare, who was out of danger, though not without fault. After this <hi>Mamercus Scaurus</hi> was accuſed againe, of a noble houſe, and a great orator; yet of reprochfull life. His friendſhip had with <hi>Seianus</hi> did nothing hurt him; but the hatred which <hi>Macro</hi> bare him was his ouerthrow; who practiſed the ſame artes that <hi>Seianus</hi> had done, but more couertly. The accuſation was an argument of a Tragedie written by <hi>Scaurus,</hi> contayning verſes which might be wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted againſt <hi>Tiberius.</hi> But <hi>Seruilius</hi> and <hi>Cornelius</hi> his accuſers obiected againſt him, that he had abuſed his bodie with <hi>Liuia,</hi> and offered magicall ſacrifices. <hi>Scaurus</hi> as a thing worthie of the auncient <hi>AEmilian</hi> familie, preuenteth his condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:18166:70"/>
by killing himſelfe at the incouragement of his wife <hi>Sexitia;</hi> who was both an encourager and partaker of his death. Notwithſtanding if occaſion were giuen he puniſhed the accuſers likewiſe: as <hi>Seruilius</hi> and <hi>Cornelius</hi> famous by the death of <hi>Scaurus,</hi> bicauſe they had taken money of <hi>Varius Ligur</hi> to deſiſt from the accuſation, were perpetually baniſhed into certaine Ilands. And <hi>Abudius Ruſo</hi> once Acdile, whileſt he went about to procure danger vnto <hi>Lentulus Getulicus,</hi> vnder whom he had charge of a legion, bicauſe he had purpoſed to marrie his daughter to <hi>Seianus</hi> ſonne, was condemned without accuſation, and driuen out of the citie. <hi>Getulicus</hi> at that time had charge ouer the legions of higher Germanie, and had gotten ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding loue for his clemencie and ſmall ſeueritie; and of the next army welbeloued by meanes of <hi>L. Apronius</hi> his father in law. Whereupon the conſtant report was, that he was ſo bould as to write vnto <hi>Caeſar:</hi> 
                  <hi rend="margQuotes">That the affinitie betwixt him and <hi>Seia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> was begun, not of his owne motion and deſire, but through <hi>Tiberius</hi> counſell; and that as well he as <hi>Tiberius</hi> might be deceiued; and that the ſelfe ſame errour could not be to him alone dangerleſſe, and to others vtter ruine; for his part that his loyaltie was truſtie and ſure, and ſo would continue; if ſnares had not beene laide to intrap him; that he would accept of a ſucceſſor in his charge no otherwiſe than of a meſſenger of death: and therefore that they ſhould ſtrike as it were an agreement, by which the Prince ſhould be maſter of the reſt, and that he would keepe and hold the Prouince.</hi> Although theſe things ſeeme verie ſtrange; yet were they beleued, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he alone of all <hi>Seianus</hi> lieſmen eſcaped without danger, and continued in great fauour and grace. The reaſon why, was, bicauſe <hi>Tiberius</hi> thought with himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now aged and hated of all men, that his eſtate would rather continue by fame, then force.</p>

He for feare of <hi>Germanicus</hi> was faithfull to the Romans, and iuſt towards his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects: but after <hi>Germanicus</hi> death became proude towards vs, and cruell towards his ſubiects; confident by reaſon of proſperous ſucceſſe in warres had againſt his borderers; and deſpiſing <hi>Tiberius</hi> as weake, old, and vnfit for warres; and greedy alſo of Armenia, into which after the death of King <hi>Artaxia</hi> he put his eldeſt ſon <hi>Arſaces</hi> as gouernor, iniuring them with contumelious ſpeeches. Then ſent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demaund the treaſurie and riches left in Syria and Cilicia by <hi>Vonones;</hi> and withall, vaine-gloriouſly bragged and threatned that he would inuade and conquer the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient bounds and limits of the Perſians and Macedonians, and recouer all that had beene poſſeſſed by <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Alexander.</hi> But the principall author and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of ſending ſecret meſſengers to Rome was <hi>Sinnaces,</hi> a man both noble and weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie; and next vnto him <hi>Abdus</hi> an Eunuch: a matter of no diſgrace among the Barbarians, nor barre to credit and authoritie. Theſe two drawing the principall noble men of the countrey to them, becauſe they could haue none of the blood of the Arſacides to be their King; moſt of them being ſlaine by <hi>Artabanus,</hi> or vnder yeeres; demaunded <hi>Phrahates</hi> King <hi>Phrahates</hi> ſonne which was at Rome: for ſaide they, there needed no more but the name and conſent of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and one of the blood of <hi>Arſacis</hi> to ſhew himſelfe vpon the bankes of <hi>Euphrates.</hi> That did <hi>Caeſar</hi> deſire and

prouided for him accordingly with preparations and neceſſaries to ſeat him in his fathers kingdom, holding ſtill his ſecret drift by entertayning forraine countries, by ſleights and pollicie in warre, to keepe all quiet at home. In the meane ſpace <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus</hi> vnderſtanding what was wrought againſt him, at the firſt was ſlow, and linge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for feare; then boyled with deſire of reuenge. For barbarous people count temporizing and delay, as baſe and ſeruile; and to goe through preſently their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeignments, a royall pointe. Yet profit tooke place, and thereupon ſending for <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> vnder colour of amitie to a banket, gaue him a lingring poiſon; and entertained <hi>Sinnaces</hi> with fained friendſhip and gifts, and buſied him in other imployments. But <hi>Phrahates</hi> arriued in Syria, and laying aſide the Romans manner of liuing, in which he had beene ſo manie yeeres nouriſhed, giuing himſelfe to the Parthian vſage and vnable to brooke it, fell ſicke, and died. Yet <hi>Tiberius</hi> held on his determination, and choſe <hi>Tiridates</hi> one of the ſame ſtocke, and an enimie to <hi>Artabanus;</hi> and inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Mithradates Hiberus</hi> to recouer Armenia, and reconciled him to his brother <hi>Pharaſmanes,</hi> which then poſſeſſed that Empire; and maketh <hi>L. Vitellius</hi> general ouer all this preparation of the Orient. I am not ignorant what a ſiniſter report ranne of him in the citie, &amp; with what infamous matters he was touched: yet in gouerning of the Prouinces he demeaned himſelfe according to the vertue of auncient times. But returning fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence, through the feare of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> &amp; familiarity of <hi>Claudius</hi> being changed into a baſe &amp; abiect ſeruilitie, became a patterne vnto poſteritie of ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full flatterie; and ſo his firſt vertues gaue place to his latter vices; and the vertuous acts of his youth, his infamous old age defaced. Of theſe pettie Kings <hi>Mithrada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> firſt induced <hi>Pharaſmanes</hi> to further his enduours by pollicie and force: and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupters were found which for great ſums of gold entiſed <hi>Arſaces</hi> miniſters to kil him; and through <hi>Hiberus</hi> great power they entered Armenia, and tooke the citie Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxata. When <hi>Artabanus</hi> vnderſtood of theſe dealings, he furniſheth his ſon <hi>Orodes</hi> with things neceſſarie to reuenge, and giueth him the ſtrength of the Parthians; and diſpatcheth others to leuie hired ſouldiers to giue him aide. On the other ſide, <hi>Pharaſmanes</hi> drewe the Albanians and Sarmates to his partie, whoſe Princes (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Sceptruchi) hauing receiued gifts on both ſides, according to the manner of their countrey, gaue aide to both ſides. But the Hiberi being maſters of the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, thruſt ſudde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly the Sarmatian forces on the Armenians by the Caſpian way. But thoſe which came from the Parthians were eaſily driuen backe, bicauſe the enimie had ſhut vp all the other paſſages, one excepted; which was betwixt the ſea and the hils of the Albani, which could not ſerue their purpoſe, by reaſon it was ſommer: for the Eaſterne windes fill vp the ſhallow foordes and the ſhore: the South winter winde keepes backe the flood, and leaues the ſhallow ſhore bare and naked. In the meane ſpace <hi>Pharaſmanes</hi> hauing reenforced his ſtrength, challengeth <hi>Orodes</hi> to fight, being deſtitute of allies and vnfurniſhed of men: and if he refuſed or ſhifted off, he braued him vnder his noſe; and hard by his campe, waſted his ſtouer; and often compaſſed him about as if he had beſieged him: till the Parthians not accuſtomed to endure ſuch brauados, came about their King, and demaunded battell. Their ſtrength conſiſted in their horſemen, and <hi>Pharaſmanes</hi> in footmen and horſemen both. For the Hiberi and Albani inhabiting mountanous places, were better accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to hardnes and trauell. They ſaie they came out of Theſſalia at ſuch time as <hi>Iaſon,</hi> after he had carried away <hi>Medea</hi> and begotten children by her, returned to the emptie court of <hi>AEeta,</hi> and vnhabited Colchos: and reporte manie woonders of his name, and the oracle of <hi>Phryxus.</hi> Neither dare any man ſacrifice a ram, becauſe it is thought that <hi>Phryxus</hi> was carried on one, be it, this ram were a beaſt or a ſhipe
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:18166:71"/>
which bare thoſe armes. The battell pitched in order on both ſides: the <hi>Parthian</hi> put his ſouldiers in minde of the Empire of the Eaſt; and the renowned nobilitie of the Arſacides: and contrariwiſe debaſed <hi>Hiberus</hi> as ignoble, and flying to mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſouldiers. <hi>Pharaſmanes</hi> on the other ſide, declared that he was neuer yet ſubiect to the Parthian rule; and that the greater their enterpriſe, the greater their glorie if they were the conquerers: or if they turned their backes, the greater diſhonour, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie and danger: withall he ſhewed them his owne hoſt dreadful, and the Medians painted with gold: on his owne ſide, men; on the other, bootie. Among the Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates the Captaine onely was not heard; but euerie man incouraged each other not to abide the ſhot, but preuent the enimie ruſhing in couragiouſly to handie ſtrokes. Diuers manners of fight were then ſeene in that battell: when as the Parthian accuſtomed with like skill to flie and follow, ſeuered his ſquadrons to make way for the arrowes to light. The Sarmates laying aſide their bowes which ſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them but a ſhort time, ran in to the enimie with their ſwordes and lances; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times were in the front, ſometimes in their backes, as if they had beene horſemen: ſometimes cloſe ranked with their bodies and weapons thruſt backe, and bare down the enimie, and were borne downe againe. The Albani alſo and Hiberi behaued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in like maner; now catching hold of the enimie; now thruſting him down; the battell growing doubtfull on their ſide; the horſemen and footemen preſſing in and giuing them many wounds. Whileſt this fight thus continued, <hi>Pharaſmanes</hi> and <hi>Orodes,</hi> each incouraging his ſtouteſt, or comforting thoſe which beganne to ſtagger and wauer, being in ſight the one of the other: and therefore knowing the one the other, with a great clamor, armour and horſes ranne one againſt another; but more fiercly <hi>Pharaſmanes:</hi> for he wounded his enimie through the headpeece: yet being carried away with his horſe, was not able to redouble his ſtroke; the ſtowteſt of his followers preſently defending the wounded. Neuertheleſſe, a rumor falſly beleeued that he was ſlaine, appaled the Parthians, &amp; cauſed them to yeeld the victorie.</p>

               <p>IMmediatly after, <hi>Artabanus</hi> gathering together his whole ſtrength out of all parts of his countrey, purſueth a reuenge on the Hiberi, ſaying that they had the better of the battell, through skilfulnes of place; and therefore would neuer deſiſt; if <hi>Vitellius</hi> by aſſembling the legions, had not giuen out that he meant to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade Meſopotamia, thereby ſtriking him into a feare of the Roman forces. Then <hi>Artabanus</hi> leauing Armenia, left all good fortune behinde him, <hi>Vitellius</hi> entiſing his ſubiects to abandon their King, as one in peace cruell, and in warres vnfortunate. <hi>Sinnaces</hi> whom, as I haue ſaid, was vtter enemie to <hi>Artabanus,</hi> had ſecret conference with <hi>Abdageſes</hi> his father and others: and by continuall ouerthrowes and loſſes which they ſuffered, drew eaſily vnto him ſuch as were moſt readie to reuolt: they alſo repairing to him by little and by little, which were ſubiect vnto <hi>Artabanus</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for feare then good will: very glad they had found captaines to follow, tooke courage vnto them. By this time <hi>Artabanus</hi> had no refuge left, ſaue only a few ſtrangers for the gard of his perſon, baniſhed from their owne dwellings: a people not vnderſtanding what is good, nor hauing a care of that which is naught; but hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for gaine, are inſtruments of what miſchieſe ſoeuer. Accompanied with theſe, he haſtneth his flight to the frontiers of his countrey, ioining vpon Scythia; hoping
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:18166:71"/>
for ſuccour, becauſe he was allied to the Hircanians and Carmanians; hauing a hope likewiſe, that the Parthians alwaies indifferently bent to the abſent, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant and fickle to the preſent, would in the meane ſpace change their minde, and receiue him againe. But <hi>Vitellius</hi> ſeeing <hi>Artabanus</hi> fled, and the minds of the countrey people enclined to a new King, incouraging <hi>Tiridates</hi> to take that which was offered; conducted the legions and allies to the banks of Euphrates. And as they were ſacrificing and offering according vnto the cuſtome of the Romans, Suouetaurilia, a Boare, Ramme, and Bull; the others made readie a Horſe, to pacifie the god of that riuer: the inhabitants of Euphrates brought word, that without any great raine, of his owne accord the riuer was exceedingly riſen; and withall, that the white froth made circles as it were in forme of a diademe, which was a preſage of a proſperous paſſage: but ſome did interpret them more ſubtilly, gathering thereby that the beginnings of their attempts ſhould be luckie; but haue ſmall continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, becauſe that there was more credit to be giuen to thoſe things which were portended by the earth and heauen; and that the qualitie and nature of riuers was vnconſtant, and running away; and would no ſooner ſhew a token of good luck, but take it away againe: but hauing made a bridge with veſſels, and paſled ouer his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, the firſt which came to the camp was <hi>Ornoſpades,</hi> with many thouſand of horſemen. This <hi>Ornoſpades</hi> once a baniſhed man, brought no ſmall ayde to <hi>Tiberius</hi> when he made warre in Dalmatia, and for that ſeruice was made citizen of Rome. After this, entering anew into the kings fauour, he made him ruler of all that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey which lieth betweene two famous riuers, Euphrates, and Tigris; and thereof tooke the name of Meſopotamia. Not long after <hi>Sinnaces</hi> augmented his forces, and <hi>Abdageſes</hi> the ſtay of that ſide ioyned vnto them the wealth and preparation of the king. <hi>Vitellius</hi> thinking it inough only to haue ſhewen the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s power, aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed <hi>Tiridates</hi> and the chiefe nobles of Parthia, but eſpecially <hi>Tiridates;</hi> that he would alwaies haue in minde as things worth remembrance, <hi>Phrahates</hi> his grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Caeſar</hi> his bringer vp; the nobles to be dutifull to their king; ſhew a reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence vnto vs; and euery man to haue a care of his credit, and fidelitie: and from thence turned back with the legions into Syria. I haue ioyned together things done in two ſommets, to recreate the minde of the reader, wearied with domeſticall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities. But <hi>Tiberius</hi> although three yeeres were paſt and gone ſince the death of <hi>Seianus,</hi> could not be appeaſed neither by time, nor prayers, no nor by puniſhing his fill (things wont to mollifie other men) but would puniſh vncertaine and ſtale things gone and paſt, as manifeſt offences, and newly committed. Whereupon <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinius Trio</hi> fearing this dealing, and not able to indure the accuſers which were now bruing matter againſt him; in his laſt will and teſtament compoſed many cruell things againſt <hi>Macro,</hi> and certaine of the chiefe of <hi>Caeſars</hi> freed men: obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt himſelfe, that he had a fickle and vnconſtant head through age, and that by his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall abſence he differed little from a baniſhed man. Which things being concealed by <hi>Trios</hi> heires, <hi>Tiberius</hi> commaunded publickly to be recited; ſhewing thereby patience in another mans libertie, and ſmall regard of his owne infamie: or elſe becauſe he was ignorant of <hi>Seianus</hi> villanies vntill that time; and content that all things howſoeuer they were ſpoken, ſhould come to light, and haue the truth knowne (which flattery often hindereth) rather to his owne ſhame and reproch, then not at all. The ſame time <hi>Granius Martianus</hi> a Senator, being accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of treaſon by <hi>C. Gracchus,</hi> ſlew himſelfe. <hi>Tatius Gratianus</hi> likewiſe who had been Pretor, and condemned to die by the ſame law.

his owne hands; and <hi>Paconianus</hi> was ſtrangled in priſon, becauſe he had there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed certaine verſes againſt the Prince. <hi>Tiberius</hi> did not receiue theſe newes, deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from Italie by ſea, or by meſſengers a farre off, as he was wont to do; but neere vnto the citie, where he might the ſame day or the next morning, anſwere the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors letters, as it were looking vpon the bloud of the citizens, flowing in their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and the hand of the executioners.

No not <hi>Tigranes,</hi> who had been ſometimes King of Armenia, but then arraigned, could with his royall title eſcape the ſame puniſhment that was inflicted vpon bare citizens. <hi>C. Galba</hi> ſometime Conſull, and two of the <hi>Blaeſi</hi> died of a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie death. <hi>Galba,</hi> bicauſe by <hi>Caeſars</hi> hard &amp; rigorous letters he was forbidden to caſt lots for the gouernment of the prouince: the <hi>Blaeſi,</hi> becauſe that the prieſthoodes which were deſtined vnto their houſe whileſt it was in proſperitie; and now being decayed deferred, and beſtowed vpon others when they were vacant; which they conſtrued as a prognoſticate of death, and therefore did execute it themſelues. <hi>Aemilia Lepida,</hi> whom as I haue before told you, was married vnto yong <hi>Druſus,</hi> charging him with diuers crimes, although ſhe were moſt lewde and wicked, yet eſcaped ſcotfree and vnpuniſhed whileſt <hi>Lepidus</hi> her father liued; but afterwards ſhe was conuinced of manifeſt adulterie with one of her bondmen: and therefore laying aſide all defence, ended her life with her owne hands. At the ſame time the Clites, being a people of Cappadocia, and ſubiect to <hi>Archelaus,</hi> becauſe they were according vnto our cuſtome conſtrained to bring in the value of their yeerely reuenewes, and pay tributes, fled to the hill Taurus; and there by the ſtrong ſite of the place defended themſelues againſt the weake forces of their King; vntill <hi>M. Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellius</hi> Lieutenant ſent thither by <hi>Vitellius</hi> Lord preſident of Syria, with foure thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand legionaries, and certaine choiſe ayd-ſouldiers, had compaſſed and enuironed with engins and works two hils which the barbarians poſſeſſed, the leſſer called Cadra, the other Dauara; killing thoſe which durſt iſſue out with the ſword, and forcing the reſt to yeeld for want of water. But <hi>Tiridates</hi> ayded by the Parthians, recouered Nicephorium, and Anthemuſias, and other townes, which lying in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia, yet are called by Greeke names: and Halum, and Artemita, townes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia, ſtriuing who had beſt cauſe to reioyce. <hi>Artabanus</hi> being odious vnto them for his crueltie, as brought vp among the Scythians: and hoping that <hi>Tiridates</hi> would be courteous and gentle, as trained vp and faſhioned after the Romaine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:18166:72"/>
and education. The Seleucians vſed great flatterie: their citie is very ſtrong, enuironed with walles, and not corrupted with barbarous faſhions, but retained ſuch as their founder <hi>Seleucus</hi> gaue them. Their manner is to chooſe three hundred either for wealth, or wiſedome, and of them make as it were a Senate. The people kept their part in gouernment, and as long as they agree among themſelues the Parthian they feare not, but falling to iarres and contentions, whileſt each ſide calleth for aide againſt his aduerſary: he who is called by one of the parties, maſtereth both. That hapned of late vnder <hi>Artabanus,</hi> who for his owne commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, made the people ſubiect to the chiefe gentlemen: where the people beare the ſway, that gouernment approcheth neereſt vnto libertie: but the rule of a few is neereſt vnto the will and pleaſure of a King. When <hi>Tiridates</hi> was come among them, they honored him with all thoſe inuentions which Kings had been honored with in times paſt, and with ſuch as later ages haue more abundantly inuented. Withall, they powred out many reprochfull ſpeeches againſt <hi>Artabanus;</hi> conſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that he was indeede deſcended of the <hi>Arſacides</hi> on the mothers ſide, but in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther points nothing ſutable. <hi>Tiridates</hi> committed the gouernment of the Seleuci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to the diſcretion of the people; then conſulting what day he ſhould be crowned, receiued <hi>Phrahates</hi> and <hi>Hieroes</hi> letters, which had two the ſtrongeſt gouernments of that kingdome, intreating him that he would defer it for ſome ſmall time, which to ſatisfie thoſe great men he yeelded vnto. In the mean time he went to Creſiphon the royall ſeare of the kingdom, &amp; perceiuing that they prolonged from one day to another, <hi>Surena</hi> with the good liking of many, in a great aſſembly crowned <hi>Tirida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> according to the cuſtome of the countrey. And if he had out of hand entered farther within the countrey, and other nations, thoſe lingerers had been put out of all doubt, and all yeelded obedience vnto one. But ſtaying too long at the Caſtell whither <hi>Artabanus</hi> had conueyed his money and his concubines, he gaue him time to leape back from their agreements. For if <hi>Phrahates</hi> and <hi>Hiero</hi> and ſome others came not at the day appointed to the coronation, ſome for feare, and ſome for malice and hate to <hi>Abdageſes,</hi> who then poſſeſſed the new King, and was the only fauorit in Court, turned to <hi>Artabanus,</hi> whom they found in Hyrcania meanely and euilfauoredly attired, killing with his bow foode for his ſuſtenance. At the firſt, he was greatly afraid, as though ſome traine had been laid to intrap him, but when they had giuen him their credit and faith, that their comming was to reſtore him to his kingdome, his ſpirits were reuiued, and inquireth what ſudden change had hapned. Then <hi>Hiero</hi> finding fault with <hi>Tiridates,</hi> ſaid, that he was but a child, and that the <hi>Arſacides</hi> gouerned not the kingdome, but the vaine name and title was in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warlike perſon, ſoftly and tenderly brought vp among ſtrangers, &amp; that <hi>Abdageſes</hi> was he which ruled and commaunded all. <hi>Artabanus</hi> knowing of old what it was to rule, perceiued well that thoſe which found falſhood in friendſhip, diſſembled not: and therefore making no longer delay then he could aſſemble the Scythians forces &amp; aid, ſetteth forward with al ſpeede to preuent the wiles of his enemies, and keepe his friends from ſlipping back: yea, he did not ſo much as wipe off the filth and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanes of his bodie, becauſe he would moue the common people to compaſſion. There was no ſubtletie, no praier, nor ought elſe forgotten, whereby he might draw the doubtful to him; or confirme &amp; aſſure the willing &amp; readie. He came then with a ſtrong power vnto the places adioyning to Seleucia, when as <hi>Tiridates</hi> ſtroken into a feare with the fame and perſon of <hi>Artabanus,</hi> was diſtracted in minde, whether he ſhould encounter him, or draw out the warre by lingering. Such as deſired battell and quick worke, perſwaded that the enemie was diſperſed, &amp; ſtragled, and wearied with their long iourney, and ſcarſe reſolued to obey <hi>Artabanus</hi> being ſo lately trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors

and enimies vnto him, though now his ſupport &amp; aid. But <hi>Abdageſes</hi> thought it beſt to returne into Meſopotamia, that hauing the riuer as a defence betweene him &amp; the enimie; calling in the meane ſpace, the Armenians &amp; Elymaei, and the reſidue which were behind them; and their forces augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted with allies &amp; friends, &amp; ſuch as the Romane captaine would ſend them; then to trie the chance of war.

For not long after, the laſt Conſuls in <hi>Tiberius</hi> raign, <hi>G. Acerronius,</hi> &amp; <hi>C. Pontius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan their charge, when <hi>Macroes</hi> power &amp; credit was growen ouer great, which he increaſed more &amp; more with <hi>C. Caeſar,</hi> although before he was neuer negligent ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. And after <hi>Claudiaes</hi> death (who as I haue alreadie ſaid was married vnto that <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar)</hi> he egged and perſwaded his owne wife <hi>Ennia,</hi> to allure &amp; draw the yoong man to her loue, &amp; intangle him vnder promiſe of marriage, as one which would do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, to laie hold on the ſoueraigntie. For although he were of a turbulent and hot ſpirit; notwithſtanding he had as it were ſucked out of his grandfathers boſome the arte of cunning diſſembling. <hi>Tiberius</hi> knew this verie well, and therefore was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued which of his nephewes he ſhould firſt make ſucceſſor to the ſtate. Of which the one was <hi>Druſus</hi> ſonne, neereſt vnto him in blood, &amp; whom he tendered beſt; but was vnder age: and <hi>Germanicus</hi> ſonne the other, in the flower of his youth, and of the people welbeloued; &amp; therefore the woorſe liked of his grandfather. And bethinking himſelfe of <hi>Claudius,</hi> ſeeing he was of ſtayed and ſetled yeeres, and deſirous of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; yet altered his deliberation, bicauſe he was weake and ſlender witted. And yet if he ſhould ſeeke for a ſucceſſor out of his houſe, he feared leaſt the memorie of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus,</hi> &amp; the name of <hi>Caeſars</hi> ſhould be had in reproch and contempt. For he was not ſo carefull to winne the fauour of the time preſent, as ambitious of fame with poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. But in the end irreſolute what to conclude, and growing weake and feeble of bodie, that which was out of the compaſſe of his power he committed to fate: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing notwithſtanding caſt out ſpeeches, whereby it might be perceiued that he had a care of things to come: for not going about the buſh, but in plaine termes he vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braied <hi>Macro,</hi> that he turned his backe to the Weſt, and looked alwaies toward the ſun-riſing. And hapning by cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that ſome ſpeech was had of <hi>L. Sulla,</hi> whom <hi>C. Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:18166:73"/>
was wont to ſcoffe &amp; laugh at: <hi>Tiberius</hi> foretold him that he ſhould haue all his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but not ſo much as one of his vertues. And withall, imbracing the yongeſt of his nephewes with weeping teares; the other looking on with an enuious eye, ſayd vnto him; thou ſhalt kill him, and another ſhall kill thee. Yet his ſicknes growing more and more vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, he omitted not any part of his wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ton &amp; vncleane luſts, counterfeiting and putting on a face of courage euen in his weaknes and infirmitie: and was wont to mock at the Phiſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s skill, that after 30. yeers ſpace they wanted other mens counſell to know what was good or hurtfull for their own bodies. In the meane time, at Rome there were certaine ſeedes of murders ſowen, to take effect after <hi>Tiberius</hi> death. <hi>Laelius Balbus</hi> had accuſed <hi>Acutia,</hi> ſomtimes the wife of <hi>P.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; when a recompence was to be ordained for the accuſer, <hi>Iunius Otho</hi> Tribune of the people withſtood it; wherupon they two growing to a iarre, <hi>Otho</hi> was ſent into baniſhment. Then <hi>Albucilla</hi> infamous for looſe loue with many, &amp; once wife to <hi>Satri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Secundus,</hi> the detector of the conſpiracie, was accuſed of certaine impieties and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments againſt the Prince: &amp; with her as confederats, her adulterers <hi>Gn. Domiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Vibius Marſus, L. Arruntius.</hi> Of <hi>Domitius</hi> nobilitie I haue ſpoken before. <hi>Marſus</hi> alſo was of an ancient ſtock, and endued with many good vertues. But the memoriall ſent vnto the Senate doth teſtifie that <hi>Macro</hi> had charge of the examinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, &amp; torture of the bondmen: and the Emperours letters gaue no token of ſuſpition againſt them; either becauſe he was weake &amp; feeble; or bicauſe he knew nothing of it: &amp; many crimes were forged by <hi>Macro</hi> knowen enimie to <hi>Arruntius. Domitius</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore premeditating his defence; &amp; <hi>Marſus</hi> as though he had purpoſed to pine away by famiſhing himſelfe, prolonged their liues. <hi>Arruntius</hi> whileſt his friends perſwaded him not to be too haſtie, but linger on; anſwereth them; <hi rend="margQuotes">That the ſame things do not beſeeme all men alike: &amp; that for his own part, he had liued long ynough; and had no other thing to repent him of, but that he had among ſo manie vaine mockeries &amp; pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils prolonged his heauie and carefull old age: hauing bin long hated of <hi>Seianus;</hi> now of <hi>Macro;</hi> &amp; alwais of ſom one of the mightieſt: not through any fault of his; but bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could not endure wickednes. True it is, he might linger out during the ſhort time the Prince hath to liue: but how ſhould he eſcape the yoong Prince which is to come? If <hi>Tiberius</hi> after ſuch long experience in affaires, by the force of rule and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion hath changed and altered: is it to be hoped that <hi>C. Caeſar,</hi> who is yet ſcarſe out of his childhood, vnexpert and vnacquainted with al things; or brought vp &amp; trained in the lewdeſt; ſhuld follow a better courſe, hauing <hi>Macro</hi> for his guide? who being cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to oppreſſe <hi>Seianus</hi> bicauſe he was woorſe than he, afflicted the common-wealth with greater calamitie. I foreſee (ſaid he) a heauier ſeruitude; and therfore I will flie as well from that which is alreadie paſt, as that which is at hand.</hi> Speaking theſe things as it had bin in maner of a Propheſie, he cut his vaines.

man vnto that villanie, that to auoid the diſcredit with her he could finde no remedie but death. She being accuſed in Senate, albeit ſhe proſtrated hirſelfe at the Lords feet &amp; long ſhewed her common griefe, &amp; womens weaknes, in ſuch deſires, and other la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable and pitifull monings, witneſſing hir dolour and griefe; yet was baniſhed the citie ten yeers, vntil her yoongeſt ſon was paſt the vnconſtant ſlipperines of his youth. Now <hi>Tiberius</hi> bodie &amp; ſtrength began to forſake him; but not yet his diſſimulation. He had the ſame courage &amp; vigour of minde; his countenance and voice was ſtrong; &amp; deſiring ſomtimes to be pleaſant, cloked his manifeſt decay of ſtrength. And often changing, at laſt ſetled himſelfe in a promontorie of Miſenum, in a houſe which ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Lucullus</hi> had bin Lord of; where it was known that his death was at hand by this means. There was a Phiſition verie skilfull in his arte called <hi>Charicles;</hi> yet neuer accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to gouerne the Prince in his ſicknes, but to aſſiſt him with his counſell. This Phiſition departing from <hi>Tiberius,</hi> as it had bin about ſome buſines of his own, vnder colour of dutie taking him by the hand, felt the pulſe of his vains: but yet he could not vſe the matter ſo cunningly, but the emperor perceiued him. Whether <hi>Tiberius</hi> were offended with him or not, it was vncertaine; &amp; if he were, ſo much the more ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his anger, cauſed meat to be made readie, &amp; otherwiſe than his cuſtome had bin, ſitteth downe, as it had been in honor of his friends farewell. <hi>Charicles</hi> neuertheleſſe aſſured <hi>Macro</hi> that his ſpirits decayed, and that he coulde not liue aboue two daies. Whereupon great debating of matters paſſed among thoſe which were preſent; and meſſengers poſted away to the lieutenants &amp; armies. The 17. of the Kalends of April, his breath being ſtopped, he was thought to haue ended this mortall life. Then <hi>C. Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> with a great multitude flocking about him, and congratulating his good fortune, went forth to take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him the Empire: when newes came on the ſudden that <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> was come to his ſpeech &amp; ſight again, &amp; that meate was called for to put him out of his ſwouning: vpon this they were all ſtroken into a great feare; and diſperſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſome one way; ſome another; euerie man counterfeiting a ſad cheere and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of all this. And <hi>C. Caeſar</hi> ſtroken dumbe in the top of his hope, expected his laſt doome. <hi>Macro</hi> reſolute and ſtout, commanded the old man to be ſmoothered, by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting many clothes on him, and euerie man to depart from the doore. And ſo <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> ended his life, the 78. yeere of his age. He was <hi>Neroes</hi> ſonne, and on both ſides extracted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Claudian familie; although his mother went by adoption into the <hi>Liuian</hi> familie, and after that into the <hi>Iulian.</hi> He had doubtfull fortunes from his firſt infancie, for being a baniſhed man, he followed his father, who was proſcribed; and being brought into <hi>Auguſtus</hi> houſe as his ſon in law, was greatly maligned al the time that <hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and afterward <hi>Caius</hi> &amp; <hi>Lucius Caeſar</hi> liued.

After that, returning from Rhodes, he liued twelue yeeres in the Princes houſe which had no children; then poſſeſſed the Empire almoſt 23. yeeres. He changed his manners diuerſly according to the times.

In the meane time <hi>Gotarzes</hi> ſtrengthened with the Daharian and Hyrcanian power, renueth the war. And <hi>Bardanes</hi> enforced to abandon Leleucia, remooued his campe to the champion countrey of the Bracteri. Then the forces of the Orient being deuided and vncertaine which way to leane, <hi>Mithradates</hi> had oportunitie offered him by chance to ſeaſe vpon Armenia; and with the force of the Roman ſouldier, raſe and beat downe the ſtrong fortreſſes: the Hiberian campe at once wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and ſpoiling the champion.

battell againſt them. <hi>Cotys</hi> King of leſſer Armenia did ſomewhat hinder them: ſome of the nobles ioyning with him. But afterward being rebuked by <hi>Caeſars</hi> letters, all turned vnto <hi>Mithradates</hi> ſide, more cruell then was expedient in a kingdome newly gotten. But the Parthian Emperours making preparation to fight, ſuddenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a peace, hauing diſcouered the treacherie of their ſubiects, which <hi>Gotarzes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraied vnto his brother. At the firſt meeting they had a ielous conceit the one of the other; then taking one another by the right hand before the altars of the gods, they promiſed and couenanted to reuenge the treaſon of their enimies; and agree and helpe one another. <hi>Bardanes</hi> ſeemed moſt meete to poſſeſſe the kingdome. And <hi>Gotarzes</hi> becauſe there ſhould remaine no ſparkle of emulation went to <hi>Hyrca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi> And <hi>Bardanes</hi> returning againe: Seleucia yeeldeth the ſeuenth yeere after her reuolt: not without diſcredit to the Parthians, whom one bare citie had ſo long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded. Then he inuadeth the ſtrongeſt Prouinces, and began to recouer Armenia; if <hi>Vibius Marſus</hi> Lieuetenant of Syria, had not hindered him by threatning to warre againſt him. In the meane time <hi>Gotarzes</hi> repenting that he had yeelded the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; and the nobilitie vnto whom obedience in peace ſeemeth hardeſt, calling him backe againe, aſſembleth his forces togither, whom <hi>Bardanes</hi> met at the riuer Erin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des; where skirmiſhing long on both parts for the paſſages: <hi>Bardanes</hi> had the vpper hand, and with proſperous battels ſubdued all the middle countries, vnto the riuer Gindes, which diuideth the Dahas from the Arij. There his fortunate ſucceſſes had an end: for the Parthians although they were conquerers; yet liked not to make warre ſo far off. Wherefore building monuments in token of his wealth and power: and that none of the <hi>Arſacides</hi> had euer before leuied any tribute of thoſe nations, he returned with great glorie: and therefore ſo much the more fierce and intollerable to his ſubiects; who hauing long before laide a ſnare to intrap him, killed him at vnawares as he was a hunting in the Prime of his youth: fewe of the old Kings to be matched in renowne with him; if he had as well ſought the loue of his ſubiects, as to be feared of his enimies. By the death of <hi>Bardanes,</hi> the Parthian affaires were in a hurly burly; whileſt they wauered, whom they ſhould receiue for their King, Many inclined to <hi>Gotarzes,</hi> ſonne to <hi>Meherdates,</hi> ſonne to <hi>Phrahates,</hi> who was giuen vs in hoſtage.

was more affectionat to him then <hi>Germanicus,</hi> which was taken as a prefage of his future greatnes. And it was rumored abroad, that in his infancie dragons were found about him in manner of a gard, which are fables, not vnlike vnto ſtrange mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles: for he himſelfe, who neuer derogated from himſelfe, was wont to report but of one ſerpent which was ſeene in his chamber. But that affection of the people was a relick of the memorie of <hi>Germanicus,</hi> who left no other male behinde him but he: and the commiſeration towards <hi>Agrippina</hi> his mother was increaſed, by reaſon of <hi>Meſſallinaes</hi> crueltie, who alwaies hating her, and now more then euer kindled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her, was hindered no way from forging of crimes, and ſuborning accuſers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her, ſauing only by a new loue, and next coſen vnto madnes. For ſhe did ſo burne in loue with <hi>C.

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was <hi>Silius</hi> ignorant how lewd the practice was, and what perill he might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre: but if he refuſed, certaine of his deſtruction, and hauing ſome hope to bleare the eyes of the world, and enticed with great rewards, he tooke it for the moſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, to expect what might fall, and inioy the preſent. She not by ſtealth, but with a great retinue frequented his houſe; was alwayes at his ſide; beſtowed wealth and honor bountifully vpon him; and at laſt, as though fortune had transferred the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; ſlaues, freed men, and all princely orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, and preparations were ſeene at the adulterers houſe. But <hi>Claudius</hi> not knowing what rule was at home, vſurped the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Cenſor; reprehended with ſeuere edicts the ouergreat licence the people vſed in the Theater; vſing opprobrious ſpeeches againſt <hi>P.

He made a law to reſtraine the crueltie of creditors, forbidding them to lend money to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt vnto mens ſonnes ſubiect to the fathers power, to be payed after their death. He brought water to the citie from the Simbruan hils. He added and publiſhed new letters and characters; being a thing moſt certaine that the manner of the Greekes writing was not begun and perfected at once. The Aegyptians firſt of all expreſſed the conceptions of their mind by the ſhape of beaſts; and the moſt auncient monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of mans memory are ſeene grauen in ſtones: &amp; they ſay, that they are the firſt inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ters of letters. Then the Phoenicians becauſe they were ſtrong by ſea, brought them into Greece, and had the glory of inuenting that, which they receiued of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. For there goeth a report, that <hi>Cadmus</hi> ſailing thither in a Phoenicean ſhip, was the inuentor of that arte among the Greekes, when they were yet vnexpert and rude. Some record that <hi>Cecrops</hi> the Athenian, or <hi>Linus</hi> the Theban, and <hi>Palamedes</hi> the Grecian, at the time of the Troian warre, inuented 16. characters; then others and eſpecially <hi>Simonides</hi> found out the reſt.

Then he propounded in Senate touching the colledge of ſouthſayers, leaſt that the moſt auncient diſcipline of Italie ſhould come to naught by ſlothfulnes, ſeeing that in the hard and aduerſe times of the common wealth they haue been ſent for; and by their aduiſe the ceremonies haue been renewed, and better afterward looked into.

But <hi>Corbulo</hi> entering into the Prouince, firſt with great care, then credit, eſpecially gotten by that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, thruſt into the riuer of Rhene certain Galleies, and other ſhipping as they were fit, into other armes and ditches of the ſea. And hauing with them ſuncke the ſmall veſſels of the enimie, and driuen out <hi>Gannaſcus:</hi> after he had ſetled the preſent eſtate of things, he reduced the legions which knew not what worke and labour meant, but deſirous to hunt after pillage and forreies, to the auncient diſcipline of ſeruice: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding that none ſhould depart from the campe, nor enter battell without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement: that the watch and warde; all charges both by day and night ſhould be executed in armes. And it is reported that one ſouldier was put to death, bicauſe he digged at a trench without his ſword by his ſide; and another, bicauſe he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but his dagger: which beeing ouer-hard and rigorous, and vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, whether falſly ſpread abroad; yet had their beginning of the Captaines ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. Whereby thou maiſt know that he was inexorable in great faults, ſeeing it was thought he vſed ſuch rigour in ſmall. But that terrour wrought different effects in the ſouldiers and enimies: we thereby increaſed our valour; the Barbarians abated their courage. The Friſian nation which rebelled after the ouerthrow of <hi>L.

If the ſucceſſe were bad, the hurt would redownd to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth: if fortune went on his ſide, he was a man to be feared in time of peace; and being valiant and couragious, and vnder a cowardly Prince, not to be ſuffered. Whereupon <hi>Claudius</hi> was ſo farre from forcing Germanie anew; that he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the gariſons to be brought backe on the hither ſide the Rhene. And whileſt <hi>Corbulo</hi> went about to encampe in the enimie land, theſe letters were deliuered him. He vnderſtanding of ſo ſudden a countermaunde, although many things at once troubled his braines; feare of the Emperour; the contempt the Barbarians would haue him in; the ieſt his confederats would make at it: yet making no more wordes, but ſaying only; O how happie ſome Roman Captaines were, ſownded a retraite.

The ſouldiers wearied with theſe toyles, and becauſe they had indured the like in many prouinces; ſent letters ſecretly to the Emperour in the name of the whole armie, and beſought him that from thence forward, he would beſtow the marks of triumph before hand, on ſuch, as he purpoſed to make commaunders of the armie.

In the meane ſpace, for no cauſe then openly knowne, nor afterward diſcouered, <hi>Gn.

The ſame men being Conſuls, <hi>P. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labella</hi> propounded in Senate, that the ſhew of Fencers might be euery yeere ſet foorth at the charges of thoſe which obtained the Queſtorſhip. Which was a charge in our anceſtors times, giuen as a reward of vertue; and was then lawfull for all citizens which truſted to their merites and vertues, to ſue for all kinde of offices, without any regard had of their age; being a thing lawfull for yong men to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls or Dictators. But the Quaeſtors were inſtituted when the Kings bare the ſway, as the law of the <hi>Curies</hi> declare, renewed by <hi>L.

Doth it repent vs, that the Balbians came out of Spaine, &amp; the worthieſt men of Gallia Narbonenſis to vs? Their poſteritie remaine with vs, neither do they giue place vnto vs in loue towards this our countrie.

precident, but it hath bin practiſed by our firſt people. But we haue fought with the Senonians. I pray you, haue the Volci &amp; Aequi neuer prepared an army againſt vs? we haue beene taken of the Galli: and we haue giuen hoſtages likewiſe to the Tuſci, and paſſed vnder the yoke of the Samnites. If thou wilt reckon vp all the warres, none hath beene ſooner ended than that againſt the Galli: ſince that time we haue had a continuall and faithfull peace. Now that in conformitie of manners, artes, and alliances, they are mingled with our people, let them rather bring to vs their gold and wealth, then inioy it by themſelues. All things (Lords of the Senate) which are thought now to be moſt auncient, haue beene new. The Patricians had firſt all offices in their hands; after them the people; after the people, the Latines; after the Latines, all the nations of Italie. This will grow olde likewiſe, although it ſeeme newe; and that which to day we maintaine by example, ſhall be reckoned amongſt examples.</hi> A decree of the Senate giuen according vnto the Princes oration, the Eduans firſt of all receiued the rights and priuileges of Senators in the citie. This was graunted them in conſideration of their auncient alliance: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they onely among the Galli, called themſelues brothers of the people of Rome. The ſame time <hi>Caeſar</hi> made the auncienteſt of the Senators patriciens, or ſuch whoſe fathers were famous; fewe of thoſe families remaining, which <hi>Romulus</hi> called of the greater; and <hi>L. Brutus,</hi> of the leſſer familie: thoſe alſo being decayed &amp; extinguiſhed, which <hi>Caeſar</hi> the Dictator ſubſtituted by the lawe Caſſia: and Prince <hi>Augustus</hi> by the lawe Senia. All theſe things were gratefull vnto the people; and done with the good liking of <hi>Caeſar.</hi> It troubled him very much howe he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue ſuch from the Senate, as were notoriouſly infamous; and at laſt bethought himſelfe of a newe and gentle courſe; yet grounded on the rigour of auncient time: which was to admoniſh euerie man to examine his owne conſcience: and craue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to giue vp his roome, if he thought himſelfe touched; which ſhould eaſily be graunted; and promiſed them to propound togither, as well thoſe as were remoued, as thoſe as reſigned their roomes; that the iudgement of the Cenſors, and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of thoſe which willingly renounced interlaced togither, might couer the diſcredit. For this cauſe the Conſull <hi>Vipſanius</hi> propounded, that <hi>Claudius</hi> might be called the father of the Senate: becauſe that the title of father of the countrey, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing common, newe merites towards the common-wealth, ſhould not be honoured with old titles. But he himſelfe brideled the Conſull as ouer-much flattering; and appointed a view to be taken of the citie which is called Luſtrum, and the number of the citizens to be inrolled, which came to threeſcore eight hundred, &amp; foure &amp; fortie thouſand. Then began he to haue better intelligence how matters went at home: and not long after he was conſtrained to know, and puniſh the diſſolute and licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious life of his wife, immediately after to burne in an vnlawfull deſire of inceſtious matrimonie.</p>

Neuertheleſſe ſhe deſired the name of matrimonie, becauſe of the greatnes of the infamie; which with prodigall and diſſolute perſons is the laſt contentment. They expected no longer, then <hi>Claudius</hi> went to Hoſtia to do ſacrifice, but ſhe accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed all the ſolemnities of marriage. I am not ignorant, but it will ſound like a fable, that there ſhould be any man ſo blockiſh and careleſſe; much leſſe that a Conſull elect ſhould in a citie where all thing is knowen, and nothing kept ſecret; a day appointed; companie aſſembled to ſeale the agreement; contract marriage as it were for iſſue and children, with the Princes wife: and that ſhee ſhould heare the words of the Auſpices, or hand-faſters; attire herſelfe bride-like, ſacrifice vnto the gods; ſit downe amongſt the gueſts, kiſſe, embrace; and in the ende paſſe the night in all libertie of marriage. But there is nothing fained, to make the thing ſeeme miraculous; but I will deliuer you that which hath been heard and written by auncient writers. Then the Princes houſe began to quake for feare; and eſpecially thoſe which were in higheſt credit and fauour: and if there ſhould fall an alteration more afeard; they began now not in ſecret whiſperings, but openly to murmur, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi rend="margQuotes">That as long as the adulterers did vſe the matter ſecretly, true it was that the Prince was diſhonored; but yet he was in no danger of his eſtate: where as now this yong man of a noble birth, of a manly repreſentation, in the prime of his youth and ſhortly to be Conſull, aſpired no doubt to greater hope.

For as ſoone as ſhe was aſſured of the marriage, ſhe beganne to laie plots for greater matters, and vndertooke a match betweene <hi>Domitius,</hi> whom ſhee had had by <hi>Gn. AEnobarbus,</hi> and <hi>Octauia, Caeſars</hi> daughter: which without ſhame and diſcredit could not be accompliſhed, becauſe <hi>Caeſar</hi> had betrothed <hi>Octauia</hi> to <hi>L.

But nothing ſeemed hard to the Princes minde, who had neither iudgment nor ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, but what was put into him or commaunded. <hi>Vitellius</hi> therefore cloking vnder the name of a Cenſor baſe and ſeruile deuiſes; fore ſeeing into whoſe handeling rule and dominion would ſhortly come, to winne <hi>Agrippinaes</hi> fauour, began to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedle and thruſt himſelfe into her counſels, and carrie tales againſt <hi>Silanus:</hi> who

had a ſiſter in deede comely, but a ſhameleſſe dame, called <hi>Iunia Caluina:</hi> who not long before had beene <hi>Vitellius</hi> ſons wife. From hence roſe the beginning of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, by drawing her into ſuſpition, not of inceſt with her brother; but of other looſe loues redounding to their ſhame and infamie. <hi>Caeſar</hi> gaue eare vnto him, as one readie through the loue he bare his daughter, to harken to all ſuſpitions againſt his ſonne in law. But <hi>Silanus</hi> doubting nothing what ſnares were laide for him; and by chaunce that yeere Pretor, was on the ſudden by an edict publiſhed by <hi>Vitellius,</hi> put from his Senators roome; although the roule of the Senators were made vp, and the number taken not long before. <hi>Claudius</hi> thereupon brake off his alliance with him; and <hi>Silanus</hi> was forced to renounce his office by othe; and the reſt of the time of his Pretorſhip was beſtowed vpon <hi>Eprius Marcellus.</hi>

               <p>C. <hi>Pompeius,</hi> and <hi>Q.

Neither was that doubt out of <hi>Caeſars</hi> head, vntill <hi>Vitellius</hi> by his drifts and ſleights vndertooke the matter. And asking the Emperour whether he would yeeld to the commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the people, or authoritie of the Senate? and he anſwering that he was one of the citizens, and not able to withſtand their agreement, <hi>Vitellius</hi> willed him not to ſtirre out of his pallace, but goeth himſelfe to the Curia, and proteſting that he had a matter to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate which touched the welfare of the whole ſtate, craueth licence to ſpeake firſt, and began as followeth: <hi rend="margQuotes">That the heauie and great toiles of the Prince in gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the whole world, wanted ſupport; that being vnburdened of domeſticall cares, he might the better prouide for the common good. And what honeſter ſolace of a Cenſors mind, then to take vnto him a wife, a companion in proſperous and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full fortune? vnto whom he might impart his inward thoughts, commit his ſmall children; he eſpecially not nuzled vp in riot and wanton luſts, but who had beene obedient to lawes from his firſt youth.</hi> After he had made this preamble with a gloſing ſpeech, and that it was accepted with great flattery of the Lords of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, he began anew and ſayd. <hi rend="margQuotes">Seeing that all of them did exhort the Prince to marry, it was conuenient a wife were choſen for him, renowmed for her nobilitie, child-bearing, and honeſtie of life. Neither was it needefull to go farre for ſuch a one, ſeeing <hi>Agrippina</hi> did excell the reſt in noblenes of bloud; &amp; had giuen a proofe of her fruitfulnes, and was indued with other honeſt qualities. That was a matter worthy remembrance, that by the prouidence of the gods, a widow ſhould be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to a Prince, who had tried no matrimonie but his owne. They had heard of their forefathers, and ſeene themſelues, mens wiues to haue beene taken by force at the will of the Emperour; a thing farre from the modeſtie of the preſent time: yea he ſhould be a precident how hereafter the Emperour ſhould take a wife. But it is a ſtrange precident to marry our brothers daughters: but it is a vſuall matter among other nations, and by no law forbidden. And marriages betweene coſen germaines a long time not knowne, in progroſſe of time grew common. A cuſtome is to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:18166:82"/>
according as it is profitable and expedient: and this marriage likewiſe in time to come will be among things commonly practiſed.</hi> There wanted not ſome which proteſted, if <hi>Caeſar</hi> would protract his reſolution, they would force him to it, and ſo ruſht who firſt might out of the Curia: and afterward by multitudes flocked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, crying that the people of Rome deſired the ſame. <hi>Claudius</hi> expected no longer, but went and met them at the Forum, and ſhewed himſelfe to ſuch as were glad thereof. And entering into the Senate, demaunded that a decree might be inacted, by which, marriage betweene the vncles and nieces, daughters to their brothers, ſhould from thence forward be accompted iuſt and lawfull. Yet for all that onely one there hath beene, called <hi>Talledius Seuerus,</hi> a gentleman of Rome, who hath greatly deſired to marry in that ſort, whom moſt men thinke to haue done it to win <hi>Agrippinaes</hi> fauour. By that marriage all was turned vpſide downe in the citie, and al men obeyed this woman; yet not as when <hi>Meſſallina</hi> abuſed the gouernment through licentiouſnes: but as it were with as great and ſeuere ſubiection, as if they had beene vnder a man. Openly ſhe ſhewed ſeueritie, and often pride; nothing done in her houſe diſhonorably, vnleſſe it were ſo expedient for the furthering of rule and gouernment: her exceeding greedines in raking of money had a cloake, which was the maintenance of the ſtate. The day of the marriage <hi>Silanus</hi> killed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, either becauſe vntill that time he had hope of prolonging his life; or elſe choſe that day to make the marriage more odious. <hi>Caluina</hi> his ſiſter was expulſed Italie. <hi>Claudius</hi> added certaine ſacrifices according to the lawes of King <hi>Tullus,</hi> and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſatisfactions by the chiefe prieſt in <hi>Dianaes</hi> wood, all men laughing <hi>Claudius</hi> to skorne, that puniſhment and purging ſacrifices of inceſt ſhould be ſought at that time.</p>

Now <hi>Domitius</hi> beſides the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red which was betweene them before, being betrothed and ſonne in law to the Emperour, began to be made equall to <hi>Britannicus,</hi> by his mothers practiſes, and pollicie of ſuch as feared the ſonne would reuenge vpon thoſe which procured <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalinaes</hi> accuſation. About the ſame time the Embaſſadors of the Parthians ſent as I haue ſaid before, to demand <hi>Meherdates</hi> for their King, entered into the Senat, ;and began to vtter their charge as followeth. <hi rend="margQuotes">They came thither not ignorant of the league betweene them and the Romans, nor diſloyall to the familie of the Arſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides;
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:18166:83"/>
but to aske for <hi>Vonones</hi> ſonne, <hi>Phrahates</hi> nephew; againſt <hi>Gotarzes</hi> tyrannie, alike intollerable to the nobilitie and communaltie. Now that his brothers are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by murder, his neereſt kinſemen, and ſuch as were fartheſe off; he would do the like to women with child, and ſmall children; thinking it a meanes being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate in warres abroad, to couer with that cowardlines his crueltie at home. That their amitie with vs was auncient, and publickly confirmed; and therefore reaſon we ſhould ayd our allies, which might in ſtrength compare with the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, but in deede yeeld for reuerence. Therefore the Kings children were giuen for hoſtages, that if they grew weary of their domeſticall gouernment, they might haue recourſe to the Prince and Lords of the Senate, vnder whoſe manner of liuing the King being brought vp, ſhould be preſumed to be the better.</hi> When they had vttered theſe and the like ſpeeches, <hi>Caeſar</hi> began his oration with the greatnes of the Roman Empire, and dutifulnes of the Parthians, and maketh himſelfe equall to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus;</hi> declaring that a King had beene demaunded of him alſo, not mentioning <hi>Tiberius</hi> at all, notwithſtanding he had ſent ayd likewiſe. He gaue certaine precepts to <hi>Meherdates,</hi> who was there preſent, aduertiſing him that he ſhould not thinke himſelfe a Lord and maiſter to commaund ouer his ſubiects as ſlaues; but a guide; and they citizens: and that he ſhould vſe clemencie and iuſtice, vertues ſo much the more gratefull vnto theſe barbarians, by how much the leſſe knowne among them. Then turning himſelfe to the Embaſſadors, he highly commended the youth which had beene brought vp in the citie, as one, whoſe modeſtie had beene well tried: that the diſpoſitions of Kings were to be borne withal, becauſe often changes are not profitable. That the Romane eſtate was growne vnto that height with ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of glory, that it deſired peace and quietnes euen to forren nations. After he had thus ſayd, he commaunded <hi>C. Caſsius</hi> gouernor of Syria, to conduct the yong man to the riuer of Euphrates. <hi>Caſsius</hi> at that time did excell the reſt in the knowledge of the lawes. For militarie skill is vnknowne in time of reſt and quietnes: and peace eſteemeth alike of the coward and couragious. Neuertheles, as much as thoſe quiet times gaue him leaue, he renewed the auncient diſcipline; kept the legions in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe with care and foreſight, as if the enemie had beene at hand; thinking it a thing worthy of his anceſtors, and <hi>Caſsian</hi> familie, renowned among thoſe people. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing therefore ſent for them, through whoſe conſentment the King was demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and planted his camp at Zeugma, where the riuer is moſt paſſable: after that the noblemen of Parthia, and the King of the Arabians called <hi>Abbarus</hi> was come, he ſhewed vnto <hi>Meherdates,</hi> that the firſt brunt of the barbarians was fierce and hote; but by delay and lingering became cold, or turned into treaſon; and therefore he ſhould couragiouſly go through his enterpriſe. But his aduiſe was contemned through <hi>Abbarus</hi> fraude, who detained him like an vnexperienced yong man in the towne of Edeſſa; as though the higheſt degree of fortune and princely felicitie had conſiſted in riot and wantonnes. And when <hi>Carrhenes</hi> called them in, and aſſured them, that all was in a good readines if they would make haſte, they did not march ſtraight to Meſopotamia, but turned to Armenia in an vnſeaſonable time, becauſe the winter was begun. Then wearied with ſnowes and mountaines, comming neere to the plaine, they ioyned with <hi>Carrhenes</hi> forces. And hauing paſſed the riuer of Tigris, they entered into the countrey of the Adiabeni; whoſe King <hi>Iuliates</hi> in open ſhew profeſſed himſelfe a confederate of <hi>Meherdates,</hi> but vnderhand was more faithfully bent to <hi>Gotarzes.</hi>

In the meane time <hi>Gotarzes</hi> at a hill called Sambulos, offered vowes to the gods of the place, among which <hi>Hercules</hi> was chiefly honoured: who at a certaine time admoniſheth his Prieſtes in a dreame, that neere vnto the Temple, they ſhould haue horſes readie prepared for hunting: the horſes loaden with quiuers full of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes prawnſing vp and downe the woods, returne at night breathing and panting with their quiuers emptie. The god again declareth to them in a dreame what woods they haue courſed vp and downe in; whither they goe and finde wild beaſts killed in many places. But <hi>Gotarzes</hi> not hauing ſufficiently ſtrengthened his armie, vſeth the riuer Corma for a defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.

Among which <hi>Ezates Adiabenus,</hi> and anon after <hi>Abbarus</hi> King of the Arabians, with their armie began to ſhrinke through a certaine lightnes incident to that nation: and bicauſe it is tried by experience that the Barbarians had rather come to Rome to demaund a King, then when they haue him keepe him. Now <hi>Meherdates</hi> ſeeing himſelfe ſtripped of his ſtrongeſt ſuccour, and ſuſpecting leaſt the others would betraye him, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for his laſt refuge to commit the matter to chaunce, and hazard it in a maine battell. <hi>Gotarzes</hi> being verie fierce, that his enimies forces were diminiſhed, refuſed not to fight. They met with great ſlaughter and a doubtfull iſſue; vntill <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhenes</hi> making cleare way before him, and driuing and purſuing the enimies too farre, was compaſſed behind with a freſh companie and ſlaine. Then all hope being loſt, <hi>Meherdates</hi> truſting the promiſes of one <hi>Parrhacis</hi> a follower of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by his falſhood was taken priſoner, and deliuered to the Conquerour. Who intreated him not like a kinſman, or one of the <hi>Arſacis</hi> ſtocke; but reuiled him like a ſtranger and a Roman: and hauing cut off his eares, gaue him his life, as a ſhew of his clemencie; and diſhonour and reproch vnto vs. Not long after <hi>Gotarzes</hi> died of a diſeaſe; and <hi>Vonones</hi> then gouernour of the Medes, was called to be King. There happened nothing in his raigne either proſperous or vnproſperous, worthie the tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: he liued but a ſhort and an inglorious time; and the kingdome of the Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans was tranſlated to his ſonne <hi>Vologeſes.</hi> But <hi>Mithradates</hi> the Boſphoran wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vp and downe after he had loſt his forces; vnderſtanding that <hi>Didius</hi> the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Captaine with the ſtrength of his armie was departed: and that onely <hi>Cotys</hi> a raw and rude youth, was left in the new kingdome with ſome few bandes vnder the conduct of <hi>Iulius Aquila</hi> gentleman of Rome; contemnig both of them, began to ſollicite the countries about him, and allure fugitiues: and at laſt, hauing aſſembled an armie, chaſeth out the King of the Dandarides, and inioyeth his kingdome. Which being vnderſtoode, and looking euerie hower that he would inuade the Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoran: <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Cotys</hi> diſtruſtring their owne forces, becauſe <hi>Zorſines</hi> King of the Soraci had taken armes againe, ſought for forreine aide, and ſent Ambaſſadors to <hi>Eunones</hi> King of the Adorſian nation: being no hard matter to draw him to their

fellowſhip, after he had declared what oddes there was between the Roman forces, and the rebell <hi>Mithradates.</hi> Whereupon they agreed that <hi>Eunones</hi> ſhould haue charge of the horſemen, and the Romains beſiege townes. Then hauing muſtered their armie in order, they marche in battell aray; the Adorſi defending the front and the rereward; the cohorts and Boſphorani the middle battell, armed after our faſhion. And ſo driuing backe the enimie, we came to Soza the chiefe towne of Dandarica, which <hi>Mithradates</hi> forſooke; where we left a garriſon, as being doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of the inhabitants fidelitie. From thence they marched to the Soraci: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing paſſed the riuer Panda, they beſieged the citie Vſpe, ſituated on a high place, &amp; fortified with wals and ditches; ſauing that the wals not being made of ſtone, but of hurdles ioyned togither, &amp; earth in the middle, were too weake againſt the beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: who hauing erected towres higher than the wals, with fire and dartes diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered they beſieged: and had not the night broken off the battell, the towne had beene aſſaulted and taken the ſame day.

And becauſe that to ſlaie ſuch as yeelded, would be a cruell part; and to keepe ſo great a multitude, hard; they thought it beſt to hold on the ſiege, and kill them by right of warre: and thereupon the ſigne was giuen to ſuch ſouldiers as had ſcaled the wals to put them to the ſword.</p>

               <p>VNder the ſame Conſuls <hi>Agrippina</hi> boiling with deadly hatred and malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Lollia,</hi> becauſe ſhe had contended with her for the marrying of the Prince, left no meanes vnſought, vntill ſhe had ſtirred vp ſome to accuſe her of conference had with the Chaldeans, and Magicians, and counſell asked of the idoll of <hi>Apollo Clarius,</hi> concerning the Emperours marriage. Hereupon <hi>Claudius,</hi> the defendant vnhard, hauing ſpoken much before the Senate of her noblenes of birth, that ſhe was <hi>L. Voluſius</hi> ſiſters daughter; that <hi>Cotta Meſſallinus</hi> was her great vncle; and ſhe once wife to <hi>Mennius Regulus,</hi> (for of purpoſe he left out that ſhe had beene married to <hi>C.

And <hi>Calpurnia,</hi> a woman of great birth was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne, only becauſe the Prince had praiſed her beawtie; not for any amorous affection, but by chaunce: yet <hi>Agrippina</hi> ſtretched not her malice to the vttermoſt againſt her, but ſent a Tribune to make away <hi>Lollia.</hi> And <hi>Cadius Rufus</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>demned for bribery, and extorſion, at the inſtance of the Bithynians. And in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the great reuerence the inhabitants of Gallia Narbonenſis bare the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:18166:85"/>
Lords of the Senat, it was graunted to the Senators of that prouince, that without licence of the Prince they might go viſit their houſes, &amp; diſpoſe of their goods with the like priuiledge, as they which were of the prouince of Sicilia. The Ituraei and Iewes, after their Kings <hi>Sohemus</hi> and <hi>Agrippa</hi> were dead, were ioyned to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince of Syria. It was ordained that the ceremonies of the auguration of health, intermitted fiue and twenty yeeres, ſhould be renewed, and continued from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth. <hi>Caeſar</hi> inlarged the circuit of the citie, according to the auncient cuſtome; by which licence was giuen them which had inlarged the bounds of the Empire, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the bounds of the Citie. Neuertheles none of the Roman captaines <hi>L. Sylla</hi> and <hi>Augustus</hi> excepted, although they had ſubdued mightie nations, had vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to do it: but whether the Kings which then ruled the citie did it for ambition or vaine-glory, there run diuers reports. But it ſhall not be impertinent, as I thinke, to lay downe the beginning of the foundation of Rome, and what circuit <hi>Romulus</hi> firſt aſſigned. He therefore began the circuit at the oxe market called <hi>forum boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium,</hi> where we ſee ſet vp a picture of a braſen Bull (becauſe that kinde of beaſt is broken to the plough) from thence drawing a furrow as a plat of the circuit of the citie, which contained within it the great altar of <hi>Hercules.</hi> From thence by certaine diſtances ſtones were put by the foote of the hill Palatine, vnto the altar of <hi>Conſus;</hi> then to the old Curies; then to the chappell of the houſhold gods. For ſome haue thought, that the forum Romanum, and the Capitoll, were not added to the citie by <hi>Romulus,</hi> but by <hi>T. Tatius.</hi> After that, the circuit or pomoerium was augmented, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fortune and riches of the Kings. And for the limits that <hi>Claudius</hi> then put, they are eaſily knowne, and are written in the publike actes.</p>

About the ſame time vpper Germanie quaked with feare, through the comming of the Catti, which robbed and ſpoiled all where they came. Whereupon <hi>L.

Their ioy was increaſed, becauſe they had deliuered from ſeruitude ſome of their fellowes, which fortie yeeres before had beene taken when <hi>Varus</hi> was defeated. But thoſe which tooke the right hand, and the neereſt way, meeting the enemie in the face, and daring to encounter, made a greater ſlaughter, and loaden with bootie &amp; fame, returned to the hill Taunus; where <hi>Pomponius</hi> was expected with the legions, if the Catti deſiring a reuenge, would offer occaſion to ſight. But they fearing leaſt the Romanes would ſet on them on one ſide, and the Cheruſci with whom they are alwayes at iarre, on the other; ſent Embaſſadors and hoſtages to Rome; where the honor of triumph was awarded <hi>Pomponius,</hi> a ſmall part of his fame with poſteritie, being more renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for skill in poetrie.

For an infinite power of the Ligians and other nations were comming, drawen with the fame of the wealth of <hi>Vannius</hi> kingdome, which for thirtie yeeres ſpace he had enriched with pillages and tributes. <hi>Vannius</hi> owne forces conſiſted in footemen, his horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were of Sarmates, called Iazygiens, vnable to encounter the multitude of the enemies power, and therefore defended himſelfe in fortreſſes, and purpoſed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the warre.

to hazard the laſt chaunce; chuſing a place for the battell, where the comming in and going out was verie incommodious to vs; and to his, great aduantage. Then they got to the top of a hill: and if there were any eaſie paſſage vnto them, they ſtopped it vp with heapes of ſtones, as it were in maner of a rampire. Not farre off, ranne a riuer with an vncertaine foord, where a great troupe of his beſt ſoldiers were readie in order before the rampire. Beſides this, the leaders went about, exhorted and incouraged the ſouldiers, taking all occaſion of feare from them, and putting them in hope, with all other inducements of warre. And <hi>Caractacus</hi> courſing hither &amp; thither, proteſted: <hi rend="margQuotes">That that day, and that battell ſhould be either the beginning of the recouering of their libertie, or perpetuall ſeruitude.

But if thou keepe me aliue, I ſhall be for euer an example of thy clemencie.</hi> Hauing ſpoken theſe words, <hi>Caeſar</hi> pardoned him, his wife, and his brothers. And being all vnbound, they did their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence likewiſe vnto <hi>Agrippina,</hi> who ſate aloft in another high chaire; and gaue her the like praiſes and thankes, as they had giuen the Prince.

For they inuiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the campe-maſter, and the legionarie cohorts, which were left behinde to build fortreſſes in the Silures countrie: and if they had not been ſpeedily reſcued by the villages and fortes adioyning, they had been put to the ſword euerie man. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the campe-maſter, and eight Centurions, and the forwardeſt common ſoldiers, were ſlaine: and anon after they put to flight our forragers, and the troupes of horſemen which were ſent to reſcue them. Then <hi>Ostorius</hi> ſendeth abroade certaine light harneſſed companies; which yet could not ſtaie their flight, if the legions had not vndertaken the battell. By their ſtrength they fought with ſmall oddes on either hand, till at length we had the better of it; and the enemie betooke him to his heeles with ſmall loſſe, becauſe the day beganne to faile. After that time they had diuers skirmiſhes, though for the moſt part in woods and mariſhes, according as occaſion was giuen, in manner of roades, either by chance, or of valoure; ſometime raſhly, ſometimes with foreſight; now for anger, now for bootie; ſometimes by their captaines commaundement; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time without warrant: but principally by the obſtinacie of the Siluri, exaſperated with a ſpeech which the Roman Emperour ſhould haue vſed: which was, that as the Sugambri were deſtroyed, and tranſported into Gallia; ſo the name of the Siluri ſhould vtterly bee extinguiſhed. And in this heate they intercepted two aide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes, vncircumſpectly waſting and ſpoiling through the auarice of the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines; and by diſtributing the ſpoiles and priſoners, drew the reſidue of the nations to reuolt; when as <hi>Ostorius</hi> wearied with care and trauell yeelded vp his ghoſt: the enemie reioyſing thereat, as at the death of a captaine not to be deſpiſed, though not in battell, yet ſpent by reaſon of the warre.

Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe <hi>Agrippina</hi> durſt not leuell at her chiefeſt marke, which was, that her ſonne ſhould ſucceede in ſtate, vnleſſe <hi>Luſius Geta,</hi> and <hi>Rufus Criſpinus</hi> captaines of <hi>Caeſars</hi> gard were firſt diſcharged; whom ſhe thought would be mindfull of <hi>Meſſallinaes</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours towards them, and therefore bound vnto her children. <hi>Agrippina</hi> therefore beareth the Emperour in hand, that the gard was deuided into factions through ambition of the two captaines ſtriuing for ſuperioritie; that the diſcipline of ſeruice would be better kept if the ſouldiers were commaunded by one alone. The charge of the cohorts was transferred vnto <hi>Burrhus Afranius,</hi> a man of great fame for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſeruice, yet knowing well by whoſe practiſe and fauour he came to the place. <hi>Agrippina</hi> began alſo to raiſe her owne eſtate to a higher degree, by entering into the Capitol in a chariot, which in times paſt was a cuſtome only lawfull for the Prieſts in ſacred rites; which augmented the more the ſtate of this woman, becauſe ſhe was the onely example vnto this day of any one, who being daughter of an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, hath been alſo ſiſter, wife, and mother of an Emperour.

               <p>THe ſame yeere a warre begun betweene the Armenians and Hiberi, was cauſe of great troubles betwixt the Romans and the Parthians. <hi>Vologeſes</hi> was King of the Parthians, deſcended by his mothers ſide of a Greek concubine, yet got the kingdome by conſent of his brothers. <hi>Pharaſmanes</hi> hath a long time poſſeſſed the Hiberians countrey as a King; and his brother <hi>Mithradates</hi> the Armenians through our forces. <hi>Pharaſmanes</hi> had a ſonne called <hi>Rhadamistus</hi> of a comely tall ſtature, and of a verie ſtrong and able bodie, trained vp in the qualities and practiſes his father before him had beene, and greatly renowned among his neighbors. He was woont to ſay that the kingdome of Hiberia was ſmall; and yet kept from him by his father, who was verie olde: and ſo oft he did caſt foorth thoſe ſpeeches, and ſo fiercely, that it was eaſily ſeene how greedie a deſire he had to raigne. <hi>Pharaſmanes</hi> then ſeeing this yoong man ſo deſirous and readie to rule, miſdoubting the peoples affection bent towardes him, by reaſon of his declining yeeres; thought it
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:18166:88"/>
beſt to feede him with ſome other hope, and ſet Armenia before his eies, telling him that he had giuen that kingdome to <hi>Mithradates,</hi> hauing firſt expulſed the Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Yet that it was not his beſt courſe to ſet on it by force; but vſe policie againſt <hi>Mithradates</hi> and intrap him when he leaſt looked for it. <hi>Rhadamistus</hi> vnder colour of ſome diſcontent with his father, through the inſupportable dealing of his ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother, goeth to his vncle: where being intreated with all courteſie as if he had been his owne childe, ſolliciteth the chiefe noble men of Armenia to rebellion: <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thradates</hi> knowing nothing, but ſtill entertaining him with all fauour and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. <hi>Rhadamistus</hi> vnder colour of reconciliation returned vnto his father, and declared vnto him, to what a forwardnes he had brought matters by pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie; and that the reſt was to bee accompliſhed by armes. In the meane time <hi>Pharaſmanes</hi> ſeeketh occaſions of warre: and faineth that when he made warre againſt the King of the Albani, and demaunded ſuccour of the Romans, his brother was againſt him, which iniurie he would reuenge to his vtter ruine and ouerthrow. And therewithall giueth his ſonne a ſtrong power; who hauing terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <hi>Mithradates</hi> with a ſudden irruption and driuen him out of the field, forced him to flee into a forte called Gorneas, ſtrong by ſituation, and garded with a garriſon of ſouldiers: <hi>Caelius Pollio</hi> being their Captaine, and <hi>Caſperius</hi> their Centurion. The barbarous people know nothing leſſe then engines and ſubtile deuiſes in beſieging and aſſayling of fortreſſes: and to vs that part of ſeruice is moſt familiar. And <hi>Rha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damistus</hi> in vaine, yea with his loſſe hauing tried to approche the forte beginneth the ſiege; and ſeeing how little good was to be done that waie, trieth what marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe he could make with the Captaine for money: although <hi>Caſperius</hi> proteſted that a King confederate, or Armenia the gift of the people of Rome, ought not to be bought and ſold by corruption and money. In the ende, becauſe <hi>Pollio</hi> pretended the multitude of enemies, and <hi>Rhadamistus</hi> his fathers commaundement; <hi>Caſperius</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing agreed to a ſuſpenſion of armes, departed: with intention that if he could not withdraw <hi>Pharaſmanes</hi> from making war againſt <hi>Mithradates,</hi> he would informe <hi>T. Vinidius Quadratus</hi> preſident of Syria in what ſtate Armenia ſtoode. By the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Centurion, the prefect being as it were deliuered of a keeper, began to exhorte <hi>Mithradates</hi> to make a peace: <hi rend="margQuotes">Shewing him the vnitie that ſhould be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene brothers, that <hi>Pharaſmanes</hi> was his elder brother; with other reſpects of friendſhip and alliance; as that he had married <hi>Pharaſmanes</hi> daughter, and how he was <hi>Rhadamistus</hi> father in law. The Hiberi refuſed not to make a peace, although at that time they were ſtrong, and the perfidiouſnes of the Armenian well knowen; &amp; <hi>Mithradates</hi> had no other refuge but the Caſtle deſtitute of munition: &amp; therfore that he ſhould not doubt rather to accept conditions of peace without blood, then trie the hazard of war. Mithradates</hi> reſolued not on the ſudden, ſuſpecting the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines counſels; becauſe he had lewdly behaued himſelfe with the Kings concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, was a man eaſily corrupted with money to all lewdnes. <hi>Caſperius</hi> in the meane ſpace goeth to <hi>Pharaſmanes,</hi> and is verie inſtant that the Hiberi ſhould depart from the ſiege of Gorneas. But the King giuing him openly vncertaine anſwers, and for the moſt part gentle and milde; by ſecret meſſengers aduertiſeth <hi>Rhadamistus</hi> by all poſſible meanes to haſten the aſſault. The price of the treaſon is augmented, and <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio</hi> ſecretly corrupting the ſouldiers, perſwadeth them earneſtly to demand a peace, and threaten that they would abandon the fortreſſe. Through which neceſſitie <hi>Mithradates</hi> taketh a day and place to treate of a peace, and goeth out of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe. <hi>Rhadamistus</hi> running immediately to imbrace him; faineth great obedience; calleth him father in lawe, and father; and ſweareth he would vſe no violence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:18166:89"/>
him, neither by ſword, nor poiſon. And withall draweth him into a wood hard by, ſaying: that there he had cauſed a ſacrifice to be prouided, to conclude and confirme the peace in the preſence of the gods. The cuſtome of thoſe Kings is, that when they make any attonement, to ioyne their right hands, and binde their thumbs togither, and draw them hard with a knot; then when the blood is runne to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, with a ſmall pricke let it out, and then licke the one the others: that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement is counted ſecret, as it were hallowed with their mutuall blood. But he which ſhould haue tied their thumbs togither, faining as if he had fallen, catcheth hold of <hi>Mithradates</hi> knees, and ouerthroweth him: immediately many ranne in and bound him in chaines and fetters, and ſo drewe him away, which the Barbarians repute a great ignominie and diſhonor. The common people whom he had rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly tyranniſed, reuiled him, and offered to ſtrike him. But contrariwiſe there were ſome which had compaſſion of ſo great a chaunge of fortune: and his wife follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing with her little children filled all with lamentation; who were all thruſt into ſundrie couered wagons, vntill <hi>Pharaſmanes</hi> pleaſure was knowen. But the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was deerer vnto him, then his brother and daughter; and therefore his mind was readie bent to all wickednes: onely he tooke order that they ſhould not be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in his ſight. And <hi>Rhadamistus</hi> as it were mindefull of his othe, vſed neither ſword nor poiſon againſt his ſiſter &amp; vncle; but laying the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on the ground couereth and ſtifeleth them with a heauie burden of clothes. And <hi>Mithradates</hi> children were ſlaine likewiſe, becauſe they wept and bewailed the murdering of their parents. But <hi>Quadratus</hi> vnderſtanding that <hi>Mithradates</hi> was betrayed, and that the murderers inioyed the kingdome; calleth a councell, declareth the matter, and conſulteth whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſhould reuenge or not.

That <hi>Rhadamistus</hi> might inioy his ill got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten kingdome, ſo as withall he be odious and infamous: ſeeing that it was better ſo for the Romans, than if he had gotten it with credit.</hi> They all condeſcended vnto this aduiſe. And yet leaſt they ſhould ſeeme to approoue that wicked fact, and leaſt <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhould commaund the contrarie, meſſengers were ſent to <hi>Pharaſmanes,</hi> adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him to depart Armenia, and withdraw his ſonne away likewiſe. At that time <hi>Iulius Pelignus</hi> a daſtardly coward, and no leſſe deſpicable a ieſting ſtocke for miſhape and deformitie of bodie, was Procurator of Cappadocia; but of inward fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritie with <hi>Caeſar;</hi> when being a priuate man in times paſt, in his companie he ſpent his idle time with delight and contentation. This <hi>Pelignus</hi> hauing gathered togither the forces of the Prouinces, as if he would recouer Armenia, but waſting and ſpoiling the allies more then the enimies; his owne reuolting from him, and the Barbarians making incurſions; being without ſuccour came to <hi>Rhadamistus,</hi> who with gifts ſo wonne him, that of his own motion he exhorted him to crowne himſelfe King, and aſſiſted him as the author and approouer of the action. Which diſhoneſt fact being bruted abroade, leaſt the credit of the reſt ſhould be meaſured according to this fact of <hi>Pelignus; Heluidius Priſcus,</hi> Lieutenant was ſent with a legion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe thoſe ſturres as the preſent occaſion required. Who hauing withall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient ſpeed paſſed ouer the hill Taurus, and ſetling the affaires there, rather with moderation, then force; was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to returne to Syria; leaſt he ſhould be a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of warre againſt the Parthians. For <hi>Vologeſes</hi> thinking there had fell out iuſt

occaſion of inuading Armenia, which poſſeſſed of his anceſtors, a forraine King now occupied by a lewde practiſe, aſſembleth his power: and becauſe none of his houſe ſhould liue without rule and ſoueraigntie, goeth about to inueſt his brother <hi>Tirida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> in the kingdome. By the comming of the Parthians, the Hiberi were driuen out without ſtroke ſtriking: and the cities of the Armenians, Artaxata, &amp; Tigranocerta, ſubmitted themſelues to the yoke. But the ſharpe and hard winter, or elſe ſcarſitie of victuals &amp; other prouiſion, &amp; the ſicknes proceeding of both; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrained <hi>Vologeſes</hi> to forſake his pretended enterpriſe: and <hi>Rhadamistus</hi> inuadeth Armenia a freſh, hauing none to reſiſt him; more cruell then before, as againſt rebels, readie at all times to rebell if occaſion were offered. In ſo much that they, though accuſtomed to bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage: yet breake all patience, and beſiege the Kings houſe; <hi>Rhadamistus</hi> hauing no other refuge, then the ſwiftnes of his horſes, ſaued both himſelfe and his wife. But his wife being great with childe, endured the firſt flight ſo ſo, for feare of the enimie and loue of her husband: afterward by continuall haſte and ouer-much iogging and ſhaking, ſhe began to pray her husband, that with an honeſt death ſhe might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from the reproch of captiuitie. He at the firſt embraced her, comforted her, encouraged her; then admiring her ſtoutnes, then ſicke with griefe, leaſt leauing her behinde him, any ſhould enioy her: at laſt ouercome with loue; and being no babe in wicked atrempts, draweth his cymetter; and hauing giuen her a wound, drew her to the banke of Araxis, and committed her to the riuer, leaſt her bodie ſhould bee carried away; and poſteth himſelfe to Hyberia his fathers kingdome. In the meane time the ſhepheards eſpied <hi>Zenobia</hi> (for ſo was <hi>Rhadamistus</hi> wife cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) drawing breath and aliue, vpon the quiet ſhore of the riuer: and iudging her by the comelines of hir perſon of ſome noble race, bound vp hir wound, &amp; applied ſuch medicaments as the countrie affoordeth.

For the countrey was ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, that the Galileans were gouerned by <hi>Cumanus;</hi> and the Samaritans by <hi>Felix,</hi> enemies of olde; and now more then euer ſhewing themſelues through the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the gouernors. And therefore made inroades one againſt the other; ſet in companies to rob and ſpoile; laide ambuſhes: and ſometimes they met in battell, and carried the booties and ſpoiles to their gouernours.

Then <hi>Antiochus</hi> King of that quarter, vſing faire words to the countrey people, &amp; craft &amp; ſubtiltie towards the Captaine, when he had ſeuered the forces of the Barbaria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, hauing ſlaine <hi>Troſobor,</hi> &amp; a few of the ring-leaders; appeaſed the reſidue by cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy. The ſame time between the lake Fucinus &amp; the riuer Lyris, the better to behold the ſight &amp; magnificence of the ſpectacle, a mountaine was cut thorough, &amp; in the verie lake a ſea fight was repreſented. <hi>Augustus</hi> in times paſt had done the like, by making a ſtanding poole on this ſide Tibris, but with light boates &amp; fewer in number. <hi>Claudius</hi> armed galleies with three and foure oares on a

On the buildings about the lake ſtood certaine companies of footemen and troupes of horſemen of the Emperours guard, with fences before them to ſhoote with war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like inſtruments &amp; engines. The reſt of the lake, ſea ſouldiers occupied with couered ſhips: the ſhore and ſmall hill tops as it had beene a Theater, an infinite number of people filled, as well out of the townes adioyning, as the citie, through deſire of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the paſtime, or to pleaſe the Prince. He himſelfe in a rich and princely cote ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and <hi>Agrippina</hi> not farre off ſate aloft, in a garment wrought with gold. They fought although they were malefactors and condemned perſons, with great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and valour; and after many wounds, were parted &amp; hindered from killing one another. But after that the ſhew was ended, &amp; the water let out: the inſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie of the work which was not thruſt down, nor digged deepe ynough to the bottome, was diſcouered.

And at the mouth of the lake a banket prepared, droue them all into a great feare through the violent guſhing out of the water, which carried with it all that was by, and things farther off breaking downe, with the craſh and noiſe, ſtroke them all into amaze. Whereupon <hi>Agrippina</hi> taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of the Princes feare, rebuked <hi>Narciſſus</hi> who had charge of the worke, of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetuouſnes and theft.

The inhabitants of Rhodes are reſtored to their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, often taken from them, or confirmed, according as they had merited by ſeruice abroade, or demerited by ſedition at home. The Apameans ruined by an earth-quake were diſcharged of tribute for fiue yeeres. <hi>Claudius</hi> was incenſed to much cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie by <hi>Agrippinaes</hi> practiſes; who gaping after <hi>Statilius Taurus</hi> gardens, eſteemed verie rich, neuer ceaſed vntill ſhe had ouerthrowen him, <hi>Tarquitius Priſcus</hi> being his accuſer.

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:18166:91"/>
And leaſt thoſe words might ſeeme to haue eſcaped him by chaunce, a decree of Senate was inacted thereon, fuller and amplier then before any had beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. And <hi>Augustus</hi> of famous memorie had graunted, that all cauſes might be heard before the gentlemen which gouerned Egypt; and commaunded that the ſentences ſet down by them ſhould be kept, as if they had bin giuen by a magiſtrate of Rome. After that, in other Prouinces and in the citie, many things were graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which in times paſt belonged to the hearing onely of the Pretor. <hi>Claudius</hi> yeelded them all the right and iuriſdiction, for which there had beene ſuch wars and ſedition: as when the order of gentlemen by the Sempronian lawes, were eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the poſſeſſion of Iudicature; or when the Seruilian lawes on the other ſide, had giuen the Senate power iudicially to determine cauſes: and for which <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Sylla</hi> in times paſt more then all the reſt, made warres the one againſt the other. But in thoſe daies factions raigned among the citizens; and the conquerers bare publicke ſway, hauing all power in their hands. <hi>C. Oppius</hi> and <hi>Cornelius Balbus</hi> were the firſt, which with authoritie from <hi>Caeſar</hi> could handle conditions as well of peace, as of ware. It were to ſmall purpoſe to ſpeake of the Matians and Vedians after theſe, which were gentlemen of marke, and of noble families: ſeeing that <hi>Claudius</hi> hath made freed men, vnto whom he had committed the charge of his houſholde affaires equall to himſelfe, and to the lawes. After that, <hi>Caeſar</hi> propounded, whether thoſe of Cous ſhould be releaſed of tributes, alleaging manie things concerning their antiquitie: as that the Argiui and Ceus, <hi>Latonaes</hi> father, were the old inhabitants of the Ile; and that after by <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> arriuing there, the Arte of Phiſicke was brought in; a man highly eſteemed of poſteritie; naming them by their names, and in what age euery one of them flouriſhed. Further, hee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that <hi>Xenophon</hi> whoſe skill himſelfe vſed in Phiſicke, deſcended from the ſame familie; and that in regarde of his deſire, the Ile of Cous deuoted to the ſeruice of ſo great a god, ſhoulde be diſcharged of all tributes. Neither was it to be doubted, but there might be alleaged many merits of theirs, towards the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Rome; and many victories obtained by their alliance. But <hi>Claudius</hi> according to his accuſtomed facilitie and ſimplicitie, went not about to ſhadowe that with external helpes, which he had beſtowed in fauour of one alone. The Byzantines ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing obtained audience, deliuered how greeuous their impoſitions and tributes were; and deſired they might be releaſed; and ripped vp all reaſons they coulde, euen from the firſt alliance which they made with vs, when we warred againſt the king of Macedonia; who for baſenes of minde, and want of courage, was called the falſe <hi>Philip.</hi> How after that, they had ſent their power againſt <hi>Antiochus, Perſes, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtonicus:</hi> and howe they ſuccoured <hi>Antonie,</hi> in the wars againſt the pyrats: calling to minde likewiſe that which they offered <hi>Sylla,</hi> or <hi>Lucullus,</hi> or <hi>Pompey:</hi> then the late good turnes &amp; ſeruices done to the <hi>Caeſars,</hi> when they came into thoſe parts; where there is a moſt conuenient paſſage both by land and by ſea, for the captaines and armies; with al carriages of neceſſarie prouiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.

By that darke ſpeech, the Chalcedonians were pointed at; bicauſe that hauing firſt arriued in that place, not iudging aright of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſnes of it, made choiſe of the woorſt: for Byzance is ſeated in a fertile ſoile, and a plentifull ſea; bicauſe great abundance of fiſh going out of Pontus, and frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the rockes and ſtones vnder the water, forſaking the creekes of the other

ſhore, is brought all to theſe hauens. Whereby, firſt all the citie became rich and wealthie: but then oppreſſed with charges and impoſitions; and therefore intreated they might either haue an end or a meane of ſo heauie a burden. The Prince was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to do them good, alleaging that they were to be helped, as people wearied with late wars againſt the Thracians, and Boſphorans: and therupon they were exempted from tributes for fiue yeeres ſpace.</p>

               </head>
               <p>WHen <hi>M. Aſinius,</hi> and <hi>M. Acilius</hi> were Conſuls, a change of ſtate to the woorſe was portended, and foreknowne by many prodigious ſignes. For the enſignes and ſouldiers tents were burnt with fire from heauen. A ſwarme of Bees lighted on the top of the Capitol: monſters and children borne with two ſhapes: and a Sowe brought foorth a Pigge with talons of a hauke. It was accounted a prodigious matter, that the number of magiſtrates was ſo ſmall; a Queſtor, Aedill, Tribune, Pretor, and Conſull dying but a fewe monethes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But <hi>Agrippina</hi> of all others was moſt afeard, by reaſon of a word which <hi>Claudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> caſt foorth being drunke; which was, that it was fatall vnto him, firſt to beare the lewdnes of his wiues; then to puniſh them. Thereupon ſhe beſtirreth hir-ſelfe, and that with all ſpeed: but firſt hauing made away <hi>Domitia</hi> for light cauſe, and womens quarrels. For <hi>Domitia Lepida,</hi> being daughter to the yoonger <hi>Antonia,</hi> and neece to <hi>Augustus,</hi> &amp; coſen germane to <hi>Agrippina,</hi> and ſiſter to <hi>Gn. Agrippinaes</hi> firſt husband; thought hir-ſelfe to be of as great nobilitie as <hi>Agrippina,</hi> and as well deſcended: neither was there any great difference betweene them in beautie, age, and wealth. And being both vnchaſte, infamous, peremptory &amp; proud; they no leſſe hated one the other for their vices, then for the graces &amp; gifts of fortune. The ground of this bitter and deadly hate was, which ſhould haue more credite, and greater intereſt in <hi>Nero,</hi> the aunt or the mother. For <hi>Lepida</hi> had woone the yoong mans hart by gifts, and faire words: <hi>Agrippina</hi> contrariwiſe cruell, and threatning, coulde giue hir ſonne the Empire; but not indure that he ſhoulde rule. The crimes imputed to hir were, that ſhe went about to deſtroy the princes wife by incantatious, and deuiliſh inuocations: and that by not brideling and puniſhng hir ſwarmes of ſlaues in Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria, ſhe had diſturbed the quietnes of Italie: for theſe cauſes ſhe was commanded to die: <hi>Narciſſus</hi> mightily repining and grudging at it, who began more and more to ſuſpect <hi>Agrippina;</hi> and was ſaid to haue vttered vnto his neereſt friends, that he was ſure to die, whether <hi>Britannicus</hi> or <hi>Nero</hi> came to be Emperour. <hi rend="margQuotes">Yet he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued ſo much good at <hi>Caeſars</hi> handes, that he eſteemed more of the princes ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie then his owne life: <hi>Meſſallina</hi> and <hi>Silius</hi> had beene conuicted; the like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of accuſations will be offered againe, if <hi>Nero</hi> ſhoulde raigne. If <hi>Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus</hi> ſhould ſucceede, he had deſerued no fauour of him; and the whole houſe woulde bee ſhaken, and vtterlie ouerthrowne with the diueliſh deuiſes of his ſtepmother; and with more wicked practiſes, then if he had concealed the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicitie and vncleane life of his other wife: although the houſe be as ſhamefully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed by <hi>Pallas</hi> adulterie as then it was; becauſe no man ſhould doubt what ſmall accompt ſhe made of her credit, reputation, ſhame, bodie and all whatſoeuer, ſo as ſhe might rule and commaund. After he had vttered theſe or the like ſpeeches he embraced <hi>Britannicus,</hi> wiſhed he were come to ripe yeeres, lifteth vp his hands ſometimes to the gods, ſometimes to him;</hi> praying that he might grow in yeeres,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:18166:92"/>
driue out his fathers enemies, &amp; reuenge on the murtherers of his mother. <hi>Claudius</hi> in this great heape of cares was ſtroken with ſicknes, and to recouer his ſtrength with the temperatenes of the citie, &amp; wholeſomnes of the waters, went to Sinueſſa. Then <hi>Agrippina</hi> long before reſolued in her villanous deſeignments, and deſirous to haſten the occaſion offered, wanting no miniſters, began to thinke with her ſelfe what kinde of poiſon ſhe were beſt to vſe: for by a ſpeedie and quick working poiſon, ſhe feared leaſt her wickednes ſhould be diſcouered; yet if ſhe ſhould chooſe a lingering ſlow working one, leaſt <hi>Claudius</hi> drawing by little and little to his end, and vnderſtanding the treacherie, ſhould turne his minde, and ſhew loue and affection to his owne ſonne: in the end ſhe reſolued to thinke on ſome ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar thing which ſhould trouble his braines, and not worke his death ouer-haſtely. A ſchoolemiſtris of ſuch practiſes was choſen of purpoſe, called <hi>Locusta</hi> of late condemned for empoiſoning, and long reſerued among other inſtruments of ſtate. The poiſon was prepared by this womans skill, and the miniſter to giue it was <hi>Halotus,</hi> an Eunuch, one accuſtomed to carrie in and taſte his meate: all came af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward ſo cleerely to light, that the writers of thoſe times haue affirmed, that the poiſon was infuſed into a Muſhrome which <hi>Claudius</hi> tooke pleaſure to eate of; which then he perceiued not, either by reaſon of his blockiſhnes, or ouer-much quaffing of wine; and hauing a ſolublenes of bodie withall, it was thought the receipt would not worke his effect. Whereupon <hi>Agrippina</hi> greatly aſtonied, and fearing her vtter deſtruction, nothing regarding what enuie ſhe might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently incurre, conferreth with <hi>Xenophon</hi> the Phiſition, whoſe conſcience before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand ſhe had wrought to ſerue her turne. He as though he would help the Prince, endeuoring to vomit, was thought to haue put down his throte a feather dipped in a ſtrong and ſpeedie poiſon; knowing well that foule attempts are begun with danger, and accompliſhed with reward. In the meane time the Senate was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, and the Conſuls and Prieſts made vowes for the health of the Prince: and being alreadie dead, he was couered and cheriſhed with cloathes, whileſt things neceſſarie to aſſure the Empire vpon <hi>Nero</hi> were a preparing. And firſt of all <hi>Agrippina,</hi> as one ouercome with griefe, and ſeeking comfort, helde <hi>Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitus</hi> betweene her armes, calling him the very image of his fathers face, and by diuers policies entertained him, for feare he ſhould go out of the chamber: and with like practiſes helde <hi>Antonia</hi> and <hi>Octauia</hi> his ſiſters; and at euery dore and paſſage placed a ſtrong gard: and often gaue out that the Prince waxed better and better, to the end the ſoldier ſhould liue in good hope, and ſhe enterpriſe her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt at ſuch a time as the Magicians ſhould thinke luckie and proſperous. Then about the middeſt of the day, the third before the Ides of October, the Pallace gates being ſuddenly layd open, <hi>Nero</hi> accompanied with <hi>Burrhus,</hi> goeth forth to the cohort, who kept warde according to cuſtome; where at the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the captaine of the gard he was receiued with ſhoutes, and acclamations of ioy, and put into a Chariot. It is reported that ſome were in a doubt, &amp; looking about them, and asking where <hi>Britannicus</hi> was? then ſeeing no beginner of any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to the contrary, they followed that which was offered: and ſo <hi>Nero</hi> being brought to the reſt of the gard, and hauing made a ſpeech fit for the time, and promiſed a donatiue according to the example of his fathers largeſſe, was ſaluted Emperour. A decree of Senate confirmed the ſentence of the ſouldiers; neither was there any doubtmade of it in the prouinces. After that, honor due to the gods was ordained for <hi>Claudius,</hi> and the funerals as ſolemnely celebrated as when <hi>Augustus</hi> of famous memorie was buried, <hi>Agrippina</hi> imitating the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence

Silanus,</hi> feared reuenge; being a common ſpeech among the people that this man deſerued to be preferred to the Empire before <hi>Nero,</hi> yet ſcarſe out of his childhood, and hauing gotten it by wicked meanes: for he was a man of a ſetled age, ſincere and iuſt in his dealing, noble of birth, and which at that time was greatly eſteemed, deſcended of the <hi>Caeſars,</hi> being in the fourth degree to <hi>Augustus.</hi> This was the cauſe of his death, the miniſters being <hi>P. Celer,</hi> a gentleman of Rome, &amp; <hi>Aelius</hi> a freed man, both hauing charge of the Princes peculiar reuenues in Aſia. By them the poiſon was giuen the Proconſull in his meate, and that ſo openly, that it could not be denied. With no leſſe ſpeede <hi>Claudius</hi> freed man, <hi>Narciſſus</hi> (of whoſe iarring with <hi>Agrippina</hi> I haue alreadie ſpoken) was brought to his end, by hard impriſonment, and extreame neceſſitie, againſt the Princes will; whoſe vicious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors yet vnknowne, he did exceedingly well fit in couetouſnes and prodigalitie; and had gone forward in murders, if <hi>Afranius Burrhus,</hi> and <hi>Annaeus Seneca</hi> had not ſtayed them. Theſe two were the yong Emperors guides and gouernors; and in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall authoritie, well agreeing, bare equall ſtroke in diuers faculties. <hi>Burrhus</hi> in mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie diſcipline and grauitie of manners; <hi>Seneca</hi> in precepts of eloquence, and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous carriage; helping one the other in their charge, the eaſier to bridle the youths ſlipperie age with honeſt and lawfull pleaſures, if he contemned vertue. Their care was both alike in keeping vnder <hi>Agrippinaes</hi> fierce humor, who boyling with all deſires of wicked rule and dominion, had <hi>Pallas</hi> for her counſeller; by whoſe aduiſe <hi>Claudius</hi> through his inceſtuous marriage, &amp; pernicious adoption, wrought his own ruine. But <hi>Neroes</hi> diſpoſition was not to be ruled by a ſlaue; and <hi>Pallas</hi> with an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious arrogancie exceeding the moderation of a freed man, bred his owne diſlike. Neuertheleſſe, all honors were openly heaped vpon <hi>Agrippina,</hi> and the Tribune according to the order of ſeruice asking the watch-word, had this giuen him by <hi>Nero, Of the verie goodmother.</hi> The Senate decreed ſhe ſhould haue two ſergeants, &amp; <hi>Claudius</hi> a colledge of Prieſts called <hi>Claudians:</hi> &amp; withall, that he ſhould haue the funerals of a Ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſor, &amp; be after deified &amp; put amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the gods.

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:18166:93"/>
no man could forbeare laughing; although the oration compoſed by <hi>Seneca</hi> ſhewed the exquiſite skill of that mans pleaſant vaine, fitted and applied to the eares of that time. The old men (which were at leaſure to compare things paſt with the preſent) noted that <hi>Nero</hi> was the firſt Emperour that needed another mans elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. For <hi>Caeſar</hi> the Dictator, was equall with the famous orators: and <hi>Augustus</hi> had a readie fluent and eloquent ſpeech, ſuch as well becommed a Prince. <hi>Tiberius</hi> had great skill in waighing his words, vttered much in few words, but was obſcure of ſet purpoſe. Yea, <hi>C. Caeſars</hi> troubled minde hindered not his eloquence: neither wanted <hi>Claudius</hi> elegancie when he had premeditated. <hi>Nero</hi> in the beginning of his childiſh yeeres bent his liuely ſpirit to other matters, as to ingraue, to paint, to ſing, to mannage horſes, and ſometimes in compoſing a verſe he ſhewed ſome ſmattering of learning. When the funerals were ended, he entered the Curia, and hauing firſt ſpoken of the authoritie of the Lords of the Senate, loue and concord of the ſouldiers, he reckoned vp certaine deſeignments and precidents he intended to follow in the gouerning of the Empire, adding: that not hauing beene nuſled vp in ciuill warres, nor domeſticall diſcords, he would bring with him neither hatred, nor grudge, nor deſire of reuenge. Then he layd downe a platforme of his future regiment, eſpecially auoiding thoſe things, the hate whereof did yet freſhly boile in mens hearts; that he would not be the iudge of all matters, leaſt the accuſers and defendants being as it were ſhut vp in one houſe, the power of a few might haue full ſway to worke their will: there ſhould nothing be ſet at ſale in his court, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ambition; his houſe ſhould be deuided from the common wealth; the Senate ſhould retaine his old preheminence; Italie and publicke prouinces ſhould make their appearance before the Conſuls tribunall, and they giue audience like Lords of the Senate, and he himſelfe would looke to the armie committed to his charge. Neither did he faile in his promiſe. For many things were ordained by the arbitrement of the Senate: As that no man ſhould be bought for reward or gift to pleade a cauſe.

               <p>IN the end of the yeere, it was a common rumor that the Parthians had burſt out againe, and waſted Armenia, driuen out <hi>Rhadamistus,</hi> who hauing beene firſt King, and after a fugitiue, had then giuen vp this warre. Whereupon in the citie greedie of talke, they began to enquire, how the Prince which was yet ſcarſe paſt ſeuenteene yeeres of age, could either vndertake or acquit himſelfe of ſo great a burden: what helpe could be expected at his hands, who was led by a woman: whether battels and warres alſo, and beſieging of townes, and other duties of ſeruice, could be accompliſhed by his maiſters? <hi rend="margQuotes">Contrarywiſe others ſaid it had fallen out better, then if <hi>Claudius</hi> a weake and cowardly old man, ſhould haue beene

called to the labors of warre, readie to obey the commandements of his ſlaues. Yet <hi>Burrhus</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> had beene proued by experience of many matters: and what wanted to the Emperors full ſtrength? ſeeing that <hi>Cn. Pompeius</hi> at eighteene yeeres of age, and <hi>Caeſar Octauianus</hi> at nineteene, ſuſtained ciuil warres. Moſt things in high fortune are atchieued rather by good luck, conduct and counſell, then weapons and hands. That he ſhould giue an euident proofe, whether he vſed honeſt friends or not, if he would rather make choiſe of a notable and valiant captaine, enuie layd aſide, then a rich, graced and fauored by ambitious ſute.</hi> Whileſt the people thus diſcourſed, <hi>Nero</hi> commaunded a muſter to be made of the youth in the prouinces bordering vpon the Parthians, to ſupplie the legions of the Eaſt; and the legions themſelues to be planted neere vnto Armenia: and withall, wrote to the two old Kings, <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and <hi>Iocchus,</hi> to prepare their forces, and enter the bounds of Parthia, and make bridges ouer the riuer Euphrates: and gaue charge of leſſer Armenia to <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> and the Sophenian nation to <hi>Sohemus,</hi> honoring them both with royall marks and ornaments. And in very good time, it fell out that <hi>Vardanes</hi> ſonne began to rebell and beard <hi>Vologeſes,</hi> which cauſed the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians to depart Armenia, as though they woulde deferre the warre. But all things were made more then they were to the Senate, amplified by thoſe who gaue aduiſe that Proceſſions ſhould be made in honor of the Prince: and that that day he ſhould weare a triumphall garment, and enter into the citie ouant: and that his image of the ſame greatnes that <hi>Mars</hi> the reuengers was, ſhould be placed in the ſame temple; being beſides their ordinarie flatterie, ioyfull and glad, that he had made <hi>Domitius Corbulo</hi> gouernor of Armenia: perſwading themſelues, that the way was now made open to vertue. The forces of the Eaſt were ſo deuided, that part of the aid-ſouldiers with two legions ſhould remaine in the prouince of Syria, with the Lieutenant <hi>Quadratus Vinidius;</hi> and that the like number of citizens and allies ſhould be vnder <hi>Corbuloes</hi> charge, with other cohorts and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets of horſemen, which wintered in Cappadocia. The Kings which were confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate with the Romans, were warned to be in a readines as occaſion of warre ſhould require. But their affections were bent more vpon <hi>Corbulo,</hi> who to purchaſe fame (which in new enterpriſes is of great importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce) making a way with all ſpeede at Agas, a citie of Cilicia, met <hi>Quadratus;</hi> who was come ſo farre, leaſt if <hi>Corbulo</hi> ſhould haue entered into Syria to receiue the forces, all mens eyes would haue been caſt vpon him, being of a comely and tall ſtature, magnificall in words; and beſides his experience and wiſedome, in ſhew of vaine hope and promiſes, woon the people to what he luſted. In fine, both of them by meſſengers admoniſhed King <hi>Vologeſes</hi> to deſire rather peace then warre; and giuing hoſtages, continue the like reuerence to the people of Rome as his predeceſſors had done. And <hi>Vologeſes</hi> to make prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of warre with more aduantage, and ſuch as might match the Romans, or to remoue thoſe he ſuſpected as concurrents vnder the name of hoſtages; deliuereth the nobleſt of the Arſacides familie, whom <hi>Hostorius</hi> the Centurion ſent before by <hi>Vinidius</hi> for other occaſions receiued. <hi>Corbulo</hi> vnderſtanding this, commaundeth <hi>Arrius Varus,</hi> captaine of a companie of footemen, to goe and receiue them: from whence grew a quarrell betweene the Captaine and Centurion (which becauſe they would no longer be a ieſting ſtock to the ſtrangers) they referred to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrement of the pledges themſelues, and Lieutenants which conducted them: who preferred <hi>Corbulo</hi> before the other, partlie through the freſh renowne which was yet in euery mans mouth; and partly through a certaine inclination which the enemies themſelues bare him. Hereupon grew a iarre betweene the captaines,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:18166:94"/>
                  <hi>Vinidius</hi> complaining, that, that was taken from him which was compaſſed by his aduiſe: <hi>Corbulo</hi> proteſting on the contrarie part, that the king was neuer drawen to offer pledges, vntill that he being choſen captain of the warre, had turned his hopes into feare. <hi>Nero</hi> to ſet them at one, cauſed it to be publiſhed: that <hi>Quadratus</hi> &amp; <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulo,</hi> for their proſperous ſucceſſes, ſhoulde haue baies added to the bundle of rods, which was carried before great captaines of warre.

And although the LL. of the Senate had decreed, that the yeer ſhould begin on that day of December that <hi>Nero</hi> was borne: yet he retained the olde ceremonie of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning the yeere the Kalends of Ianuarie.

After this followed his lenitie towards <hi>Plautius Lateranus,</hi> who being remooued from the order of Senators, for adulterie committed with <hi>Meſſallina,</hi> was reſtored by him to his roome; binding himſelfe to continue this cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie, with many orations: which <hi>Seneca,</hi> to teſtifie in what honeſt precepts he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed him, or for a bragge of his owne wit, publiſhed by the voice of the prince. But <hi>Agrippinaes</hi> credit and authoritie by little and little began to waine: and <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> caſt a liking to a freed woman called <hi>Acte:</hi> two comely youthes, <hi>Otho</hi> deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from a Conſularie houſe; and <hi>Claudius Senecio,</hi> ſon of one of <hi>Caeſars</hi> freed men, being partakers of his counſels: his mother being at the firſt a ſtranger to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and in vaine at laſt ſtriuing to the contrarie. So far ſhe had poſſeſſed him by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute behauiour, and riot &amp; ſecret conuerſation, that his greateſt friends &amp; ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, ſeemed not to know it: conſidering that this woman ſatisfied his luſts, without the offence of any.

But <hi>Agrippina</hi> fretted and fumed that a freed woman ſhould beard her, &amp; a bond woman become her daughter in law; with other ſuch like womaniſh complaints; not hauing patience to ſee whether her ſonne woulde either repent or be filled: and the more opprobriouſlie ſhe vpbraided him, the more ſhe inflamed him; till at laſt ouercome with the rage of loue, he ſhaked off all dutie &amp; reuerence towards his mother, and committed himſelfe wholy to <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca.</hi> Amongſt his familiars was <hi>Annaeus Serenus,</hi> who faining loue to the ſame freed woman, couered &amp; cloked with his owne name, the firſt heats of this yoong prince: and ſuch things as the prince had beſtowed on hir by ſtealth, he openly aduouched to be his gifts. Then <hi>Agrippina</hi> changing her ſtile ſeeketh to win the yoong man by

faire alluring ſpeeches, offereth rather hir own chamber and boſome to hide thoſe things which his youth &amp; high fortune deſired. Yea ſhe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed her vntimely ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; &amp; offered him the vſe of al her wealth, which was little inferior to the Emperors: as before too ſeuere in correcting her ſonne; ſo now vnreaſonably humbled and caſt downe in courage. The which change did neither deceiue <hi>Nero,</hi> and gaue his neereſt friends cauſe of feare; and prayed him to beware of the trecherie of this woman, alwaies fell and cruell; and then falſe and diſſembling. <hi>Nero</hi> hauing by chaunce ſeene the wardrop where the apparell laye, which Princes wiues and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents were wont to ſhine in, made choiſe of a garment and iewels, and ſent them his mother moſt bountifully: ſeeing he ſent of his own the chiefeſt, and which by others were moſt of all deſired. But <hi>Agrippina</hi> exclaimeth that theſe ornaments were not ſo much giuen her to adorne and trim her ſelfe, as to exclude her from the reſt; and that her ſonne would diuide thoſe things with her, which came wholly from her. Neither wanted there ſome to carrie theſe ſpeeches, and make them woorſe then they were. Whereupon all ſuch growing odious vnto <hi>Nero,</hi> vpon whom this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans pride chiefly relied, diſplaceth <hi>Pallas</hi> from the charge which <hi>Claudius</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him; in which he carried himſelfe as if he had beene chiefe Lord and maſter of all.

For it was long before prouided that ſuch as were neereſt about <hi>Britannicus</hi> ſhould haue no regard either of honeſtie or faith.

The cuſtome was for Princes children to ſit with other noble mens, of the ſame age, in preſence of their neere kindred, with a ſpare diet at a table by themſelues: <hi>Britannicus</hi> there taking his repaſt, becauſe one of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitours did taſte his meates and drinkes, leaſt the cuſtome ſhould be omitted, or the villanie diſcloſed by both their deaths, this pollicie was deuiſed: A drinke yet not hurtfull, but very hote, and taſted of, was preſented to <hi>Britannicus;</hi> then that being refuſed by reaſon of the heate, the poiſon was powred into cold water, which ſo ſpread throughout all the parts of his bodie, that his ſpeech and ſpirits were at once taken from him. Thoſe which ſate about him were in a maze; the other which knew nothing ran away: but they which were of deeper iudgement ſtirred not, but looked <hi>Nero</hi> in the face; he leaning on the table like one that knew nothing of the practiſe, ſayd: he was often wont to fall into ſuch fits, through the falling ſicknes, which <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannicus</hi> had been greeuouſly afflicted with from his infancie; and that his ſight and ſpeech by little and little would come to him againe. But <hi>Agrippina</hi> was poſſeſſed with ſuch a great feare, &amp; an aſtoniſhment of ſenſes, although ſhe indeuored to hide it in countenance, that ſhe was eaſily iudged to be as ignorant of the fact, as <hi>Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus</hi> ſiſter <hi>Octauia:</hi> for ſhe ſaw that ſhe was bereaued of her greateſt ſtay, &amp; percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued well that it was a beginning of parricide. <hi>Octauia</hi> alſo although of yong yeeres, yet had learned to hide her griefe, her loue and all affections; and ſo after a little ſilence, the mirth of the banquet began againe. <hi>Britannicus</hi> bodie was burnt the ſame night he died, all funerall preparation hauing beene prouided before hand, which was but ſmall: neuertheles he was buried in Campus Martius, in ſuch ſtormes &amp; ſhowres, that the people beleeued they portended the wrath of the gods againſt ſo heinous a fact: which yet many excuſed in <hi>Nero,</hi> calling to minde the auncient diſcord of brothers in termes of ſoueraigntie, and how Kings admit no companions. Many writers of that time do deliuer, that <hi>Nero</hi> many dayes before had abuſed <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanicus</hi> bodie; and therefore that now his death could not ſeeme either vntimely or cruell, although it happened in the ſacred libertie of his table, his ſiſter not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſo much as time to imbrace him, haſtned before his enemies face againſt the laſt of <hi>Claudius</hi> bloud, and his bodie defiled before he was poiſoned. <hi>Caeſar</hi> excuſed the haſtines of the obſequies by an edict, ſaying, <hi rend="margQuotes">that the cuſtome of auncient times
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:18166:96"/>
was to celebrate in ſecret manner, and not openly dolefull and bitter funerals, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either ſolemnities or praiſes. As for himſelfe hauing loſt the ayde and comfort of his brother, the reſt of his hopes were anchored wholy in the common wealth: and that the Lords of the Senat &amp; people ſhould ſo much the more fauour &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that Prince, which was only left of the familie borne to rule and abſolute do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion.</hi> Then he enriched with gifts the chiefeſt of his friends. Neither wanted there ſome which blamed men pretending grauitie, that they deuided houſes and poſſeſſions, as though they had beene booties. Some thought the Prince forced them thereto, as guiltie of his fact, and hoping for pardon if he could bind vnto him the mightieſt and ſtrongeſt in power. But his mothers wrath could by no munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence be appeaſed, but ſhe embraced <hi>Octauia,</hi> and had often ſecret conference with her friends: and beſides her naturall couetouſnes, ſcraping money together of all hands as it were for ſome purpoſe on a pinch, ſhe entertained the Centurions and Tribunes with all courteſie: ſhe honored the names and vertues of the nobilitie which then were in towne, as though ſhe had ſought for a head to make a faction. <hi>Nero</hi> perceiuing that, commaundeth the gard of ſouldiers which heretofore was appointed to gard the Emperors wife, and now her, as his mother, to be taken from her; and certaine Germans which ſhe had, beſides the former appointed to gard her, to depart and be gone.

ſadnes, and declaring the whole order of <hi>Atimetus</hi> tale, did ſo terrifie and daunt the Prince, that he determined to kill not onely his mother, and <hi>Plautus;</hi> but diſcharge <hi>Burrhus</hi> of his office, as aduaunced by <hi>Agrippinaes</hi> fauour; and readie therefore to requite her with as good a turne. <hi>Fabius Rusticus</hi> reporteth, that letters were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to <hi>Caenina Tuſchus,</hi> to come and take charge of the guard; but that <hi>Burrhus</hi> credit was ſaued, and kept in his office by <hi>Senecaes</hi> meanes. <hi>Plinie</hi> and <hi>Cluuius</hi> ſeeme there was no doubt made of <hi>Burrhus</hi> loyaltie: and in verie deede <hi>Fabius</hi> inclineth much to the commendation of <hi>Seneca,</hi> as one of his preferment.

Then <hi>Burrhus</hi> hauing decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the accuſation, and the authors of it, vſed threatning termes: and <hi>Agrippina</hi> not forgetting her old fiercenes, returned him his anſwere: ſaying, <hi rend="margQuotes">I maruell not if <hi>Silana</hi> neuer hauing had childe, know not what the affections of mothers are: neither are children changed by their parents, as adulterers by ſhameleſſe women. Neither if <hi>Iturius</hi> and <hi>Caluiſius,</hi> hauing waſted their ſubſtance, beſtow this their laſt labour in vndertaking this accuſation: therefore am I to ſuſtaine the infamie of parricide, or <hi>Caeſar</hi> haue ſcruple of conſcience, that I would commit it: as for <hi>Domitia</hi> I would thanke her for the hate ſhe beareth me, if ſhe would likewiſe in good will and loue towards my <hi>Nero,</hi> ſtriue with me. Now by her concubine <hi>Atimetus,</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi> the ſtage player ſhe doth as it were compoſe fables for the ſtage.

Or elſe let ſome one be brought foorth to make it appeere, that I haue practiſed with the citie-cohorts; corrupted the loyaltie of the Prouinces; or ſollicited bond-men, or freedmen to rebellion. I might haue liued if <hi>Britannicus</hi> had beene ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne: but if <hi>Plautus</hi> or ſome other ſhould get the rule of the common-wealth, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth there ſhould want accuſers to laye to my charge, not wordes ſometimes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduiſedly eſcaped thorough feruencie of loue; but ſuch crimes alſo from which I could not be acquited, but as a mother by hir ſon.</hi> The aſſiſtance moued with theſe ſpeeches and endeuoring to appeaſe her anger; ſhe requireth to ſpeake with her ſonne: before whom ſhe ſpake nothing in defence of her innocencie, as if ſhe had diſtruſted; or of her benefits, as to vpbrayd him: but obteined reuenge of her accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers; and rewards for hir friends. The charge and office of prouiſion of corne was giuen to <hi>Senius Rufus;</hi> the commiſſion of plaies which <hi>Caeſar</hi> was a preparing, to <hi>Aruntius Stella:</hi> Aegypt to <hi>C.

and affinitie with <hi>Claudius,</hi> whoſe ſonne in lawe he was by marriage of <hi>Antonia,</hi> to the Empire.

Neither was <hi>Pallas</hi> innocencie ſo gratefull, as his pride inſupportable: for when ſome of his freed men were ſaide to haue beene priuie to the practiſe; he made anſwer that in his houſe he appointed nothing to be done, but with a nod of his head or hand; or by writing, if he had much to ſay, leaſt if he ſhoulde haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnto them, he ſhould ſeeme to haue made them his fellowes. <hi>Burrhus</hi> although accuſed, yet gaue ſentence among the iudges. <hi>Paetus</hi> the accuſer was baniſhed, and the writings burnt, by which he went about to renewe the recordes of the treaſurie alreadie cancelled.

                  <hi>VI. Neroes</hi> diſorders: the caſe of the franchiſed debated: an order for certaine magistrates.</head>
               <p>Q. <hi>Voluſius</hi> and <hi>P. Scipio</hi> being Conſuls, there was peace abroad, &amp; filthie la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciuiouſnes at home: during which, <hi>Nero</hi> gadded vp &amp; down the ſtreetes, to infamous brothell houſes, &amp; by-corners, in ſlaues attire, to be vnknown; accompanied with ſuch as ſnatched away wares from mens ſtales, wounded ſuch as met them, and with ſuch ſmall regard whome, that <hi>Nero</hi> himſelfe hath receiued and carried away blowes and marks on the face. And when it was knowne to be <hi>Caeſar</hi> which played thoſe pranks, the diſorder grew greater againſt both men and women of accompt; and with like licentiouſnes abuſing <hi>Caeſars</hi> name, many practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſame inſolencies, gathered together in particular companies, and ſo ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the night as it had been in taking a towne, and captiuitie. One <hi>Iulius Montanus</hi> a Senator, who had not yet taken vpon him the dignitie, by chaunce coping with the Prince in the darke, and rudely thruſting him backe as he offered him violence; then knowing him, and crauing pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, was inforced to die, as though therby he had reproched him of folly. <hi>Nero</hi> more wary and fearefull after that, went not without a rabble of ſouldiers and fencers; which medled not at the firſt, and whileſt the prince made his party good: but after, if he were ouermatched, by ſuch as he abuſed, they layd hands immediately on their weapons. He turned the diſordered licence at plaies, and part-taking in fauor of ſtage players, almoſt to a mutinie, by giuing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punitie and rewards, himſelfe priuily or for the moſt part openly looking on; vntill the people growing to ſedition, and fearing greater ſtirres, no other remedie was found then to expell the ſtage-players out of Italie, and place a gard of ſouldiers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine on the theater. At the ſame time the deceit and vngratefull behauior of freed men was debated in Senat; and inſtant ſute made that the patrons might haue authoritie to reuoke the freedome giuen to ſuch as deſerued it not: for many there were of that opinion. But the Conſuls not daring to determine the matter; without the priuitie of the Prince; yet wrote the common conſent vnto him: <hi rend="margQuotes">And that he ſhould be the author of the decree, few being of a contrary opinion, and ſome grudging that the irreuerence of their late bondmen, by reaſon of libertie was
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:18166:97"/>
growen to that, that they cared not whether they carried themſelues towards their patrons dutifully or not: nothing at all waying what they ſayd vnto them: yea, bende their fiſts towards them; thruſt and elbow ſuch as would haue any lawe made to bridle them. For what other redreſſe was there graunted vnto patrons of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, but to baniſh his freed man aboue twentie miles off, to the coaſt of Campa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia? all other actions were indifferent and equall to both. Some weapon therefore ſhould be giuen the patron, which the freed man ſhould not deſpiſe. Neither could it ſeeme hard if the manumiſed ſhould with the ſame obedience keepe their liberty, by which they got it. And ſuch as were openly conuicted of crimes, were woorthily brought againe to ſeruitude; that ſuch might be brideled by feare, whom benefits could not change. Some ſpake to the contrarie, ſaying: That, that fault of a fewe ſhould be preiudiciall but to themſelues; and not derogate from the priuiledges, common to them all; bicauſe it was a bodie farre ſpred abroad. From them were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken many Tribes and Decuries, fit men for magiſtrates &amp; prieſts, and citie cohorts: and many gentlemen and Senators could deriue no beginning but from thence. If the freed men ſhould be ſeuered from the reſt, the number of the free borne woulde appeere very ſmall. Not without cauſe our aunceſtors when they diuided the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens into degrees and callings, left libertie in common. Yea they had inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted two kindes of manumiſing their bondmen, bicauſe it might be in their choiſe to repent or yeelde newe fauour. Thoſe whome the patron did not manumiſe <hi>Vindicta</hi> before the magiſtrate, remained ſtill as it were in the bonds of ſeruitude. That eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man ſhould looke into the merits of his ſlaue; and graunt that ſlowly, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once giuen coulde not be taken away.</hi> This opinion caried it away. And <hi>Caeſar</hi> wrote to the Senate that they ſhould priuately examine the cauſe of the freed men, as oft as they were accuſed by their patrons: and derogate nothing from the whole bodie of them. Not long after, <hi>Paris</hi> the late bondman was taken from <hi>Domitia, Neroes</hi> aunte, vnder colour of ciuill lawe; not without a diſgrace to the Prince: by whoſe commandement iudgement of free condition was giuen him. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe there remained a certaine ſhew of a free common-wealth. For a contention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing growen betweene <hi>Vibullius</hi> the Pretor, and <hi>Antistius</hi> tribune of the people, for releaſing out of priſon certaine vnruly fauourers of the Stage-plaiers, committed by the Pretor: the Lords of the Senate approoued the Pretors fact, and blamed <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtius</hi> boldneſſe. Withall the Tribunes were forbidden to vſurpe any thing belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Pretors or Conſuls authoritie; or call ſuch before them out of Italie, whoſe right was to be determined by law. <hi>L. Piſo</hi> Conſull elect added further, that they ſhould not exerciſe their authoritie in puniſhing of any in their own houſes: &amp; that the Quaeſtors of the treaſury ſhould not enter into record before foure months were paſt, the mercements adiudged by them: and that in the mean time it might be lawfull to ſpeake againſt them; and the Conſuls determine the matter. The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Aediles is alſo reſtrained, and order ſet down how much the Curules, and the people might take to pawne, and how farre they might puniſh. Thereupon <hi>Heluidius Priſcus,</hi> Tribune of the people, ſhewed his priuate grudge againſt <hi>Obultro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Sabinus</hi> Quaeſtor of the treaſury, as though he had too ſeuerely enforced the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of open ſales of goods againſt the poore. Then the Prince transferred the records of publicke debts from the Quaeſtors to the Prouoſts of the citie: albeit, the forme of that office hath beene diuerſly vſed, and often chaunged. For <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi> gaue the Senate licence to chooſe the Prouoſtes; then canuaſing of voices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuſpected, they were drawne by lot out of the number of the Pretors. Neither did that long continue, becauſe the lot fell oft vpon the vnmeeteſt. Then <hi>Claudius</hi>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:18166:98"/>
reſtored againe the Quaeſtors to the office, and beſtowed extraordinarie promotion vpon them, leaſt for feare of offence they ſhould be ſlacke in their dutie. But bicauſe there wanted authoritie of age in manie which were in that office, as being the firſt they were poſſeſſed of; <hi>Nero</hi> choſe ſuch as had beene Prouoſtes, and tried by long experience. <hi>Vipſanius Lenas</hi> was condemned vnder the ſame Conſuls, for behauing himſelfe too rauenouſly in the Prouince of Sardinia. <hi>Cestius Proculus</hi> was acquited of extorſion, his accuſers letting fall the ſute. <hi>Clodius Quirinalis,</hi> Captaine of the galli-ſlaues at Rauenna, accuſed for moleſting Italie with riot and crueltie, as the leaſt of all nations, preuented his condemnation by poiſoning himſelfe. <hi>Aminius Rebius</hi> a principall man for the skill of the lawes and of great wealth, eſcaped the griefes of ſickely olde age by letting himſelfe blood in the vaines, although he was thought to be too cowardly to kill himſelf; by reaſon he was giuen too effeminately to luſtes.

                  <hi>NEro</hi> being the ſecond time Conſull, and <hi>L.

Capua and Nuceria both colonies, were reenfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with a ſupplie of old ſouldiers. There was beſtowed a gift of <note n="*" place="margin">Sixe ſhil. 3. d.</note> fortie ſeſterces by powle to the people, and <note n="*" place="margin">About 31250. pound.</note> foure hundred thouſand ſeſterces to the publike trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurie to maintain the people faithful vnto him. The tribute of the fift, &amp; of the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth for the ſale of ſlaues was releaſed in ſhew rather then in deed: for when the ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler was commaunded to pay it, he enhanſed the price ſtill to the buiers loſſe. <hi>Caeſar</hi> commaunded by an edict, that no magiſtrate, procurator of any prouince, ſhould ſet foorth a ſhew of fencers, or wilde beaſts, or any other paſtime. For heretofore the ſubiects were no leſſe endomaged by ſuch-liberalities, then by taking their money from them, whileſt they cloaked with fauor gotten by ſuch ſpectacles, their faults committed by robbing the people. A decree of Senate was made as well for reuenge as ſecuritie, that if any man had been ſlaine by his bondmen, thoſe alſo who being manumiſed by teſtament, &amp; continued in the ſame houſe, ſhould be puniſhed as the other bondmen. <hi>L. Varius</hi> ſomtimes Conſull was reſtored to his dignitie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued before for couetous dealing and extortion. And <hi>Pomponia Graecina</hi> a noble woman, and wife to <hi>Plautius,</hi> who returned with a ſmall triumph out of Britannia, and accuſed of ſtrange ſuperſtition, was remitted to the iudgement of her husband; and he according to the auncient cuſtome, in the preſence of her neereſt kindred, heard her cauſe of life and death, and pronounced her innocent. This <hi>Pomponia</hi> liued long, and in continuall ſorrow: for after that <hi>Iulia, Druſus</hi> daughter was murdered by <hi>Meſſallinaes</hi> trecherie, ſhe was not ſeene for forty yeers but in mourning apparel, and very ſad &amp; doleful. Which ſhe might lawfully do whileſt <hi>Claudius</hi> raigned, &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward turned to her glory. Many citizens were accuſed that yeere, of which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>P Celer</hi> being one, at the information of the inhabitants of Aſia, becauſe <hi>Caeſar</hi> could not acquit him, he prolonged his cauſe till he died of age.

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:18166:98"/>
cloaked all other villanies vnder the greatnes of that lewd action.

Great ſuings preuailed ſo much for <hi>Eprius Marcellus,</hi> of whom the Lycians demaunded reſtitution, that ſome of the accuſers were baniſhed, as though they had indangered an innocent man.</p>

To <hi>Aurelius Cotta</hi> likewiſe, and <hi>Haterius Antoninus,</hi> the Prince graunted that an annuall ſum of money ſhould be giuen, although they had waſted riotouſly the wealth their anceſtors had left them. In the beginning of that yeere, the warre which was drawne at length with ſoft and milde beginnings vntill then, betweene the Parthians and the Romans for obtaining of Armenia, was nowe hotly purſued: becauſe <hi>Vologeſes</hi> would neither ſuffer his brother <hi>Tiridates</hi> to be depriued of the kingdome in which he had inueſted him, nor that he ſhould enioy it as a gift from another Lord; and <hi>Corbulo</hi> thought it woorthie of the greatnes of the people of Rome to recouer that which by <hi>Lucullus</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> had beene once got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. The Armenians being doubtfull, and faithfull to neither ſide, inuited both: yet by the ſite of their countrey and conformitie of conditions, being more neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Parthians, and intermingled with them by mariages, and not knowing what libertie was, inclined rather to that ſeruitude. But <hi>Corbulo</hi> had more adoe with the ſlothfulnes of the ſouldiers, then perfidiouſnes of the enimies: for the legions remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from Syria, by a long peace grown lazie and idle, could hardly endure the labor and paines of the Roman diſcipline. Certaine it was there were old ſouldiers in that campe, which had neuer kept watch nor ward; a rampire or trench they gazed at, as at a new and ſtrange deuiſe: without head-peeces; without curaſſes; neate and fine; hunting after gaine; hauing ſpent all their ſeruice in townes. Whereupon the olde and feeble being diſmiſſed, he deſired a ſupplie, which was had out of Galatia and Cappadocia. And to them was added a legion out of Germanie with wings of horſemen, and all the armie kept in campe; although the winter were ſo hard, and the earth ſo couered with yce that they could not pitch their tents, vnleſſe they had firſt digged the ground. Manie of their limmes grew ſtarcke with extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of cold; and many died in keeping the watch. And there was a ſouldier noted carriyng a faggot, whoſe hands were ſo ſtiffe frozen, that ſticking to his burden, they fell from him as though they had beene cut from his armes. <hi>Corbulo</hi> ſlightly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parailed, bare headed, was with them when they marched; when they laboured, praiſed the ſtout; comforted the feeble; and gaue example vnto them all. Then bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many refuſing to endure the hardnes of the ſeaſon, &amp; ſuch rigor of diſcipline, forſooke him; he ſought a redreſſe by ſeueritie: for he did not pardon the firſt and ſecond fault as in other armies, but he ſuffered death preſently who forſooke his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne:
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:18166:99"/>
which by experience proued more profitable, then clemencie. For fewer forſooke that campe, then where there was much mercie ſhewen. In the meane ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>Corbulo</hi> hauing kept the legions in campe vntill the ſpring, and diſpoſed the ayd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cohorts in conuenient places, charged them not to giue the onſet. The charge of the garriſons he committed to <hi>Pactius Ophitus,</hi> once Captaine of the firſt enſigne: who although he wrote to <hi>Corbulo</hi> that the Barbarians were careleſſe and diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and a fit occaſion offered of atchieuing ſome exploite; yet he was commaunded to keepe within his garriſon, and expect greater power. But breaking his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement when he ſaw a few troupes of horſemen iſſue out of a caſtle hard by, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfully demaund battell; he encountered the enimie, and went away with the loſſe. And thoſe which ſhould haue ſeconded them, terrified with that diſcomfiture, fled as faſt as they could euerie man to his hold; which to <hi>Corbulo</hi> was an exceeding griefe. Who rebuking <hi>Pactius</hi> and the Captaines, and the ſouldiers, commaunded them all to pitch their tents out of the campe: and there kept them in that diſgrace, vntil they were deliuered by the interceſſion &amp; ſute of the whole armie. But <hi>Tiridates</hi> beſides his own followers, ſuccoured by his brother <hi>Vologeſes;</hi> not now by ſtelth, but with open warre moleſteth <hi>Armenia,</hi> ſpoiling all ſuch he thought faithfull to vs: and if any forces were brought againſt him, he deluded them, by flying hither and thither, terrifiyng more by fame then fight. <hi>Corbulo</hi> therefore ſeeking occaſion to ioyne battell, but in vaine; and conſtrained to make war now in one place, now in another, as the enimy did; ſeuered his forces, to the end that the Lieutenants &amp; Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines might inuade diuers places at once. Withall, he aduertiſed King <hi>Antiochus</hi> to ſet on the gouernment next adioyning to him. For <hi>Pharaſmanes,</hi> his ſonne <hi>Rhadamistus</hi> being ſlaine, as a traitor towardes him, to teſtifie his loyaltie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs, ſhewed more willingly his inueterate hatred againſt the Armenians. Then the Iſichians, a nation neuer before confederate with vs, being nowe brought to our ſide, inuaded the hardeſt paſſages of Armenia; whereby all <hi>Tiridates</hi> deſeignments were croſſed. He ſent Embaſſadors to expoſtulate in his owne, and the Parthians name, <hi rend="margQuotes">Why hauing of late giuen hoſtages, and renewed amitie, which opened the way to new benefites, he ſhould be driuen from the auncient poſſeſſion of Armenia? therefore <hi>Vologeſes</hi> was not yet moued to warre, becauſe he had rather debate the matter by reaſon, then by force. But if they would perſiſt in warre, the Arſacides ſhould neither want courage nor fortune, often experimented to the loſſe of the Romans.</hi> Hereupon <hi>Corbulo</hi> knowing well that <hi>Velogeſes</hi> was troubled with the Hircanians rebellion, perſwadeth <hi>Tiridates</hi> to deale with <hi>Caeſar</hi> by intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; that he might obtaine a firme poſſeſſion of a kingdome without bloudſhed; if leauing of a long and ſlow hope, he would imbrace that which was preſent and more ſure. Then they reſolued, becauſe by entercourſe of meſſengers they profited nothing, for the full knitting vp of peace, to appoint time and place for a parlie. <hi>Tiridates</hi> ſayd, that he would come with a thouſand horſe for his gard: how many of whatſoeuer ſort of ſouldiers <hi>Corbulo</hi> ſhould bring, he weighed it not; ſo as they came without curaſſes &amp; helmets, as a better ſhew of peace. The barbarous treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie was palpable to all men, much more to an old circumſpect captaine: therfore a ſmall number was limited on one part, and a greater permitted to the other, that the treaſon might be the better effected: for to oppoſe againſt practiſed horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men archers, vnarmed men, the multitude would auaile nothing. Yet <hi>Corbulo</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king as though he had not perceiued the treaſon, anſwered, that publick affaires would better be debated in the face of both the whole armies. And for the purpoſe choſe a place whereof the one part had hils of an eaſie aſcent fit for ranks of foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:18166:99"/>
the other ſtretched out into a plaine, conuenient to diſplay troupes of horſemen. And the day agreed on, <hi>Corbulo</hi> appeared firſt in this order: He placed the cohorts of allies, and ſuccours ſent by Kings, in the wings: and in the middle, the ſixt legion; among which he had intermingled three thouſand of the third, ſent for by night from other garriſons, with one enſigne, as if all were but one legion. <hi>Tiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi> the day being well ſpent, ſhewed himſelfe aloofe, where he might better be ſeene then heard: ſo the Romaine captaine without parlie, commaunded his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to depart euery man to his owne camp. The King either ſuſpecting fraude, becauſe our men went at once to diuers places, or to intercept our prouiſion of victuals, comming from the ſea of Pontus, and the towne Trapezunt, maketh away with all ſpeede. But he could not hinder the comming of the victuals, becauſe it was brought through mountaines poſſeſſed by our owne garriſons; and <hi>Corbulo</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the warre ſhould draw to an end, and the Armenians conſtrained to defend their owne, goeth about to raze their Caſtels.</p>

Then ſurueying his forces, and ſeeing all things in a readines for the aſſault, incourageth his ſouldiers to vnneſtle the vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond enemie, neither readie for peace nor warre; acknowledging by his fleeing away his perfidiouſnes and cowardiſe; and ſo win at once both glory and wealth. After this, hauing deuided his armie into foure parts, he lead ſome cloſe and thicke ranked together, for a target fence to vndermine and beate downe the rampire: others to ſcale the walles: others to let flee fire and darts out of engins of warre: the ſling-caſters and ſtone-throwers had a place appointed them, from whence they might a farre off throw pellets of yron and ſtone, that the beſieged might haue no refuge or comfort of one another, all places being full of like feare. The courage of the aſſailants was ſo great, that within the third part of the day the wals were naked of defendants; the gates broken downe; the fortreſſe ſcaled; and all of lawfull yeeres put to the ſword; no one ſouldier loſt on our ſide, and verie few hurt: the weake and vnable people were ſold in a portſale and made ſlaues; the reſt of the bootie fell to the Conquerours ſhare. The Lieutenant and camp-maſter had the like fortune; three caſtles taken in one day; the reſt for feare and by conſent of the inhabitants yeelded: which encouraged the Romans to ſet on Artaxata the chiefe towne of the countrey. Yet the legions were not brought the next way, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that paſſing the riuer Araxis which waſheth the wals, by the bridge they ſhould haue come vnder the danger of blowes; but went ouer a farre off at broade foordes. But <hi>Tiridates</hi> aſſailed with ſeare and ſhame, leaſt if he ſhould ſuffer the beſieging, he might ſeeme not to be able to ſuccour it; if hinder it encomber himſelfe and his horſemen in dangerous and difficult places, reſouled in the end to ſhew his armie in battell aray, and a day appointed, giue the onſet; or making as though he would flee, dreſſe an ambuſh. Whereupon on a ſudden he enuironeth the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans; our Captaine not ignorant thereof, who had marſhalled his armie in ſuch aray, that it might both march on, and fight. On the right ſide the third legion; on the left the ſixt marched; in the middle a companie choſen out of the tenth; the carriages betweene the rankes, and a thouſand horſemen in the rereward, with
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:18166:100"/>
commaundement that they ſhould reſiſt and make head againſt the enimie if they paſſed in; but if they ſled, not to follow. In the wings went the footemen archers with the reſidue of the horſemen; the left wing ſtretched ſomewhat longer to the bottome of the hils; that if the enimie ſhould enter on them, he ſhould haue beene receiued both in the front and middle. <hi>Tiridates</hi> on the contrarie ſide, came about the Romans freely; yet not within a darts caſt; now threatning; now making as though he were afraide; and ſo retiring, to ſee whether we would open or breake our rankes to follow, and ſo entrap vs being ſcattered. But not ſeeing any thing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered, nor any ranke broken by raſhnes; and onely one vnder Captaine of horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ventring boldlier then the reſt to haue beene ſlaine with an arrow, and the reſt by his example to obey, the night being almoſt come, he departed. <hi>Corbulo</hi> hauing pitched his campe in the ſame place, conſidered with himſelfe, whether he ſhould goe by night to Artaxata, and beſiege it with light and vncumbered legions, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that <hi>Tiridates</hi> had retired thither. Then the ſcouts hauing brought intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence that the King had taken a longer iourney, doubtfull whether to the Medes or Perſians, he ſtaied vntill it was day: ſending before a companie lightly armed, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiron the wals, and beginne the aſſault a farre off. But the towneſmen opening the gates of their owne accord, yeelded themſelues and all they had to the Romans; whereby their liues were ſaued. But Artaxata was burnt and raced to the ground, becauſe it could not be kept without a ſtrong garriſon, by reaſon of the compaſſe of the wals; and our forces were not ſo great that we could leaue there a ſufficient gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, and withall, keepe the field: or if ſhe ſhould be left ſtanding and vngarded, there would be neither profit nor glorie that ſhe had beene taken. There is a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle reported, as it were by ſome diuine power happened: for all things out of the houſes were lightened by the ſun; but that which was inuironed with the wals, was on ſuch a ſudden couered with a darke cloud &amp; ſeparated with lightning, that it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the will of the gods was, it ſhould be deſtroyed. Hereupon <hi>Nero</hi> was ſaluted Emperor, &amp; proceſſions made by decree of Senat; and images &amp; triumphall arches ſet vp, and the Conſulſhip continued on him: and ordained that the day the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie was gained, the day of the newes, the day wherin they talked of it in Senat ſhould be kept holie, &amp; other ſuch like; ſo far beyond meaſure, that <hi>C.

He had beene Queſtor to <hi>Germanicus;</hi> and <hi>Seneca,</hi> an adulterer of his houſe. Was it to be iudged a greeuouſer offence to receiue a ſuters reward freely offered for a mans honeſt trauell, then to defile the beds of Princes wiues? with what wiſedome, with what precepts of Philoſophers within foure yeeres friendſhip with the King, had he gotten <note n="*" place="margin">About 2343750. lib.</note> three thouſand times three hundred thouſand ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterces?

Why was there no other choſen to ſpeake for that cruell vnchaſt dame? the inſtruments of cruell actions are to be puniſhed, when as hauing receiued the reward of their lewdnes, yet go about to lay it to others charge. Therefore part of his goods being taken from him (for part was left his ſonne and his neece, and that alſo was excepted which was giuen them by their mothers or grandfathers teſtament) he was baniſhed into the Ilands of Balea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, neuer loſing courage either in the time of his danger, or after condemnation. And it is reported that he ſuffered that ſeparation from company, liuing both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundantly and delicately.

               <p>THe ſame yeere, an vntemperate life, no leſſe infamous then the former; was a beginning of greater miſchiefes in the common wealth. There was in the citie one <hi>Sabina Poppaea,</hi> daughter of <hi>T.

This woman was graced with all things ſauing an honeſt mind: for her mother ſurpaſſing other women of her time in beautie, gaue her both glorie &amp; beautie: wealth ſhe had ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to maintain her no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie: her ſpeech affable &amp; gratious, nor no groſſe wit; but knowing wel how to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend modeſtie, &amp; liue laſciouſly: ſhe came little abroad, and then part of her face couered with a vaile; either not to fill the eie of the beholder, or bicauſe it beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>med her beſt: of her credite regard ſhe had neuer; making no differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betweene hir huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands &amp; adulterers: neither ſubiect to her owne will, nor anothers; but where profit was offered, thither ſhe carried her affection. This woman then being wife to <hi>Rufus Criſpinus,</hi> a gentleman of Rome, by whom ſhe had a ſonne; <hi>Otho</hi> ſeduced through his youth &amp; riot; &amp; bicauſe he was moſt inwarde in friendſhip with <hi>Nero:</hi> It was not long but they ioined marriage to adulterie. <hi>Otho</hi> either bicauſe he was vncircumſpect in loue, or bicauſe he would enflame the princes luſt; praiſed his wiues beautie and comely feature in his preſence; that both enioying one woman, his credite and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie might by that bond grow greater. He hath bin often heard to ſay, as he hath riſen from banquetting with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that he woulde go to her in whom was all beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and nobilitie; and to her who kindling all mens deſire, was able to make them moſt happie. Through theſe and the like prouocations, there was no long delaie made. <hi>Nero</hi> then finding acceſſe vnto her, <hi>Poppaea</hi> at the firſt by allurements and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, began to inueigle him; ſaying, that ſhe was not able to withſtande his loue, and that ſhe was ouercome with his beautie. Then perceiuing the princes luſt to be growen hot; ſhe began to grow proud; and if ſhe entertained him aboue a night or two, it was all ſhe coulde affoorde him; ſaying, ſhe was a married wife, and that ſhe could not abandon her husband as being bounde vnto <hi>Otho,</hi> for his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of cariage and behauiour, which fewe came neere vnto: that he was in courage and demeanour magnificent; and in all reſpects woorthie of higheſt fortune. As for <hi>Nero</hi> vſing a bond-ſlaue for his concubine, and tied to Actes familiaritie, he had learned nothing of that ſeruile companie, but baſenes and niggardice. <hi>Otho</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this was barred of the accuſtomed familiaritie with the Prince; then of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie and retinue: and laſt of all, leaſt he ſhould be his concurrent in the citie, he
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:18166:101"/>
made him gouernour of the prouince of Portingall. Where he liued vntill the ciuill wars, not as before diſorderly; but honeſtly and vncorruptly, as one looſly giuen when he had little to do; but in office and rule more ſtayed and temperate. All this while <hi>Nero</hi> ſought to cloke his vitiouſnes and licentious life. Afterward he beganne to be iealous of <hi>Cornelius Syllaes</hi> dull and heauie diſpoſition, interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it contrarie to that which it was, deeming him a craftie and ſubtle deſſembler. Which iealouſie <hi>Graptus</hi> a freed man of <hi>Caeſars</hi> by age, and experience and time, vntill then well practiſed in Princes houſes, augmented with this lie. The Miluian bridge in thoſe daies was notorious for a haunt, of diſſolute and vnruly perſons in the night. Whither <hi>Nero</hi> reſorted alſo to inioy his licentious pleaſures more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, being out of the towne: and returning backe by the Flaminian way; <hi>Graptus</hi> put him in the head that there had bin wait laid for him, which he eſcaped by deſtinie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he went another way to <hi>Sallustius</hi> gardens, &amp; falſly accuſed <hi>Sylla</hi> to be the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor thereof: Bicauſe that ſome of the Princes ſeruitors returning that way by chaunce, were, by ſome licentious behauiour of youth, which in that place was verie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, put in greater fright than danger. Yet there was no one of <hi>Syllaes</hi> ſeruitours or vaſſals knowen. His faint hart and not daring any enterpriſe being well knowen to be farre from any ſuch fact: yet neuertheleſſe as though he had been conuicted, he was commaunded to depart his countrey, and liue within the wals of Marſiles. Vnder the ſame Conſuls the Embaſies of the Puteolanians were heard, which the Senators on one ſide, and the communaltie on the other, ſent to the Senate: the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators charging the communaltie with inſolencie; and the people charging the magiſtrates &amp; chiefe gentlemen with couetuouſnes. And when the ſedition was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie growen to throwing of ſtones, and threatning to fire one another, and like to drawe on murder and war, <hi>C. Caſsius</hi> was choſen to order the matter; but knowing that they could not endure his ſeueritie at his requeſt, that care was committed to the brothers the Scribonians, with a band of the Emperours guarde: through the terrour of which, and puniſhment of a fewe, the towneſmen were ſet at quietnes againe. I would not ſpeake of the very common decree of Senate, by which the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Syracuſa was licenſed to exceede the number prefixed in the ſhew of Fencers: If <hi>Paetus Thraſea</hi> had not ſpoken againſt it and giuen matter vnto backbiters to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend his iudgement: For ſaid they, <hi rend="margQuotes">if he beleeued that the common-wealth wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the libertie of Senators, why did he meddle in ſuch trifles? He ſhould rather haue perſwaded or diſſwaded matters of warre or peace; of tributes, of lawes, and other things wherein conſiſted the eſtate of Rome. It was lawfull for the Lords of the Senate as oft as they thought conuenient to giue their opinion, to propounde what they liſted, and aske for a conſultation vpon it. Was it onely woorthie of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting, that at Syracuſa the plaies ſhould not be ſo long? Be all other things in the Empire, as well as if, not <hi>Nero,</hi> but <hi>Thraſea</hi> had the gouerment thereof?

               <p>THe ſame yeere, through the often and importunate ſute of the people, blaming the couetouſnes of the farmers of the common rents; <hi>Nero</hi> doubted whether it were beſt to command that there ſhould no more ſubſidies and tributes be leuied; and giue ſo faire a gift to the worlde. But this ſudden pang, hauing firſt commended the bounteouſnes of his minde; the LL. of the Senate ſtaied, affirming it to be the diſſolution of the Empire, if the reuenewes by which it was ſuſtained ſhould be diminiſhed: for if cuſtome were taken away, it would follow that the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of tributes woulde be demaunded. Manie ſocieties of tributes and tallages were eſtabliſhed by the Conſuls and Tribunes of the people, euen when the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munaltie had greateſt libertie. Things afterwarde were ſo proportioned, that the receits and reuenues ſhoulde be anſwerable to the layings out. Indeede the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes of the farmers was to be moderated; leaſt things tolerated ſo many yeeres without complaint, ſhould turne to further miſchiefe and hatred, by their ſtrange greedines. The prince therefore by edict commanded, that the taxation of euerie cuſtome which hitherto hath bin concealed, ſhould now be publiſhed: and that the farmers ſhould not after the yeere was expired demaund any thing, let ſlip, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, during that time. That in Rome the Pretor; in the prouinces, thoſe which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the places of the pretors &amp; Conſuls, ſhould extraordinarily determine againſt the farmers of common rents. That ſouldiers ſhoulde keepe their immunitie: thoſe things excepted wherin they trafficked: and many other iuſt things, which obſerued a ſhort time, afterward came to nothing. Neuertheleſſe the aboliſhing of one in fortie, and one in fiftie continueth, and what other names the farmers had inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for their vnlawfull exactions. The carriage of corne to partes beyond the ſeas was moderated. And ordained that marchants ſhips ſhould not be valued in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall eſtimate of their goods, nor tribute paied for them. <hi>Caeſar</hi> diſcharged <hi>Sulpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Camerinus,</hi> and <hi>Pomponius Siluanus,</hi> who had beene Proconſuls in Affrike; and accuſed by the prouince; obiecting againſt <hi>Camerinus,</hi> rather cruell dealing againſt a few priuat men, then extortion in generall. A great number of accuſers came about <hi>Siluanus,</hi> and required time to produce witneſſes: but the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant deſired his defences might preſently be hearde: which being rich, child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and old, he obtained; and ouerliued thoſe by whoſe ſuite he had eſcaped. The eſtate of Germanie was quiet vntill then, through the induſtrie of the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, who ſeeing the honor of triumph common, hoped for greater glory if they could continue peace. <hi>Paullinus Pompeius,</hi> and <hi>L.

Whereupon the Friſians placed their youth in the woods and mariſhes; ſent their feeble old men to the banks of Rhene, planting them in voide grounds appointed out for the vſe of ſouldiers; <hi>Verritus</hi> and <hi>Malorigis</hi> being the authors thereof, who then gouerned the countrey which the Germains were Lords of. Now they had built houſes, ſowed the ground, and tilled it, as though it had been their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue countrey: when <hi>Dubius Auitus</hi> hauing receiued the prouince of <hi>Paullinus,</hi> threatning to ſend the Roman forces, vnleſſe the Friſians would returne to their old homes, or obtaine a new place of habitation of <hi>Caeſar;</hi> enforced <hi>Varritus</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorigis</hi> to fall to intreatie. And taking their iourney to Rome whileſt they attended for <hi>Nero,</hi> buſied in other matters, among other things woont to be ſhewen to bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous people, they went to <hi>Pompeius</hi> Theater to behold the multitude of people. There at their leiſure (for being vnskilfull in thoſe plaies, tooke no great delight in them) whileſt they inquired of many things touching the aſſemblie, skaffolds, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of degrees, which were gentlemen, where the Senators ſate, they perceiued ſome in a ſtrange attire in the Senators roomes: and asking who they were, when they vnderſtoode that that honour was done to the Embaſſadors of thoſe countries which excelled in vertue, and friendſhip with the Romans; they cried that <hi>There were none in the world more valiant and faithfull than the Germans;</hi> and ſo went and ſate among the Lords of the Senate, which was courteouſly taken of the beholders, as a forwardnes of their old good nature, and a commendable emulation of vertue. <hi>Nero</hi> gaue them both the priuileges of a citizen of Rome, and commaunded the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians to depart the countrey they had poſſeſſed: who refuſing to obeie, a troupe of ayde horſemen ſent on the ſudden forced them to it, and thoſe taken and ſlaine which moſt obſtinately reſiſted. The Anſibaria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s entered the ſame territories, a ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger nation then the other: not onely by their owne ſtrength, but by the pitie their neighbours take on them; bicauſe that being driuen out by the Chauci, and wanting dwelling places, they deſired they might haue it as a ſure place of exile. They had for their conductor a man of great reputation in that countrey, and vnto vs likewiſe truſtie, called <hi>Boiocalus:</hi> who declared, how by the commaundement of <hi>Arminius</hi> he had beene taken priſoner, when the Cheruſcirebelled: then how he had ſerued the Romans fiftie yeeres vnder <hi>Tiberius</hi> and <hi>Germanicus.</hi> He ſaid further, <q rend="margQuotes">He would put his nation vnder our dominion. What neede was there of ſuch ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious waſte grounds, to put at ſometimes onely the ſouldiers heards and cattell to feed? That they might reſerue thoſe grounds they had receiued for their ſtocks (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit men died with famine) ſo as they deſired not rather a wildernes than an habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of people their confederates. In times paſt thoſe fields belonged to the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mauorians; then to the Tubantians; and in the ende to the Vſipians. As the heauen was giuen the gods, ſo the earth to makind; and that which was not poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, was common. Then beholding the ſunne, and calling vpon the reſt of the ſtars, he asked as it were in their preſence, whether they would ſee the land naked? That they would rather ouerwhelme the takers away of the earth with the ſea.</q>
                  <hi>Auitus</hi> mooued with theſe ſpeeches; aunſwered that the commaundement of their betters was to be obeied. It was the will of the gods whom they called vpon, that the arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trement ſhould belong to the Romans, what they ſhould giue, and what take away; neither would they ſuffer any iudges but themſelues. Theſe things he aunſwered the Anſibarians in publicke, to <hi>Boiocalus</hi> he would giue grounds in memorie of his friendſhip. Which he as if it had beene a reward of treaſon contemning added: We may want land to liue in; but to die in we cannot: and ſo they parted both diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented. They called the Bructeri, and Tencteri, and other nations further off, their
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:18166:103"/>
confederates to ioine in warre with them. <hi>Auitus</hi> hauing written to <hi>Curtilius Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi> Lieutenant of the vpper armie, that he ſhould paſſe ouer Rhene, and ſhew the forces behinde them; conducted the legions himſelfe into the Tencterans coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, threatning their deſtruction vnles they would breake with the Anſibarians. Theſe therefore deſiſting, the Bructeri daunted with the like feare, and the reſt flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from others perils, the Anſibarian nation alone retired back to the Vſipians and Tubantians: from whoſe territories being expulſed, as they went to the Catti, then to the Cheruſci, by long wandering, ſtrangers, poore, enemies, in a ſtrange coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, that youth that was left was ſlaine: thoſe that for age were vnfit for warre, diuided for a pray. The ſame ſummer there was a great battell fought betweene the Hermunduri, and Catti, each ſide ſtriuing by force to be maiſter of a riuer which yeelded aboundance of ſalt, ſited in the confines of both their countries. And beſides a deſire of ending all ſtrifes by warre, they had a religion rooted in them, that thoſe places are aboue others neere heauen; and the prayers of mortall men no where ſooner heard, then from thence. For they were of opinion, that by the goodnes of the gods in that riuer, and in thoſe woods came increaſe of ſalt, not as in other countries, of the wooes of the ſea, when the water is dried vp; but by that water caſt vpon a pile of wood ſet on fire, by the vertue of two contrary ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, fire and water, which becommeth thick and congealed. The warre was proſperous on the Hermundurians ſide, but the vtter ruine of the Catteans, becauſe of a vow they made, that if they were conquerors, they would dedicate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary army to <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> proteſting, horſes, men, all things ouercome, ſhould be put to the ſword; and truly thoſe deadly threats were turned againſt themſelues. But the citie of the Iuhonians confederate with vs, was afflicted with a ſudden diſaſter: for fires iſſuing out of the earth, burned townes, fields, villages euery where, and ſpread euen vnto the walles of a Colonie newly built; and could not be extinguiſhed, neither by raine, nor riuer water, nor any other liquor that could be employed, vntill for want of remedie, and anger of ſuch a deſtruction, certaine peaſants caſt ſtones a farre off into it; then the flames ſomewhat ſlakning, drawing neere, they put it out with blowes of clubs, and other like, as if it had been a wilde beaſt. Laſt of all, they threw in clothes from their backs, which the more worne and fouler, the better they quenched the fires. The ſame yeere, the Fig tree called Ruminalis, in the place of aſſemblies, which aboue eight hundred and fortie yeeres before had couered <hi>Remus</hi> and <hi>Romulus</hi> infancie, hauing his boughes dead, and the bodie beginning to wither, was held as a prodigious ſigne, vntill it began to flouriſh againe, and thruſt out new ſhootes.</p>

                  <hi>II. Anicetus</hi> worketh a meanes how to make away <hi>Agrippina Neroes</hi> mother.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>ANicetus</hi> a freed man, captaine of the nauie at Miſenum, one which had brought vp <hi>Nero</hi> in his childhood, hating, and hated of <hi>Agrippina,</hi> found out an inuention for the purpoſe: which was, that there might a gallie be made looſe by arte in the bottome, that ſhould let her fall into the ſea when ſhe ſuſpected leaſt. There is nothing more ſubiect to chance then the ſea, and if ſhe ſhould periſh by ſhipwrack, who is ſo vnreaſonable as to aſcribe that to any vngracious inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was the fault of the windes and waues? And to colour the matter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, the Prince ſhould build a temple in honor of the dead, erect altars, and inſtitute other ceremonies, to ſhew a loue and reuerence towards her. This ſubtile inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion pleaſed the Princes humor, and fell out at a fit time, becauſe <hi>Nero</hi> then cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated the feaſt of <hi>Minerua</hi> fiue dayes together at Baias. Thither by faire words he brought his mother; affirming, that the diſpleaſure of parents was to be borne with, and meanes to be ſought to pacifie their anger: which hee did to giue out a reconciliation betweene them, and ſo receiue <hi>Agrippina</hi> (as women by kinde are of eaſie beliefe) willing enough to ſee the ſport. Then going to meete her on the ſhore of Antium, tooke her by the hand and embraced her, and lead her to Baulos, which was a countrey houſe betwixt the promontorie of Miſenum and the Baian lake, hard by the ſea ſide, where a gallie trimmer than the reſt was readie prepared, as a thing among others to honour his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for ſhe had beene accuſtomed to the gallie, and to be carried by force of ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers. After that, ſhe was inuited to a banket, bicauſe the night might the better cloke the deuice. But ſure it was ſome one or other had bewraied the plot, and <hi>Agrippina</hi> vnderſtanding the practiſe, and doubtfull whether ſhe ſhould beleeue it, cauſed herſelfe to be carried to Baias in a bearing-chaire: there <hi>Neroes</hi> careſſes leſſened her feare, being courteouſly entertained, and placed aboue him; entertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning her with much communication; ſomtimes with a youthfull familiaritie, againe as it were recalling himſelfe, and interlacing it with ſerious talke, made the banket holde a long time: and his eies fixed on her as ſhe departed, embraced her more ſtreightly then he was accuſtomed; either becauſe he would omit no complement of diſſimulation; or elſe becauſe the laſt ſight of his mother euen readie to periſh, did mollifie his hart though fell and cruell. A bright ſtar-light night and quiet with a calme ſea, as it were to manifeſt the wicked practiſe, the gods themſelues did yeeld. The gallie not farre gone, and <hi>Agrippina</hi> hauing onely two of her owne perſons with her, the one <hi>Crepereius Gallus,</hi> which ſtood not far from the ſterne, &amp; <hi>Aceronia</hi> lying at <hi>Agrippinaes</hi> feete, with great ioy diſcourſed of her ſonnes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and the fauour ſhe had recouered. But the watch-woord being giuen the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:18166:104"/>
couering of the place heauily loaden with lead, fell downe vpon <hi>Crepereius</hi> and preſt him to death immediately. <hi>Agrippina</hi> and <hi>Aceronia,</hi> the vppermoſt bearing of the couering, by fortune being ſtronger then the reſt though it ſhrunke with the waight, were ſaued, &amp; the veſſel not looſed aſunder: all being amazed, and ſome which were ignorant of the practiſe, hindered others which were priuie to it. Then the rowers thought beſt to way the gallie on one ſide, and ſo to ſincke her. Yet they could not agree vpon ſo ſudden an aduiſe; but ſome ſwaying to the contrary way, cauſed the veſſell not to ſinke on the ſudden, but by little and little. But <hi>Aceronia</hi> vnaduiſedly crying that ſhe was <hi>Agrippina,</hi> and that they ſhould helpe the Princes mother, with poles and oares, and ſuch implements in the gallie as came firſt to hand, was ſlaine. <hi>Agrippina</hi> not ſpeaking a word, therefore not knowen, receiued onely one wound in the ſhoulder: then ſwimming towards the banke, was ſuccoured by ſmall barkes, and carried by the lake Lucrinus to her owne houſe. There caſting in her mind how ſhe had beene ſent for by craft and falſe letters, entertained with eſpeciall honour: how the veſſell neither toſſed by winds, nor carried vpon rockes, the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part fell as it had beene a land-frame: noting <hi>Accroniaes</hi> death, and beholding hir own wound, thought it the only remedy againſt the treachery, to make as though ſhe perceiued it not. And thereupon ſent <hi>Agerinus</hi> a freed man to tell her ſonne, how by the goodnes of the gods and his good fortune, ſhe had eſcaped a great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: and prayed him that although he were affrighted with his mothers daunger; yet that he would forbeare a time from viſiting her, bicauſe that for the preſent ſhe had need of reſt. And in the meane while making ſhewe of ſecuritie, healeth her wound, and cheariſheth hir bodie. And commaunded <hi>Aceroniaes</hi> teſtament to be ſought for, and her goodes to be ſealed vp, which was the onely thing wherein ſhe ſhewed no diſſimulation. But whileſt <hi>Nero</hi> expected meſſengers to certifie him that his plot had taken effect; tidings cam that ſhe had eſcaped lightly wounded, but paſſed through great da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, the author therof not once doubted. <hi>Nero</hi> ſtroken dead with feare, and crying ſhe would reuenge out of hand, either by arming her ſlaues, or ſturring vp the ſoldiers, or run to the Lords of the Senat, or people, there co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine of the ſhipwrack, her wound, &amp; the murder of her friends; knew no ſhift, vnles <hi>Burrhus</hi> &amp; <hi>Seneca</hi> would beſtur themſelues, whom immediatly he ſent for, doubtful whether they had vnderſtoode the matter before or not. They ſtoode mute a long time, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring leaſt their perſwaſions ſhould take no effect; in the end concluded, that vnleſſe <hi>Agrippina</hi> were preuented, <hi>Nero</hi> ſhould periſh. Then <hi>Seneca</hi> hitherto forwarder of the two, looked vpon <hi>Burrhus,</hi> as though he ſhould haue asked, whether the ſouldier ſhould be commaunded to execute the murder? but he anſwered, that the gard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bound to all <hi>Caeſars</hi> houſe, and ſo mindfull of <hi>Germanicus,</hi> would not vndertake ſo cruell an enterpriſe againſt his progenie, and that <hi>Anicetus</hi> ſhould accompliſh his promiſe. He nothing at all ſtaggering, demandeth the whole charge of the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. At which ſpeech, <hi>Nero</hi> profeſſed openly, that that day the Empire was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon him, and that the author of ſo great a gift was his freed man; and therefore that he ſhould make ſpeede, and take with him ſuch as were readieſt to fulfill his commaundement. He hearing that <hi>Agerinus, Agrippinaes</hi> meſſenger was come, maketh a colour of his enterpriſe in this ſort: Whileſt <hi>Agerinus</hi> deliuered his meſſage, <hi>Anicetus</hi> let fall a ſword betweene his legs, and as it were taking him in the manner, as though he had come to kill the Prince, commaundeth him to be caſt in priſon, that he might make the world beleeue that the mother had pretended her ſonnes death, and killed her ſelfe, for ſhame that the plot was diſcouered. In the meane ſeaſon, <hi>Agrippinaes</hi> danger being ſpread abroad, as though it had hapned
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:18166:105"/>
by chance, euery man as he vnderſtoode it, ranne to the ſea ſhore; ſome clammered vp the ſea dammes, ſome gate into the next boates, ſome waded as farre as they could into the ſea, ſome ſtretched out their hands to her. The coaſt was filled with complaints, vowes, and cries, of ſuch as either asked diuers queſtions, or anſwered doubtfully. And a great multitude flocked thither with torches, who vnderſtanding that ſhe was eſcaped, ſet themſelues in a readines, as it were to haue welcomed her, vntill they were diſperſed by the ſight of a threatning armed companie of ſouldiers. <hi>Anicetus</hi> beſetteth her houſe with a gard, and hauing broken the gate, layeth hand on all the ſeruants he meeteth, vntill he came to the chamber dores, where there ſtoode but a few, the reſidue terrified with thoſe which burſt in. There was but little light in the chamber, and one mayde only, <hi>Agrippina</hi> more and more perplexed that ſhe heard not from her ſonne, no nor of <hi>Agerinus.</hi> The face of the ſhore was now almoſt quite changed, euery man gone, and on the ſudden a great noiſe, and tokens of extreme danger. Then that one mayde going away, ſpeaking theſe words, <hi>Thou doeſt alſo for ſake me,</hi> ſhe eſpieth <hi>Anicetus,</hi> accompanied with <hi>Herculeus</hi> cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the gallie, and <hi>Oloaritus</hi> a Centurion of ſea ſouldiers, vnto whom ſhe ſayd, that if he came to viſit her, he ſhould go and ſay that ſhe was well recouered; if to execute any villanie ſhe ſuſpected her ſonne no way, and that the parricide was not by him commanded. The murderers came about her bed, and the captaine of the galley firſt ſtroke her on the head with a cudgell. For to the Centurion drawing his weapon to kill her, thruſting out her belly ſhe cried; ſtrike my belly, and ſo hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued many wounds, ſhe was ſlaine. Thus many report with one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent. Whether that <hi>Nero</hi> beheld his mother when ſhe was dead, &amp; praiſed the feature of her bodie, ſome there are which affirme, ſome which denie. She was burnt the ſame night in a banketting bed with baſe funerals; and whileſt <hi>Nero</hi> raigned, neuer buried. Not long after by the care of her friends, ſhe had a tombe of ſmall expenſes neere the Miſeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an way, and <hi>Caeſar</hi> the Dictators houſe, which from a high place looked vpon a gulphe of the ſea vnderneath. When the funerall fire was kindled, <hi>Mnester</hi> her freed man thruſt himſelfe thorough; but whether for loue of <hi>Agrippina,</hi> or feare of death, doubtfull. That this ſhould be her ende <hi>Agrippina</hi> many yeeres before did beleeue, but contemned it. For conſulting of <hi>Neroes</hi> fortune, the Chaldaeans tolde her that he ſhould be Emperour, and kill his mother: and ſhe aunſwered, let him kill her, ſo as he be Emperour.</p>

               <p>BVt after this vnnaturall fact was committed, <hi>Caeſar</hi> began to waigh how hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous it was: and the reſt of the night, now in dumme ſilence, often riſing vp as affrighted, and out of his wits, looked for day as if it had beene a meſſenger of death. But at <hi>Burrhus</hi> perſwaſion the firſt flatterie of the Centurions and Tribunes did animate him to hope: who taking him by the hand, reioyced that he had eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped an vnlooked for danger, and his mother wicked practiſes. Then his friendes frequented the Temples, and the example begun the free townes adioining to Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pania, witneſſed their ioy with ſacrifices and Embaſſadours. He counterfeiting the contrarie, ſad and as it were an enemie to his life, wept and bewailed the death of his mother. Yet becauſe the face of places is not chaunged like vnto the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of men, the grieuous ſight of that ſea and ſhore comming oft to his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce (and ſome there were which beleeued that there was heard a ſound of a

trumpet in thoſe high hils adioining, and lamentations at his mothers tombe) he went to Naples and ſent letters to the Senate, with contents as followeth. <hi rend="margQuotes">That <hi>Agerinus</hi> one of <hi>Agrippinaes</hi> deereſt freed men, was found with a ſword to kill him, and that ſhe with the ſame remorſe of conſcience, had ſuffered the puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, with which ſhe had prepared her lewd enterpriſe againſt him. He added farre fet crimes, as that ſhe would haue beene equall with him in the Empire, and that his guarde ſhould haue ſworne allegeance to her being but a woman, hoping to haue done the ſame diſhonor to the Senate and people. And that perceiuing theſe deuiſes to want effect, offended with the ſouldiers, the Senators, and the people; ſhe hindered a gift which ſhould haue beene giuen the people, and ſought the ruine of many noble men. How greatly laboured he, that ſhe ſhould not ruſh into the Senate, and giue fortaine nations their anſweres?</hi> And by a by-glancing at <hi>Claudius</hi> raigne, caſt vpon his mother all the lewd actions of his gouernment, affirming that ſhe was dead for the common good of the eſtate. He declared hir ſhipwracke likewiſe; the which to haue happened by chaunce, who was ſo blockiſh as to beleeue? or that one man alone ſhould be ſent from a woman that had ſuffered ſhipwracke to force a guarde and Emperors nauie? Therefore now not <hi>Nero</hi> whoſe crueltie ſurpaſſed all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, but <hi>Seneca</hi> was hardly ſpoken of, as one confeſſing the fact by that oration. Neuertheleſſe proceſſions were ordained with a woonderfull ſtrife of forwardnes in euerie Temple, and a bed made in the Temples in honour of their gods; and alſo that the fiue daies feaſtes of <hi>Minerua</hi> called Quinquatrus, in which the trecheries were diſcouered, ſhould be celebrated euerie yeere.

Many prodigions ſignes happened likewiſe, but of no effect. A woman brought forth a ſnake, and another companying with her husband, was ſtriken dead with lightning. The ſun was darkened on a ſudden, and fourteen places of the citie damnified with tempeſt from heauen: which chaunced ſo without the care of the gods, that <hi>Nero</hi> many yeeres after continued the Empire and wickednes. But to make his mother more odious, and ſhew his owne lenitie was augmented by her death, he recalled from baniſhment two noble women <hi>Iunia</hi> and <hi>Calpurnia,</hi> and <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius Capito,</hi> and <hi>Licinius Gabolus,</hi> who had beene Pretors long before, baniſhed by <hi>Agrippina.</hi> He permitted alſo that <hi>Lollia Paullinaes</hi> aſhes ſhould be brought backe, and a ſepulchre to be built her, and releaſed the puniſhment of <hi>Iturius</hi> and <hi>Caluiſius,</hi> whom not long before he himſelfe had baniſhed. As for <hi>Silana</hi> ſhe died in comming backe at Tarentum; <hi>Agrippinaes</hi> malice which was her ouerthrow, either appeaſed, or her credit beginning to waine. Whileſt he lingered in the townes of Campania, doubtfull how he ſhould enter into the citie: whether his beſt way were to ſeeke the fauour of the Senat, or good will of the people; the lewdeſt conditioned, whereof there was no court better ſtored, perſwaded him that the name of <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pina</hi> was odious, and that by her death the fauour of the people was more bent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him than euer: therefore that he ſhould goe boldly, and with his preſence trie how he ſhould be reuerenced. And withall they earneſtly entreated him to ſet forward: and found all things in a greater readines than they had promiſed: the Tribes came to meete him; the Lords of the Senate in their holy-daie robes, wiues and children placed according to their age and ſexe: and all the way he ſhould goe builded with ſtaires as in publicke ſhewes or triumphes. Thereupon puffed vp with

pride, as a conquerour of publicke ſeruitude, he went to the Capitoll, and gaue thanks to the gods: letting looſe the raines to all luſts and licenciouſnes of life, which before badly reſtrained, yet the reuerence towards his mother ſuch as it was, did in ſome ſort bridle.</p>

               <p>IT was an old practiſe of his neuer to be abſent from the race of chariots: and no leſſe vnſeemely was that other delight of his, at ſupper to ſing to the harp as minſtrels did, which he ſaid to haue beene a cuſtome of auncient Kings and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines; and a thing highly commended by Poets, and attributed to the honor of the gods. For melodie is ſure dedicated to <hi>Apollo,</hi> &amp; in that attire he doth ſtand, not only in the cities of Greece, but alſo in the temples at Rome: a principall deitie, and knowing things to come. Neither could he now be remoued, ſeeming good alſo to <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Burrhus</hi> to yeeld him the one, leaſt he ſhould perſiſt in both. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon a ſpace was incloſed in the valley of the Vatican to mannage his horſes, and not to be ſeene indifferently of euery man: and not long after of his owne accord he called the people to ſee it, who highly extolled him; as the manner of the people is, to be deſirous of paſtimes, and very glad if the Prince draw them to it. And his ſhame publiſhed abroad, brought him not as it was thought it would, any loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing therin, but a farther prouocation, thinking that the diſcredit would be ſhaken off, if he could diſhonor many with the like. He brought to the skaffold many deſcended of noble houſes, bought for pouertie, which becauſe they be dead, I will not name, as hauing regard vnto their aunceſtors: being rather his fault to giue money for ill doing, then leaſt they ſhould commit that which is naught. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained alſo the chiefe gentlemen of Rome with mightie gifts to promiſe their labour in the Theater: vnleſſe you ſay that a reward giuen by him who may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, bringeth a neceſſitie in obeying. Yet leaſt he ſhould be diſcredited by the publick Theater, he inſtituted Playes called Iuuenalia, as it were for the health of youth, to which euery man willingly gaue his name; not any ones nobilitie, not his age, or office borne, being any hinderance vnto them, but that Greekes and Latins exerciſed the arte of a ſtage player, euen vnto geſtures and meaſures vnſeemely for men. Yea noble women practiſed many geſtures, and vnſeemely to their calling. And in the wood which <hi>Augustus</hi> planted about the lake, where he repreſented a ſea fight, Tauernes and meeting places were built, where all prouocations of wanton luſts were ſold, where money was giuen to the good to ſpend of neceſſitie, and to the intemperate to glory and brag of. From thence ſprang all lewdenes and infamie, neuer at any time (not when there was great corruption in manners in times paſt) more diſſolute laſciuiouſnes vſed then at thoſe impure aſſemblies. Shame is ſcarſe retained among men of honeſt example; much leſſe among ſuch which ſtriued who ſhould haue moſt vices, can chaſtitie and modeſtie, or any good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauior be maintained. Laſt of all, <hi>Nero</hi> himſelfe entereth on the ſtage, tuning and playing on his inſtrument with great care, and premeditating what to ſay; his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liars aſſiſting him, and beſides them a cohort of ſouldiers, Centurions and Tribunes, and <hi>Burrhus,</hi> both grieuing, and praiſing him. Then alſo were firſt inrowled the gentlemen of Rome called <hi>Augustani,</hi> men for their age and ſtrength of body highly eſteemed: part of them ſhameleſſe and ſaucy in behauior, and part hoping thereby to riſe to greater authoritie, day and night with clapping of hands made all to ring of them, commending the feature, and voice of the Prince with termes attributed to

And yet leaſt the Emperours skill on ſtage only and muſick ſhould be publiſhed, he deſired to be well accompted of for verſifying, hauing gathered about him ſuch as had any cunning therein, much more ſuch as were excellent.

Many of the Nucerians were brought lame and wounded to the towne, and many wept for the death of their children and parents: the determining of which the Prince referred to the Senate, the Senate to the Conſuls.

               <p>DVring theſe things, there appeared a blaſing ſtarre, which in the opinion of the common people, betokeneth the change of a Prince.

He was an obſeruer of the old manner of liuing, vpright, graue and ſeuere, liuing with all honeſtie, as one retired in his own houſe: and the more ſecret he was for feare of being accounted of; ſo much the more his reputation increaſed. An interpretation of a lightning begun by the like vanitie, augmented the rumor. For <hi>Neroes</hi> meate being ſtriken with lightning, and the table throwen downe at the lakes of Simbruinum, in a place called Sublaqueum, in the confines of Tiburtum, from whence <hi>Plautus</hi> had his beginning by his fathers ſide; all men beleeued that he was deſtined by the prouidence of the gods to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: and thereupon many fawned and courted him: which by a greedie and for the moſt part deceiptfull ambition, admire new things, doubtfull and vncertaine. <hi>Nero</hi> moued with theſe rumors writeth to <hi>Plautus,</hi> aduiſing him to looke to himſelf and his aſſemblies, and rid his hands of thoſe which lewdly defamed him: and that in Aſia he had poſſeſſions by deſcent from his aunceſtors, in which he might paſſe his youth ſafely and without troubles.

than a common ſouldier. Then we came into tilled groundes, but where harueſt was in: and of two caſtles into which the Armenians had fled, the one was taken by force; and the other which had reſiſted the firſt aſſault was forced with ſiege. From thence paſſing into the countrey of the Taurantians he eſcaped an vnlooked for danger: for not farre from his pauilion, there was found a Barbarian of no ſmall reputation with a weapon; which by torture diſcouered the order of a treaſon (him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the inuentor of it) and all his complices: and they were conuicted and puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed which vnder colour of friendſhip went about treaſon.

Then by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of the Captaine, and animating each the other, that they ſhould not feare a flocke of women, and franticke people, they diſplaied their enſignes and marched on; ouerthrew ſuch as encountered them, and thruſt them among their owne fires. Which being done, they placed garriſons in their townes, and cut down their woods; which through their execrable ſuperſtitions among them were recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned holie. For they accounted it lawfull to offer ſacrifice at their altars with the blood of captiues, and aske counſell of their gods by the aſpect of mans intrailes and fibres. Newes came to <hi>Suetonius</hi> as he atchieued this enterpriſe, of a ſudden rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of the Prouince. <hi>Praſutagus</hi> King of the Icenians <note n="*" place="margin">Suffolke, Norfolke, Cambridgeſhire Huntington<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</note>, verie famous for his riches a long time gotten, made <hi>Caeſar</hi> with two of his daughters his heire by will, thinking that by that flatterie his kingdome and houſe ſhould haue beene warranted from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:18166:109"/>
which fell out otherwiſe: for his kingdome by Centurions, his houſe by ſlaues was waſted &amp; ſpoiled as lawfull booties. And to begin withall, his wife <hi>Boudicea</hi> was whipped, &amp; his daughters defloured. And the chiefeſt of the Icenians as though they had receiued the whole nation for a pray, were diſpoſſeſſed of al their ancient inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, &amp; the Kings kindred reputed as ſlaues. By reaſon of which contumely &amp; feare of worſe (after that they were reduced into a forme of a prouince) they take armes againe: the <note n="*" place="margin">Middleſex and Eſſex.</note> Trinobantes being ſturred to rebellion alſo, &amp; others not yet broken to the yoke of ſeruitude, by ſecret conſpiracies had vowed to recouer their libertie, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a bitter hatred againſt the old ſouldiers. For thoſe which were lately brought into the colonie of <note n="*" place="margin">Maldon in Eſſex.</note> Camalodunum, thruſt out of their houſes the auncient inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, tooke their liuings from them, calling them captiues and ſlaues: the new ſoldiers fauouring the inſolent fiercenes of the old, as well for likeneſſe and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of life, as hope of like licence. Beſides, a temple erected in honor of <hi>Claudius</hi> of famous memory, was an eye ſore, and an altar of perpetuall dominion ouer them: and the Prieſts which were choſen vnder colour of religion, waſted all the wealth of the inhabitants. Neither did it ſeeme any hard matter, to extirpate that colonie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defenſed and vnfortified, which was not circumſpectly foreſeene by our captaines, whileſt they had a greater care of pleaſure then good gouernment. Amongſt theſe things the image of Victorie ſet vp in Camalodunum fell downe without any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant cauſe why, and turned back, as though it would giue place to the enemie. And the women diſtempered with furie, went ſinging, that deſtruction was at hand. And ſtrange noiſes were heard in their court, and the Theater gaue a ſound like to a howling, and a ſtrange apparition in an arme of the ſea was a foretelling of the ſubuerſion of the colonie. Further, the Ocean bloudie in ſhew, and dead mens bodies left after an ebbe, as they brought hope to the Britaines, ſo they droue the old ſoldiers into a feare; who becauſe <hi>Suetonius</hi> was farre off, craued aide of <hi>Catus De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cianus</hi> procurator. He ſent not aboue two hundred men, and thoſe badly armed, and the number not great which was there before, truſted to the franchiſe of the temple. And thoſe hindering which were confederates of the ſecret conſpiracie troubled their deſeignments: for they neither made trench nor ditch, nor ſending away the old men and women, and keeping the yong men only, being as ſecure as it had beene in a full peace, they were ſurpriſed with a multitude of barbarous people, and all ouerthrowne, and waſted with violence, or conſumed with fire: the temple only excepted, into which the ſouldiers had fled, which alſo within two dayes was beſieged, and taken. And the Britaine being thus conqueror, and meeting with <hi>Paetus Cerealis</hi> Lieutenant of the ninth legion which came to ſuccour them, put to flight the legion, and ſlew all the footemen. <hi>Cerealis</hi> with the horſemen eſcaped to the campe, and defended himſelfe in the fortreſſes. Through which ouerthrow, and hate of the prouince, driuen to take armes through the auarice of the Romaines, <hi>Catus</hi> the procurator being afraid, ſailed to Gallia. But <hi>Suetonius</hi> with wonderfull conſtancie paſſing euen among the enemies, went on to London, not greatly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous by the name of a colonie, but for concourſe of Merchants, and prouiſion of all things neceſſary, of great fame and renowme: and being come thither, ſtoode doubtfull whether he ſhould chooſe that for the ſeate of warre or not: and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſmall ſtore of ſouldiers he had, and how <hi>Petilius</hi> had well payed for his raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, he determined with the loſſe of one towne to preſerue the reſt whole. Neither was he won by weeping and teares to giue aide to ſuch as demaunded it, but gaue ſigne of remouing, and receiued ſuch as followed as part of his armie. If imbecillitie of ſexe, or weariſomnes of age, or pleaſantnes of the place kept any back, they were

all put to the ſword by the enemie. The free towne of <note n="*" place="margin">S. Albons.</note> Verulamium receiued the like ouerthrow, becauſe the barbarians forſaking their Caſtels and forts, and being well manned, ſpoiled the richeſt and fatteſt, and carrying it to a ſure place, glad of the bootie, went on to places more notable. It is certaine there were ſlaine in thoſe places I haue ſpoken of, to the number of ſeuentie thouſand citizens and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates. Neither did they ſell or take any one priſoner, or vſe any entercourſe of traffick of warre, but kill, hang, burne, crucifie, as though they would requite the meaſure they had ſuffered, and as it were in the meane time haſten to anticipate reuenge.</p>

                  <hi>XI. Suetonius</hi> vanquiſhed the Britaines, vvhich <hi>Boudicea</hi> conducted: her ſtoutnes and death.</head>
               <p>NOw <hi>Suetonius</hi> hauing with him the foureteenth legion, with the Standard bearers of the twentith, and the aides from places adioyning, which came all to the number almoſt of ten thouſand armed men, reſolued to lay aſide all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, and trie the chaunce of a maine battell. And chooſeth a place with a narrow en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and incloſed behinde with a wood, being well aſſured that he had no eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies but before him; and that the plaine was wide without feare of ambuſh. The le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gionarie ſouldier then marſhalled togither in thicke and cloſe rankes, and the light harneſſed cloſely about them, the horſemen made the wings. But the Britaines forces triumphed abroade in troupes and companies, by ſuch multitudes that the like had not beene ſeene; and of ſuch fiercenes of courage, that they brought their wiues with them, and placed them in carts in the vtmoſt parts of the plaine, as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the victorie. <hi>Boudicea</hi> hauing her daughters by her in a chariot, now going to one, now to another: <hi rend="margQuotes">Told them that the Britaines were woont to make warre vnder the conduct of women. But at that time not as though ſhe had deſcended of ſuch noble aunceſtors, ſhe ſought neither for kingdome nor wealth, but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge as one of the common people, of their loſt libertie, of her bodie beaten with ſtripes, and the chaſtitie of her daughters violated. That the deſire of the Romaines was growen to that paſſe, that they left none, of what age ſoeuer, nor any virgin vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled. Neuertheles that the gods fauored iuſt reuenge; that the legion which durſt vndertake the battell was ſlaine; the reſt had either hid themſelues in their camp, or fought meanes by flight to ſaue themſelues: that they could not indure the noiſe and cry of ſo many ſouldiers, much leſſe their furie and ſtrength. If they would waigh with themſelues the ſtrength of the ſouldiers; if the cauſe of the warre, they ſhould reſolue either to vanquiſh in that battell or die. That, for her owne part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a woman, was her reſolution, the men might liue if they pleaſed, and ſerue.

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:18166:110"/>
a feruencie and edge followed the captaines words; the old ſouldier experienced in many battels ſo beſturred himſelfe, and ſhewed ſuch forwardnes in lancing his darts, that <hi>Suetonius</hi> aſſured of the euent, gaue the ſigne of battell. And firſt of all the legion not ſtirring afoote, but keeping within the ſtreight, as in a place of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; after that the enemie was come neerer, and had ſpent his darts to good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the legion in the end ſallied out in a pointed battell. The auxiliarie ſouldier was of the like courage, and the horſemen with long lances breaking before them all they met, or made head againſt them. The reſidue ſhewed their backs, hardly fleeing away, by reaſon the carts placed about the plaine had hedged in the paſſages on euery ſide. And the ſouldiers ſpared not from killing ſo much as the women; and their horſes and beaſts thruſt through, increaſed the heape of bodies. That was a day of great renowme, and comparable to the victories of old times: for ſome there are which report, that there were ſlaine fewe leſſe in number then four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore thouſand Britaines, of our ſouldiers fower hundred ſlaine, and not many moe hurt. <hi>Boudicea</hi> ended her life with poiſon. And <hi>Poenius Posthumus,</hi> Campe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſter of the ſecond legion, vnderſtanding of the proſperous ſucceſſe of the foureteenth and twentith legions, becauſe hee had defrauded his legion of the like glorie; and contrarie to the order of ſeruice, refuſed to obey the Captaines commaundement, ſlewe himſelfe. After this gathering the armie togither, they encamped againe, readie to end the reſidue of the warre. And <hi>Caeſar</hi> augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his forces by ſending out of Germanie two thouſand legion aries, eight cohorts of auxiliaries, and a thouſand horſe; by whoſe comming the ninth legion was ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The cohorts and wings were lodged in newe winter garriſons, and all thoſe which were either openly againſt vs, or doubtfull, were waſted with fire and ſword. But nothing ſo much diſtreſſed that nation as famine, being negligent in ſowing of corne, and of all ages giuen to warre: and aſſuring themſelues to liue on our proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, being a fierce nation ſlowly gaue eare to any peace. For <hi>Iulius Claſsicianus</hi> ſent to ſucceed Catus, and at variance with <hi>Suetonius,</hi> hindered the common good with pruate grudges: and had bruted abroad that the new Lieutenant was to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, who without any hoſtile rancor, &amp; pride of a conqueror, would entreat ſuch as would yeelde with all clemencie. He ſent worde likewiſe to Rome that they ſhould looke for no ende of the warres, vnleſſe ſome other ſhould ſucceed <hi>Suetonius,</hi> attributing his aduerſe lucke, to his own ouerthwartnes; and the proſperous, to the good lucke of the common-wealth. Whereupon to ſee what ſtate Britannie ſtood in, <hi>Polycletus</hi> a freed man was ſent, <hi>Nero</hi> greatly hoping, that by his authoritie there ſhould not onely an agreement be made betweene the Lieutenant and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curator; but alſo the rebellious mindes of the Barbarians be won to a peace.

And <hi>Suetonius</hi> being occupied in diſpatching of buſines, after he had loſt a fewe galleies on the ſhore, and the gallie-ſlaues in them, as though the warre did continue, was commaunded to deliuer the armie to <hi>Petronius Turpilianus,</hi> who had lately giuen vp his Conſulſhip: who neither prouoking the enimie, nor egged by him, gaue his laſie and idle life, the honorable name of peace.</p>

                  <hi>XII. Balbus</hi> a Senators testament forged: and <hi>Pedanius Rufus</hi> killed by his bondmen.</head>
               <p>THe ſame yeere two notable lewd parts were committed at Rome: the one by a Senator; the other by an audacious bondman. <hi>Domitius Balbus</hi> ſometime Pretor, being aged, without children, and of great wealth, lay open to much treacherie. One of his neereſt kinſmen, <hi>Valerius Fabianus,</hi> and Conſull elect, forged a falſe teſtament in his name, hauing called thereunto <hi>Vicius Rufinus,</hi> and <hi>Terentius Lentinus</hi> gentlemen of Rome: and they aſſociated vnto them <hi>Antonius Primus,</hi> and <hi>Aſinius Marcellus. Antonie</hi> was readie and bold; <hi>Marcellus</hi> nobly deſcended, and nephewe to <hi>Aſinius Pollio,</hi> of a good cariage and behauiour; ſauing that he thought pouertie the woorſt of all things. <hi>Fabianus</hi> then ſealed the teſtament with thoſe which I haue named, and others of leſſer calling: whereof he was conuicted before the Lords of the Senat, with <hi>Antonius,</hi> &amp; <hi>Rufinus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Terentius,</hi> and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the law Cornelia againſt forgerie. But <hi>Marcellus</hi> the memorie of his aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, and <hi>Caeſars</hi> entreatie, acquited rather from puniſhment, than infamie. The ſame day ouerthrew <hi>Pompeianus Aelianus,</hi> a yoong man, who had been Quaeſtor and priuie to <hi>Fabianus</hi> practiſe, and was baniſhed Italy and Spaine his natiue countrey. <hi>Valerius Ponticus</hi> ſuſtained the like ignominie, becauſe that eſchuing the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Prouoſt of the citie, he had informed againſt ſome before the Pretor firſt vnder colour of ſom lawes, then by preuarication to eſcape puniſhment. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon a decree of Senate was ordained, that he who ſhould either buy or ſell any ſuch actions, ſhould ſuſtaine the ſame puniſhment, as he who was publickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for forging of crimes in falſe accuſations. Not long after <hi>Pedanius Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> Prouoſt of the citie was ſlaine by his bondman, either becauſe he had denied him his libertie, which for woney he had couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted; or hating him for the vnnatural luſt of a youth, as not induring his lord to be his riuall. But when all the bondſlaues of the houſe according to the old cuſtom ſhould haue bin condemned for that fact; through the flocking thither of people, which defended ſo many innocent perſons, they grew almoſt to a mutinie, and euen in the Senate it ſelfe; among which there was a faction, ſome contemning that ouergreat ſeueritie; and many on the contrary ſide holding it neceſſary that nothing ſhould be changed. Among which, <hi>C. Caſsius</hi> vttered his opinion as followeth. <hi rend="margQuotes">I haue oftentimes been preſent in this aſlemblie, Lords of the Senate, when new decrees haue beene demaunded, contrary to the lawes and ordinances of our aunceſtors: neither haue I euer gaineſaide them; not that I doubted but that in times paſt they foreſaw and tooke better and more vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right order for all affaires then now; and that thoſe things which were altered were changed into the worſe: but leaſt I ſhould ſeeme by ſticking too much to old cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes, to extoll the thing I affected: with all I thought it not conuenient with of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten contradiction, to ouerthrow this our authoritie whatſoeuer it be, to the end it might remaine ſtrong and entire, if at any time the common wealth ſhould neede of counſell. Which this day hath appeered, a Conſull being murdered in his owne houſe, by treaſon of his ſlaues, which none either hindered or bewraied, although the decree of Senate be yet in force, which in this caſe threatned puniſhment to the whole familie. Decree in good truth impunitie. But whom ſhall any mans digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie warrant, ſeeing the Prouoſtſhip of the citie auailed not? whom ſhall a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſlaues defend, ſeeing foure hundred haue not protected <hi>Pedanius Secundus?</hi> Whom ſhall any ones familie help, if ſtanding in feare of lawes our ſeruants care
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:18166:111"/>
not what danger we fall into. Shall we ſay, as ſome are not aſhamed to inuent, that this murderer reuenged his owne priuat iniurie, becauſe he had compounded for his fathers inheritance; or that ſome old ſlaue had beene taken from him? Let vs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce ſentence without any further adoe, that <hi>Pedianus</hi> ſeemeth to vs to haue bin iuſtly ſlaine. Giue me leaue to reaſon of that point, that hath been determined by wiſer men: If we were now firſt of all to conſider of the matter, do you thinke that a ſlaue had had the hart to murder his Lord, if no threatning word had before eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped him? if he had vttered nothing raſhly? forſooth he concealed his intention, he prepared a weapon amongſt ſuch as knew nothing of it. Could he paſſe the watch, open the chamber dores, bring in light, commit the murder, all of his fellowes igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of it? If ſlaues would bewraye ſuch attempts, they can giue many ſignes: which if they diſcouer, we alone may be ſafe among many lewde perſons: in the end if we muſt needes dye, yet not vnreuenged of the wicked. The diſpoſition of ſlaues hath alwayes beene feared by our aunceſtors; yea although they were borne in the ſame countrey and houſes, and haue iuſt occaſion preſently to loue their lords. But ſeeing we haue nations of them in our families, vſing diuers rites and cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes, ſtrange or no ceremonies of religions at all, this raſcalitie thou ſhalt not be able to bridle but by feare. But ſome innocents ſhall be caſt away. When an armie is diſcomfited, and euery tenth ſouldier is culled out and beaten with a cudgell, the lot falleth alſo vpon the valiant. Euery exemplarie puniſhment hath ſomewhat in it which is vniuſt, which being in particular to the preiudice of ſome, yet is recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed by the generall good of the whole.</hi> As no one man durſt gainſay <hi>Caſsius</hi> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, ſo many confuſedly anſwered together, that there ſhould commiſeration be taken, of the number, age, ſexe, and vndoubted innocencie of many. Yet that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion preuailed, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded they ſhould be puniſhed; but it could not be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, a multitude being flocked together, threatning with ſtones and fire. Then <hi>Caeſar</hi> rebuked the people by an edict, &amp; beſet al the way, by which the condemned parties were lead to puniſhment with a gard of ſouldiers. <hi>Cingonius Varro</hi> aduiſed that the freed men which liued vnder the ſame roofe with their maiſter ſlaine, ſhould be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed Italie. But that was withſtoode by the Prince, leaſt the auncient cuſtome which clemencie had not diminiſhed, ſhould by crueltie be made worſe. The ſame men being Conſuls, <hi>Tarquitius Priſcus</hi> was condemned for extortion, at the ſuite of the Bithynians, the Senators greatly reioyſing thereat, who bare in minde that <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilius Taurus</hi> their Proconſull had beene accuſed by him. The people were num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred and valued in Gallia by <hi>Q. Voluſius,</hi> and <hi>Sext. Africanus,</hi> and <hi>Trebellius Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus;</hi> and whileſt <hi>Voluſius</hi> and <hi>Africanus</hi> contended for woorth and nobilitie, and both diſdaining <hi>Trebellius,</hi> they preferred him before themſelues. That yeere died <hi>Memmius Regulus,</hi> in authoritie, conſtancie, fame, as much as might be, the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall highnes ſhadowing him, greatly renowmed: in ſo much that <hi>Nero</hi> being ſicke, and ſuch as were about him flattering him, and ſaying that the Empire was at an end if he ſhould miſcary, made anſwere; that the common wealth had a ſupport and ſtay.

Whereupon he was accuſed of treaſon by <hi>Coſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus Capito,</hi> not long before receiued into the number of Senators at the requeſt of his father in law <hi>Tigellinus.</hi> It was thought that then firſt of all that law was put on foote, which wrought not ſo great an ouerthrow to <hi>Antistius,</hi> as glorie to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour: by which the condemned partie, by the Senate was deliuered from death, by the negatiue voice of the Tribune.

The reſt after that yeelding their aſſent, <hi>Paetus Thraſea</hi> hauing ſaid ſomewhat in the commendation of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ſharpely rebuked <hi>Antistius,</hi> and declared: <hi rend="margQuotes">That it was not expedient, that the extremitie of puniſhment ſhould be vſed vnder a good Prince, and when the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat was by no neceſſity bound to ordaine it: that there was no vſe now of an executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner and halter: and that there were penalties ordained by lawes, and puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted without note of the ſeuerity of the iudges, &amp; infamy of times.

               <p>AS publicke calamities daily increaſed; ſo the remedies againſt them grewe ſcarſe. And <hi>Burrhus</hi> ended his life, but whether by ſicknes or poiſon, vncertain. It was coniectured by ſickeneſſe, becauſe that his winde-pipe within ſwelling by little and little, and in the end ſtopped, he yeelded vp the ghoſt. Moſt men affirme that by <hi>Neroes</hi> commaundement, making as though he would haue applied a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to the palate of his mouth annointed it with poiſon: and that <hi>Burrhus</hi> vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the practiſe, when <hi>Caeſar</hi> came to viſite him, turned his face from him: and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him how he did, anſwered onely, I am well. He was much lamented in the citie for the memorie of his vertue: and harmleſſe ſloth of one of his ſucceſſors, and enormous wickednes, and adulteries of the other. For <hi>Caeſar</hi> had made two Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of the garde: <hi>Fenius Rufus</hi> through the fauour of the people, becauſe he dealt in corne matters without gaine; and <hi>Sofonius Tigellinus,</hi> who helde on his old courſe of vncleane and infamous life, which by cuſtome was another nature in him. <hi>Tigel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus</hi> was more inward with the Prince, choſen as one priuie to his ſecret pleaſures. <hi>Rufus</hi> was of good reputation and fame with the people, and accepted of the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, which he found by experience to breed <hi>Neroes</hi> miſlike. The death of <hi>Burrhus</hi> weakened <hi>Senecaes</hi> authoritie, bicauſe his good artes wanted the ſtrength they had: hauing loſt one as it were of their guides; &amp; <hi>Nero</hi> inclined to the worſer ſort. Which with ſundrie ſorts of calumniations ſet vpon <hi>Seneca,</hi> ſaying: <hi rend="margQuotes">That he continually heaped vp wealth aboue the calling of a priuate man, and ſought to win the peoples harts; that in pleaſant gardings, and ſtately buildings he did almoſt exceede the Prince.

For ſhewing openly a diſlike of the princes pleaſures; he detracted from his skil in riding, and ſcoffed at his voice when he ſang; to what other purpoſe, but that nothing ſhould ſeeme excellent in the common-wealth, which was not thought to be his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention? <hi>Nero</hi> was now out of his childhood, and in the ſtrength of his youth; he ſhould ſhake off his maſter, being alreadie inſtructed with ſufficient teachers, to wit his anceſtors.</hi> But <hi>Seneca</hi> knowing of theſe accuſations, by ſome which had a care of honeſtie; and <hi>Caeſar</hi> more and more eſtranging himſelfe from his familiaritie: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth a time to be heard; and hauing obtained it, beginneth thus. <hi rend="margQuotes">It is foureteene yeeres <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ſince I haue beene put to thee as a guide to thy hope; and eight ſince thou haſt gouerned the Empire. From that time vntill this, thou haſt heaped on me ſo many dignities and ſo much wealth, that there wanteth nothing to my felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but the moderation of them. I will alleage great examples; not of mine owne cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but of thine. <hi>Augustus</hi> thy great great grandfathers father, licenſed <hi>M.

Whereof the one a companion of his warres; the other toſſed and wearied with many trauels at Rome, had receiued large rewards, but anſwerable to their manifold deſerts. As for my ſelfe, what was there in me for the requitall of thy munificencie, ſaue onely my ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:18166:112"/>
I may ſay, nouriſhed in the ſhadow? By which I haue gotten credit and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe I ſeemd to haue beene at hand and directed thy youth with inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: a great recompence in very deed of my trauell. But thou haſt done me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, great fauours, and inriched me with infinite wealth; in ſo much that I do oft debate the matter with my ſelfe, ſaying: Am I, being but a gentleman onely, and borne out of the citie, reckoned among the chiefeſt peeres of the citie? Can it be that my new riſing can ſhine among noble men honored with the marks of ancient anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity? Where is that minde of mine which once was contented with a little? What, doth he make ſuch goodly gardens &amp; walke in ſuch manner houſes neer the wals of the citie: doth he abound in ſuch ſcope of grounds, and vſury in ſo many places? One defence commeth to minde for all, that is, that it was not my part to ſtriue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thy gifts, but both of vs haue filled our meaſure, thou by giuing as much as a Prince could beſtow vpon a friend, and I in taking as much as a friend could take of a Prince. That which is aboue this augmenteth enuie, the which no doubt, as all mortall things doth lye vnder thy greatnes, but lye heauily on my ſhoulders; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I neede help: and as wearie in ſeruice of warre, or on the way, I would craue ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour; ſo in this iourney of my life, old and vnable to wade through the ſmalleſt cares, ſeeing I cannot ſuſtaine the burden of my riches any longer, I craue thy aide and helping hand; commaund them to be mannaged by thy procurators, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued as thy owne goods. Neither will I thruſt my ſelfe into pouertie, but giue vp thoſe things, whoſe brightnes dimmed and dazeled me: that time which I was wont to beſtow in my gardens and houſes of pleaſure, I will imploy in recreation of minde. Thou art in the floure of thy age, and the regiment of thy Empire eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and ſetled many yeeres, and we thy old friends may betake our ſelues to reſt. This alſo ſhall redound to thy glorie, that thou haſt raiſed ſuch to great honors as could haue contented themſelues with a meane eſtate. Vnto which, <hi>Nero</hi> anſwered almoſt as followeth. That I am able extempore to anſwere thy premeditated oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I am principally indebted to thee, who hath inſtructed me how not onely to acquit &amp; diſcharge my ſelfe of things premeditat, but alſo of ſuch as happen on the ſudden. My great great grandfathers father <hi>Augustus</hi> ſuffered <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Mecenas</hi> after great labour to take their eaſe; but in ſuch an age, that his authoritie might main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine whatſoeuer had been beſtowed; yet he neuer tooke thoſe rewards from them he had once giuen them. In warre and dangers they had deſerued them, for in theſe things <hi>Augustus</hi> youth was employed: neyther would thy weapons and hands haue been wanting, if I had been in armes. But as the preſent ſtate of times required, thou diddeſt with reaſon, and counſell traine vp firſt my childhood, then my youth: and therefore the gifts which thou beſtowedſt vpon me, whileſt life laſteth ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine with me. Thoſe things which thou haſt receiued of me, thy orchyards, vſury, countrey houſes, are ſubiect to caſualtie; and although they ſeeme much, yet many not equall with thee in knowledge haue poſſeſſed more. I am aſhamed to ſpeake of ſuch as haue been ſlaues, which ſeeme richer then thou. And therefore I bluſh that thou, who in affection art deereſt vnto me, doeſt not ſurpaſſe all men in wealth and fortune. And thou art of thy age a luſtie man, and able to inioy thy wealth and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie thereof, and we enter into the firſt ſteps of the Empire; vnleſſe pardie thou doeſt preferre thy ſelfe before <hi>Vitellius</hi> thriſe Conſull, or me before <hi>Claudius.</hi> But how much <hi>Voluſius</hi> ſcraped by long ſparing, ſo much my liberalitie cannot fulfill towards thee. If the ſlipperines of our youth be ouerprone to that it ſhould not, thou draweſt it back, and tempereſt carefully with aduiſe our vnſeemely and vnruly cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.

ſhouldeſt forſake the Prince: but my couetouſnes, and the feare of my crueltie ſhall be in euery mans mouth.

The Galli became prechant at the name of a Dictator, and the people of Aſia no leſſe to be ſuſpected through the renowme of <hi>Druſus, Plautus</hi> grandfather. <hi>Sylla</hi> was poore and needie, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bold and venturous, and counterfeiting a lazines, vntill he found a fit oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie to ſhew his raſhnes. <hi>Plautus</hi> abounding in wealth, did not ſo much as pretend a deſire of a quiet life, but made open ſhew of imitating the old Romanes: hauing taken vpon him the arrogancie and ſect of the Stoicks, which maketh men buſie headed, and deſirous to be ſet aworke.</hi> Neither was there any further delay vſed but <hi>Sylla</hi> (thoſe which were to do the feate arriuing at Marſils the ſixt day) before feare or rumor, was ſlaine being ſet at table, and <hi>Nero</hi> skoffed when his head was brought him, as euilfauored by vntimely hoarines. But it was not ſo ſecretly kept that <hi>Plautus</hi> death was intended, becauſe many had a care of his ſafetie, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the iourney and ſea, and the time betweene, had ſpread it abroad; and giuen out among the common ſort, that he went about to ſturre vp <hi>Corbulo</hi> then lord ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ouer great armies, ſaying, that if noble and innocent perſonages were thus murdered, he was moſt likelie to come into danger. Further, Aſia had taken armes in fauour of this yong man, and the ſouldiers ſent to go forward with the enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, being neither ſtrong in number, nor in courage ſtout, ſeeing they could not performe that which they were enioyned, turned altogether to new hopes.

To be ſhort, either he muſt prouide for his ſafetie by ſuch counſell, or at all aduenture there can come no worſe to him by ſtoutnes then co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardiſe.</hi> But thoſe perſwaſions did nothing moue <hi>Plautus,</hi> either foreſeeing he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſufficient meanes, as being vnarmed, and a baniſht man, or for the irkeſomnes of doubtfull hope, or for the loue of his wife and children, to whom he thought the Prince would be more milde, if he troubled him not with care.

               <p>HAuing thus receiued a decree of Senate, and perceiuing that all his vngraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous actes were taken for worthie exploites, he putteth away <hi>Octauia,</hi> ſaying ſhe was barren, and marrieth <hi>Poppaea.</hi> She, long a concubine, and hauing power ouer him as an adulterer, then as her husband, procureth one of <hi>Octauiaes</hi> ſeruitors to accuſe her that ſhe was in loue with one <hi>Eucerus</hi> a bondman, a minſtrell, borne at Alexandria. Thereupon many bondwomen were tortured, ſome of them ouercome by extremitie of torment, yeelded to falſhood; and many ſtood ſtoutly in defence of their miſtres innocencie. Amongſt whom, one of them, <hi>Tigellinus</hi> ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly vrging hir, anſwered, that <hi>Octauiaes</hi> ſecret parts were chaſter then his mouth: yet at the firſt ſhe was put from him vnder colour of a lawfull diuorſe, and <hi>Burrhus</hi> houſe and <hi>Plautus</hi> poſſeſſions aſſigned her, both preſages of ill luck. Then ſhe was driuen into Campania, with a gard of ſouldiers; whereof grew many complaints and lamentations, and thoſe not in ſecret among the people, as hauing ſmall wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and little to loſe, ſo ſubiect to fewer dangers: by reaſon whereof, though no whit ſory of that he had done, <hi>Nero</hi> recalleth his wife <hi>Octauia,</hi> and the people very ioyfully went vp to the Capitoll, and worſhipped and thanked the gods, threw downe <hi>Poppaeas</hi> images, and bare <hi>Octauiaes</hi> on their ſhoulders, ſtrawed flomes on them, and placed them in the Forum and Temples, prayſed and honored the Prince for taking her againe. And now they had filled the pallace with multitudes and cries, when as companies of ſouldiers ſent, with blowes and threates, thruſtand ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered them ſome one way, ſome another; and changed all that the people had done
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:18166:114"/>
by ſedition, and reſtored <hi>Poppaeas</hi> images to their places againe. Who alwayes fell and cruell with hatred towards <hi>Octauia;</hi> and then with feare, leaſt a more forcible viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the people ſhould fall vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her; or <hi>Nero</hi> be changed, ſeeing how the people were affected, caſting herſelfe at his knees, ſayd: <hi rend="margQuotes">That ſhe ſtoode not now on thoſe termes that ſhe might reaſon of her marriage, (although ſhe eſteemed it more then her ſafty) but that ſhe was brought into da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of her life by <hi>Octauias</hi> clie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts &amp; ſlaues, which ſhadowing themſelues vnder the name of the people, durſt venter that in peace, which could hardly haue hapned in warre. Thoſe armes were taken againſt the Prince: there wanted only a Captaine, which in a tumult would eaſily be found. <hi>Octauia</hi> might now leaue Campania, and go to the citie, ſeeing that at a beck in her abſence ſuch tumults were raiſed. What fault had ſhe committed? whom had ſhe offended? Whether is it becauſe ſhe was likely to bring forth a true and lawfull progenie to the houſe of the <hi>Caeſars?</hi> would the people of Rome there ſhould be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther brought into the imperiall highnes the iſſue of a minſtrell of Aegypt? To be ſhort, if that be conuenient for the ſtate, he ſhould rather willingly then conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly call his miſtres, or looke to his ſafetie with iuſt reuenge. The firſt tumults are appeaſed by eaſie meanes: but if they did deſpaire of hauing <hi>Octauia</hi> for <hi>Neroes</hi> wife, they would prouide her a husband.</hi> This doubtfull ſpeech appliable to feare and anger, did both terrifie <hi>Nero,</hi> and incenſe him. But the ſuſpition of the ſlaue was of ſmall credit, and the torture of the bondwomen had made the matter cleere: therefore it was thought conuenient, to haue the confeſſion of ſome one, which might be charged with ſome practiſe againſt the ſtate. <hi>Anicetus</hi> the executioner of his mothers death ſeemed to be a fit inſtrument for the purpoſe, as I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſayd, Captaine of the nauie at Miſenum, in ſome ſmall fauour after the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanie committed, but anon after moſt odious, becauſe the miniſters of great villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are looked on as vpbraiders of the ſame. <hi>Caeſar</hi> then cauſing him to be ſent for, putteth him in mind of the former ſeruice, and telleth him that he only had been the ſafegard of his eſtate againſt his mothers treaſon, and that there was now an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie of no leſſe fauor, if he could rid him of his wife, which greatly diſliked him. Neither ſhould he neede hand or weapon, but only confeſſe he had committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery with <hi>Octauia:</hi> and promiſeth him great rewards, though for the preſent the world ſhould not know them, and pleaſant dwellings; or if he ſhould denie it, threatned him death. He like a blockhead as he was, his firſt villanie making an eaſie way to this, inuenteth more then was commanded, and confeſſeth it vnto ſuch of the Emperors friends, whoſe counſell as it were he had vſed in the plot. Then he was baniſhed into Sardinia, where he indured no poore exile, and died naturally. But <hi>Nero</hi> accuſed her that ſhe had corrupted the captaine of the gallies, in hope of winning him to her deuotion: and forgetting that not long before he had accuſed her of barrennes, publiſheth by edict, that to hide her licentious life, ſhe had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the children ſhe had had by others then by him, and that thereof he was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, and therefore baniſhed <hi>Octauia</hi> to the Iland Pandateria. No baniſhed wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man did euer moue the beholders to greater pitie then ſhe. Some did yet remember <hi>Agrippina</hi> exiled by <hi>Tiberius;</hi> and <hi>Iulia</hi> baniſhed by <hi>Claudius</hi> was freſher in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie: but both beſides the ſtrength of age, had taſted of ſome pleaſure, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted their preſent cruell hap with the remembrance of a better eſtate. Vnto this woman, her firſt day of marriage was in ſtead of a graue, being brought into a houſe in which ſhe could finde nothing but what was dolefull and lamentable: her father poiſoned, and her brother anon after. Then the maid greater then the miſtres, and <hi>Poppaea</hi> married for no other end, but to ruine her; and laſt of all a crime obiected
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:18166:114"/>
more grieuous then any death. But this yong princeſſe of the age of twentie yeeres, being betweene the Centurions and ſouldiers as it were alreadie depriued of life, with the preſage of ſo many miſeries, yet could not yeeld to death. A few daies after ſhe was commanded to be put to death, although ſhe proteſted ſhe was no wife, but a widow only, and a ſiſter of the Emperours, calling to <hi>Germanicus</hi> ghoſt to aid her, and <hi>Agrippinaes</hi> likewiſe, in whoſe lifetime ſhe ſhould indeede haue indured an vnhappie marriage, but without danger of death. Notwithſtanding ſhe was ſhut vp in priſon, and all the vaines of her bodie opened; but becauſe the bloud ſtopped with feare iſſued forth ſlowly, ſhe was killed with the vapor of a very hot bath. And a deadlier crueltie alſo added, that <hi>Poppaea</hi> ſaw her head cut off, and brought to the city; for all which it was decreed, that gifts ſhould be offered in the temples. Which we haue vttered, that who ſoeuer ſhall either by vs, or other writers, vnderſtand the euents of thoſe times, may be aſſured, that as oft as the Prince commaunded either baniſhment, or murder, ſo oft thanks were giuen to the gods; and thoſe things which in times paſt were marks of proſperitie, were then badges of publick calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Yet neuertheles we will not hold our toong if any decree of Senat hath beene ordained, new and ſtrange by flattery, or by baſe and abiect ſufferance.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hileſt theſe things thus paſſed, <hi>Vologeſes</hi> King of the Parthians, vnderſtanding what ſucceſſe <hi>Corbulo</hi> had in his affaires: and how <hi>Tiridates</hi> his brother being expulſed, and <hi>Tigranes</hi> a ſtranger made King of Armenia; reſolued to reuenge the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt offered the greatnes of the Arſacides: yet conſidering the great power of the Romans, and alliance a long time continued, was diuerſly perplexed, as one of his owne diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſlow and lingering; and then intangled with many warres by the reuolt of the Hyrcanians, a ſtrong and mightie nation. And as he thus wauered, he was further exaſperated by the newes of freſh iniurie: for <hi>Tigranes</hi> gone out of Armenia, had waſted and ſpoiled the Adiabenians, a nation bordering, farther and longer than any rodes of enemies heretofore. Which grieued not a little the chiefe noble men of that nation, that they were growen to that contempt, that they ſhould be forraged and robbed not of a Roman Captaine, but by the raſhnes of an hoſtage, ſo manie yeeres held and eſteemed no better than a bond-ſlaue. <hi>Monobazus</hi> gouernour of the Adiabenians augmented their griefe, asking them what remedie, or from whence? Armenia was alreadie gone, and the countrey adioyning would goe ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after: and vnleſſe the Parthians would defend them, thoſe which yeelded to the Romans ſhould find an eaſier ſeruitude, then thoſe which were taken. <hi>Tiridates</hi> chaſed out of the kingdome, by ſilence complayning not a little; was no ſmall griefe, telling them that great Empires were not maintained by cowardlines; but they muſt trie the valour both of men and armes. For among great Princes, he ſeemed to haue moſt reaſon and right, who had moſt ſtrength. And it was the praiſe of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate houſes to keepe their owne; but the glorie of a King to warre for other nations. <hi>Vologeſes</hi> being mooued with theſe ſpeeches, calleth a Councell, and placed <hi>Tirida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> hard by him, and thus began. <hi rend="margQuotes">This man, borne of the ſame father that I am, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing yeelded vnto me the name of the King in regard I am his elder, I did put in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Armenia, which is reckoned the third part of my kingdome. For the Medes <hi>Pacorus</hi> had before poſſeſſed; making account that in ſo doing I had taken away the inueterate hatred which raigneth between brothers, and fully ſetled the ſtate of our familie. The Romans hinder this, and now breake the peace alſo to their owne ruine, which they neuer yet diſturbed but to their owne deſtruction. I will not deny but I had rather hold things gotten by my anceſtors, by equitie then blood, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon then armes. If I haue offended by lingering, I will amend it with valour. Your ſtrength and glorie is intire with fame of modeſtie; which neither ought to be contemned of the higheſt, and is eſteemed of the gods.</hi> Hauing thus ſaid, he put the Diademe on <hi>Tiridates</hi> head; and gaue <hi>Moneſes</hi> a noble gentleman a gallant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of horſemen, which vſually followed the King, and withall the aide of the Adi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abenians;
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:18166:115"/>
and commaunded <hi>Tigranes</hi> to be chaſed out of Armenia: Whileſt he pacifiying the ſedition of the Hyrcanians, draweth his whole forces togither, and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt power of warre, threatning the Roman Prouinces. Whereof <hi>Corbulo</hi> being aduertiſed by certaine meſſengers, ſendeth two legions with <hi>Verulanus Seuerus,</hi> and <hi>Vectius Bolanus</hi> to aide <hi>Tigranes,</hi> with a ſecret charge they ſhould proceed rather or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and aduiſedly, then haſtily: for he had rather entertaine, than make warre. And wrote to <hi>Caeſar</hi> that it was needfull to haue a Captaine of purpoſe to defende Armenia; and that Syria by <hi>Vologeſes</hi> approach was in greater danger. And in the meane time he lodgeth the reſt of the legions by the banke Euphrates: leuieth and armeth in haſte a power of the countrey people, and intercepteth the enimies paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges with a garriſon. And bicauſe the countrey is ſcarce of water, he fortified hard by the fountaines, &amp; couered certain ſmall brookes with mounds of ſand. Whileſt <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulo</hi> vſed this preparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the defence of Syria, <hi>Moneſes</hi> becauſe he would preuent the rumour of his comming, marched with all ſpeed: but yet found not <hi>Tigranes</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduertiſed or vnprouided; who had put himſelfe into Tigranocerta, a verie ſtrong towne, well manned and walled. Beſides this, the riuer Nicephorius of a reaſonable breadth, enuironeth part of the wals, and a huge ditch caſt in length, where the riuer was diſtruſted as not ſufficient. There were ſouldiers within to man it, and prouiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of neceſſaries: for conueiyng whereof, ſome hauing beene too forward in ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing, and on the ſudden ſurpriſed by the enemie, enflamed the reſt rather with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, than feare. But the Parthian wanting courage to performe the aſſault at hand, ſpent a fewe arrowes a loofe; loſt his labour; and put the beſieged into no feare at all. The Adiabeni, as they began to raiſe ladders and other engines, were eaſily thruſt backe, and by a ſallie made by our men, hewd in peeces. Yet <hi>Corbulo,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding things proſpered on his ſide, thinking it his beſt to vſe fortune moderately, ſent ſome to <hi>Vologeſes,</hi> finding himſelfe greeued, that violence ſhould be offered the Prouince: and that a King confederate and a friend ſhould beſiege the Roman co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts; therefore that he ſhould giue vp the ſiege, or elſe he would incampe in the enimies countrey. <hi>Caſperius</hi> a Centurion choſen for that Embaſſie, went to the King at a towne called Niſibis, ſeuen and thirtie miles diſtant from Tigranocerta, and deliuered his meſſage verie ſtoutly. <hi>Vologeſes</hi> had long reſolued with himſelfe to auoide warres with the Romans: neither went things currantly with him for the preſent; the ſiege tooke no effect; <hi>Tigranes</hi> was ſtrong in men and prouiſion; the beſiegers put to flight; certaine legions were ſent to Armenia; and others in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines for Syria to aſſaile him in his owne countrey. That he had but a weake com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of horſeſmen; want of ſtower; for a multitude of Locuſts had eaten vp all graſſe and leaues. Therfore concealing his feare, and making ſhew of more milde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, anſwereth that he would ſend Ambaſſadors to the Emperour of Rome, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund Armenia and eſtabliſh a peace. And commaundeth <hi>Moneſes</hi> to depart from Tigranocerta, and himſelfe turned backe. Theſe things many extolled as proceeding from the Kings feare, and <hi>Corbuloes</hi> threatnings. Some conſtrued it that they had pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily agreed to forbeare warre on both ſides; and that <hi>Vologeſes</hi> departing, <hi>Tigranes</hi> ſhould alſo depart from Armenia. <hi rend="margQuotes">For why (ſaide they) went the Romans forces from Tigranocerta? Why were thoſe things abandoned in time of reſt, which they had defended in warre? Could they haue wintered better in the remote parts of Cappadocia, in cabbins erected on a ſudden, than in the chiefe ſeate of the kingdom lately poſſeſſed? Doubtles the warres were put off, that <hi>Vologeſes</hi> might rather fight with ſome other, then <hi>Corbulo. Corbulo</hi> would not indanger his glorie ſo manie yeeres alreadie gotten.</hi> For as I haue alreadie ſaid, he had demaunded a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:18166:116"/>
Captaine to defende Armenia; and notice came that <hi>Ceſennius Paetus</hi> was at hand, and by that time he was come. Their forces were ſo diuided, that the fourth and twelfth legions, and withall the fift which was lately called from the Moeſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and the aides of Pontus, Gallatia, and Cappadocia ſhould obey <hi>Paetus:</hi> the third, ſixt, and tenth legions, and the ſouldiers which before remained in Syria ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue with <hi>Corbulo.</hi> The reſt they would ioyne or diuide as occaſion ſerued. But neither <hi>Corbulo</hi> could endure a concurrent, and <hi>Paetus</hi> vnto whom it was ſufficient glorie, if he were reckoned the ſecond, made ſmall account of the ſeruice alreadie done, ſaying: that there hath beene no ſlaughter made, no bootie gayned; and that he had woon townes only with words, and not with deedes. He would impoſe tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes and lawes vpon them, and inſtead of a ſhadow of a King, he would force them to liue like conquered people vnder the Roman lawe. About the ſame time <hi>Vologeſes</hi> Ambaſſadors, as before I haue rehearſed ſent to the Prince, returned and nothing done. And the Parthians openly made warre; neither did <hi>Paetus</hi> drawe backe, but with two legions, whereof the fourth <hi>Famiſulanus Vectonianus</hi> conducted, and the twelfth <hi>Calauius Sabinus,</hi> he entered Armenia with an vnluckie preſage. For hauing made a bridge and paſſing ouer Euphrates, without any manifeſt cauſe, the horſe which bare the conſularie ornaments fled backeward, and eſcaped. And the beaſt readie for ſacrifice, neere to the winter campes which were a fortifiyng, the worke halfe finiſhed, brake looſe, and leapt ouer the trench: and the ſouldiers iauelins and darts were on a fire; the woonder ſo much the more to be noted, bicauſe the Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans fight with weapons throwen with the hand.</p>

               <p>BVt <hi>Paetus</hi> ſetting nought by ominous ſignes, nor hauing ſufficiently fortified his wintering campes, nor prouiſion of corne made, conducteth his armie in all haſt ouer the hill Taurus, to recouer (as he ſaide) the Tigranocertians, and to forrage the countries which <hi>Corbulo</hi> had left vntouched. And ſome caſtles he tooke, and ſome glorie and ſome bootie he wanne, if he had vſed his glorie with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and his bootie with circumſpection. Hauing by long iourneies ouerrun thoſe places which he could not keepe, and that the prouiſion of victuals was ſpoiled and corrupted which he had taken, and the winter now at hand, he brought his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie backe againe: and ſent letters to <hi>Caeſar</hi> as though the warre had beene ended, in wordes magnificent; but voide of matter. In the meane ſeaſon <hi>Corbulo</hi> hauing had alwaies a ſpeciall care of the bankes of Euphrates; lodged on them now a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtrength of garriſons, then before he had: and leaſt the enimie troupes ſhould hinder the making a bridge (for they braued it with a gallant ſhew in the champion which lay vnder them) he brought vp the riuer veſſels of huge bignes, ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither with timber worke, and built towres on them; beating off the Barbarians with ſtones and ſpeares out of Baliſtas and other engines, let flie farther, than that the countrey ſhot of arrowes, could match vs with the like againe. The bridge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued and finiſhed, the oppoſite hils were ſeaſed by the cohorts of allies, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward poſſeſſed by the campe of the legions, with ſuch great celeritie and ſhew of puiſſant forces, that the Parthians, all preparation of inuading Syria omitted, turned all their hope againſt Armenia. There <hi>Paetus</hi> ignorant what was at hand, had the fift legion far from him in Pontus: and had weakned the reſt by inconſiderate licenſing the ſoldiers to depart, vntill newes was brought that <hi>Vologeſes</hi> came with a great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie reſolutely bent to do great miſchiefe.

that thereby it would be noiſed that his forces were increaſed; but indeed that bewrayed his weakenes, with which neuer theleſſe he might haue incamped: and the Parthian deluded by drawing the warre in length, if <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

But he by men experienced in warre being counſelled what was beſt againſt imminent caſualties, leaſt he ſhould ſeeme to haue neede of thers aduiſe, would do quite contrarie and much woorſe. And then forſaking his ſtanding campes, crying that he had no trench and rampire giuen him againſt the enimie, but bodies and weapons, iſſued out with the legions, as though he would fight a field. And hauing loſt a Centurion and a few ſouldiers, ſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to view the enimies forces, came backe againe greatly affrighted. And bicauſe <hi>Vologeſes</hi> came on but coldly, reſuming againe a vaine hope, lodged three thouſand choiſe men on the top of the hill Taurus hard by, to hinder the King to paſſe. He placed alſo certaine cornets of Pannonians, which were the ſtrength and ſinewes of his horſemen, in one part of the plaine. His wife and ſonne were ſhut vp in a caſtle called Arſamoſata, and a cohort appointed to guarde them; and thus diſperſed the ſouldiers, which vnited in one, would much better haue made head againſt the ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled and rouing enimie. It is reported that he was hardly brought to confeſſe vnto <hi>Corbulo</hi> that the King was at hand: neither did <hi>Corbulo</hi> make any great haſte, to the end that the dangers growing great, his own praiſe in ſuccouring might be the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Neuertheleſſe he commaunded three thouſand to be ſet forwarde out of the three legions; eight hundred horſe, and the like number out of the auxiliarie co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts. But <hi>Vologeſes</hi> although he had vnderſtood that the paſſages were ſhut vp by <hi>Paetus</hi> on the one ſide with footmen, and on the other with horſmen, nothing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering his determination; what with violence, what with threatnings, hauing put the horſemen to flight, broke the legionaries; one onely Centurion <hi>Tarquitius Creſcens</hi> hauing courage to defend himſelfe in a towre wherein he had a garriſon: making often ſallies, and ſlaying ſuch Barbarians as came neere, vntill he was forced by fire to yeeld. Of the footemen if any was vnhurt he fled to bye-places a farre off, the wounded returned to the campe; extolling the valour of the King; the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie and number of his ſouldiers, and all elſe for feare; ſuch eaſily beleeuing them as were in the like perplexitie. The Captaine himſelfe not once endeuoruing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie the calamitie, neglected all duties of ſeruice, and ſent againe to intreat <hi>Corbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi> that he would come away in all poſte haſte, to defend the enſignes and ſtandarts, and the onely name left of the vnfortunate armie: he for his owne part would whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt life laſted remaine faithfull.</p>

them, put them in minde of their old valour, and what occaſion they had to win new glory. <hi rend="margQuotes">That they ſought not now villages and townes of Armenia for a reward of their trauels, but Roman camps, and amongſt them two legions. If vnto euery common ſouldier, the crowne was giuen by the Emperors hands, as a ſpeciall honor to him who had ſaued one citizen only, how great and worthie an honor ſhall it be when the like number ſhall be ſeene of the ſuccourers &amp; ſuccoured.</hi> And with theſe and the like incouragements generally cheered, (and ſome there were whom their brothers perils and neere kindred inflamed of their owne proper motions) they haſtned their iourney day and night. <hi>Vologeſes</hi> ſo much the more eagerly purſueth the beſieged, now aſſailing the trench of the legions, now the fort, where the feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or aged had fled for defence, approching neerer then the Parthians cuſtome is, to allure by temeritie his enemie to battell. But the Romans hardly haled out of their cabins, did but defend their rampires, part at the commaundement of the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and others by their owne cowardlines, looking for <hi>Corbulo;</hi> and if they ſhould be put to any diſtreſſe, purpoſed to ſhift for themſelues by the example of the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe at Caudina and Numantina. Neither had the Samnites people of Italie, nor the people of Carthage which contended for greatnes with the Romans, ſo great power as the Parthians. Their aunceſtors alſo, both valiant and commended of all, when fortune croſſed them prouided for their ſafetie. By which deſperation <hi>Paetus,</hi> the generall of the armie vtterly caſt downe, yet ſent not his firſt letters to <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logeſes</hi> in humble ſort, but in manner of a complaint: <hi rend="margQuotes">That he vſed hoſtilitie againſt the Armenians, ſubiect alwaies to the Romans, or to a King choſen by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. That peace was alike profitable to both. That he ſhould not regard things preſent only. That he was come againſt two legions with all the power of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but the Romains had the whole world beſides at commandement to aide the warre. Vologeſes</hi> anſwered nothing touching the matter, but that he was to expect his brothers <hi>Pacorus</hi> and <hi>Tiridates,</hi> and that that place and time was appointed to conſult of Armenia. * And that the gods had fauored them ſo much, being a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter worthy of the Arſacides greatnes, that withall they could determine of the Roman legions. After that, <hi>Paetus</hi> ſent meſſengers to intreate a parly with the King, who commanded <hi>Vaſaces</hi> captaine of the horſe to go. Then <hi>Paetus</hi> beginneth with the <hi>Luculli, Pompei,</hi> and ſuch other Captaines as had conquered and giuen away Armenia. <hi>Vaſaces</hi> anſwered, that the Romaines had but a ſhadow of holding and giuing away of Armenia, and that the right and power was with the Parthians. And hauing ſufficiently debated the matter on both ſides, <hi>Monobazus Adiabenus</hi> the next day was called a witnes of their agreement: which was, that the legions ſhould no longer be beſieged, and all the ſouldiers depart out of the bounds of Armenia, and all forts and prouiſions to be deliuered to the Parthians: which done, that <hi>Vologeſes</hi> ſhould haue licence to ſend Embaſſadors to <hi>Nero.</hi> In the meane ſpace <hi>Paetus</hi> built a bridge ouer the riuer Arſamites, which ran by the camp, vnder colour of paſſing that way: but the Parthians had commanded it to be done as a token of the victorie, for it ſerued their turne, and our men went another way.

               <p>MOſt certaine it was, the beſieged had ſuch ſtore of corne left, that they fired their ſtorehouſes; and on the other ſide <hi>Corbulo</hi> declared, that the Parthians were in want of all neceſſarie prouiſion, and their ſtouer all conſumed, ready to haue forſaken the ſiege, and himſelfe but three dayes iourney off.

The captaines vſed few words, and thoſe complaining that their labour was loſt, that the warre might haue beene ended with the flight of the enemie. <hi>Paetus</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that all was whole and in good ſtate to them both, that they ſhould turne their enſignes, and iointly inuade Armenia, weakened by <hi>Vologeſes</hi> abſence. <hi rend="margQuotes">
                     <hi>Corbulo</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he had no ſuch commiſſion from the Emperour: that he had gone out of the prouince moued with the danger of the legions; and ſeeing that the Parthians at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts were vncertaine, he would returne to Syria. And that he was to pray for good fortune, that his footemen wearied with trauelling ſo farre afoote, might o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertake the Kings horſemen going before cheerefully, hauing the aduantage of the countrey.

And in the end the King yeelded to it, and the fortreſſes which <hi>Corbulo</hi> had made beyond Euphrates were pulled downe, and the Armenians left to their will. But at Rome, trophees and triumphant arches were erected in ſigne of victorie ouer the Parthians, in the middle of the Capitol, by order of Senate, the warre yet freſh and not finiſhed, only for a faire ſhew, no conſcience made whether by deſert or not. Yea <hi>Nero,</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the cares of forren affaires, did caſt corne into Tyber, corrupted by the peoples ouer-long keeping it, to ſhew thereby a ſecuritie and plentie of victuals: the price nothing enhanced, although almoſt two hundred ſhips were caſt away by tempeſt in the very hauen, and a hundred brought vp Tyber conſumed by caſuall fire. After that, he appointed three Conſuls, <hi>L. Piſo, Ducennius Geminus, Pompeius
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:18166:118"/>
Paullinus,</hi> to take charge of the tribute, with an inuectiue againſt other Princes, which by exceſſe of expenſes, ſpent more then the reuenewes came to, and he would beſtow yeerely on the common wealth * threeſcore millions of ſeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. There was a very bad cuſtome commonly practiſed at that time when the <note place="margin">About 68750. pound.</note> chooſing of officers was at hand, or caſting lots for gouerment of prouinces; which was, that many which were without children, colourably adopted ſome, and being thereby admitted amongſt the Lords to draw lots for Pretorſhips and Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, immediately after manumiſed thoſe they had adopted. Whereupon, thoſe which had children went to the Senat with a great complaint, declaring the law of nature, the labour in bringing vp of children, againſt the fraud and deceit and ſhort time of adoption. <hi rend="margQuotes">That it was a ſufficient recompenſe to the childeleſſe, that with great ſecuritie, without charge, they had credit, honors, and all things elſe offered them. That to them the promiſes of lawes long expected were turned into a ieſt, when a man without care, a father, without mourning, childleſſe, would on the ſudden be equall with the long deſires of fathers.</hi> Whereupon a decree of Senate was made, that fained adoption ſhould not benefit in any part to any publicke charge, nor yet to ſucceede in others inheritances.</p>

So the licence of orators was cauſe of the lawe Cincia; the ſuing of competitors of the Iulian lawes; the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetuouſnes of magiſtrates of the Calpurnian decrees.

The Senate had alreadie commended <hi>Poppaeas</hi> wombe to the gods, and had made publick vowes; which were multiplied and performed.

Which gaue occaſion of new flatterings; ſome being of aduiſe that ſhe ſhould be honored like a goddeſſe, with a bed, a Temple, and a Prieſt. And <hi>Nero</hi> himſelf as before he was without meaſure glad; ſo now moſt ſorrowfull. It was noted that when all the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ranne to Antium at the new birth of the childe, and <hi>Thraſeas</hi> forbidden: he tooke the contumelious repulſe with a ſtout courage, as a preſage of his imminent ouerthrow. It was reported, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> bragged to <hi>Seneca,</hi> that he was reconciled to <hi>Thraſea,</hi> and that <hi>Seneca</hi> was glad thereof. From whence grew at once glorie and danger to woorthie men.

with the chiefeſt of the citie, whether it were beſt to make a doubtfull war with the enemie, or peace. It was not doubted but warre. And <hi>Corbulo</hi> ſo many yeeres practiſed in warres, knowing the ſouldiers and the enimies, had the generall charge giuen him, leaſt there ſhould be a new errour committed by ſome others vnskilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: for of <hi>Paetus</hi> bad gouerment, they were ſorrie and repented. Whereupon they were ſent backe without any concluſion, yet with gifts; whereby it might be hoped that <hi>Tiridates</hi> ſhould not aske in vaine, if he came by way of intreatie. The gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Syria was committed to <hi>Cintius;</hi> the ſtrength of warre to <hi>Corbulo;</hi> and the fifteenth legion vnder the conduct of <hi>Marius Celſus</hi> was brought out of Pannonia.

                  <hi>VII. Tiridates</hi> ſpeaketh with <hi>Corbulo:</hi> and yeeldeth vp the crovvne of Armenia in the Roman campe.</head>
               <p>THe day appointed, <hi>Tiberius Alexander,</hi> a noble gentleman of Rome, giuen as an aide to the warre, and <hi>Viuianus Annius, Corbuloes</hi> ſonne in lawe, not yet of age to be Senator; but aſſigned in the place of the Lieutenant of the fift legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, came to <hi>Tiridates</hi> campe to do him honour: and that hauing ſuch pledges he ſhould feare no treacherie. And then were taken twentie horſemen on each ſide. And the King ſeeing <hi>Corbulo,</hi> lighted firſt from his horſe; and <hi>Corbulo</hi> did the like im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and both of them on foote, ioyned right hands. Then the Roman praiſed the yoong Prince, that leauing dangerous vncertainties, he would imbrace ſure and wholeſome counſell. <hi>Tiridates</hi> hauing ſpoken much of the noblenes of his ſtocke, in the reſt was temperate, ſaying: that he would goe to Rome, and bring <hi>Caeſar</hi> newe glorie: <hi>Arſacides</hi> humblie intreating, the Parthians being daunted with no aduerſe encounter. Then ſeemed it good that <hi>Tiridates</hi> ſhould lay his royall crowne before <hi>Caeſars</hi> image, and not take it againe but at the hand of <hi>Nero;</hi> and ſo the ſpeech was ended with a ſhort ſalutation. A few dayes after, with a great pomp on both parts, they ſhewed themſelues, his horſemen ranged into troupes on one ſide, with the enſignes of his countrey; and on the other the armie of the legions marſhalled in order with glittering ſtandards, and enſignes and images of the gods in manner of a temple. In the middle was planted a tribunall, and in it a chaire of eſtate, with <hi>Neroes</hi> image; vnto which <hi>Tiridates</hi> went, and ſacrifices offered according to the cuſtome, taketh the crowne from his head, and laide it vnder the image; which troubled the minds of ſuch as had yet before their eyes the ſlaughter and beſieging of the Romane armies. But now fortune was changed, and <hi>Tiridates</hi> a ſpectacle to the people; how much better then a captiue? <hi>Corbulo</hi> added to his glorie courteſie and feaſtings: and as the King marked any ſtrange thing, and asked the cauſe; as the beginnings of the watches brought by the Centurion, the banket ended with a trumpet, the pile of wood before the Augural altar lighted with a torch: <hi>Corbulo</hi> made him anſwere, extolling euery thing more then it was, to draw the new Prince into an admiration of the old cuſtome. The laſt day when he was to take his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, he deſired time to viſit his brothers and mother before his departure, and left his daughter for an hoſtage in the meane ſpace, and letters of ſubmiſſion to be ſent to <hi>Nero.</hi> And departed thence, he found <hi>Pacorùs</hi> with the Medes, and <hi>Vologeſes</hi> at Ecbatanes, not vnmindfull of his brother: for he had requeſted of <hi>Corbulo</hi> by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall meſſengers, that <hi>Tiridates</hi> might not ſhew any token of ſeruitude, or deliuer vp his weapons, or be barred from imbracing the gouernors of prouinces, or attend at their dores; but haue the ſame honor at Rome that the Conſuls had. Being accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to forren pride, he was vnacquainted with our manners, with whom the lawe of rule and dominion beareth ſway, vanities being laid aſide. The ſame yeere <hi>Caeſar</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored the nations of the ſea Alpes with the rights and priuiledges of the Latians, and in the Cirque placed the Gentlemen of Rome before the people. For vntill that day they ſate indifferently, becauſe the lawe Roſcian had taken no order but for foureteene orders.

               <p>C. <hi>Lecanius,</hi> and <hi>M.

Yet he durſt not begin at Rome, but choſe Naples as a Greeke citie, thinking that that might ſerue for a commencement to goe to Achaia, where hauing obtained the famous, and in times paſt reputed ſacred crownes, &amp; by that meanes grown in credit, he thought he ſhould ſtur a great deſire in the citizens of Rome to heare him. The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>món rabble flocked together, or ſuch as the fame of thoſe plaies had drawne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the next colonies &amp; townes, and ſuch as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him either to do him honor, or ſundrie other occaſions; yea companies of ſouldiers filled the Theater of Naples. There hapned as moſt men thought, a dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full chance, but yet as he conſtrued it, foretokening good luck, and ſent by the fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable prouidence of the gods. For the people were no ſooner gone, and the Theater emptie, but it fell downe, without hurt done to any. Therfore with ſongs compoſed for the purpoſe, thanking the gods, and celebrating the fortune of the late chance, going to the Adriatike ſea, he ſtayed in the meane time at Beneuentum, where, by <hi>Vatinius</hi> was exhibited a notable play of Fencers. <hi>Vatinius</hi> was one of the ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt monſters of his court, brought vp in a coblers ſhop, miſhapen of bodie, and a ſcurrile ieſter: and therefore firſt emploied in that practiſe; then by pickthanking and informing againſt the better ſort, grew to ſuch authoritie, that in credit and wealth, and power of doing hurt, he was worſe then the worſt. <hi>Nero</hi> then comming to the play he had ſet forth, no not at their paſtime did they abſtaine from doing of miſchiefe. For the ſelfeſame daye <hi>Torquatus Silanus</hi> was conſtrained to dye, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that beſides the noblenes of the <hi>Iunian</hi> familie, he ſayd, that he was in the fourth degree lineally deſcended from <hi>Augustus</hi> of famous memorie. The accuſers were commaunded to lay to his charge, that he was prodigall in gifts, and that all his hope lay in the alteration of the ſtate. And that he had noble men about him which he called his Secretaries, maiſters of requeſts, &amp; Auditors, which were names of imperiall dignitie, and deſeignments of great attempts. Then the chiefeſt of his freed men were bound and caried away. And when <hi>Torquatus</hi> condemnation was at hand, he cut the vaines of his armes, and <hi>Nero</hi> as his manner was, made an ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion after: that although he had beene culpable, and worthily diſtruſted his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, yet he ſhould haue had his life graunted him, if he would haue expected the Iudges clemencie. Not long after forſaking Achaia for the preſent (the cauſes were vncertaine) he came againe to Rome, hammering greatly with himſelfe of going to the prouinces of the Eaſt, and eſpecially Aegypt. Then by an edict witneſſing his abſence ſhould not be long, and that all ſhould go well with the common wealth, he went to the Capitol to worſhip the gods. And as he entered the temple of <hi>Veſta,</hi> taken ſuddenly with a ſhaking ouer all his bodie, either the goddeſſe of the place terrifying him; or the remembrance of his villanies alwaies accompanying him with feare, he changed his determination; affirming, <hi rend="margQuotes">that all cares, were nothing to him, in regard of the loue of his countrey; that he had ſeene the ſad countenances of the citizens, heard their ſecret complaints, why he ſhould go about ſo great a iourney, whoſe ſhort and reaſonable abſence they could not indure; as men wont to be

comforted with the ſight of the Prince againſt all croſſes and aduerſities. Therefore as in priuat friendſhips, the neereſt pledges and kindred are moſt deereſt; ſo the people of Rome had great power ouer him, and that he muſt obey them, ſeeing they kept him from going.</hi> Theſe and the like ſpeeches were pleaſing to the people, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of paſtimes, and which was their chiefeſt care fearing want of corne if he ſhould be abſent. The Lords of the Senate and the nobilitie knew not whether he were more cruell farre off, or neere: then as the nature of all great feare is, they beleeued that which hapned to be worſt. He to win an opinion that he was no where ſo merrie as in the citie, made bankets in publick places, and vſed the whole citie as it had beene his owne houſe. Thoſe bankets were moſt ſpoken of for riot and fame, which <hi>Tigellinus</hi> prepared, which I will lay downe as a parerne of all, leaſt the ſame waſtfulnes ſhould be often repeated. In <hi>Agrippaes</hi> lake therefore he built a boate, whereon the banket was drawne with other boates. The boates were beſet with gold and Iuory. The rowers were ſtale Catamites, placed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their age and skill of vnnaturall vncleannes. He had prepared Fowle, and wilde beaſts out of diuers countries, and out of the Ocean. On the brinke of the poole were brothell houſes, filled with noble women: and ouer againſt them were common ſtrumpets naked, vſing filthie geſtures and behauiour. And when the night was come, all the wood and houſes about rang with ſinging, and ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with lightes. <hi>Nero</hi> himſelfe defiled with lawfull, and vnnaturall luſts, left no wickednes vndone, becauſe he would be moſt corrupt. And a few dayes after, he was wedded as it had been ſolemnely to one of that polluted crew, called <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras.</hi> The Emperour was couered with a yellow vaile.

               <p>THere followed a great misfortune, but whether by chaunce, or deuiſe of the Prince, vncertaine: for authors haue affirmed both: but of all, the greateſt and moſt grieuous that euer chanced to this citie, by violence of fire. It began in that part of the Cirque that ioyneth to the hils Palatine &amp; Caelian: then taking in the ware-houſes wherein was marchandiſe, which nouriſhed the fire, increaſing more and more by the blowing of the winde, burnt all the length of the Cirque. Neither were the houſes compaſſed with any defences, or temples walled, or any thing elſe to ſtay the furie of it. But ſpreading with violence, conſumed firſt the plaine, then riſing to the hils, againe waſting the low places, by ſwiftnes of hurt preuented the remedies, the citie being ſubiect to it by reaſon of the narrownes of the ſtreetes, turning and winding lanes on euery hand, and vnorderly as it was in old Rome.

Neither was there any man which durſt to quench it, through the often threatning of many which hindered them: yea ſome openly threw burning fire-brands into it, and cryed alowd, that they had a warrant for it, either becauſe they might rob and ſteale more licentiouſly, or becauſe they were ſo commaunded. <hi>Nero</hi> being then at Antium, came not to the citie vntill the fire was come neere his owne houſe, on that ſide that it ioyned with the pallace and <hi>Maecenas</hi> orchardes. Yet it could not be hindered from burning his houſe and pallace, and all elſe round about. But to giue ſome co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort to the chaſed &amp; fugitiue people, he opened Campus Martius, and the monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and his own gardens: and erected buildings in haſte to receiue the needie multitude. Vtenſiles were brought from Hoſtia and other neere townes, and the price of corne brought downe vnto <note n="*" place="margin">Fiue pence b. q.</note> three nummos. All which although done in fauour of the people, yet was not accepted; bicauſe a rumor was ſpread, that at the verie time that the citie was on fire, he went to the ſtage in his houſe, and ſang the deſtruction of Troy, comparing preſent calamities with old diſaſters. At laſt, on the ſixt day, the fire ended at the bottom of the Eſquilin hill, by beating downe a huge number of buildings, that the fielde and as it were the open heauen, might withſtand and encounter the continuall rage. And before the feare was paſt, it began afreſh, but not ſo terriblie in open places of the citie, and therfore the hurt of people the leſſe: but the Temples of the gods, and galleries deuoted to pleaſure, were almoſt all ruined. The obloquie of that fire was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, bicauſe it burſt out to <hi>Tigellinus</hi> houſes of pleaſure, ſometimes belonging to the Aemylians. And it ſeemed that <hi>Nero</hi> ſought the glorie of building a new citie, and calling it by his name. For Rome was diuided into fourteene wardes: whereof fower were vntouched; three conſumed to the ground: of the other ſeauen, ſome markes of buildings remained, but rent and halfe burnt. It were no eaſie matter to reckon the number of houſes, and buildings ſtanding by themſelues, called Iles, and Temples which were conſumed: but the auncienteſt in regard of religion, as the Temple which <hi>Seruius Tullius</hi> built in honour of the Moone; and the great altar and Temple which <hi>Arcas Euander</hi> conſecrated to <hi>Hercules;</hi> the Temple of <hi>Iupiter Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> vowed by <hi>Romulus; Numaes</hi> pallace; and the Temple of <hi>Vesta</hi> with the peculiar gods of the people of Rome, were conſumed and burnt to aſhes. Now wealth got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in ſo many victories, excellent workes of the Greekes inuentions, then old and perfect monuments of rare wits, which in ſo beautifull a citie, and flouriſhing more and more, with manie other notable antiquities, auncient men haue obſerued and ſpoken of, which could not be recouered. Some there were which noted, that this fire beganne the fourteenth Kalends of Iulie, on which the Senones burnt the citie after they had taken it. Some were ſo diligent therein, that they counted iuſt ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeeres, and moneths, and daies betweene both the fires.</p>

and audacitie to enterpriſe that by arte which nature had denied, and fooliſhly caſt away the Princes wealth. For they had vndertaken to make a nauigable ditch from the lake Auerne, vnto the mouth of Tyber alo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the rough and hard ſhore, or through the oppoſite mountaines. Neither is there any other moiſture to feede the waters, but the marſhes of Pomptina: other places being vneuen craggie grounds, or drie; and if they could be wrought through, it would be an intollerable labour, and no cauſe why. <hi>Nero</hi> notwithſtanding, deſirous to bring incredible things to paſſe, laboured to digge the hils adioyning to Auerne: where remaine the markes of his vaine hope to this day. But the houſes which were ruined were not built without order, here and there as when the Galli had fired them: but the ſtreetes drawen by meaſure and proportion, with ſpatious and large waies; the buildings reſtrained to a certaine height, and the courts made wide, and galleries added to defend the front of the houſes called Iles: which galleries <hi>Nero</hi> promiſed to builde at his owne charges, and deliuer them to their maſters, the courts and floores made cleane. And gaue rewardes according to euerie mans degree and wealth: and prefixed a time, within which the houſings finiſhed, or Iles, their maſters ſhould receiue them. The mariſhes of Hoſtia were appointed to receiue the rubbiſh: and that the veſſels which brought corne vp the riuer Tibris, ſhould be loaden downe with rubbiſh: and that ſome part of the buildings themſelues, without timber ſhould be built with ſtone of Gabi and Albanum, which cannot be damnified with fire. Now, that water inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by priuate men to their owne vſe from the citie, might more aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly flowe in manie publicke places, there were watchmen appointed to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee it: and that euerie man ſhould haue ſome prouiſions to quench fires: and that euerie houſe ſhould be inuironed with his owne wals, and not common to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Which being ordained for the publicke commoditie, brought ornament to the new citie. Yet ſome were of opinion that the old faſhion of building was more wholeſome, bicauſe the narrownes of the waies, and height of the houſes, could not ſo eaſily be pearced with the heat of the ſunne. But now the ſtreetes being open and wide, and vndefended from ſhadow they are ſcorched with greater heat. And theſe things were prouided by mans counſell. Anone after, purging ſacrifices were ſought for of the gods, &amp; the Sibyls books peruſed; by aduertiſement of which, praiers were offered to <hi>Vulcane</hi> and <hi>Ceres,</hi> and <hi>Proſerpina;</hi> and <hi>Iuno</hi> made fauourable by the matrons, firſt in the Capitoll, then at the next ſea. From which hauing drawen water, the Temple and the image of the goddeſſe was ſprinkled, and the married wiues prepared banqueting beds, and watcht in the Temple in honour of the ſame goddeſſe. But the infamie was not wiped away, neither by mans helpe, nor lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſe of the Prince, or pacifiyng of the gods; but that it was thought the fire came by commandement. Therefore to extinguiſh the rumour, <hi>Nero</hi> falſly accuſed and puniſhed moſt grieuouſly certaine people, hated for their wickednes <note n="*" place="margin">The author being no Chriſtian, calleth Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian religion <hi>Maleficium.</hi>

Firſt they were apprehended which confeſſed that religion; then by their detection, an infinite multitude were conuicted, not ſo much for ſetting the towne on fire, as for the hate of all men againſt them. Such as were condemned, were skorned and mocked, and couered in wilde beaſts skins, and torne in peeces with dogs; or faſtened on croſſes; or burnt in fire: and when the day failed, they were burnt in the night to giue light.

               <p>IN the meane time Italie was waſted by contributions and borrowing of money; the Prouinces ruined; and the confederats of the people of Rome empoueriſhed; and the cities which were called free. Yea the gods themſelues were not priuile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from being made a pray: but the Temples in the citie were robbed, and the gold carried away, which the people of Rome in all ages, either in triumphes or vowes, in proſperitie or feare, had dedicated to the gods. Yea in Achaia and Aſia, not onely gifts, but the images of the gods were taken away, <hi>Acratus,</hi> and <hi>Secundus Carinates</hi> being ſent thither of purpoſe. The one a freed man readie to all villanies: the other exerciſed in the Greekiſh learning, in words onely, but his minde not ſeaſoned with any good artes. It was reported that <hi>Seneca,</hi> becauſe he would ſhake from himſelfe the infamie of ſacriledge, deſired licence to depart to ſome countrey houſe a far off: which not being graunted, he fained himſelfe ſicke of the gout and kept his chamber. Some haue giuen out that poiſon was prepared him at <hi>Neroes</hi> commandement, by a freed man of his owne, called <hi>Cleonicus,</hi> and auoided by <hi>Seneca,</hi> as forewarned by the freed man, or by his owne feare, ſuſtained his life with a ſimple diet, Crabbes, and if he were a thirſt with running water. About the ſame time the Fencers at Preneſte offering to make an eſcape, were hindered by a guarde of ſouldiers which watched them: the people both fearful and deſirous of nouelties, &amp; now muttering &amp; whiſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of <hi>Spartacus,</hi> and calling to minde the hurts which happened in times paſt. Not long after newes came of a great misfortune by ſea; not by warre (for a more firme peace was ſeldome ſeeme) but <hi>Nero</hi> had commaunded the nauie to returne by a certaine day to Campania, not excepting the hazards of the ſea.

               <p>AFter that <hi>Silius Nerua,</hi> and <hi>Atticus Vestinus</hi> entered the Conſulſhip, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracie was begun, and growen ſtrong againſt <hi>Nero:</hi> vnto which Senators, gentlemen, ſouldiers, and women gaue their names auie, as well for the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:18166:122"/>
they bare <hi>Nero,</hi> as good will to <hi>L. Piſo.</hi> He was deſcended from the Calpurnians, and of great nobilitie by the fathers ſide; in high reputation with the people for his vertue, or apparances like vnto vertue: his eloquence he had imployed in defence of the citizens: vſed liberalitie towards his friends; and to ſtrangers courteſie and affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie. He had alſo the gifts of fortune: was of a tall ſtature, and comely counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; but grauitie in behauior he was farre from, or moderation in pleaſures. He gaue himſelfe to courteſie, bountie, and ſometimes to diſſolutenes: which many allowed of, thinking it not neceſſarie, that in ſo great ſweetnes of vices, he, who was deſtined to higheſt rule, ſhould be ſtreight-laced, or ouer ſeuere. The beginning of the conſpiracie proceeded not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his own deſire: yet can I not eaſily tell, who was the firſt author, or at whoſe inſtigation that was begun, which ſo many enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. The forwardeſt to haue bin <hi>Subrius Flauius,</hi> Tribune of the Pretorian cohort, &amp; <hi>Sulpitius Aſprus,</hi> a Centurion, the conſtancie of their end doth ſhew. And <hi>Lucanus Annaeus,</hi> and <hi>Plautius Lateranus,</hi> Conſull elect, came with deadly hatred againſt him. Peculiar cauſes enflamed <hi>Lucan,</hi> becauſe <hi>Nero</hi> ſuppreſſed the fame of his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and had forbidden him to publiſh them, vainely comparing his owne vnto them. <hi>Lateranus</hi> Conſull elect, no iniurie, but loue of the common wealth aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated vnto them. But <hi>Flauius Sceuinus,</hi> and <hi>Afranius Quinctianus,</hi> both Senators, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke the action, contrary to the opinion which was had of them. For <hi>Sceuinus</hi> bare a laſciuious mind, and therfore led a lazie &amp; drowſie life: <hi>Quinctianus</hi> infamous of his bodie, and defamed by <hi>Nero,</hi> by reprochfull verſes, ſought to reuenge his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie. Therefore diſcourſing among themſelues, or with their friends, of the Princes wickednes; that the Empire drew to an end; and that choiſe was to be made of one to ſupport the afflicted ſtate, aſſociated vnto them <hi>Tullius Senecio, Ceruarius Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, Vulcatius Araricus, Iulius Tugurinus, Munatius Gratus, Antonius Natalis, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Festus,</hi> gentlemen of Rome: among which <hi>Senecio</hi> hauing been of <hi>Neroes</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward familiaritie, and then retaining a ſhadow of friendſhip, was perplexed with the imagination of many dangers. <hi>Natalis</hi> was a partaker of all <hi>Piſoes</hi> ſecrets. The reſt hoped after a change. Beſides <hi>Subrius</hi> and <hi>Sulpitius,</hi> whom I haue ſpoken of for greater ſtrength, there were drawne in <hi>Granius Siluanus,</hi> and <hi>Statius Proximus,</hi> Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes of the Pretorian cohorts, <hi>Maximus Scaurus,</hi> and <hi>Venetus Paullus</hi> Centurions. But for chiefeſt ſtrength, they relied on <hi>Fenius Rufus,</hi> captaine of the gard, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for life and reputation worthie praiſe: <hi>Tigellinus</hi> through his crueltie and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane life, ſurpaſſed in credit and fauour with the Prince, and charging him with many falſe accuſations, brought <hi>Caeſar</hi> oft into a feare, as if he had plaied the adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer with <hi>Agrippina,</hi> and therefore for loue of her, carefully plotting a reuenge. Therefore when the conſpirators were fully aſſured by his owne often ſpeeches, that the captaine of the gard was one of their faction, they were now more readie to conſult of the time and place of the murder. It is reported that <hi>Subrius Flauius</hi> had a ſudden motion to ſet vpon <hi>Nero</hi> ſinging on the ſtage, or running hither and thither in the night vngarded, his houſe being on fire: on the one ſide the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of finding him alone; on the other, the companie of people, witnes of ſo worthy an exploit pricked forward his moſt valiant courage, if the deſire of eſcaping (an eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to all great attempts) had not kept him back. In the meane time, betweene hope and feare lingering and deferring, one <hi>Epicharis,</hi> vnknowne by what meanes ſhe came to the knowledge of the attempt (and before that time careleſſe of all that honeſt was) began to incenſe &amp; blame the conſpirators: and in the end grieued with their ſlacknes, being then in Campania, went about to corrupt the chief of the nauie which lay then at Miſenum, and bind them to conſent to the practiſe with this
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:18166:123"/>
beginning. There was in that nauie one <hi>Voluſius Proculus,</hi> a coronell of a thouſand men, and among others an inſtrument in murdering <hi>Neroes</hi> mother, and as it was iudged not ſufficiently rewarded according to the greatnes of the fact. He acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of old, or newly growne into friendſhip with this woman, and ſhewing how much he had deſerued of <hi>Nero,</hi> and yet how his labour was loſt, complaining much, and declaring a purpoſe of reuenge, if meanes were offered; put <hi>Epicharis</hi> in hope he might be induced to conſpire and draw others with him to the ſame confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracie. Neither was the help of the ſea ſmall, but offered many occaſions, becauſe <hi>Nero</hi> tooke great pleaſure on the ſea at Puteolum and Miſenum. Whereupon <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charis</hi> added more, and opened all the Emperours villanies: and that the Senate * had prouided, how he ſhould be puniſhed for ouerthrowing the common wealth: that he would only prepare himſelfe, beſtow all indeuour, draw to his ſide the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anteſt of the ſouldiers, and aſſure himſelfe of worthie recompenſe. Neuertheles, ſhe concealed the names of the conſpirators, whereby <hi>Proculus</hi> betraying the matter, tooke no effect, although he had caried all he had heard to <hi>Nero.</hi> For <hi>Epicharis</hi> ſent for, and brought face to face before the appeacher, ſupported by no witneſſes, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily confounded him. Neuertheles ſhe was kept in priſon, <hi>Nero</hi> ſuſpecting that thoſe things were not falſe which were not prooued true. Yet the conſpirators, for feare of being betraied, thought it conuenient to change the place of the murder, and execute it at Baias, in a houſe of <hi>Piſoes;</hi> whither <hi>Caeſar</hi> came oft, as delighted with the pleaſantnes of it; and there vſed to bathe and to banket without any gard, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe of the greatnes of his eſtate. But <hi>Piſo</hi> refuſed, pretending it would breede him enuie, if the ſolemnities of his table, and gods of hoſpitalitie ſhould be diſtained with the murder of any Prince whatſoeuer. Therefore that it might be better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the citie, in that hatefull houſe built with the ſpoiles of the citizens, or in publick place, ſeeing it is vndertaken for the publick weale. Thus they debated the matter in common, but yet with ſecret feare, leaſt <hi>L. Silanus,</hi> a man of great nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and by <hi>C. Caſsius</hi> diſcipline, vnder whome he was brought vp to all renowne, ſhould lay hold on the Empire; all which were free from the conſpiracie ioining to help him, and ſuch alſo as would pitie <hi>Nero</hi> as ſlaine by treacherie. Some beleeued, that <hi>Piſo</hi> would not meddle with <hi>Vestinus</hi> the Conſuls fierce courage, leaſt he ſhould attempt the bringing in of libertie; or if another Emperour ſhould be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, aſcribe the beſtowing of the ſtate to himſelfe: for he was not priuie to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracie, although <hi>Nero</hi> to ſatiate his inueterate hatred layd it to his charge, though guiltles. At laſt, they reſolued to accompliſh their deſeignments on that day that the Circenſian plaies were repreſented in honor of <hi>Ceres;</hi> becauſe <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhewing himſelfe then little abroad, or ſhut vp in his houſe or gardens, came to the plaies at the Cirque; and therefore might eaſilier be come vnto, becauſe he tooke delight in the paſtime.</p>

Plinius</hi> doth report. Our meaning was not to conceale this, howſoeuer it hath beene left vs; although it ſhould ſeeme abſurd and friuolous (vnleſſe the deſire of dominion ſurpaſſe all other paſſions and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) that <hi>Antonia</hi> ſhould lend her name, or endanger herſelfe for him, or that <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo</hi> (the loue towards his wife ſo well knowen) ſhould binde himſelfe in marriage to any other whatſoeuer. But it was ſtrange how all was kept cloſe, among ſo many of diuers callings, degrees, ages, ſexes, rich and poore; vntill the detection beganne in <hi>Sceuinus</hi> houſe: who the day before the feate ſhould be effected, long confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with <hi>Antonius Natalis;</hi> then returning home, ſealed his teſtament: hauing drawen the rapier (of which I haue ſpoken) out of the ſcabberd; and angrie that it was dull with long keeping, commaunded it to be ſharpened at the point and ſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; giuing the charge of that care to his freed man <hi>Milichus.</hi> Withall he made a more ſumptuous banket than his cuſtome was: and made ſome of his bondmen he beſt liked free; and vnto others gaue money. And he himſelfe was ſad and eaſily ſeene, his head was fraighted with great imaginations, although he diſſembled mirth with impertinent talke. In the ende warned the ſame <hi>Milichus</hi> to prepare rowles to binde vp wounds, and things neceſſarie to ſtanch blood; either as one knowing the conſpiracie, and vntill then truſtie; or ignorant of it, and then firſt tooke hold of ſuſpitions, as ſome haue thought by the conſequents. For when this ſeruile minde, waighed with himſelfe the rewards of his falſhood, and repreſented to his owne imagination huge ſummes of money and great authority, honeſtie gaue place; and his maſters ſafetie, and the memorie of his receiued libertie. He tooke alſo the counſell of his wife (a womans counſell in deed, and the woorſer) which droue him into a further feare, affirming that manie freed men and ſlaues were by, which ſawe as much as he: the ſilence of one auailed nothing; but ones ſhould be the reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pence, if he preuented the reſt in detecting it.

And being put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to irons, they were not able to endure the ſight and threatnings of the torture. Yet <hi>Natalis</hi> as better acquainted with the whole conſpiracie, and withall skilfuller in accuſing, firſt confeſſeth of <hi>Piſo:</hi> then added <hi>Annaus Seneca,</hi> either bicauſe he was a meſſenger betweene him and <hi>Piſo,</hi> or bicauſe he would purchaſe <hi>Neroes</hi> fauour: who bearing deadly hatred to <hi>Seneca,</hi> practiſed all inuentions to bring him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. <hi>Natalis</hi> confeſſion knowen, <hi>Sceuinus</hi> with the like imbecillitie, or belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that all had beene diſcouered, and that no profit could riſe by keeping counſell, appeached the reſt. Among which <hi>Lucanus,</hi> and <hi>Quinctianus,</hi> and <hi>Senecio</hi> long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the matter. And afterward corrupted by promiſe of impunitie, to excuſe their backwardnes, <hi>Lucanus</hi> named <hi>Atilla</hi> his mother; <hi>Quinctianus, Glicius Gallus; Senecio, Annius Pollio</hi> their chiefeſt friendes. And <hi>Nero</hi> calling to minde in the meane while that <hi>Epicharis</hi> was in indurance through <hi>Voluſius Proculus</hi> information, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that a womans bodie was not able to endure much griefe, commaundeth her to be rent with tortures: but her; neither ſtripes, nor fires, nor the rage of the tortures, which ſo much the more cruelly racked her leaſt they ſhould be contemned by a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, could ouercome: but ſhe denied the crimes obiected, and ſo the firſt day of torture was contemned. The next daie when ſhe was brought to the ſame tortures in a bearing-chaire (for her members out of ioint and broken, ſhe could not put foot to ground) faſtning a lace which ſhe drew from her breaſt to the bow of the chaire, in manner of a ſliding knot, put her necke into it: and weighing downe with the heft of her bodie ſtopped that little breath ſhe had left. A notable example that a freed woman ſhould defend in ſuch great crueltie of torture ſtrangers, and almoſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen to her; when as men, and free-borne, and gentlemen of Rome, and Senators not touched with tortures, detected the deereſt of their kindred. For <hi>Lucanus, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necius,</hi> and <hi>Quinctianus,</hi> ſtucke not indifferently to bewray their confederates; <hi>Nero</hi> growing more and more fearefull, although he had doubled his guard. Further, he filled the citie and the wals with bands of ſouldiers, and beſet both ſea and riuer with watch and wards. And to and fro, by the Forum, the houſes, the fields, and townes adioyning, footmen and horſmen ſcoured vp and downe, intermingled with Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, whom he beſt truſted, bicauſe they were ſtrangers.</p>

Some there were which ſeeing the conſpiracie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, whileſt <hi>Milichus</hi> was examining, and <hi>Sceuinus</hi> doubteth whether he ſhould confeſſe or not, perſwaded <hi>Piſo</hi> to goe to the fort of the guarde, or goe vp to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra, and found the affection of the ſouldiers and people, ſaying: <hi rend="margQuotes">That if the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates would ioyne togither, the reſt which were not priuie would follow them: that the fame of an attempt was a great matter, and could do much in new enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.

Manie things are done by venturing, which to the faint harted ſeeme hard. It was a folly to hope for ſilence and fidelitie in ſo many mindes and bodies of partakers: by torment or reward all things are made eaſie. And ſome would come to clap irons on him, and put him to a ſhamefull death. How much more commendable were it for him to die, embracing the common-wealth, and ſeeking aide for libertie. Although the ſouldier ſhould ſaile him, and the people ſhrinke fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, if it ſhould coſt him his life, his death would be glorious as well to his aunceſtors, as his poſteritie?</hi> But nothing mooued with theſe ſpeeches, ſhewing himſelf little abroad, then keeping within doores, confirmeth his minde againſt death: vntill a band of ſouldiers came, which <hi>Nero</hi> had choſen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the yoong ſouldiers, and ſuch as lately were receiued into ſeruice: ſuſpecting that the old were made on <hi>Piſoes</hi> ſide. And cutting his vaines, yeelded vp the ghoſt. His teſtament was full of filthie flatteries toward <hi>Nero,</hi> through the loue of his wife, whom commendable only for her beautie, and nothing ſutable to his calling, he took from a friend vnto whom ſhe was married. Her name was <hi>Arria Galla;</hi> her firſt husband, <hi>Domitius Silius:</hi> he by patience, ſhe by vnchaſtnes ſpread abroade <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoes</hi> infamie. Next followed the death of <hi>Plautus Lateranus</hi> Conſull elect, and that with ſuch haſte, that he ſuffered him not to imbrace his children, nor haue ſo much as that ſhort time of choſing his death: but lead away to a place where ſlaues were executed, was killed by the hand of <hi>Statius</hi> the Tribune: full of conſtant ſilence, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer once reproching the guilt of the ſame fact to the Tribune. Then followed the death of <hi>Annaeus Seneca</hi> moſt ioiful to the Prince; not bicauſe he had found him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly priuie to the conſpiracie, but bicauſe he would ſhew crueltie with the ſword, ſeeing poiſon tooke no effect. Onely <hi>Natalis</hi> this farre did vtter: that he was ſent to <hi>Seneca</hi> being ſicke to viſite him and complaine, whie he barred <hi>Piſo</hi> from hauing acceſſe to him: and that it would be better to entertaine their friendſhip by familiar conuerſation. And <hi>Seneca</hi> to haue anſwered, that their interchaung of ſpeech, and often communication was profitable for neither of them: yet that his ſafetie did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on <hi>Piſoes</hi> welfare. Theſe things <hi>Granius Siluaenus</hi> Captaine of the guarde, was commaunded to carrie to <hi>Seneca,</hi> and aske him whether he acknowledged <hi>Natalis</hi> ſpeeches, and bring <hi>Senecaes</hi> anſwere. <hi>Seneca</hi> by chaunce, or of purpoſe, returned that day from Campania, and remained in a countrey houſe fower miles from the citie. Thither came the Tribune the next euening, and beſetteth the houſe with a companie of ſouldiers: then openeth vnto him the Emperours charge as he ſate at meate with <hi>Pompeia Paullina</hi> his wife, and two other friends. <hi>Seneca</hi> anſwered, that <hi>Natalis</hi> had been indeede ſent to him, and complained in <hi>Piſoes</hi> behalfe that he was forbidden to viſit him: and that he excuſed himſelfe with ſickenes, as being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of quietnes. <hi rend="margQuotes">Why he ſhould preferre the welfare of a priuat man before his owne ſafetie, he had no cauſe.

of <hi>Poppaea,</hi> and <hi>Tigellinus,</hi> who was of the cruell Princes inward counſell, he asketh whether <hi>Seneca</hi> prepared himſelfe any voluntarie death? The Tribune affirmed, he found no ſignes of feare in him, nor token of ſadnes in words or countenance: and thereupon he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to go back, &amp; giue him warning he ſhould die. <hi>Fabius Ruſticus</hi> doth report, that he returned not the ſame way he came, but turned aſide to <hi>Fenius</hi> the captaine: and hauing imparted vnto him <hi>Caeſars</hi> commandement, asked him whether he ſhould obey it or not; who aduiſed him to do his commandement; which was a cowardlines fatall vnto them all: for <hi>Siluanus</hi> was one of the conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and was now a furtherer of the crueltie, to whoſe reuenge he had before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented: yet he ſpared both his toong and preſence, and ſent to <hi>Seneca</hi> one of the Centurions, to denounce him the laſt neceſſitie. He nothing amazed, called for his teſtament, and the Centurion denying it, turned to his friends, and ſaid: <hi rend="margQuotes">That ſeeing he was not ſuffered to requite their merites, he proteſted he left them yet one thing which of all other he held moſt precious, which was the patterne of his life: of which if they were mindfull, they ſhould carry away the fame of good learning, and of ſo conſtant friendſhip.</hi> Withall, hindereth their teares, now with ſpeech, now more earneſtly as it were rebuking them, and calling them back to conſtancie, <hi rend="margQuotes"> Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king where were the precepts of wiſedome? where the reſolution ſo many yeares premeditated againſt imminent dangers? vnto whome was <hi>Neroes</hi> crueltie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne? neither did there remaine any thing to be done after he had murdered his mother and his brother, but that he ſhould adde the death of his bringer vp and maiſter.</hi> When he had diſcourſed this or the like, as it were in generall, he imbraced his wife, and hauing ſomwhat confirmed her againſt preſent feare, prayeth &amp; intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth her to temper her griefe, lament no longer, but in the contemplation of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer life ſpent in vertue, beare the lack of her husband with honeſt comforts.

Then <hi>Seneca</hi> loth to hinder her glory, and deerely louing her, leaſt he ſhould leaue her, whome ſo tenderly he affectioned to the iniuries of others, ſayd: <hi rend="margQuotes">I had taught the comforts of life, but thou haddeſt rather the glory of death.

And in the very laſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his eloquence not failing him, calling ſome to dictat his ſpeech, deliuered many things, which publiſhed in his owne words, I purpoſe not to alter or change with other termes. But <hi>Nero,</hi> hauing no peculiar hatred againſt <hi>Paullina,</hi> leaſt the odiouſnes of his crueltie ſhould grow greater, commaundeth her death to be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. Whereupon her bonde and freede men at the ſouldiers commaundement, bound her armes, and ſtopt the bloud. But whether ſhe knew it or not, is vncertaine: for (the common people being alwaies readie to ſpeake the worſt) there wanted not ſome which beleeued, that as long as ſhe feared <hi>Nero</hi> to be implacable, ſhe ſought to haue the glory of accompanying her husbands death; then a milder hope offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that ſhe was ouercome with the ſweetenes of life, vnto which ſhe added a few yeeres after, with a lawdable memorie towards her husband: but her face and other parts of her bodie were growne ſo pale and wan, that it eaſily appeared her vitall ſpirits were much diminiſhed. <hi>Seneca</hi> the meane time perceiuing himſelfe to linger

and pine away with a long death, intreateth <hi>Statius Annaeus</hi> his knowne friend, and expert Phiſition, to giue him of that poiſon with which the condemned by publick iudgement at Athens are put to death, whereof long before he had made prouiſion: which being brought him he dranke in vaine, the parts of his bodie alreadie cold, &amp; the conduits ſtopped againſt the force of poiſon.

Not long after, by their appeaching, <hi>Subrius Flauius</hi> Tribune was ouerthrowne, firſt alleaging the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilitude of his maners and life for his defence, and that he being a man of armes, would neuer in ſo dangerous an enterpriſe, aſſociate himſelfe with vnarmed effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate perſons: after that farther preſt, imbracing the glory of confeſſion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of <hi>Nero</hi> for what reaſons he had proceeded ſo farre as to forget his oath. <hi rend="margQuotes">I hated thee (quoth he:) neither was there any of the ſouldiers more faithfull vnto thee then I, whileſt thou deſeruedſt to be loued.

quaking very much, when he had ſcarſe cut off his head at two blowes, bragged to <hi>Nero</hi> of his crueltie, ſaying, that he was killed with halfe a blow. The next example of conſtancie the Centurion <hi>Sulpitius Aſper</hi> did ſhew; for <hi>Caeſar</hi> asking him why he had conſpired his death? anſwered briefely: <hi rend="margQuotes">That ſo many his villanies could not otherwiſe be redreſſed.</hi> Then he ſuſtained the puniſhment commanded. Neither did the reſt of the Centurions degenerate in bearing their puniſhments. But <hi>Fenius Rufus</hi> had not the like courage, but ſet downe his griefes and lamentations in his teſtament. <hi>Nero</hi> expected that <hi>Vestinus</hi> the Conſull ſhould alſo be drawen into the action, iudging him violent, and an enemie to him: but the conſpirators would not communicate their deſeignments with him; ſome by reaſon of old grudges; but more, becauſe they thought him raſh, headie, and inſociable. Furthermore, <hi>Neroes</hi> hatred againſt <hi>Vestinus</hi> proceeded of their inward familiaritie, the one contemning the Princes knowne cowardlines; and the other fearing the fell courage of his friend, often ieſting at him with bitter skoffes: which when they carry much truth with them, leaue behinde them a biting memorie. Beſides, there was a freſh cauſe of malice betweene them, becauſe <hi>Vestinus</hi> had married <hi>Statilia Meſſallina,</hi> not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that <hi>Caeſar</hi> kept vnlawfull companie with her.

Then order was taken, that gifts and

thanks ſhould be rendered the gods, and peculiar honor done to the Sunne, vnto whome there is an old temple in the Cirque, in which the enterpriſe ſhould haue beene accompliſhed; who diſcloſed by his diuine power, the ſecrets of the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracie: and that the Circenſian paſtime in honor of <hi>Ceres</hi> ſhould be exhibited with more horſe races; and that the moneth of Aprill ſhould beare the ſurname of <hi>Nero:</hi> that a Temple ſhould be built to <hi>Salus,</hi> in the place from whence <hi>Sceuinus</hi> had taken the rapier, which he himſelfe had offered vp in the Capitol, and wrote vnder it, <hi>To</hi> Iupiter <hi>the reuenger.</hi> Which preſently was not noted, but after that <hi>Iulius Vindex</hi> had taken armes, it was interpreted as a foretelling and preſage of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture reuenge.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter that time, Fortune began to delude <hi>Nero</hi> through his own vanitie, taking hold of a promiſe made by <hi>Ceſellius Baſſus:</hi> who being an African borne, and buſie headed, built an aſſured hope vpon the ſhadow of a dreame which he had in the night. And come to Rome, hauing bought acceſſe to the Prince, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth that there was a caue in his ground of a huge depth, wherein was contained great quantitie of gold vncoyned and vnwrought in a maſſe, as in old time it was wont to be hidden! For there lay a wall of very heauie bricks on the one ſide; and on the other, pillers ſtanding vpright: all which had laine hidden many yeeres to increaſe the wealth of the preſent time. And as coniecture doth ſhewe <hi>Dido</hi> the Feniſſian, fleeing from <hi>Tyrus,</hi> after ſhe had built Carthage, hid that treaſure there; leaſt the newe people with ouer-great wealth ſhould become wanton and riotous: or the King of the Numidians their olde ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, for greedines of their gold ſometime be incenſed to make warre againſt them. Whereupon <hi>Nero,</hi> not well aſſured of the credit of the Author, or certaintie of the buſines, nor any ſent to view and learne whether a truth were reported: of himſelfe encreaſeth the rumour, and ſendeth ſome to bring away all, as it were a pray alreadie gotten. Galleies and choiſe veſſels were appointed to helpe to haſten the matter: the people hauing no other ſpeech in their mouth, but that treaſure, through the credulouſnes of the diſcouerer, though not reporting of it all alike. And it fell out by chaunce that the Quinquennale paſtime, which euerie fift yeere being repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, was then the ſecond time celebrated: which miniſtred the orators their chiefeſt ſubiect to commend the Prince; ſaying: That the earth did not now bring forth only the vſuall fruits, nor gold mingled with other mettals; but a new plentie: and that the gods themſelues beſtowed wealth in all aboundance: and manie other things with great eloquence, and no leſſe ſeruile and baſe flatterie they fained; being aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of eaſie beliefe in the hearer. Riotuouſnes in the meane time grew greater by vaine hope, and the old wealth was conſumed, as though the other had beene offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, prodigally to waſte many yeeres. Yea from thence largeſſes were beſtowed: and the expectation of that wealth, was a cauſe in part of the publicke pouertie. For <hi>Baſſus</hi> hauing digged his ground, and large fields round about; auouching boldly this or that to be the promiſed caue: not onely ſouldiers followed him; but the countrey people were taken to dig and labour; at length leauing his ſottiſhnes, and maruelling that his dreames neuer prooued falſe before, and that he was neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued vntill then, ridde himſelfe of ſhame and feare by killing himſelfe. Some haue reported that he was impriſoned, and ſet at libertie againe incontinently, his goods firſt taken to the Princes treaſure. In the meane time the Senate, the Quinquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nale paſtime drawing neer, to ſhadow his ſhame, offereth him the victorie of ſinging,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:18166:128"/>
and withall the crowne of eloquence to colour the reproch of his ſinging on the Stage. But <hi>Nero,</hi> ſaying that he needed not the authoritie and fauour of the Senat in that reſpect; as able of himſelf to make his partie good with his concurrents, &amp; little doubting but that by the vprightnes of the iudges he ſhould obtaine his deſerued praiſe; ſang firſt of all a verſe on the Stage: then the people inſtantly crauing that he would publiſh all his ſtudies (for thoſe were their words) he entereth the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and obſerueth all the orders of the Harpers: as that being wearie, yet he ſhould not ſit downe; that he ſhould not wipe off his ſweate, but with the garment he wore; that no excrements ſhould be ſeene at his mouth or noſe. And laſt of all kneeling, and ſhewing a reuerence to the aſſembly with his hand, expected the iudges ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence with a counterfeite feare. And the citie-people accuſtomed alſo to approoue the geſtures of the players, anſwered him with a certaine meaſure and artificiall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe. Thou wouldeſt haue thought they had reioyced, and perhaps they did, for the iniurie of the publick diſcredit. But thoſe which from townes farre off, retaining as yet the auncient ſeueritie and cuſtome of Italie; and from remote Prouinces vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with diſſolute behauiour, came either as Ambaſſadors, or for priuate bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines, could neither indure that ſight, nor applaude any way ſo diſhonorable a labor: but awearie with their vnskilfull clapping of hands, and troubling the skilfull, were often beaten by the ſouldiers, placed in thicke aray, leaſt any moment of time ſhould be loſt by an vntuned and diſproportionable crie, or ſlothfull ſilence. It is certaine that many horſemen which laboured to paſſe through the crowd and thicke multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes were troden vnder feete; and others whileſt they continued day and night in their places, were ſtriken with deadly ſicknes. And yet if they ſhould haue beene ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent their feare was greater; many openly, and more priuily obſeruing the names and countenances, cheerefulnes and heauines of the lookers on. Whereupon pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments were inflicted vpon the poorer ſort foorthwith; the hatred againſt noble men diſſembled for the time, ſhewed it ſelfe within a ſhort ſpace after. And it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported that <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> was rebuked by <hi>Phoebus</hi> a freede man, as though he had beene ſomewhat drouſie with ſleepe, and was hardly defended by the intreatie of the better ſort: and afterward eſcaped imminent ruine by a greater chance.</p>

                  <hi>II.</hi> The death of <hi>Poppaea.</hi> Baniſhment and death of others.</head>
               <p>AFter the paſtime was ended, <hi>Poppaea</hi> died by a ſudden anger of her husbands, ſtriking her with his foote being with childe. Neither do I beleeue that ſhe was poiſoned, although ſome writers do ſo report, of hatred rather than truth: for he was deſirous of children and blinded with the loue of his wife. Her bodie was not burnt as the Roman manner was, but embalmed according to the cuſtome of forreine Kings, ſtuffed with ſweete odors, and buried in the tombe of the Iulians. Yet publicke funerals were ſolemniſed, and he himſelfe praiſed her beautie before the people aſſembled; that ſhe had beene the mother of a diuine daughter; and other gifts of fortune he commended in ſteed of vertues. The death of <hi>Poppaea</hi> as in ſhew ſorrowfull; ſo to the remembrers of her looſe life and crueltie ioyfull; <hi>Nero</hi> made more odious by giuing new matter of hatred, by hindering <hi>C. Caſsius</hi> from being preſent at her exequies; which was the firſt token of his ruine, not long defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And <hi>Silanus</hi> bare him companie for no crime committed, but becauſe <hi>Caſsius</hi> for his auncient riches, and grauitie of manners, <hi>Silanus</hi> for noblenes of birth, and modeſt youth, were woorthie praiſe aboue the reſt. Hauing therefore ſent an oration to the Senate, declared that they were both to be remooued from the common-wealth.
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:18166:128"/>
And layd to <hi>Caſsius</hi> charge, that among the images of his aunceſtors, he had done honour alſo to the image of <hi>C. Caſsius,</hi> which had this written vnder it: <hi>To the Captaine of the parts.</hi> For ſeedes of ciuill warre, and a reuolt from the houſe of <hi>Caeſars</hi> might haue beene intended by thoſe words. And leaſt he ſhould vſe the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie only of a hatefull name to ground a quarrell on; he ioyned <hi>L. Silanus</hi> a yoong man of a noble ſtocke, raſh and headie, vnder a pretence and colour of mouing newe broiles. Further, he rebuked <hi>Silanus</hi> for the ſame matters, as before he had done his vncle <hi>Torquatus,</hi> as though he did alreadie diſpoſe of the cares of the Empire, and giue his freed men charge of the accounts, requeſts and ſecretariſhips: things both vaine &amp; falſe. For <hi>Silanus</hi> was warie &amp; fearfull, and by the death of his vncle circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in his actions. After this he induced ſome vnder the name of accuſers, which falſly charged <hi>Lepida, Caſsius</hi> wife, <hi>Silanus</hi> aunt, of inceſt with her brothers ſonne; and with certaine execrable rites of ſacrifices. There were drawen in as priuie thereto, <hi>Vulcatius Tullinus,</hi> and <hi>Marcellus Cornelius,</hi> Senators; and <hi>Calpurnius Fabatus,</hi> a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of Rome: who appealing to the Prince, and diſappointing the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; anon after <hi>Nero</hi> being buſied about ſome great miſchiefes, were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten as men of ſmall reckoning. Then baniſhment was decreed againſt <hi>Caſsius</hi> and <hi>Silanus</hi> by order of Senate; and that <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelfe ſhould diſpoſe of <hi>Lepida. Caſsius</hi> was exiled to the Iland Sardinia, * exſpecting their further order from the Lords of the Senate. Silanus conueighed to Hoſtia, as though he ſhould be carried to Naxus; was after ſhut vp in a towne of Apulia, called Barium. And there, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie bearing his moſt vnwoorthie aduerſitie, a Centurion ſent to kill him laying hands on him; perſwaded him to cut his vaines: who anſwered, that he had a minde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute &amp; readie to die, but he would not permit an executioner to haue the glorie of the ſeruice. But the Centurion, although ſeeing him vnarmed; yet ſtrong, and more inclining to anger than feare, commaunded his ſouldiers to diſpatch him. Neither did <hi>Silanus</hi> omit to reſiſt, and lay on blowes as well as he was able with naked hands, vntill he fell downe ouermatched with the Centurions wounds on his face as it had beene in a skirmiſh. With no leſſe courage died <hi>L. Vetus,</hi> and <hi>Sexia</hi> his mother in law, and his daughter <hi>Pollutia:</hi> hatefull to the Prince, as though by liuing, they ſhould vpbraid him with the murder of <hi>Rubellius Plautus, L. Vetus</hi> ſonne in law. But the firſt diſcouerer of his crueltie towards them, was one <hi>Fortunatus</hi> a freed man of <hi>Vetus,</hi> who hauing pilfred away his maſters goods and fearing an enquirie, began to accuſe him, aſſociating <hi>Claudius Demianus</hi> with him, who empriſoned by <hi>Vetus</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſull of Aſia for his miſdeeds, <hi>Nero</hi> deliuered in recompence of the accuſation. Which being vnderſtood by the partie accuſed, and that there was no difference made betwixt him and his freed man, hedeparteth to Eormianum, where a ſecrete guarde of ſouldiers watched him. His daughter was with him, who beſides the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent danger, through long griefe, fell and cruell, as ſoone as ſhe had ſeen the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers of her husband <hi>Plautus,</hi> grew to further extremitie: and hauing caſt herſelfe about his necke embrued with blood, kept ſtill the blood, and her apparell beſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled with it, remaining a widow, drownd in continuall griefe, vſing no other foode, than was neceſſarie to keepe off death. Then her father exhorting her, ſhe goeth to Naples. And, becauſe ſhe was kept from the ſpeech of <hi>Nero,</hi> lying in waite for his going abroad, ſhe cried alowde that it would pleaſe him to heare the innocent, and not commit one who had beene his companion in the Conſulſhip to the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of a freed man, ſometime with a womaniſh lamentation, ſometimes going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond her ſexe, with angrie and bitter termes: vntill the Prince ſhewed himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible; and no way mooued, either with praiers or hatred he might incurre. And
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:18166:129"/>
warneth her father to caſt away hope, and reſolue himſelfe to the preſent neceſſitie. Withall newes came, that the matter ſhould be heard before the Lords of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and a cruell ſentence intended. Thereupon ſome aduiſed him to pronounce <hi>

                     </gap>ar</hi> his heire for the moſt part of his goods, and ſo helpe his nephewes with the reſt; which he refuſed, leaſt he ſhould diſhonour with this laſt ſeruile acte his life paſt almoſt in libertie: and gaue all his money among his bondmen, and if any thing could be carried away, that euerie one might ſerue himſelfe; three beds onely reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for his funerall obſequies. Then in the ſame chamber, with the ſame knife they cut their vaines, and with ſpeed each one couered with a ſimple garment, for mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie ſake, they were put into bathes. The father looking on the daughter, the grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother on her neece, ſhe on both, praying a-uie for a ſpeedie end to leaue the others aliue, though to follow incontinently after. And fortune herein kept the order, the eldeſt dying firſt, then the next in age. And being accuſed after their buriall, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned they ſhould be puniſhed according to the auncient manner: <hi>Nero</hi> was againſt it, ſuffering them to make choiſe of their manner of death, for ſuch kinde of ſcoffes were vſed after the murders committed. <hi>P. Gallus</hi> a gentleman of Rome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was inward with <hi>Fenius,</hi> and not an enemie to <hi>Vetus,</hi> was baniſhed: the freed man and accuſer rewarded for his paines, and a place giuen him in the Theater a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the beadles of the Tribunes. And the month of May which followed Aprill, and called <hi>Nero,</hi> was changed into the name of <hi>Claudius,</hi> and Iuly into <hi>Germanicus:</hi> and <hi>Cornelius Ofitus,</hi> whoſe cenſure that was, ſaide that therefore the month of Iune was paſt ouer, becauſe two of the <hi>Torquatus</hi> alreadie executed for their miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, had made the name of Iune vnluckie. A yeere continued with ſo many lewd actions, the gods haue marked and made notorious by tempeſts and diſeaſes. Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pania was deſtroied with boiſterous ſtormes of windes, which did euerie where beat downe houſes, woods, and graine, and brought the violence of it to places adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the citie. Where the rage of the peſtilence ſpared none, although there was no manifeſt ſhew of corruption of the aire to be ſeene. Yet the houſes were filled with dead bodies, and the waies with funerals; no ſexe, no age, free from danger; as well bond, as free borne indifferently periſhed: amidſt the lamentations of their wiues and children; who whileſt they ſat by them and bewailed, were often burnt in the ſame funerall fire. The death of gentlemen and Senators although in different with others, leſſe lamented, as though they had by a common mortalitie preuented the Princes crueltie. The ſame yeere they muſtered in Gallia Narbonenſis, Affrick, and Aſia, to ſupplie the legions of Illyria, which worne out either with yeeres or ſickenes were freede from their oath. The Prince relieued the oalamitie of Lugdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num with <note n="*" place="margin">About 31250 pound.</note> fortie hundred thouſand ſeſterces to recouer the loſſes of their citie: which ſumme of money the Lugdunenſes had before beſtowed in troubled times.</p>

Whereupon hauing intercepted <hi>Anteius</hi> let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and ſtolne his writings wherin the day of his natiuitie and things to come, were hidden among Pammenes ſecrets, and withall found thoſe things which had beene compoſed of the birth and life of <hi>Ostorius Scapula:</hi> writeth to the Prince, that he would bring him great newes touching his owne ſafetie, if he might obtaine a ſhort intermiſſion of his baniſhment: for <hi>Anteius</hi> and <hi>Ostorius</hi> watch for opportunitie to lay hold on the ſoueraigntie, and ſearched out their owne and <hi>Caeſars</hi> deſtinies. Therupon ſwift veſſels were ſent &amp; <hi>Soſianus</hi> brought with all ſpeed. And his accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion diuulged, <hi>Anteius</hi> and <hi>Ostorius</hi> were reckoned rather among the condemned than accuſed; in ſo much that no man would haue ſealed <hi>Anteius</hi> teſtament, if <hi>Tigel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus</hi> had not beene their warrant. <hi>Anteius</hi> was firſt admoniſhed not to delay the making of his teſtament: but he hauing drunken poiſon, weary of the ſlow working of it, by cutting his vaines haſtened his death. <hi>Ostorius</hi> at that time was farre off in the confines of Liguria, whither a Centurion was ſent to make him away with all ſpeed. The cauſe of the haſte proceeded of that, that <hi>Ostorius</hi> being for matter of warre of good reckoning, and deſerued in Britannie a ciuicall crowne, of a mightie ſtrength of bodie and skilfull in armes, droue <hi>Nero</hi> into a feare leaſt he ſhould aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile him; alwaies timorous &amp; fearfull, but then more then euer, through the conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie lately detected.

And bicauſe his vaines whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were opened, yeelded but little blood, vſing the hand of his ſlaue only to take out a rapier &amp; hold it ſtedfaſt: he drew his right hand to him, and ranne himſelfe through the necke. If I ſhould haue written of forrein wars, and deaths ſuſtained for the common-wealth, with diuers other accidents &amp; chances: yet I ſhould not only haue ſeemed tedious to my ſelfe; but to others alſo: abhorring the deaths of citizens, being dolefull and continuall, although honorable. But now a ſeruile patience, and ſo much bloode loſt at home, doth trouble my minde and oppreſſe it with griefe. Neither do I require any other defence or excuſe of thoſe who ſhall know theſe things, but that they hate them not, for dying ſo cowardly. That was certainely the anger of the gods againſt the Roman ſtate, which ought not ſo eaſily be runne ouer with once writing, as in the ouerthrow of armies, or taking of townes. Let this prerogatiue be giuen the poſteritie of worthie perſonages, that as how they are diſtinguiſhed from the confuſe multitude in the ſolemnitie of their funerals: ſo in the deliuerie of their laſt ends, that they may receiue and haue a proper and peculiar memorie. For within a fewe daies by the ſame violent courſe, <hi>Annaeus Mella, Cerialis Anicius, Rufus Criſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and <hi>C. Petronius</hi> periſhed. <hi>Mella</hi> and <hi>Criſpinus</hi> were gentlemen of Rome, and equall in dignitie with Senators. <hi>Criſpinus</hi> once Captaine of the guarde, and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Conſularie ornaments, and of late through the conſpiracie, exiled into Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia, hauing receiued tydings he ſhould die; ſlew himſelfe. <hi>Mella</hi> borne of the ſame parents as <hi>Gallius</hi> and <hi>Seneca,</hi> forbare purchaſing of dignities, by a prepoſterous am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, to the end that a Roman gentleman might be equalled in authoritie to the Conſuls. Withall he thought it a ſhorter courſe of getting wealth, to mannage the affaires of the prince in quality of a Procurator. The ſame <hi>Mella</hi> was <hi>Annaeus Lucanus</hi> father, which was a great credit to him: but after his death, ſeeking out too narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:18166:130"/>
his goods, ſtirred vp an accuſer againſt him, one <hi>Fabius Romanus,</hi> one of <hi>Lucans</hi> familiar friends: which falſly fathered vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him &amp; the father, the priuitie of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracie, by counterfeiting of <hi>Lucans</hi> letters: which <hi>Nero</hi> hauing peruſed, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be caried him, gaping after his wealth.

And as others, induſtrie; ſo this man, ſlouth had raiſed to fame: a riotous and waſtfull ſpender he was, not accompted like many, which run through all, but vſing riot to his credit. And his words and deedes how much the freer, and ſhewing a certaine careleſnes; ſo much the more gratefully receiued, as ſauoring ſomewhat of ſimplicitie. Notwithſtanding being Proconſull of Bithynia, and anon after Conſull, he ſhewed himſelf quick &amp; ſtout, and able to wade through great matters. Then falling againe to his vices, or elſe ſhew of vices, was receiued amongſt <hi>Neroes</hi> familiar friends, as a iudge and arbitrator of his daintieſt delights, eſteeming nothing pleaſant or delightfull, vnleſſe <hi>Petronius</hi> had approued it. Thereupon grew <hi>Tigellinus</hi> malice againſt him, as againſt a concurrent, or one more skilfull in pleaſures then himſelfe, whetting <hi>Neroes</hi> crueltie (vnto which all other luſts gaue place) againſt him: obiecting the friendſhip he had with <hi>Sceuinus,</hi> corrupting a ſlaue to be his accuſer: taking from him all meanes of defence, and the greateſt part of his familie drawne into priſon. By chance about that time <hi>Caeſar</hi> went to Campania, and <hi>Petronius</hi> gone as farre as Cumas, was there ſtayed; and not able any longer to indure the lingering betweene hope, or feare, yet did not raſhly kill himſelfe, but cutting his vaines, and binding them vp as pleaſed him, opened them againe, and talked with his friends, though not of any ſerious matter, or worthie to purchaſe the glorie of conſtancie: but gaue eare to thoſe which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed with him, yet nothing of the immortalitie of the ſoule, or opinions of wiſe men, but of light verſes, and eaſie ſongs. On ſome of his ſlaues he beſtowed gifts, and on ſome ſtripes. He went ſometimes abroade, and gaue himſelfe to ſleepe, that although his death was conſtrained, yet it ſhould be like a caſuall death. Neither in his teſtament (as moſt men were wont to do) did he flatter <hi>Nero</hi> or <hi>Tigellinus</hi> or any other fauorite, but wrote down the vncleane life of the Prince, vnder fained names of ſtale catamites, abuſed againſt nature, and of women, with the ſtrangenes of the abuſe of either of them; and ſealed vp, ſent it to <hi>Nero,</hi> and brake his ſeale, leaſt after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it might ſerue to breede danger to others. And <hi>Nero</hi> doubting how the inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his night pleaſures ſhould come to light, <hi>Silia</hi> by being the wife of a Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor not vnknowne, and abuſed in all his licentious luſts, and very familiar with <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronius,</hi> came to his minde, whom he thruſt into baniſhment, as not hauing kept ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:18166:130"/>
thoſe things ſhe had ſeene and ſuffered: moued thereto by his owne particular hatred rather then reſt occaſion. He deliuered <hi>Numicius Thermus</hi> once Pretor, to <hi>Tigellinus</hi> priuie hatred, becauſe <hi>Thermus</hi> freed man had layd ſome criminall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Tigellinus</hi> charge, which he ſhould pay for by torment of torture, and his maiſter by vndeſerued death.</p>

               <p>SO many worthie men being murdered, in the end <hi>Nero</hi> coueted to deſtroy vertue, it ſelfe, by killing <hi>Bareas Soranus,</hi> and <hi>Thraſeas Paetus,</hi> of old enemie to both; and new occaſions riſing againſt <hi>Thraſeas,</hi> becauſe he went out of the Senat, as I haue alreadie ſaid, when <hi>Agrippinaes</hi> cauſe was debated; &amp; becauſe that in the paſtime of youth called Inuenales, he ſhewed not ſo acceptable indeuor as was expected: which grudge pearſed the deeplier, becauſe the ſame <hi>Thraſea</hi> at Padua where he was borne in the Ceſtian playes, inſtituted by <hi>Antenor</hi> the Troian, ſang in tragicall attire. The day alſo that <hi>Antiſtius</hi> the Pretor was condemned for outrages againſt <hi>Nero,</hi> he gaue a milder ſentence, and obtained it: and when the honor of the goddes was ordained for <hi>Poppaea,</hi> abſent of ſet purpoſe, was not at the conuoy of the funerall. Which things <hi>Capito Coſſutianus</hi> did not ſuffer to be forgotten, beſides his ouer-readie inclination to naughtines, enemie to <hi>Thraſea,</hi> becauſe that by his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, countenancing the deputies of Cilicia, he loſt his cauſe, when they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued <hi>Capito</hi> for vſing iniuſtice and extortion in his office. He obiected farther: <hi rend="margQuotes">That in the beginning of the yeere <hi>Thraſea</hi> did auoide the oath; was not preſent with the reſt at the offering vp of vowes, although he were one of the fifteene Prieſts, yet he neuer offered ſacrifice for the health of the Prince, or heauenly voice: that hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath beene often preſent, and diligent, ſhewing himſelfe a fauorer or an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie to the ordinarie conſultations of the Lords of the Senate, but hath not once entered the Curia this three yeeres: and very lately when euery man ran who firſt might, to puniſh <hi>Silanus</hi> and <hi>Vetus,</hi> he attended rather on his clients priuat buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: that was now a reuolting, and a faction, and if many durſt do the like, it would breede to a warre. As in times paſt (ſayd he) the citie deſirous of garboile, ſpake of <hi>C. Caeſar,</hi> and <hi>M.

This man only is careleſſe of thy health, no way procuring thy honor, he little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth the Princes proſperous ſucceſſes. What, is he not filled with thy griefes, and ſorrowes? It proceedeth from the ſelfeſame minde not to beleeue <hi>Poppaea</hi> to be agoddeſſe, and not ſweare to obſerue the ordinances of <hi>Augustus</hi> and <hi>Iulius</hi> of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous memorie. He deſpiſeth holie things, abrogateth lawes. The diurnals of the people of Rome are curiouſly read in the prouinces and campe, that it might be knowen what <hi>Thraſea</hi> hath not done. Either let vs condiſcend to his ordinances if they be better: or let the captaine and author be taken away from deſires of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelties.

with choler, and ioyneth with him <hi>Marcellus Eprius,</hi> of a quick and liuely eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. As for <hi>Barea Soranus, Oſtorius Sabinus,</hi> a Romaine gendeman had required he might accuſe him for matter committed in the Proconſulſhip of Aſia: in which he aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the diſpleaſure the Prince bare him for iuſtice and induſtrie: and becauſe he had beene very carefull in opening the hauen of the Epheſians; and had left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed the violence of the citie Pergamena, which hindring <hi>Acratus Caeſars</hi> freed man to carry away their images and pictures. But the fault indeede laid to his charge, was his friendſhip with <hi>Plautus,</hi> and ambition in alluring the prouince to new hopes. The time choſen to condemne him, was, when <hi>Tiridates</hi> came to take the kingdome of Armenia: that domeſticall wickednes might be obſcured and hidden with the rumors of the ſtrangers arriuing; or elſe that he might ſhew the greatnes of an Emperour by the death of worthie men, as a royall act. Whereupon all the citie being run out to receiue the Prince, and behold the King, <hi>Thraſea</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to go to meete him, loſt not courage therefore; but wrote to <hi>Nero,</hi> demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his accuſations, boldly affirming that he would purge himſelfe, if he might haue knowledge of the crimes, and licence to cleere them. Theſe writings <hi>Nero</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued very greedily, in hope that <hi>Thraſea</hi> being terrified and deiected, would haue written ſomewhat ſounding to the magnificencie and excellencie of the Prince, and diſcredit of his owne reputation: which falling out otherwiſe, fearing the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and courage and libertie of the innocent, commaunded the Lords of the Senate to be aſſembled. Then <hi>Thraſea</hi> conſulted with his friends, whether he ſhould aduenture his purgation, or let it paſſe. Thoſe which thought it beſt he ſhould enter into the Senat houſe, ſaid, <hi rend="margQuotes">they were aſſured of his conſtancie, and that he would ſay nothing but what ſhould augment his glory. Cowardly and timorous men did ſhut themſelues in ſecret places at the time of their death. The people ſhould ſee a man offering himſelfe to death; the Senate ſhould heare words more then hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, as it were of ſome diuine power, that <hi>Nero</hi> himſelfe might alſo be moued with the miracle: but if his crueltie ſhould continue, certes the memorie of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable death ſhould be diſtinguiſhed with poſteritie from the cowardlines of ſuch as periſhed with ſilence.</hi> Contrarywiſe, ſuch as thought it conuenient to expect within dores what might happen, ſaid the ſame of <hi>Thraſea:</hi> 
                  <hi rend="margQuotes">But yet that skoffes and iniuries were at hand: he ſhould therefore withdraw his eares from checks and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prochfull ſpeeches: not only <hi>Coſſutianus</hi> and <hi>Eprius</hi> are prompt to naughtines: ſome there are which peraduenture would let their hand walke and ſtrike, through the crueltie * of <hi>Auguſtus:</hi> yea the good do the like for feare. That he would rather deliuer the Senat whom he had alwaies honored, of the infamie of ſo great a villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie: and leaue it doubtfull, what, hauing ſeene <hi>Thraſea,</hi> the Lordes of the Senate would determine. That <hi>Nero</hi> ſhould be aſhamed of his wickednes, was to trouble himſelfe with a vaine hope: and that it was much more to be feared, leaſt he ſhould grow cruell againſt his wife, his familie, and the reſt of his children. Therefore that vndefiled and vncorrupted, whoſe ſteps and ſtudies he had imitated in his life, theirs alſo he ſhould follow in the honor of his death.</hi> There was preſent at this conſultation <hi>Rusticus Arulenus,</hi> Tribune of the people, a hot yongman, who for deſire of praiſe, offered to oppoſe himſelfe to the decree of Senate. <hi>Thraſea</hi> coold his courage: <hi rend="margQuotes">Leaſt he ſhould begin a vaine enterpriſe vnprofitable to the criminall, and dangerous to the oppoſer. As for himſelfe he had ended his yeeres, and that he ought not forſake the manner of his life ſo many yeeres continued: but he entred now into offices, and was in his choiſe to accept or refuſe ſuch as are behind. That he ſhould waigh well and ponder with himſelfe what courſe of gouerning he ſhould

               <p>THe next day two armed Pretorian cohorts, beſet the Temple of <hi>Venus</hi> the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: the waies to the Senate a companie of gownd-men had filled, not hiding their weapons: and a thicke aray of ſouldiers diſperſed in the place of aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies and Temples; amidſt whoſe lookes and threats the Senators went into the court; where the Princes oration was heard by his Quaeſtors mouth. None noted by name, he blamed the Senators; <hi rend="margQuotes">That they neglected publicke duties, and that by their example the gentlemen of Rome were become lazie. For what maruell was it, if from Prouinces farre off they came not to Rome, when as the moſt part hauing obtained the Conſulſhip and prieſtly dignities, gaue themſelues rather to paſſe the time withall pleaſures in their gardens?</hi> Which the accuſers tooke hold of as it were of a weapon. And <hi>Coſſutianus</hi> leading the daunce, and <hi>Marcellus</hi> with greater vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie: <hi rend="margQuotes">Cried that this touched the whole ſtate, that through the diſobedience of the inferiours, the lenitie of the commaunder was made leſſer.

Finally, that he ſhould come and play the Senator, and as he was wont, protect the backbiters of the Prince, and giue his cenſure what he would haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended or chaunged: for they could more eaſilie endure one finding fault with all things, then endure his ſilence now, condemning all things.

That they would not ſuffer him haue the deſire of his ouerthwart ambition, who grieued at the common proſperitie, thought the place of aſſemblies, the Theater, and Temples, ſolitarie places, and threatned his owne baniſhment.

                  <hi>VII. Soranus</hi> daughters oration in Senate, and his death.</head>
               <p>IN the meane ſeaſon <hi>Ostorius Sabinus, Soranus</hi> accuſer, commeth in, and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with his friendſhip had with <hi>Rubellius Plautus:</hi> and that being Proconſull of Aſia, he caried himſelfe rather as fitting his own nobilitie, than the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon good, by entertayning and nouriſhiug ſedition among the citizens. Theſe were ſtale mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but as if they were freſh he ioined the daughter to the fathers allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging that ſhe had beſtowed money vpon Magicians. So it was indeede, through the loue and affection <hi>Seruilia</hi> (ſo was ſhe called) bare her father, and vndiſcretion of age; yet ſhe conſulted of nothing but of the ſafetie of their houſe; or whether <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes</hi> wrath would be pacified; or the Senators hearing of the cauſe, would be to the preiudice of her father. She was called into the Senate, and ſtoode one from the other before the Conſuls tribunal; the father very aged, the daughter vnder twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeeres, a widow, and deſolate, her husband <hi>Annius Pollio</hi> of late baniſhed; and not ſo much as looking towards her father, whoſe dangers ſhe imagined ſhe had increaſed. Then the accuſer asking her whether ſhe had ſould her dowrie orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and taken her iewell from her neck, to get money to practiſe magicall ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions? firſt proſtrating her ſelfe on the ground, with a long ſilence and weeping, then imbracing the altars, ſaid: <hi rend="margQuotes">I haue not called vpon any wicked gods, I haue made no diueliſh inuocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, nor any thing elſe by my vnhappie praiers, then that this my very good father, thou ô <hi>Caeſar,</hi> &amp; you Lords of the Senat, would ſaue aliue. So I haue giuen my iewels, and apparell, and ornaments of my dignitie, euen as I would haue done my bloud and life, if they had demaunded it. Let theſe men heretofore vnto me vnknowen, looke what names they carry, what artes they practiſe: I made no mention of the Prince, vnleſſe it were among the gods. Yet my moſt vnfortunate father knoweth it not: if it be an offence, I alone haue offended. Soranus</hi> tooke the words out of her mouth as ſhe was yet ſpeaking, and cried, that ſhe went not with him into the prouince: for her age <hi>Plautus</hi> could not know her; ſhe was not confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate with her husbands crimes; ſhe was guiltie only of ouer-great and tender loue: and therefore whatſoeuer ſhould ſort to his lot, he beſought them that they would ſeparate his cauſe from hers; withall, haſtned to caſt himſelfe in the armes of his daughter which came to meete him, if the ſerieants putting themſelues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, had not hindered both. By and by the witneſſes were heard; and how much pitie the crueltie of the accuſer had moued, ſo much anger <hi>P. Egnatius</hi> the witnes ſturred. This man being a client of <hi>Soranus,</hi> and then hired to oppreſſe his friende, pretended grauitie of the Stoicall ſect, in demeanor and countenance to repreſent the patterne of honeſt exerciſes; but in minde was traiterous, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiptfull, couering auarice, and a lewd minde: which being diſcouered, and made knowne by money, hath taught vs to beware of ſuch, as vnder colour of liberall ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, are falſe in friendſhip: no leſſe then of thoſe which are notoriouſly noted for vice, and treacherous dealing. The ſame day was ſhewed a notable example by <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius Aſclepiodotus,</hi> who for wealth, being the chiefeſt among the Bithynians, vſed the ſame tokens of kindnes towards <hi>Soranus</hi> in his aduerſitie, as before he had done in time of proſperitie: for which cauſe being depriued of all his goods, and caſt into ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, by the iuſtice of the gods * which lay before vs a precident as well of good as of bad. <hi>Thraſea, Soranus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Seruilia</hi> had their choiſe giuen them what death they would haue. <hi>Heluidius</hi> and <hi>Paconius</hi> were baniſhed Italie. <hi>Montanus</hi> was granted to his father, with conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that he ſhould beare no charge in the common wealth.

            <head>THE DESCRIPTION OF GERMANIE: AND CVS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOMES OF THE PEOPLE, BY CORNELIVS TACITVS.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LL Germanie is diuided from the Galli, the Rhaetians, and Pannonians, with two riuers, Rhene and Danubius; from the Sarmatians and Dacians by mutuall feare of one the other, or high hils. The reſt the Ocean doth enuiron, compaſſing broad and wide gulphes, and large and ſpatious Ilands; the people and Kings of which hath beene of late diſcouered by warre. The riuer of Rhene hauing his beginning on the top of the inacceſſible, ſteep Rhaetian Alpes, and winding ſomewhat towardes the Weſt, falleth into the North Ocean. Danubius ſpringing from the top of the hill Abnoba, not ſo ſteepe, paſſing by manie nations, falleth by ſixe channels into the Ponticke ſea: the ſeuenth is loſt in the mariſhes. I may thinke that the Germans are home-bred and the naturall people of their countrey, and not mixed with others, comming from other places; bicauſe ſuch as in times paſt ſought new habitations, came by ſea and not by land: and that huge and ſpatious Ocean, and as I may terme it, different from the other, is ſeldome trauelled by our men. For beſides the daunger of the rough and vnknowen ſea; who (vnleſſe it were his natiue ſoile) would leaue Aſia, or Affricke, or Italie, and plant himſelfe in Germanie? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a countrey of it ſelfe rude, and the aire vnpleaſant and rough, to looke on ilfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured; not mannured nor husbanded. They giue it out as a high point in old ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes (which is the onely way they maintaine the memorie of things, as their Annales) that the god <hi>Tuisto,</hi> ſonne of the earth, and his ſonne <hi>Mannus,</hi> were their firſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and beginners. To <hi>Mannus</hi> they aſſigne three ſonnes; whoſe names the Ingae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uones tooke, a nation neere the Ocean: the Iſtaeuones, and Herminones lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them both. But ſome through a licence which antiquitie doth giue, affirme that the King had moe ſonnes, from which moe nations tooke their names; as the Marſi, Gambriui, Sueui, Vandali, all true and auncient names. As for the name, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie, it is a new name lately coyned: for thoſe which firſt paſt the riuer of Rhene &amp; droue out the Gallois, were now called Tungri, now Germani: ſo the name of one people, not of the whole nation, growing great by little and little: as they were all at the firſt called for feare, as beſt liked the Conquerour; ſo at laſt, Germans, being a name of their owne inuention. And they record that <hi>Hercules,</hi> came amongſt them of all that euer was the valianteſt perſon. They goe ſinging to the warres. And haue certaine verſes, by ſinging of which, calling it Barditus, they incourage their people, and by the ſame ſong foretell the fortune of the future battell: for they both ſtrike a feare into others, and are themſelues ſtriken with feare, according to the meaſure and tune of the battell: ſeeming rather an harmonie of valour than voices; and do affect principally a certaine roughnes of the voice, and a broken confuſe murmur, by putting their targets before their mouthes, to the end their voice by the reuerbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration might ſound bigger and fuller. Yea ſome are of opinion, that <hi>Vliſſes</hi> in his long and fabulous wandring, being brought to this Ocean, came into Germanie,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:18166:133"/>
and built the towne Aſciburgium vpon the banke of Rhene and inhabited at this day, which he called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And that an altar conſecrated to <hi>Vliſſes</hi> hath been found in the ſame place, with his fathers name <hi>Laërtes:</hi> and that there are yet monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments extant, and certaine tumbes inſcribed with Greeke letters, in the confines of Germanie and Rhaetia: which I intend not to confirme by reaſons, or confute; and therefore I leaue it to euerie mans iudgement to beleeue or not. For mine owne part I hold with them, which thinke that the people of Germanie, not changed and altered by marrying with other nations, haue continued the true and pure nation like vnto none, but themſelues. And therefore you ſee they haue all one feature and making, though they be infinite in number: firie and gray eies, yellow haire, great bodies, and ſtrong at a puſh onely. Trauell and paine they cannot endure: nor yet thirſt nor heate; but to hunger and cold the aire and the countrey hath inured them. The ſoile, although differing ſomewhat in kind, yet generally is wilde with woods, or vnpleaſant and ilfauoured with mariſhes: moiſter towards Gallia: more windie towards Noricum and Pannony: batfull enough; but bad for fruit-bearing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees; cattle plentie, but for the moſt part harletry runts: their kine and labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring beaſt hath no beautie in him: all their ioye is in plentie of them: and therein conſiſteth their wealth; &amp; the wealth they chiefly deſire. Siluer &amp; gold whether the angry or fauourablegods haue denied them, I doubt. Neither wil I affirme that there is no vaine in Germany which yeeldeth ſiluer &amp; gold: for who hath ſought it? the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of theſe metals or vſe, they do not greatly affect. Yet veſſels of plate you may ſee among them preſented to their Embaſſadors &amp; Princes; but as ſmally accompted of, as if they were of earth: although the borderers for commoditie of trafficke, like gold and ſiluer well; and do acknowledge and chooſe ſome coine, bearing our images. Thoſe which dwell further in the land, go more ſimplie to worke, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the old manner, haue no buying and ſelling, but by exchange of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities. The older the money, and longeſt knowne, the better liked, as that which is toothed about like a ſawe: or hath the picture of a chariot drawen with two horſes. They deſire rather ſiluer then gold: not for any liking vnto it; but becauſe that, being in ſmaller money, it is eaſlier put away in buying and ſelling of ſmall wares. Yron they haue little among them, as by their weapons it may be gathered. Few of them vſe ſwords, or great lances: but carrie Iauelins, or as they terme them Frameas, with a narrow and ſhort yron, but ſo ſharp and handſome, that as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſerueth, with the ſame weapon they can fight both at hand, and a farre off: and the horſeman is contented with a ſhield and a framea. The footemen vſe weapons, to throw one man a great many, and that a great way off: naked, or couered with a light caſſocke. Handſomnes and neatnes in attire they do not brag of, but trim and diſtinguiſh their ſhields only with varietie of colours. Brigantine or cote of fence few haue. Salet or head-peece ſcarſe any one vſeth. Their horſes are neither beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull to the eye, nor ſwift, nor mannaged to the carrire according to our faſhion; but to go on ſtraight, or turne on the right hand ſo cloſe and round, that not one drags behinde another. All things well conſidered, their greateſt ſtrength conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth of footemen: and therefore in their fight they mingle the one with the other; the footemen which are a choſen number out of the youth, and placed before the battell, neither going too haſtily before the horſemen, nor drailing after, but mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching in proportionable meaſure with them. There is a certain number ſet downe, that is, of euery towneſhip or borough an hundred, for ſo they terme themſelues: and that which was but a number at the firſt, is now a name and an honor. Their bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels be pointed: to giue ground, ſo as they charge luſtely after, they thinke rather
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:18166:134"/>
a point of good policie then cowardlines. The bodies of their ſouldiers they carrie away, euen in doubtfull battels: to abandon his ſhield is the chiefeſt diſgrace and offence: an ignominious perſon is barred from their ſacrifices, and from their aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies; and many which haue fled from battels, haue for ſhame hanged themſelues. Their Kings they chooſe by noblenes of birth, and their Captaines by valour. The Kings power is reſtrained, and not to do what he liſteth; and their Captaines if they be forward in ſight, and in the point of the battell, are admired and reuerenced ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for their example, then commanderie. Power to puniſh, to empriſon or beate, none haue but Prieſts: yet that not as a puniſhment, or at the Captaines comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement; but as it were by the commaundement of God, whom they beleeue doth aſſiſt warriors in battels; and carrie before them certaine images, and monuments taken out of the woods. And which is the chiefeſt encouragement of all, they make not their pointed battell at hap hazard, of all perſons as they come; but of their familie and friends, and kinsfolke, with their children not farre of; from whence they may heare the howling of their wiues, and crying of their children: which are to all, ſacred witneſſes of their valour, and beſt commenders. They goe when they are hurt to their mothers and wiues; which are not afeard to number or ſucke their wounds; and carrie the ſouldiers meate, and incourage them to ſtand to it. It is reported that ſome battels, euen readie as it were to be loſt, and diſcomfited, haue beene by the womens earneſt prayers, expoſing their bodies to the daunger, and by ſhewing how neere at hand their captiuitie was, recouered againe: which in regard of their wiues is a greater griefe and hart-breake vnto them; in ſo much that thoſe cities are more ſtraightly bound, which amongſt other hoſtages haue deliuered alſo noblemens daughters: for they dreame that they haue in them I know not what holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; foreſight of things; which maketh them regard their counſell, &amp; giue credit to their oracle. Vnder <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> of famous memorie, we haue ſeene <hi>Velleda</hi> a long time and with many nations counted as ſome diuine thing: and in times paſt did adore <hi>Aurinia,</hi> and many others, not of flatterie, or as though they would haue made them goddeſſes.</p>

               <p>OF all the gods, they adore eſpecially <hi>Mercurie;</hi> vnto whom they thinke it lawfull certaine daies, to offer men in ſacrifice: but <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> they pacifie with beaſts, lawfully killed to that vſe: &amp; ſom of the Sueuians ſacrifice to <hi>Iſis.</hi> What reaſon they haue to vſe that ſtrange ſacrifice, I know not: vnleſſe it be that the image of that goddeſſe, being faſhioned in forme of that kinde of boat, doth declare that their religion hath beene brought them from a ſtrange countrey. They thinke it a matter il beſeeming the greatnes of the gods, to incloſe them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in wals, or paint them in mans ſhape. They conſecrate woods and forreſtes; which ſecret places they call by the names of gods: which they ſee onely by apprehenſion and reuerence.</p>
               <p>Soothſaying and lots they obſerue aboue all others. Their cuſtome in caſting of lots is without fraude: for they cut a branche from a fruit-bearing-tree, into many peeces; and diſtinguiſhed with ſeuerall markes caſt them vpon a white garment, at auenture: then if the matter belong to a communaltie, the Prieſt; if to a priuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the maſter of the houſe hauing prayed the gods, and looking vp to the heauen, taketh vp euerie of them three times: and interpreteth them according to their markes. If the lots fall contrarie to their mindes, they conſult no more that day,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:18166:134"/>
the ſame matter. But if they do, yet they will trie what further credit there is in Soothſaying: for they are not ignorant in this countrey of obſeruing the ſinging of birdes and their flying, conſulting with their gods of both. And it is a thing pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar vnto that countrey to trie the preſages and warnings of horſes; which are bred and maintained in thoſe woods and forreſts, white, vnbacked, or vnlaboured: which harneſſed and put to a ſacred chariot, the Prieſt, King, or Prince of the citie do fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; obſeruing their noiſe and neying. Of all preſages this is of greateſt credit with the Prieſtes, noblemen, and common people: thinking themſelues miniſters of the gods; and the horſes priuie to their ſecrets. They haue another obſeruation among them, by which they ſearch out the euent of great and weightie battels; which is this. They get ſome one, how they can, of that nation with whom the warre ſhall be; and take another choiſe man of their owne, and arme them, each according to his faſhion; and ſo trie their valour: and by that preiudice, coniecture on whoſe ſide the victorie ſhall fall. In ſmall matters, the Princes themſelues determine of them: but if they be of importance, they all in generall conſult: but yet ſo, that thoſe things whoſe determination belong to the people, are concluded before the Prince. And vnleſſe ſome caſuall or ſudden accident fall out, they make their aſſemblies certaine daies, either in the firſt quarter or full moone; thinking that to be the luckieſt time to begin their workes. The number of daies they recken not, as we do, but of nights; and in them make their appointme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, and ſommonces to appeere, thinking that the day is gouerned by the night. Their libertie is cauſe, that they meet not togeither, nor as they are commaunded, but ſpende two or three daies in expecting one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. They ſit armed as they come, and the Prieſt, who hath authoritie to puniſh, commaundeth ſilence. Then the King or Prince, or euerie man according to his age, nobilitie, and renowne of warre, or as he is eloquent, beginneth to ſpeake. Vſing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſwaſion then authoritie of commaunding. If their opinion miſlike them, they reiect it with a murmuring noiſe: if it liked, they ſhake their iauelins: but the moſt honorable manner of liking is to approoue it by their weapons. It is lawfull in their councell to accuſe, and arraigne in criminall cauſes. Puniſhments are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the offence: traitors and fugitiues they hang on trees: the cowardly and vnwarlike, and ſuch as were vnnaturally lewd of their bodies, they did drown in mud and marriſhes, and couer them with hurdles. The drift of that diuerſitie of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments was; to declare that it was expedient to ſhewe offences as they were, in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, but hide heinous crimes. But in leſſer treſpaſſes, according to the qualitie of the puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, the parties conuicted, are fined, in ſome number of horſes, or other cattell; whereof part goeth to the King, or citie; part to the partie damnified, or to his kindred. In the ſame councels they chooſe rulers, to adminiſter iuſtice in townes and villages: which haue an hundred choſen out of the people, to accompanie them, which are as their counſell, and authoritie. They conſult neither of publicke nor priuate affaires but armed: but yet it is not the maner for any to take weapons, vnleſſe he haue beene iudged before by the citie able to vſe them: and then in the councell, either one of the gouernours, or his father, or ſome one of his kindred, doth honour the yoong man with a ſhield and a Framea. This is with them a gowne; this is the firſt honor giuen to yoong men: before reputed a part of their particular houſe, but from thence forward, of the common wealth. High nobilitie, or merit of predeceſſors, maketh their children although they be but yoong, woorthie of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, which aſſociat themſelues to the ſtronger, and long tried: and take it for no diſgrace, to be ſeene among their followers: among which there be likewiſe degrees according to his diſcretion of whoſe traine they be. And there is a great emulation
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:18166:135"/>
among the followers who ſhould be in greateſt fauour with his Prince: and amongſt the Princes, who ſhould haue the greateſt number following him, and moſt couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. This is their honour, this their ſtrength; to be garded alwaies with a company of choiſe youth: which is a credit and reputation, in peace; and in warre, a defence. And it is not onely an honour and glorie in ones owne nation to haue a gallant number, and a valiant in his traine; but is alſo a matter of reputation with cities adioyning: as men ſought vnto by Ambaſſadors: and preſented with gifts: and do oftentimes by their onely fame end warres. When they come to ioyne battell, it is a diſhonor to the Prince, to be ouercome in valour: and to his followers, not to go as far in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſſe as their Prince. Now to returne aliue from that battell, in which his Prince is ſlaine, is a perpetuall infamie and reproch: being the principalleſt part of their oath, to defend and maintaine him, and aſcribe their owne exploits to his glorie and honour. Princes fight for victorie; the followers, for the Prince. If the citie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are borne, grow lazie with a long peace, and idlenes; moſt of the yoong no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen, goe of their owne will to thoſe nations, wherein there is warres: bicauſe that nation diſliketh reſt and quietnes: as winning greater renowne in doubtfull and hazardeous attempts; and not able to entertaine ſo great number of followers, but by violence and warre: ſometimes by the liberalitie of their Prince getting that horſe of ſeruice, and bloodie and conquering ſword. Their bankets, and large, but rude diet, is inſteede of pay: but matter to miniſter liberalitie commeth by warre and rapine. To manure the ground, or expect the ſeaſon, thou canſt not ſo eaſilie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them; as to prouoke the enimie, and deſerue wounds: to get that with the ſweate of thy browes, which thou maiſt winne by the loſſe of thy blood, they hold as an idle &amp; ſlothfull part. When they are not buſied in wars, they giue not themſelues much to hunting: but ſpend more of their time in idlenes, as a people much giuen to ſleep and feed. When the valianteſt and warlikeſt are idle, they commit the care of houſhold affaires &amp; tillage, to women &amp; old men, &amp; to the weakeſt of their family; and do themſelues grow heauie and lazie: a ſtrange diuerſitie of diſpoſition, that the ſame men ſhould ſo much loue ſlouth, and hate quietnes. The cuſtome is in cities to beſtow by pole vpon the Princes, either of their cattell or graine, which is receiued as an honor, yet ſupplieth their wants. But aboue all, they are exceeding glad if any thing be preſented them by neighbour-nations, which do ſend ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in particular, ſometimes in common: as choiſe horſes, great weapons, furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for horſe, and chaines; and now we haue taught them alſo to receiue money. It is well knowen that the Germans dwell in no cities, nor will not ſuffer their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to ioyne together, but aſunder, the one from the other, as they liked beſt of their fountaines, fields, or wood. They build not their villages as we do, one houſe cloſe to another: but euery man leaueth a ſpace about his houſe, either as a remedie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt misfortunes of fire, or by vnskilfulnes in building. Parget and mortar they vſe not, nor tiles: and vſe to all buildings vnſquared and vnwrought timber, without any beautie or delight, but do daube ſome places very diligently with ſuch a cleare and ſhining earth, that it reſembleth a picture, or draught of colours. It is a faſhion amongſt them to dig deepe caues vnder ground, and couer them ouer with dung, as a ſuccour in the winter, and garner for their graine; tempering the rigour of the cold by ſuch places: and if at any time the enemie come vpon them, he forrageth all open places, but hidden vnder ground, are either not found, or elſe are ſaued, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are driuen to ſeeke them. They all weare a kinde of caſſock called <hi>ſagum,</hi> clapſed, or for want of one, faſtned with a thorne, and hauing no other garment, but naked, lye all day in the harth, or by the fire. The richer ſort are diſtinguiſhed from
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:18166:135"/>
the others by their garments, which are not large and wide as the Sarmates and Parthians vſe to weare them, but ſtraite, and ſhewing the proportion of euery part of the bodie. Beſides, they weare certaine pelts made of beaſts skins; thoſe neere the Rhene-banke careleſly; but thoſe which are farther off more curiouſly, as neuer trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming themſelues with far-fet merchandiſe. They make choiſe of certaine beaſts, and heere and there ſpecke their skins with ſpots: and the like with the skins of beaſts taken in the fartheſt Ocean, or vnknowen ſea. The man and womans attire diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in nothing, ſauing that the women often vſe linnen garments trimmed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlaced with purple: and the vpper parts of their bodies without ſleeues, their armes bare, and their boſome naked and vncouered. Yet matrimonie is ſeuerely kept among them: the thing moſt commendable of all their manner of life: for of all barbarous people, they alone content themſelues, euery man with one wife, except ſome very few: which not for vnruly luſt, but for their nobilitie are ſued vnto for ſundrie marriages. The wife giues not a dowry to her husband, but the husband to the wife. Their parents and neere kinſmen are preſent, when they giue any gifts the one to the other: which are not exquiſite as to daintie dames, or for to beautifie and trim the new married wife; but oxen, and a horſe with furniture, and a ſhield with a ſword, and lance. With theſe gifts the wife is taken, and ſhe alſo doth bring her husband ſome armes: this is the greateſt bond: theſe are the ſecret cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies: theſe they thinke to be the gods of marriage. And leaſt the woman ſhould thinke herſelfe exempt and free from bonds of vertue, or hazards of warre, in the very beginnings and firſt ſpeech of marriage, ſhe is put in minde, that ſhe commeth as a companion of his labours and dangers: and that ſhe ſhall ſuffer and venture the fame in peace and warre that he doth: that is the ſignification and conſtruction of the oxen yoked, of the horſe with bridle and furniture, this the meaning of the weapons and armes giuen on one ſide and the other: thus ſhe muſt liue, thus ſhe muſt die: ſhe receiueth that which ſhe muſt deliuer vnuiolated and pure to her children, which their daughters in lawe do receiue as worthie things, and yeeld a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to their nephues. They liue therefore in moſt ſtraite chaſtitie, vncorrupted with the allurements of ſhewes and ſpectacles, or prouocations in banketting. As well men as women are ignorant of the ſecrets of learning. Adulterie is ſeldome committed in ſo populous a nation, and the puniſhment for it incontinently inflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as beſt liketh the husband: who hauing cut her haire, turneth her naked out of his houſe in the preſence of her kinsfolks, and driueth and beateth her throughout all the towne: no pardon giuen to her that hath violated her chaſtitie: neither for her beautie, nor age, nor wealth, can ſhe euer after finde another husband<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No man laugheth at vices: neither when any is corrupted, or doth corrupt, do they ſay, it is the time. Yet there is one thing more commendable in thoſe cities, that only vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins do marrie, and that only once, and the man the like, contracting with the hope and deſire of one wife. As they haue but one bodie, one life; ſo they take but one husband: that they might haue no other thoughts, no farther deſires, nor loue him as ſo deſeruing it, but becauſe of matrimonie. To preſcribe a certaine number of children, or kill any of their neere kindred, they compt it a heinous crime. Good manners are of greater authoritie and force among them, then elſewhere good lawes. They grow to haue theſe great lims and bodies which we maruell at, naked, and ſlouenly in euery houſe. Euery mother nurſeth her owne children with her owne breaſts, and ſend them not to nurſes or other women. Thou ſhalt not know the Lord from the ſlaue, by any note of deintie and nice education: for they liue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the ſame cattell, and on the ſame ground, vntill age doth diſtinguiſh the

Siſters children are as much ſet by in their vnckles houſe, as in their fathers. Some are of opinion, that this bond of bloud is the ſtraiteſt and holieſt, and moſt of all required, in taking of hoſtages: as thoſe which are of a more conſtant minde, and in the familie the greateſt part: yet euery mans children ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede as heires: and teſtament they make none at all. If there be no children to ſucceede, the next in degree are brothers, vnckles by the fathers ſide and by the mothers. The more kindred, the greater affinitie, the more an old man is honored: and to be without children, is of no reputation. They muſt as well become enemie to their fathers enemies or kinſmens, as friend to their friends. Their hatred is not implacable: for mans ſlaughter it ſelfe is ſatisfied and redeemed with a certaine number of beaſts, which contenteth the whole familie, and is profitable for the common good: for where libertie is, there priuate enmities are dangerous.</p>

               <p>GReater hoſpitality and entertainment is no where more bountiful than there, being a curſed deed to barre any man his houſe: and not giue him meate and drinke according to his abilitie. When all is ſpent, the laſt hoſte will be a guide and companion vnto him to the next houſe vninuited: for that skilleth not; but are receiued with like curteſie: in reſpect of hoſpitalitie making no difference whether he be of acquaintance or not. If any thing be demaunded of him which is going away, the manner is to graunt it; and he may with like facilitie aske againe. Gifts are things which pleaſe them well: but thoſe which giue them do not thinke they do you a benefit therein, and thoſe which receiue them not bound or beholden for them. They entertaine their gueſts courteouſly: immediatly after they riſe (which for the moſt part is verie late and the day well ſpent) they waſh, and moſt commonly in warme water, as hauing long winters: and when they haue waſhed, they fall to eate, eurie man his ſtoole and his meſſe to himſelfe: then they fall to their buſines; and as oft to banket and make good cheere all armed. To ſit a tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a day and a night, is no diſgrace to any. There ariſe many quarrels (as common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it happeneth where drunkards meete) which ſeldome end with brawling and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious termes, but oftner with murder and hurt. In their bankets they conſult of peace and warre, make attonements betwixt ſuch as are at debate, make marriages, and chooſe their Princes: as a time when the mind is neuer more open to plaine dealing; or more ſturred vp to great attempts. The people being neither craftie nor ſubtle, through the libertie of the place doth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moſt diſcouer the ſecrets of his breaſt. Euerie mans minde then being open and diſcouered, the next day, they waigh and examine it; with a regard had to both the times.

And (which thou wouldeſt maruell at) freſh and faſting, they play at dice, as a matter of ſerious and earneſt buſines, with ſuch a raſh deſire of winning and loſing; that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all elſe is loſt, they lay their libertie and bodie vpon the laſt throw: and he who is ouercome entereth a voluntarie ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitude: and although he be yoonger, and ſtronger; yet ſuffereth himſelfe to be bound and ſold. Such is their obſtinacie in a bad matter; which they call faith: but ſlaues of this condition, they make away by marchandiſe, to rid themſelues of the ſhame of ſuch a victorie. Their other ſlaues they employ not in certaine affaires of houſe, as we do ours; but euerie one gouerneth his own houſe and houſhold. The Lord inioyneth him to pay a certaine of corne; or cattell, or apparell, as he doth his tenant, which the bondſlaue performeth &amp; no more: other duties of houſe belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to the wife &amp; children. It is a rare matter to beat their ſlaues, or ouer-labour or empri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon them: yet they are woont to kill them; not by diſcipline and ſeueritie, but car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with ſudden anger, as againſt an enimie, ſauing that it is vnpuniſhed. The freed men are not much aboue the ſlaue; they ſeldome beare any ſway in the houſe or city, ſauing in thoſe countries which haue a King. For there they are in greater au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, then ether free borne or noblemen: in other countries freed men being of vnequall condition, make libertie better knowen. To practiſe vſurie, and in rich themſelues with it, they know not what it meaneth: which is better kept then if it were forbidden. All the ground the inhabitants about do poſſeſſe, according to their number: which they diuide among themſelues, according to their calling; which is eaſily done by reaſon the fields are ſo ſpatious. Their earable land they change by yeeres: and let onelie; not labouring to ouercome the fertilnes and largenes of it by induſtrie; by planting of orchardes; incloſing their medowes; and watering their gardens: onely they vſe much tillage. Hereupon they diuide not the yeere into ſo many ſeaſons, as we do: the winter, ſpring time, and ſommer, they vnderſtand, and haue names for: but as for the autumne, as well the name, as the commodities it bringeth, are vnknowen. Ambition they vſe none in their funerals: onely that one thing is obſerued; that the bodies of noblemen are burned with a certaine kinde of wood. The pile of the funerall fire, they do neither fill vp with apparell nor ſweete odors: euerie mans armes, and ſomes horſe was burnt likwiſe. The toombe is raiſed vp with turnes of earth: great workes and laborious monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they deſpiſe as heauie for the dead: lamentation and teares they quickly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare; but griefe and ſorrow ſlowly. It is ſeemely enough for the women to mourne; and for men to remember the dead. This is it which we haue learned in generall, of the beginning and cuſtomes of the Germans. Now I will lay downe the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and cuſtomes of euerie people in particular; and how they differ; and what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions haue gone out of Germanie, to the Gallois.</p>

                  <hi>IVlius</hi> of famous memorie, the chiefeſt of all authors doth deliuer, that the ſtate of the Gallois hath in times paſt beene of greater force and power, then now it is: and therefore not vnlike, but the Gallois went into Germanie. For what great hinderance could the riuer be; that, euerie nation as he was ſtrong, ſhould not ſet himſelfe in poſſeſſion and chaunge ſeats, yet vnoccupied, and not diuided by any

power of kingdomes? Therefore the Heluetians held that which lyeth betweene the Hercynian forreſt, and the two riuers Rhene and Moene: and the Boij that which is beyond, both nations of Gallia. The name of the Boiemi doth yet continue, and doth ſignifie the old memorie of theplace, although the inhabitants be changed: But whether the Arauiſci from the Oſi, a people of Germanie, came into Panno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia; or the Oſi from the Auariſci into Germanie, is yet vncertaine: conſidering they vſe the ſame language, lawes, and cuſtomes: for being equall in times paſt in pouertie and libertie; the commodities and diſcommodities of both the banks were common to them alike. The Treueri and the Neruij ambitiouſly ſeeme to haue their beginning fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Germans: as though by this glorie of blood, they ſhould be vnlike, and differ in cowardlines from the Gallois. Without all doubt the banke of Rhene is inhabited with the people of Germanie, the Vangiones, Treboci, Nemetes. The Vbij, albeit they haue deſerued to be a Roman colonie: and deſire to be called rather Agrippinians by the name of their foundreſſe, though not aſhamed of their beginning, haue heretofore paſt ouer; and for good proofe of their fidelitie, haue beene planted vpon the banke of Rhene, to keepe off others, and not for any ſafetie of their owne. Of all theſe nations, the chiefeſt in valour are the Batauians, which inioye ſmall parte of the banke of Rhene, but inhabit an Ilande of the riuer ofRhene; in times paſt a people of the Catti, and went by reaſon of ciuill ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into thoſe countries to be a part of the Roman Empire. The honour and marks of auncient alliance do yet continue, for they are neither contemned by pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tributes, nor oppreſſed by the farmer of publick reuenues. They are exempted from charges and contributions, as reſerued for vſe of warre, as it were armes and weapons. The Mattiaci do the like allegeance: for the greatnes of the people of Rome hath been inlarged further then the old bounds of the Empire did extend, and beyond the Rhene. Therefore in regard of their habitation and bounds, they inhabit the banke, but in hart and minde dwell with vs: in other things like the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauians; ſauing that by reaſon of their ſoile and aire, they are more forward and ſtout. I will not accompt them among the people of Germanie, albeit they are planted beyond Rhene, and the Danube, of whoſe land the tenth is raiſed. The lewdeſt of all the Gallois, and whom neede hath driuen to venture, haue poſſeſſed that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey as doubtfully holden. Not long after, hauing inlarged their bounds, and placed fortreſſes farther, they are within the compaſſe of the Empire, and are a part of the prouince. Beyond theſe, the Cattians begin from the Hercynian forreſt, but haue not ſo wide &amp; mariſh a countrey, as the other cities in which Germanie doth open and ſpread itſelfe: for the hils are one by another, and continue a certaine ſpace, and then by little and little waxe thinner: and the Hercynian forreſt doth containe the Catti, and is the bounds of their territorie. They are a people hardned to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, well ſet, ſterne countenanced, and of greater courage. As Germans go, they are ſenſible wiſe men, and conſiderate: they preferre choiſe men, harken to their leaders, know their ranks, know where aduantages are, bridle their heate, diſpoſe of the day to their benefit, intrench in the night, hold fortune among things doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and eſteeme of valour as of certaintie: and which is moſt rare, and vnderſtood only by diſcipline, they repoſe more aſſurance in their leader, then in the armie. All their ſtrength conſiſteth in footemen, whom beſides their armes they loade with yron tooles and prouiſion. Thou maiſt ſee others go to skirmiſh: but the Catti march to warre. They ſeldome skirmiſh, or fight at aduenture. Their horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are of this propertie, that they either quickly win the victorie, or yeeld. Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dennes is neere vnto feare; lingering draweth neerer conſtancie. And that which is
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:18166:137"/>
ſeldome vſed among other people of Germanie, through their boldnes and hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes it is growen to a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon conſent among the Catteans: that is, when they come to ripe yeeres, they ſuffer their haire and beard to grow at length; and neuer put off that vowed ornament of the face, and as it were a bond of vertue, vntill they haue killed an enemie. Vpon bloud and ſpoile, they vncouer their forehead, and ſay, they haue paied back the price of their birth; and thinke themſelues worthie of their countrey and parents: the cowardly and vnwarlike remaine in their ilfauourednes. Beſides this, euery man as he is moſt valiant, weareth an yron ring (an ignominious thing to that people) as it were a bond, vntill they rid themſelues of it, by killing an enemie. This qualitie pleaſeth many of the Catteans. And then they grow graye, reſpected of their owne people and enemies: theſe begin euery battell: theſe make alwayes the firſt ranke; ſtrange to behold: for in time of peace, they are altogether as fierce in countenance. There is not one of them that hath a houſe, or liuing, or care of any thing. As they come to euery mans houſe they are maintained: prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall of other mens; and contemners of their owne: vntill through feeble old age, they are no longer able to indure ſo hard a labour.</p>

               <p>NExt vnto the Catti, the Vſipij and Tencteri do inhabit the Rhene, running in a certaine channell, and which may ſuffice for a bound. The Tencteri be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their auncient renowne of warres, excell the reſt in ſeruice of horſe: and the Catteans deſerue no greater commendation for footemen, then the Tencteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans for horſemen. So did their predeceſſors ordaine it, and ſucceſſors follow it. Theſe are the childrens paſtimes; this the emulation betwixtyong men; and old men continue the ſame; and horſes are deliuered, as rights of inheritance among the familie: and the ſonnes receiue them, though not the eldeſt, but he who is moſt couragious, and likelieſt to make a marſhall man. Hard by the Tencteri, in times paſt the Bructeri did inhabit; but now it is reported that the Chamauians, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griuarians, are entred into that countrey, and wholie rooted out and chaſed the Bructerians, by agreement of nations adioyning: either as hating them for their pride, or for ſweetnes of pray, or ſome fauor of the gods towards vs; as not denying vs the ſpectacle of the battel, wherein there were ſlaine threeſcore thouſand, not by the Roman armes and weapons: but, which is more glorious, to ſhew vs paſtime, and pleaſe our eye. I wiſh that if thoſe people cannot loue vs, that they would hate one another, ſeeing that the ſtate of the Empire fatally declining, fortune can do vs no greater fauor, then ſowe ſedition among the enemies. The Angriuarians and Chamauians, haue behinde them the Dulgibini and Chaſuari, and other nations not greatly ſpoken of; and before them the Friſians. The Friſians are called great or ſmall, according to their ſtrength: the Rhene bordering both vnto the Ocean, and beſides that, do comprehend huge and ſpacious lakes, which the Roman nauie hath paſt: yea and the Ocean itſelfe we haue entred into and tried on that ſide. And the fame goeth, that <hi>Hercules</hi> pillers are yet there to be ſeene; either becauſe <hi>Hercules</hi> went ſo farre, or elſe becauſe by common conſent all that is any where magnificall, is attributed to his renowme. <hi>Druſus Germanicus</hi> wanted not courage: but the Ocean hindered vs for being ouer inquiſitiue of him or <hi>Hercules.</hi> After that, no man aſſayed to do it, as being an act of greater deuotion and reuerence, to beleeue the actions of the gods, rather then know them. Hitherto we haue ſeene the Weſt part of Germanie: towards the North it goeth bowing with a great compas. And firſt
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:18166:138"/>
of all the people of the Chauceans, although they begin at the Friſians, and poſſeſſe part of the ſhore, coaſt all thoſe nations I haue made mention of, vntill they wind into the Catti; and ſo ſpacious and huge countrey the Chauci do not only hold, but fill likewiſe: of all the German nation the nobleſt; and deſirous to maintaine their greatnes by iuſtice: without couetouſnes or vnbrideled luſt, quiet and retired; ſtirre vp no warres, neuer waſte, ſpoile, nor rob. And which is a ſpeciall marke of their valour and ſtrength, they got not their ſuperioritie ouer others by any wrongs of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. Yet they are all readie for warre, and if occaſion require to make an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, wanting neither horſe nor men: and although they lie quiet, yet their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation is neuer the leſſer. On the ſide of the Chauci and Catti, the Cheruſci haue nouriſhed long, beeing neuer prouoked, an idle and lazie peace: which was more ſweet than ſafe vnto them, bicauſe there is no ſure peace betweene ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and ſtrong people. For when the matter is come to hand-ſtrokes, modeſtie and good dealing be termes which belong to ſuperiors. So the Cheruſci in times paſt good and iuſt, are now called cowards and fooles: and the fortune of the Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti being fauourable, is cauſe that they are counted wiſe. The Foſi, a people bordering vpon the Cheruſci, are touched with their ruine, companions in their aduerſitie, though in proſperitie they were inferiour vnto them. Neere vnto the ſame coaſt of the Ocean, the Cimbrians inhabite; now a ſmall people, but highly renowned: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing yet remaining certaine markes of their old glotie; to wit, on both the bankes, trenches and lodges: by the circuit of which, thou maiſt yet meaſure the greatnes and ſtrength of that nation, and beleeue the number of ſo great an armie. It was ſixe hundred and fortie yeeres after the foundation of our citie, before the Cimbri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans armes were heard of, when <hi>Caecilius Metellus,</hi> and <hi>Papirius Carbo</hi> were Conſuls. From that time, vnto the ſecond time that the Emperor <hi>Traian</hi> was Conſull, by iuſt account, are two hundred and ten yeeres: and ſo many yeeres we were a conquering Germanie. In the middle time, there were many loſſes on both parts. Not the Samnites, not the Carthagineans, not the Spaniards, or the Gallois; no, not the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian haue ſo often troubled vs: the libertie of the Germans being more earneſt, than the kingdome of the Arſacides. For what can the Eaſt obiect againſt vs, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the death of <hi>Craſſus,</hi> when he had defeated <hi>Pacorus,</hi> before troden downe by <hi>Ventidius?</hi> But the Germans, hauing either ſlaine or taken <hi>Carbo</hi> and <hi>Caſsius,</hi> and <hi>Scaurus Aurelius,</hi> and <hi>Seruilius Cepio,</hi> and <hi>M.

               <p>NOw we will ſpeake of the Sueui, which are not one nation as the Catti and Tencteri: and poſſeſſing the greater part of Germanie, and ſeuered by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar names and countries: although by one generall name they be called Sueui: whoſe marke is to curle their haire and tie it on knots. By that the Sueui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is diſtinguiſhed from the other Germans: and the free borne Sueuian from the bond man. That in other countries is vſed alſo but ſeldome times, either for affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:18166:138"/>
with the Sueuians; or as it often happeneth by imitation, and whileſt they be yoong: but the Sueuians euen vntill they be old and gray, haue their haire ſtanding an end, and often tie it on the crown only: princes weare it after a finer faſhion. That is the harmeleſſe care they haue of their beautie. For they vſe it not, either to winne loue, or be beloued: but turne it vp to a certaine height, to ſeeme to the enimie more terrible, when they go thus trimmed to the warre. The Semnones ſay, they are the moſt auncient of the Sueuians, and the moſt noble. The credit of their antiquitie they confirme with this ceremonie. At certaine times, all of one blood meet by their deputies in a wood, reputed holy by the auguration of their forefathers, and auncient reuerence; where publickly killing a man, they celebrate the barbarous beginnings of their ceremonie. Yet there is another reaſon why the wood is had in reuerence. No man entereth into it, but bound with ſomewhat as an inferiour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and acknowledging the power of the god. If he fall by chaunce; it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for him to riſe, or get vp: but is rowled out: all their ſuperſtition tending to this that from thence the nation had his beginning: that there dwelleth the God, ruler of all others; and vnto whom all other things are ſubiect and obedient. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of the Semnones giueth this authoritie: their countrey is inhabited by an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred villages: and by their great bodie, they take themſelues to be the head of the Sueuians. Contrarily, the Longobards are renowned, by reaſon their number is ſo ſmall: that being hemmed in with many, verie puiſſant nations; yet maintaine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, not by doing any dutie to any but by warres and dangers. After them the Reudigni, and Auiones, and Angli, and Varini, and Eudoſes, and Suardones, and Nuithones, are defended by riuers or woods: hauing no notable thing particular in any; ſauing that generally they adore Herthum, that is, the mother-earth, whom they beleeue to be preſent at mens affaires. There is a wood called Caſtum in an Iland of the Ocean, and a chariot dedicated in it, couered with apparell, which one Prieſt onely may lawfully touch. He knoweth that the goddeſſe is in ſome ſecret part of the houſe, and followeth her with great reuerence as ſhe is lead by Kowes: and make thoſe holy daies &amp; places of ioy which ſhe vouchſafeth to honor with hir preſence. Warre they make none, nor put on any armour, nor ſhew any weapon: but peace and quietnes is onely knowen and loued: vntill the ſame prieſt, bring backe the goddeſſe to her Temple, filled with the conuerſation of mortall men. Then the chariot and the apparell, if you will beleeue it, the diuinitie itſelfe is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in ſome ſecret lake: bond men miniſter vnto her, which the ſame lake doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently ſwallow vp. Whereof ariſeth a ſecret terror, and an holy ignorance, what that ſhould be, which they onely ſee which are a periſhing. And this part of Sueuia, reacheth far within the country of Germanie: the neerer (that I may deſcribe that part which lyeth by Danub, as I haue done that which lyeth along the Rhene) is the citie of the Hermunduri, faithfull to the Romans: and therefore of all the Germans trafficke, not onely vpon the banke of Rhene, but euen within the hart of the countrey, and in the moſt famous colonie of the Prouince Rhaetia. Theſe goe all ouer without a guard: and whereas we ſhew other nations, ſomtimes our armes, ſometimes our campe; to theſe we lay open our houſes, and villages, as people not deſiring them. In the countrey of the Hermunduri, the riuer Albis hath his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, in times paſt a famous riuer and well knowen; but now onely heard of. Neere vnto the Hermundurians dwell the Nariſci, the Marcomani, and Quadi. The greateſt renowne and ſtrength that the Marcomans haue, is in that they got their dwellings by valour and driuing out in times paſt the Boiens. Neither do the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſci, and the Quadi degenerate. And that is as it were the frontier of Germanie, on
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:18166:139"/>
that ſide which the Danube borders. The Marcomani and the Quadi, had euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till times of our memorie, Kings of their owne nation, of the noble ſtocke of the Marobodui, and Tudri: but now they ſuffer ſtrangers; which haue their ſtrength and power, by the authoritie of the Romans: and ſeldome vſe our armes, but are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten helpt with our money. Neither are the Marſigni, Gothini, Oſi, Burij, which are behinde the Marcomani and Quadi, of leſſer valour: among which the Marſigni, and Burij, reſemble the Sueuians in ſpeech and attire. The Gallican toong doth conuince the Gothinos, and the Pannonicall the Oſos, not to be Germans: and that they endure to paie tribute; part of the tribute the Sarmates, part the Quadi charge them with, as ſtrangers. The Gothini, the more to their ſhame, dig for mines of iron: and all theſe people inhabite ſmall ſtore of plaine ground, but wood-landes, and hill tops. Sueuia is deuided by a continuall ridge of hils, beyond which dwell many nations: amongſt which, the name of the Lygians is fartheſt ſpread into many ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. It will ſuffice to reckon the ſtrongeſt, as the Arios, Helueconas, Maninos, Ely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſios, Naharualos. Among the Naharualians there is a wood long agone conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to religion, ouer which a Prieſt apparelled in womans attire is ſuperintendent: but the Romans interpret them to be the goddes <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux.</hi> The name of the god is Alcis. Images there are none, nor ſigne of ſtrange ſuperſtition: yet they are reuerenced as brothers, and two yong men. But the Arij beſides their ſtrength, wherein they go beyond the other people I haue made mention of, fell and cruell, do ſet forth their naturall fiercenes with arte, &amp; time: for they vſe black targets, and die their bodies with the ſame colour, and chooſe the darkeſt nights to fight in, ſtriking a terror with the ſhadow of ſo deadly an armie, into the enemies; none of them able to indure ſo ſtrange and as it were helliſh ſight, the eyes being firſt ouercome in all battels. Beyond the Lygians the Gothones liue vnder Kings in a more ſeuere go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment then the other people of Germanie, and not in full libertie. Then from the Ocean follow the Rugij, &amp; Lemouij, all of them bearing for their marke round bucklers, and ſhort ſwords, and liuing vnder the ſubiection of Kings. After thoſe are the cities of the Suionians, ſcituated in the Ocean; beſides men and armor, ſtrong in ſhipping; which in making differ from other veſſels, in that both ends are fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts, readie to land at each end, without ſaile, or oares in a ranke in the ſides, but the mariners are at libertie readie to change hither and thither, as occaſion ſerueth, as in ſome other riuers. Thoſe people eſteeme of riches: and therefore one hath amongſt them abſolute rule and gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and not at the will of the ſubiect. They are not all licenſed to weare weapons as in other parts of Germanie, but their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons are ſhut vp vnder a keeper, and that a ſlaue, becauſe the enemie can make no ſudden incurſion againſt them, by reaſon of the Ocean. If the ſouldiers be idle and at reſt, they eaſily grow inſolent: and in deede it is not for the Kings profit to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the charge of armor to noblemen, or free borne, or freed men. Beyond the Suionas, there is another ſea ſo ſlow and almoſt immoueable, that many thinke it to be the bounds which compaſſe in the whole worlde, becauſe that the Sunne continueth ſo cleare and bright from his ſetting till the riſing, that it darkneth the ſtarres. And ſome are further perſwaded, that the ſound of him is hard as he riſeth out of the ſea: and many ſhapes of gods ſeene, and the beames of his head. So farre the fame is true, and that there was the end of nature and the world. Now on the right ſhore of the Sweuian ſea the Aeſtyans inhabit, whoſe maner of life is like the Sweuians, but their language more like the Britains language. They adore the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the goddes: for a skutchion of their ſuperſtition, they carry the pictures of wilde Boares. That ſerueth them for all weapons and all defence, and aſſureth all
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:18166:139"/>
thoſe which worſhip that goddeſſe, euen amongſt the enimies. They haue ſmall vſe of iron, but great, of clubs. They ſowe corne and plant fruits, more painefully, than ordinarily the ſlothfull German is accuſtomed to do. They ſearch out what the ſea will yeeld: and onely amongſt all, gather on the flattes, and on the very ſhore Roſin <note n="*" place="margin">or Amber.</note>, which they call Gleſum. Yet they haue not ſought out (ſo barbarous they are) what is the nature of it, or by what meanes it is ingendred. Yea a long time i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> lay as nought worth, like other purgings of the ſea, vntill our wantonnes gaue it a name. They haue no vſe of it themſelues: but gather it foule &amp; filthie; &amp; ſo bring it, and maruell at the price we giue for it. But it is the iuice of trees: for there ſhine in them ſome birdes or foule, which wrapped in the humor, and afterwards waxt hard, are ſo ſhut in it. And as in the ſecret places of the Eaſt, there are fertill woods and forreſts, which ſweat Frankinſence and Balmes: ſo may I beleeue that in the Ilands of the Weſt, there are others, which being neere to the ſunne beames, yeeld an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, which melted runneth into the next ſea, and by force of tempeſt is carried to the oppoſite ſhore. If by fire thou wilt make proofe what the nature of Amber is, it will burne like vnto wood pitched and roſened: and nouriſheth a fat and ſtrong ſauoring fire: then waxeth pliant and clammie like Roſin or Pitch. Hard by the Suionians, be the Sitones: alike in all things, ſauing one, which is, that a woman is their ruler: ſo far they degenerat, not onely from libertie, but alſo from bondage: and there is the end of Sueuia. I am in doubt, whether I ſhould reckon the Peucini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Venedians, and Fennians, among the Germans, or Sarmates: although the Peucinians, which ſome call Baſtarnas, reſemble the Germans in language, beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, houſing, &amp; dwelling: but all are generally, ſlouenly and lazie: and the noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men allied by marriage with the Sarmates, are ſomewhat transformed into their v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage: and the Venedians haue learned many of their faſhions alſo. For they ſcowre and rob all the hils &amp; woods which lie betweene the Peucinians and Fennians. Yet theſe may rather be accounted Germans; bicauſe they build houſes, carrie targets, and are good footmen. None of which the Sarmates do vſe, but alwaies ride in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, or on horſeback. The Fennians are verie barbarous &amp; beggerly: hauing neither armes, horſes, nor houſes; no food but herbs; no apparell but leather pelts; no bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding but the ground: hauing all their hope in their arrowes, which for want of iron, they head with bones. Man and woman liueth by the ſame hunting: for the women follow, and aske for part of the pray. Yoong children haue no other ſuccour againſt wild beaſts, and hard weather, but ſome couerture made of boughes: that is the lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of yoong and old. That they thinke to be more glorious and magnificall, than toile in manuring the earth; and trouble themſelues in building; and turmoile betwixt hope and feare, about their owne and other mens goods. Thus ſecure againſt men and gods, they haue woon this hard point, that they neede make no vowes at all. The reſt is fabulous, as that the Helluſij, and Oxionae, haue the viſage and countenance of men, but the bodies and members of beaſts: which I leaue as a thing to me vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen.</p>
