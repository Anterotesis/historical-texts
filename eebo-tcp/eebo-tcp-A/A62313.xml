         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

WILLIAM HAMMOND, <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
            </head>
            <p>AMidſt the great deprava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Morality, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the preſent Age is
chargeable, it is ſome comfort, that
there is a certain improvement
of Gratitude, of which there are,
at leaſt, ſo many Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as we find Dedicatories.
You have many times very ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
<pb facs="tcp:60941:3"/>
ſurpriz'd me with your
Kindneſſes, and this is the firſt
Opportunity I have had, to make a
Publick Acknowledgment thereof.</p>
            <p>In the primitive fervour of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi>
Diſcipline, men were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to undergo publick penances,
in order to the expiation of ſecret
miſcarriages. Why therefore may
not a private act of Generoſity
lay an obligation upon the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
to make an open celebration
thereof, if there be a concurrence
and combination of circumſtances
to enforce it?</p>
            <p>The former productions of this
<hi>Comical</hi> and <hi>Burleſque</hi> Author,
of my publiſhing in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that
<pb facs="tcp:60941:3"/>
is to ſay, his <hi>Novels,</hi> were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs'd
to the Patronage of the
worthily - worſhipful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Thomas
Stanley,</hi> Eſquire, and I am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
apt to attribute the kind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
they met withal in the
World to the ſacredneſs of that
Dedication. The preſent Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of <hi>Letters</hi> is the cloſe of
all that is to be expected of his
in Proſe: And 'tis my preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that, being recommended to
the publick, under a name ſo
neerly related to him, they will
meet with a ſucceſs anſwerable
to that of the others.</p>
            <p>But whatever entertainment
they may have, I make this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
<pb facs="tcp:60941:4"/>

I have made a Manifeſto of my

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>IN the Year 1670, I Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd
the laſt <hi>Novel</hi> I could
meet withal of Monſieur
<hi>Scarron</hi>'s, under the Title of
<hi>The Vnexpected Choice,</hi> Printed
for Mr. <hi>John Martyn</hi> at the
<hi>Bell</hi> in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church-Yard.
In the Addreſs to the Reader
before that Piece, I made him
a promiſe of ſome other, of the
<pb facs="tcp:60941:5"/>
ſame Author's, which being
then upon the <hi>Stocks</hi> was in a
very fair way to be <hi>launch'd</hi>
within a ſhort time. The Work
then intended, and indeed where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ſome ſhort Progreſs had been
made, is this preſent Collection
of his <hi>Letters,</hi> which had it not
been miſlay'd, and ſo given
over for loſt, might have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
long ere this, poſſibly,
to the great ſatisfaction of thoſe
who were not diſſatisfy'd with
his other <hi>Productions.</hi> What
ſucceſs, and kind reception they
have found, the frequent Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of them do ſufficiently
teſtifie. 'Tis preſum'd, his <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:60941:5"/>
may be as divertive to ſome
as his <hi>Novels,</hi> that is, to thoſe
who are Judges of Wit; for
an Artiſt muſt needs be injur'd,
if he be try'd by any, but his
Peers. There was alſo a deſign,
of making ſome Additionals to
this little Collection, out of other
<hi>French</hi> Authors, but, upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
conſideration, it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ'd
to the next Edition of
it, which the Bookſeller is in
great hope to ſee, ſoon after this
next long Vacation.</p>

            <head>A LETTER
From Monſieur De BALZAC, to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
COSTAR, concerning the Works
of Monſieur SCARRON.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Book you were pleas'd to ſend
me from Monſieur <hi>Scarron</hi> is a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
which I am extreamly oblig'd
to value. Upon the firſt peruſal, it
prov'd an effectual remedy, and eas'd me of
an oppreſſion of the Spleen, which might
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60941:9"/>
haply have put a period to my breathing,
had it not been for that ſeaſonable relief.
I am in hopes, it may yet do ſome further
Cure, if I uſe it oftner. It is not impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but, by the help of it, I may be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
out of that Philoſophical Melancholy,
and indivertive ſeriouſneſs, which I am too
much ſubject to. Nay, probably, I may
thereby learn to put <hi>Chancery</hi>-Bills and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends
into rime, and become jocund and
cheerful by contagion. This certainly is
the moſt admirable <hi>indiſpos'd</hi> perſon that
ever was heard of; there is ſomething in
him which tranſcends health it ſelf, I mean
that health which we may call ſtupid and
material: for you know, that the <hi>Arabians,</hi>
ſpeaking of alacrity, affirm it to be the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and ſpirit of a lively and ſtirring health.
Since you are deſirous to know what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
reflections I have made on this <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpos'd</hi>
perſon, and expect I ſhould digeſt
my thoughts of him into a particular Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
I am, in the firſt place, to give you
this character of him, That, of all the men
I ever convers'd with, he muſt be guilty of
either the greateſt diſſimulation, or the
greateſt conſtancy. I ſay, that he ſhall riſe
up in Judgment againſt the delicacy and
blandiſhments whereto humane Nature is
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60941:9"/>
ſo much inclin'd, or that Pain, and all its
afflictive retinue treat him more gently
than they do other men. I ſay, there is
ſome probability, that the common Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner
puniſhes the Patient with ſome kind
of lenity and remorſe. When I ſee him
laughing, as he does, in the midſt of his
torments, I muſt confeſs my ſelf apt to be
of an opinion, That his pain comes not up
to that degree we commonly aſſign it, to be
ſuch, and amounts only to a certain titilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
In fine, I ſtick not to affirm, that the
<hi>Prometheus,</hi> the <hi>Hercules,</hi> the <hi>Philoctetes,</hi>
mention'd in the Fables, not to ſay any
thing of <hi>Job,</hi> the truth of whoſe ſtory we
doubt not of, ſay very great and remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable
things in the violence of their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
but they are far from ſpeaking
ſuch as are pleaſant, and divertive. I muſt
acknowledge, that, in many places of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
I have met with Griefs, from
which, ſuch as endur'd them, acquir'd the
reputation, ſome of Conſtancy; ſome of
Modeſty; ſome of Prudence, nay, ſome
of Eloquence; but of any remarkable for a
perpetual intermixture of Alacrity, this is
the onely Example: No, I could never meet
there with any mention of a Mind, ſoprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled
by the dictates of any Sect, as that it
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60941:10"/>
could dance and be frolickſom, in a Body,
where the Palſey had taken up its Quarters.
So obſervable a Prodigy deſerves to come
under the conſideration of Philoſophers, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
upon the queſt of things requiring
the greateſt curioſity. 'Twere an omiſſion
in Hiſtory to forget him; and if I were in
an humour to be an Hiſtorian, as I am an
Hiſtoriographer, I ſhould not account it
the leaſt Miracle of our Time, which hath
produc'd ſo many ſuch. It is not my deſign
to detract ought from the reputation of the
Dead, with whom I muſt acknowledg my
ſelf to have had a friendſhip: But there are
different degrees of Reputation, and though
the quality of an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> be a Title of no
ſmall Account in a Chriſtian Family, yet is
it to be confeſs'd, that the Martyrdom of the
Son is ſomewhat that is more rare than the
<hi>Apoſtolical</hi> employment of the Father. What
think you, would be the ſentiments of your
<hi>Seneca</hi> upon this occaſion, that <hi>Seneca,</hi> who
heretofore took ſo great a pleaſure in Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of ſuch matters, and who ſo often hath
ſought the occaſions of doing it? Will it
not be found true, that that diſdainful and
inſolent Vertue, ſo much celebrated by him,
which brags of its being at eaſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturb'd
in <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s Bull, and could ſay,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60941:10"/>
that it was pleaſant being there, was but the
ſimple figure of this Vertue ſo accompany'd
by Meekneſs and Humility, as that it knows
how to put in practice the <hi>Paradoxes</hi> of the
other, and that without the leaſt oſtentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
Let us then conclude, to the honor of
him, who calls himſelf the moſt humble,
moſt Obedient, moſt Oblig'd, and moſt <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpos'd</hi>
Servant and Subject to a great
Queen, that there is either Ecſtaſie and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm
in his Indiſpoſition, and that the
Soul executes her functions apart, without
being any way immers'd in Matter; or that
there is an extraordinary conſtancy and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
in it, and that the Soul, in its ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
with the Body, hath all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
that a ſtronger perſon hath over a
weaker.</p>

Majeſty, <hi>Madam,</hi> you are an admirable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
In all places wherever you come, your
Eyes make you more Subjects than a great
Kingdom had given you; and if they do of
themſelves all we have ſeen done by them,
without your taking the trouble of giving
them any inſtructions, it muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd,
that the World affords not any that
are more beautiful and more attractive, but
withal more dangerous. Hence it comes,
that, in all the Perſons who viſit me, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
a certain Rivalſhip in the expreſſions
they make of your Empire over them; but
the particular Miracle your Majeſty hath
wrought is upon the Ladies, who though
naturally inclin'd to envy all others, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
in an unanimous acknowledgment of
your perfections. <hi>Madam,</hi> I ſhould dread
being too free with your Majeſty, were I not
aſſur'd, that you know better than any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in the World, how great a doſe of <hi>Icarus,</hi>

and that the Hiſtory of thoſe two teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarious
attempters, though the cloſe of it
be not much to the advantage of thoſe poor
Merchants of Immortality, is that, of all the
Fables, which beſt pleaſes them, and is of

applauded Poet, but would prefer the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60941:13"/>
of being a Modern <hi>Ixion,</hi> before
that of turning a ſtanza well, and an Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick
Confidence (ſo they call their Platonick

Money, or both. But, <hi>Madam,</hi> poſſibly I
play the wanton with the Command your

I have not already done it. I am therefore
to beg this favour, if your Majeſty be pleas'd

that I may know, to what degree of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

ſo much to his fault, as his unhappineſs,
that he is ſo ſoon diſcarded after ſo favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

            <p>SInce you have had the curioſity to ſee
me, as the Queen of <hi>Sweden</hi> had before
you, it is but juſt, you ſhould, as ſhe did,
give me leave to fall in Love with you, and
to give you the Honour of a thing, which it
may be is already paſt depending on your
conſent. If you imagine I ask any thing of
you, which you ought not to grant me, and
that I undertake more than I am able to
perform, I am content to be reduc'd into
the number only of your Friends, and to
conceal from you, what other more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
relation I might be capable of. For
without your condeſcending to that, there
will be no occaſion of my waiting on you,
which will be an extraordinary affliction to
me; for I was extreamly deſirous to uſe the
utmoſt of my endeavours and abilities to
give you ſatisfaction. After ſuch a diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
as this is, of my intentions to you, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it to your own imagination, whether any
thing in the World would tempt me to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60941:15"/>
diſappoint you. I ſhall therefore, with much
ſincerity, give you an account of the good
and bad qualities of the Perſon, whom you
are to look on as your humble Servant, as
long as he lives. His Body, indeed, as you
might have obſerv'd, is very irregular, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that he is thought a dangerous ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle
to Women with Child. As to the
Soul, he is ſo well content with his own,
that he would not make an exchange with
any in the World, but your ſelf. When he
loves, he does it with ſuch violence, that he
is ſometimes aſham'd of it; and ſince you
muſt know all, though he be very punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
in acquitting himſelf of the obligations
and devoirs of Friendſhip, yet in one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
he is defective, to wit, that of writing
to his Friends. But it is to be conſider'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
that he ſpeaks advantageouſly of them
upon all occaſions, expreſſing himſelf with
a kind of fury, and ſometimes is ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate,
as to weary out his Auditors; and
when he is obliged to vindicate ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
whom he loves, he can hardly be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed
from a Lion. If you like me
upon theſe qualifications, I am, Body and
Soul, at your ſervice. In the mean time,

ſticks any thing cloſe to your Heart, when
you amuſe your ſelf in giving me a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
relation of all the noble exploits, ſhe is
able to perform either in Peace or War. If
the deſcription you have made of her be free
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60941:17"/>
from flattery, I muſt confeſs, I had rather
have broken a leg, than ever have known
her, nay though it were ſuch, as that I might
venture it at the dancing of a Ball; and I
do adviſe you not to be too familiar with
her, ſince you have not ſo much time to
ſquander away. But is there, in earneſt,
any more in it, than that you, having little
to do, yet deſirous to be doing, have given
me an ingenious draught of your own ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
of Beauty, and attributed them
all to the Perſon you were moſt converſant
withal? For you tell me ſo many things of
her, that I ſhould believe but little, were
it not for this reflection, that you would
not have written me ſo excellent and ſo
long a Letter, without ſome deſign. For, at
<hi>Paris,</hi> it was never believ'd till now, that
there was any perſon at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> whoſe
attractions might raiſe a Love in Monſieur
<hi>Guyonet.</hi> But upon the reading of your
Letter, I am eaſily induc'd to a perſwaſion,
That if ever Mademoiſelle <hi>de Viger</hi> ſhall
make all the advantages ſhe can of her pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
the number of thoſe whom ſhe ſhall
make ſlaves, will equal that of thoſe whom
<hi>Guyonet</hi> had made unhappy; and ſhe will
be fully reveng'd on the poor unhappy
men, for all the devaſtations which that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60941:18"/>
dangerous <hi>Guyennian</hi> hath committed upon
thoſe of her Sex. But dear Sir, conſult
your own Conſcience, and deal ſincerely,
Is not that ſerenity and indiſturbance of
Mind, which you magnifie above all things,
ſomewhat concern'd in the caſe, when you
make an open profeſſion of having ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Inclinations for her? For my part,
were I ſtill, as you ſay,
<q>
                  <l>Qualis eram bonae</l>
                  <l>Sub regno Cynarae.</l>
               </q>
and were, as I now imagine you to be, on
the Banks of the <hi>Garonne,</hi> where it kindly
contributes to the production of ſo many
Flowers to ſtrew your Walks, it would
coſt me at the leaſt two or three thouſand
diſturbances, ſeven or eight hundred jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies,
ſome handfuls of the hair of my
head, and a quart or two of warm tears;
for I have now lately receiv'd the gift of
tears as well as you, and I dare compare
with you for matter of weeping, though it
be known, you have been as remarkable
for it, as the Prophet <hi>Jeremy.</hi> But to return
to Mademoiſelle <hi>de Viger,</hi> 'tis a misfortune
to be lamented, that ſhe ſhould be wiſer
then <hi>Solomon.</hi> There are indeed ſome men
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60941:18"/>
would be guilty of a great extravagance
for her, as the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> was for him.
For example, I my ſelf, who am not ſo wiſe
as the Son of <hi>Barſabe,</hi> as ſhe told you, and
yet think her a more amiable Perſon than
that Queen of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> would take <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux</hi>
in my way, upon no other deſign,
then that of ſeeing her, if I go next Spring
to <hi>Barages,</hi> as I have ſome intentions to do.
But my Dog of a Deſtiny will hurry me
about a month hence towards the <hi>Weſt-Indies:</hi>
or rather, I am afraid to be ſhov'd
out of <hi>Europe,</hi> into <hi>America,</hi> like a piece
from one end of a Sheffle-Board to the
other, by a ſort of importunate and inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
perſons, a ſort of Excreſcencies of
<hi>Paris,</hi> who call themſelves, the <hi>Leigers of
Wit and Drollery.</hi> The Queſtion among
them, is not, Whether a man be well prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled,
well inclin'd, or of an obliging de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment,
and good carriage; but whether
he be one of the <hi>Leigers of Wit and Drollery.</hi>
There are a certain number of perſons who
would attempt to give them a ſhove; but
they were told, the more ingenious among
them make it their bragg, That they are
approv'd by a great Princeſs, whoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of Mind equal the tranſcendency of
her Quality, and that they are ſo vain, as

            <p>I Am very much oblig'd to a certain thing

ſuggeſting to me that the little

ſomewhat of the ſhorteſt, in reſpect of the
mode now regnant, and who preſently fell a
crying, I know not upon what occaſion, was
no leſs ingenious, than her countenance gave
her out. The Letter you have written to
Mademoiſelle <hi>de Saint Hermant,</hi> is ſo highly
ingenious, that it argues a great decay of
Wit in me, not to have obſerv'd ſoon enough
the accompliſhment of it in you. To be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere

your buſineſs to conceal ingenuity, when
others are ſo over-forward to make all the

that you are known, you ſhould make as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
difficulty of writing to me, as you have
done to Mademoiſelle <hi>de S. Hermant.</hi> I ſhall

            <p>YOur ſatisfaction has coſt me abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of miſery; for what <hi>Recipes,</hi> and
Diet-Drink, and Phyſical Directions have I
been the Butt of, only out of a compliance
with the Command you had laid on me, not
to dye, till you had ſeen me! And yet,
Madame, all this ſtrictneſs, all my patient
obedience to thoſe who exercis'd their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
power of life and death upon my
body, hinders not my being ſtill in a dying
condition, out of an impatience to ſee you.
Had you taken an exact meaſure of your
own forces and mine, this would not have
happen'd. You Ladies of prodigious merit
imagine there is no more to be done, but to
command. We indiſpos'd perſons have
not ſo much the diſpoſal of our Lives. Be
therefore ſatisfy'd to occaſion their death
who ſee you ſooner then they would, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
prolonging their lives, who ſee you not
ſo long as you wiſh they ſhould; and blame
none but your ſelf, if I obey not the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
you ever laid upon me, ſince you have
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60941:21"/>
haſten'd my death, and that there is great
likelihood, that, to pleaſe you, I ſhould have
been as willing to have liv'd a hundred
years, as any other man. But is it not in
your power to change the manner of my
death? I ſhould not be a little oblig'd to
you. All theſe deaths of impatience and
love are not for my turn, much leſs ſuitable
to my humour; and if I have wept a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
times for perſons who have dy'd upon
that account, though I knew them not,
imagine what I ſhall do for my ſelf, who
ever made account to have a little of my
own humour at my death. But it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for a man to elude his deſtiny; and
ſo I am convinc'd, that, whether you be
near me, or at a great diſtance from me,
you are the occaſion of my death. All the
comfort I have, is, that, if I had ſeen you, the
very thought of it would have added to
the torment of my diſſolution. They ſay
you are a dangerous Lady, and that they
who look not on you with a certain cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection,
are preſently taken ſick, and
carry'd away within a ſhort time. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſubmit to the death you have aſſign'd
me, and I heartily forgive you. Farewel
Madam, I die your moſt humble Servant;
and I pray Heaven, the divertiſements you
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60941:21"/>
expect to find in <hi>Britany,</hi> be not diſturbed,
by a remorſe, of having been the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner

you:</p>

            <p>The laſt Verſe ſhould have rim'd to one of
the other two; but at the point of death,
a man's thoughts are more taken up with
dying well, than riming well. And ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>IT was no hard matter for me to find by
your Letter, that I had written a very
impertinent one to you: but it was not the
firſt that ever I writ, when I and my Wits
were at ſome diſtance; and I am not ſo
highly conceited of my own Prudence, as
to preſume it will be the laſt that I ſhall
write while I live. The firſt time I ever
come abroad, I will endeavour to crawl for
your pardon: Mean time, Madam, you may
aſſure Mademoiſelle <hi>Meuſnier,</hi> that though
ſhe hath ſaid of me a hundred falſe things,
which have brought me to the knowledg
of many true ones concerning her, I am
ready to put the Maid-Servant ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
of, into the hands of the Magiſtrate,
and, what you will hardly believe, that this
wicked Maid, whom ſhe charges to have
ſold what ſhe could juſtly call her own, is
more forward to appear before the Judges,
than ſhe her ſelf. But, Madam, I am ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
afraid that I ſhall be taken at my word;

yet ſhall I not retract what I have ſaid. She
may preſent her Petition when ſhe pleaſes;
if the Maid be guilty, I ſhall be the firſt to
ſollicite againſt her. For your ſelf, Madam,
as you are good, and generous, you cannot
forbear pitying a Mother that has loſt her
Daughter, or rather that was deſirous to
have loſt her: And for her, if her Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
ſpeak truth, ſhe could do no leſs then
ſurprize you. And, for my part, Madam,
I ſhall give you no further trouble, but that

            <p>FOr the diſcharge of my own tender
Conſcience, I muſt needs tell you, That
you know not what you do, when you
make me a proffer of your Friendſhip, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60941:23"/>
are ſo deſirous, as you ſeem to be, of mine
Though it be habitual in you to do good
actions, yet that of wiſhing well to a perſon
ſo diſcarded to misfortune, as I am, requires
a generoſity, which you will find more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
in the exerciſe of it, than you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.
I find little for you to hope from it,
and much to fear, and therefore I adviſe you
not to undertake it, how great ſoever my
advantages be thereby. This heretofore coſt
<hi>Armentieres</hi> his life; and not long ſince,
poor <hi>Haucourt</hi> run the ſame fate; not to
mention to you divers others, whom I could
name to you, not of your acquaintance, and
whom Death would not haply have ſnatcht
away ſo ſoon hence, had they not been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward
to expreſs their love to me. Muſt
I yet give you more examples, to aſſure you
that my misfortune is contagious? Let
theſe few ſuffice. Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> dy'd
within a month after my being known to
him, and that I was thought ſo happy as
to pleaſe him. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had
no ſooner diſcover'd his deſires of making
me ſome Preſent, but he fell ſick of the Small
Pox, and dy'd. The Preſident <hi>de Meſme</hi>
did not long out-live the Viſit he made me,
in a Chamber three Stories high. In fine,
my acquaintance, if it come to any degree
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60941:23"/>
of Friendſhip, is ſo ſure a loſing caſt to thoſe
who have it, and of ſo ſudden a Diſaſtre,
that it is beyond my apprehenſion, how the
Cardinal <hi>de Retz</hi> hath got into that Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency,
againſt Wind, Water, and Weather,
at a time when it was the general perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
that he had a certain eſteem for me.
After all theſe deterring examples, if your
heart couragiouſly perſiſt in its reſolution,
I am, Body and Soul, yours. I am not ſo
deeply beſotted as to refuſe my good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
and the Friendſhip of a Perſon, whom
I paſſionately love, as well upon the account
of his merit, as my own natural inclination.
Yet can I not disburthen my ſelf of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
for the hazard you run into; for I
once more tell you, That I am a Mail, which
open'd, you will find ſtuff'd only with miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune;

            <p>TO offer your Majeſty a Comedy, and
that of my Compoſure, is to make you
a Preſent infinitely below your Worth and
Quality: Only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have this plea, That every
one ought to be tax'd according to his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
for the payment of the Tribute due to
you, from all thoſe who make it their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
to write in the preſent age. In that
of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> men paid in Verſe and Proſe the
ſame Tribute to the Patron of the <hi>Virtuoſi,</hi>
the deceas'd <hi>Mecenas,</hi> whom your Majeſty
knows, better than I, by the general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of all the Poets, to have been a very
gallant Perſon. But how highly ſoever his
Name may have been celebrated in the
World, all the advantage he now hath of
your Majeſty, is only that of Precedence;
and I would confidently venture all the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
eſtate I have in the Kingdom of <hi>Parnaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi>
that your Majeſty would have defeated
all his Deſigns, and forc'd him to exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as your Father the Great <hi>Guſtavus</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:60941:24"/>
would have done his Maſter <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> had
they been to diſpute the Empire of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.
But, <hi>Madam,</hi> if it be pardonable in
a Perſon ſo much the object of pity, upon
the account of Miſery, as I am, to put queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to a great Queen, as you are, I would
know, whether it be not ſometimes incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious
to your Majeſty to be ſo highly
a Heroine as you are? Extraordinary Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
hath alſo its inconveniences, and all
theſe Dedicatories of Books, which we
Poets would have to paſs for Incenſe, with
thoſe whom we pretend to Heroify, are not
always of the ſame value, nor have the

made uſe of them heretofore, and was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

them worth your approval in any degree,
be not ſparing of them; ſince all I have

you have endeavour'd to do me at Court,
where your influence being ſo great, no
doubt what you attempt will prove accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
ſucceſsful. All I have to offer to
your conſideration in this particular, is that
you may find the oppoſing of my croſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
a harder task than at firſt ſight you
imagine; ſince I cannot but fear it will give
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60941:29"/>
you the diſſatisfaction of not compaſſing,
once in your life, what your generoſity had
engag'd you to undertake. Yet, howe're
you come off, my obligations to you will
be as tranſcendent, as they can poſſibly be
in a Perſon who has hardly the honour of
being known to you, who never did you
any ſervice, who is incapable of doing any,
and whom nevertheleſs you will needs take
into your protection. Should I not be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſenſible of theſe ſurprizing kindneſſes,
there were no colourable excuſe to be made
for me, but that the wretchedneſs of my
condition had reduc'd me to a more than
ordinary ſtupidity. On the contrary, I am
a great admirer of ſuch perſons as you are,
and I begin to be troubled, that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
period of my life, will prevent
my full knowledg of yours, which I ſhould
ſtudy with as much ſatisfaction, as I have
done all thoſe of the moſt Illuſtrious Men.
Though I was never guilty of any natural
inclination to be a great Courtier, yet am
I one of thoſe perſons in the World, to
whom ſome of the greateſt in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
have many times made promiſes, and
for the moſt part broken them. But that
misfortune, attended by many others, ſhall

dead, Monſieur <hi>Coſtard,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>de

not have been Arch-Deacons and Canons.
I know not how I came to put in that word
<hi>haply;</hi> haply I had not us'd it, if I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd
what I was doing. If ever I have
the honour to write to you again, I will

But to return to my Prebendary,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60941:30"/>
ſince you have diſpos'd of it, you ought to
give me another for it, though it were only
to make me ſome requital, for the time I
have loſt, in relying on the promiſes of
your deceas'd Uncle, of happy Memory, and
little mindfulneſs of his word. You know
well enough what you have to do; but if I
were in your condition, I ſhould beſtow a
Benefice on a Perſon that were in mine.
And indeed you have a ſure Expedient to
procure a vacancy, without burthen to your
Conſcience, or injury to good Manners, as
was done by a Regular Eunuch named <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier,</hi>
Abbot of <hi>Marmouſtier,</hi> and Uncle to the
Abbot of <hi>Euron.</hi> This Maſter-Monk took

one thing <hi>I</hi> muſt not at this time forbear
minding you of, now that you are in the

            <p>IT may be you conceive a great ſelf-ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
when you reflect on your gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity.
Diſlodge that fond imagination;
it is the moſt incommodious quality an
Eminent Perſon can be guilty of, when he is
ſo imprudent as to ſpin out his divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in the company of ſuch a Wretch as
I am. We Writers are a ſtrange ſort of
people; for where we are once oblig'd, we
are importunate all the daies of our lives
after. You beſtow'd on me ſome days ſince
the Works of Monſieur <hi>de Voiture;</hi> I am
now to begg of you a thing of greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.
I am acquainted with ſome
Lords, whoſe countenances would change
at theſe laſt words of my Letter; but they
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60941:32"/>
are not ſo terrible, as to frighten or ſtartle
a Duke <hi>de Retz;</hi> and I durſt be ſworn, he is
as impatient to know what I deſire of him,
as I am aſſur'd of obtaining it. 'Tis this:
A young Gentleman, whoſe name I find in
the Catalogue of my choiceſt Friends, and
one who at the age of twenty years hath
been concern'd in twenty engagements, as
noble as that of the <hi>Horatij</hi> and <hi>Curiatij,</hi> and
hath as great a reputation of Prudence as
Gallantry, hath kill'd a vapouring Bragga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochio,
by whom he was forc'd to a Duel.
He cannot procure his Pardon any where
but in <hi>Paris,</hi> and he would fain be in ſafety
there, meerly out of a repugnance he hath,
to the ſevering of his head from the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
I could prevail for his reception into
the Palace of a great Prince; but for his
entertainment there, as to proviſion, I can
promiſe nothing; and I think ſtarving a
greater misfortune, than to be in fear of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ones Throat cut by an Officer appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for that purpoſe. But if you afford him
the Sanctuary of your Roof, he will be in a
condition to defie both; and you will have
no ſmall ſatisfaction, in taking into your
protection a young Gentleman ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
it. Beſides, you will have the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
pleaſure in the World, in ſeeing Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60941:32"/>
ſnuff'd with Piſtol-bullets, as often as
you ſhall think fit to be a ſpectator of that
Divertiſement: And I queſtion not, but you
will give me thanks, being as you are, the
moſt generous of all Dukes, for finding you
out ſo noble an occaſion to exerciſe your
Generoſity; and I for my part, promiſe to
ſupply you with the like as often as I can,
and that, as ſoon as you have granted me
what I now deſire, I ſhall importune you
daily, to imploy your intereſt and that of
your Friends, to procure the pardon of mine.
The <hi>Burleſque</hi> Muſe will not be ſilent upon
the obtaining of this favour, but will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
her ſelf well enough of an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

            <p>WHile you are taking your diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
in the Country, and haply
killing Horſes, in the purſuit of
Hares, we have wanted your good wiſhes
at a Wedding; which hath united two
Warlike Nations, between whom the height
of the <hi>Apennines</hi> made not ſo great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
as the difference of their Humours.
I needed not to have ſent you this Newes,
ſince it is not to be imagin'd, but you know
it already; yet ſince there is a neceſſity of
my writing to you, I thought it not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to begin with that great piece of Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
meerly out of this reflection, that,
if all other Records fail, Poſterity may find
the time of ſo remarkable an occurrence by
the date of my Letter to you. Your next
obſervation will be, that, notwithſtanding
this ſtrange revolution, the City of <hi>Paris</hi>
is much at the ſame rate as when you left
it; that, for one rational perſon, there are
a hundred thouſand that are not ſuch, nor
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60941:33"/>
ever will be; and that this is as true of the
Women, as the Men. There is another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
conſequent to the removal of
the Court; which is, That they who ſmell
of their dirty Shops where ere they go, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
to take the Wall of all they meet, and
plead the prerogative of Birth and Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the greateſt City in the World. No
Quarter of it, but has a Poet, good or bad;
nor Houſe, where Company hath acceſs, but
is peſter'd with vain and ſuperfluous Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.
Of theſe, mine hath the precedence,
and I muſt bear all, without any other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
than that of bemoaning my ſelf, to
ſee the afflictions of my Mind bear ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to the infirmities of my Body. For
my part, the decaies of my condition are
daily more and more obſervable, and I feel
my ſelf tow'd to my end faſter than I could
wiſh. I have a thouſand pricking pains, or
rather a thouſand Legions of Devils in my
Arms and Legs, and yet in that condition, I
cannot reproach my ſelf with any remiſſion
in the love I bear you. I know not how
far it may contribute to that of my pain;
but this I am certain of, that you owe me
a great meaſure of Eſteem and Friendſhip,
and that, if you do me Juſtice, I ſhall have
this to bragg of, that, towards the period of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60941:34"/>
my days, I have made ſo advantageous an
acquaintance as yours. I might very well
think this a fair acqueſt, for a Perſon who
cannot ſtirr from the place where he is ſet,
and give a check to all further ambition;
but you have given me ſo excellent a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of Monſieur <hi>Manchini,</hi> that I ſhall
never acquit you of the promiſe you have
made me of the honour to be known to
him. Yet muſt it be with this precaution,
That he be not a man of many comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
for when I am forc'd to make any
my ſelf, or to receive them from others, I
cannot forbear weeping, and am put out of
countenance, to think what a loſs they alſo
are at, who will needs diſplay their Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
when they have to do with the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of univerſal compaſſion. In a word, I
have as great an averſion for Complements,
as moſt people have for Serpents, and Toads;
and to aſſure you it is ſo, I ſhall conclude my

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOur writing to me has given me the
greateſt ſatisfaction I could have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.
My generous Friends are all the
Eſtate I have in this World; and when
you aſſure me that you are of that number,
I cannot forbear aſſuring you again, That
you give me a greater occaſion of rejoycing,
than I ſhall derive from the <hi>General Peace,</hi>
which is now ſo near its concluſion. The
compariſon will poſſibly, at firſt ſight, ſeem
weak to you, and I muſt acknowledg, that
the Affairs of <hi>Europe</hi> might change face a
hundred times, ere ever mine look any
better. But I am over head and ears in
deſires, to ſee your Prince once more in
<hi>France,</hi> though it were only for this reaſon,
That <hi>France</hi> is this Year but poorly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
with Princes, and yet there are as
many as ever there were, and the ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
years will haply prove no better than
this: and if I have my ſatisfaction in that,
I ſhall have it alſo, in embracing my tall, my
corpulent, and my fat Monſieur <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

               </gap>. For
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60941:37"/>
I queſtion not, but ſtrong Beer has made
ſome additionals to his former bulk. But
is it poſſible, the great and Heroick <hi>Condé</hi>
ſhould know, that I am yet among the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving?
My Friend <hi>Guenault</hi> told me ſo, and
that he had ſeen lying upon his Table the
Second Part of my <hi>Comical Romance.</hi> It put
me into ſuch an humour, as I never was in
twice before; I was ſo tranſported with
Heroick thoughts of my ſelf, and if my
Diſeaſes had not faſten'd me to my Chair,
I would have ſtollen upon him to ſee how
he would have been frighted at the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous
appearance of the Author. Theſe
Heroes are an odd ſort of people, and would
be worth the whiſtling after, if they could
but be brought to love the indigent part of
Mankind, as well as the others love them.
As for yours, he ſeems to have heroify'd
himſelf a hundred times over, ſince he has
taken upon him the Conduct of our Invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
Troops; and it may be ſaid of him,
That if he were a great Prophet in his
Country, where the Scripture ſayes that
no man is, he prov'd much more ſuch a one
in a ſtrange Country. If he take the pains
to read any thing of the five Epiſtles, in
Verſe, which you receive herewith, be
pleas'd to let me know what he ſayes of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60941:38"/>
them. The <hi>Melancholy Invective</hi> comes
piping hot out of my Study, the others
were the laſt Years productions. 'Tis pity
the Perſon who is the ſubject of it had not
been ſome more notorious Raſcal. But
this is only a damn'd Tax-gatherer, who
owes me ſix hundred Piſtols, and would
conſcientiouſly chowſe me of that ſmall
Summe. You tell me of a Lady that's fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
in love with me, I intreat you to give
her timely notice, that my Diſeaſes have
rendred me of ſo irregular a Figure, that
Women with Child are forbidden acceſs
to me, for fear of Monſtrous Births, and
Miſcarriages. But for your part, I adjure
you to be kind to</p>

            <p>YOu are not to be ſo much bemoan'd
by others, as you imagine to your ſelf,
ſince that if your abſence, or exile, or what
elſe you pleas'd to call it, were not volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
you might eaſily find an occaſion to
quit the Campagne: But it is to be fear'd,
that ſome beautiful Eyes at <hi>Xaintonge</hi> have
made a conqueſt over yours, and you have
the ambition to have your Military <hi>Trophies</hi>
interwoven with <hi>Points de Venize.</hi> Your
Friends therefore here are much more to be
bemoan'd than you are, and their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
are more preſſing. For my part, I
am clearly daſh'd out of all countenance.
When you were pleas'd to honour me with
your Viſits, I thought it the greateſt happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
I could make by braggs of. The appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of your Coach at my little door ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
it venerable to all the Inhabitants of
the Street I live in; and I am told, that it
procur'd me the envy of ſeveral great Gates,
whoſe Owners think themſelves better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated
to entertain Perſons of your
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60941:39"/>
Quality. Nay, the ſtanding of <hi>Rincy</hi>'s
Coach at the ſame place ſome time ſince,
does ſtill keep my Neighbours in awe: but
it is to be fear'd, that they will forget them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
again, if ſome Courtiers make not a
ſpeedy return to <hi>Paris,</hi> and, till yours hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
keep up our glory and repute, which,
for want of ſuch Viſitants, is much eclips'd.
But though it ſhould be ſo darkned, as that
I might never recover ought of my former
luſtre, yet is it poſſible, that a man may be
comforted with a little Philoſophy. But
the caſe is quite otherwiſe, when a man is
forc'd to be Six months together without
ſeeing the perſons he loves. Were it not
for the kindneſs of your writing to me
ſometimes, I ſhould ſoon make it known to
all the World, by a generous act of deſpair,
that my Heroes are not ſuch Idols, as a fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical
humour, or Time can deſtroy; that
Madam <hi>Scarron</hi> ſpeaks againſt her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
or knowes not well the internal
concerns of a man, with whom ſhe ſpends
the beſt part of her life, when ſhe tells you,
that my affection to you will not laſt above
Six Months. That will be try'd by the effect.
But now I ſpeak of Heroes, you tell me, that
Monſieur the <hi>Surintendant,</hi> who is alſo one
of my Heroes, and which is more, my only
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60941:39"/>
Benefactor, will take his way through <hi>Pons.</hi>
I queſtion not but you will recommend to
him the concerns of your humble Servant,
and the concluſion of his fatal Affair. There
never was a more favourable opportunity
for the ſettlement of it; <hi>Julian Colas</hi> the
moſt inſolent perſon that ever got his live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood
by the retayling of Bread and Wine,
and one that would prefer the moſt deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
Carman, or Porter, before the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
<hi>Virtuoſo</hi> in the Kingdom, and the only
perſon who obſtructed the eſtabliſhment of
my affair, has taken his laſt draught in this
mortal life. The Unloaders are as deſirous
to ſee it eſtabliſh'd, as I am my ſelf. But
Monſieur the <hi>Surintendant</hi> has told our
Friend <hi>Peliſson,</hi> that it could not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated
till after the return of the Court.
'Tis poſſible, his late being there may have
ſomewhat advanc'd it, and that the moſt
wretched perſon, of all thoſe to whom he
has ſhewn any kindneſs, will ſoon be at ſome
eaſe in his Mind, and will find himſelf out
of danger of dying, for want of employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for his Jaws. Madam <hi>Scarron</hi> has
been at St. <hi>Mandé</hi>'s. She is extreamly pleas'd
with the Civil Entertainment ſhe receiv'd
from Madam the <hi>Surintendant</hi>'s Lady; and
I find her ſo ſmitten with her attractions,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60941:40"/>
that there is ſome ſuſpition there might be
a little touch of impurity in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view.
But that danger muſt be the leſs,
ſince ſhe cannot wait upon her as often as
ſhe wiſhes, becauſe, for want of a Coach,
ſhe cannot go abroad, but when her Friends
are pleas'd to take her along with them. I
am forc'd to write things to you that have
no relation to your Concerns, for want of
ſomething that has. When I meet with
any more worthy your knowledg, you will

            <p>WE muſt needs be extreamly exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

are ſtill in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and that Madam <hi>de
Martel,</hi> and her Daughter, return'd hither
but yeſterday. Yet is there a neceſſity, that
I ſhould ſend you a large Letter, and that I
ſhould give ſome aſſurance, at leaſt by the
endeavours I ſhall uſe to divert you, as far
as one of my Letters can do it, that it is
not altogether my fault, if I do not ſtand
you in ſome ſtead. You muſt therefore
give me leave to catch at any thing that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers

violent diſſolutions which are ſeen at the
<hi>Greve,</hi> are not things that can be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendably
communicated to the knowledg
of a Perſon of your Quality, yet ſhall I not
ſtick, out of pure ſterility of matter, to give
you an account of what has happen'd there.
There has been lately, for ſeveral dayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
ſo much hanging, and breaking of
perſons on the Wheel, that the common
Executioner himſelf is weary of his Office,
Madam <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                  <desc> _____ </desc>
               </gap> who, next to Monſieur <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                  <desc> _____ </desc>
               </gap>
is not ſo much pleas'd at any ſight, as that
of publick Executions, begins to be cloy'd
with the divertiſement, and will hardly be
ſeen this good while in the <hi>Greve</hi> again.
The Martyrs are all of the true <hi>Pariſian</hi>
breed, moſt of them the Sons of that kind
of Cooks, who ſell only Roaſt-meat, becauſe
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60941:41"/>
they have no convenience for any other
way of Cookery. They were convicted of
the robbing of Coaches and Sedans, and
other Crimes ordinarily committed in the
Night-time, and many of other denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the faculty of Stealing, are in great
danger of dying in the Air. I am to tell
you, by way of Digreſſion, That the Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys
of <hi>Paris,</hi> my Countrymen, are valiaut
enough, more apt to ſteal, then beg, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a very patibulary inclination. But
now I am fallen upon the ſubject of violent
Deaths, I cannot forbear giving you the
relation of one, which was not ſo ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious,
as that of the foreſaid Criminals, yet
was not leſs cruel. Before I come into the
Story, you are to underſtand, by way of
preadvertiſement, that the next ſubſequent
days after Sundays, and Feſtival days, there
is a great ſcarcity of all Proviſions at <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renton,</hi>
and particularly of new bread above
all things. 'Twas upon a Munday, not long
ſince, that the Impetuous <hi>Du Rincy,</hi> the
Eloquent <hi>Peliſson,</hi> the Incomparable <hi>Scu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dery,</hi>
and the Diſcreet Madam <hi>Bocquet,</hi> about
half an hour paſt Ten in the Morning, ſent a
Meſſenger expreſs to the beautiful <hi>Izar,</hi>
who ſome days before had retir'd to <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renton,</hi>
for the Air's ſake, to tell him, that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60941:41"/>
they would dine with him that day, and
that he ſhould not give himſelf the trouble
of getting any thing but a good <hi>Potage</hi> and
a <hi>Deſsert,</hi> for as to Meat they would bring it
along with them from the Cooks. <hi>Izar,</hi>
and a certain Advocate of the Counſel, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Du Mas,</hi> whom he had taken for his
Country-Companion, during that retreat,
beſet and beſtir themſelves for the more
ſplendid Reception of ſo great a Party of Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious
Perſons, for we do not every day
ſee four ſuch together. To give a greater
fortification to the Potage, they put in three
Pullets, and a conſiderable quantity of green
Peaſe; and while a certain perſon is ſent
away Poſt to <hi>Bagnolet,</hi> for Raſpices, they
employ the moſt experienc'd Paſtry-Cooks
of <hi>Charenton,</hi> in the making of Tarts and
Cakes. The Cloath is laid in the Garden,
and to take away the ſcent of the Lavender,
wherein the Linnen had long lain, the Table,
Cloth, and Napkins, are all beſtrew'd with
ſuch Flowers newly gather'd as the Garden
afforded. About Noon the Quinteſcence
of all that dare aſſume to themſelves the
title <hi>Ingenious,</hi> or <hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> arrive at <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renton.
Du Rincy,</hi> as ſoon as he was got
out of the Coach, went directly into the
Kitchin, where he is little ſatisfy'd with the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60941:42"/>
Potage, much leſs with the diligences and
ſollicitude of <hi>Izar</hi> and <hi>Du Mas,</hi> in all the
preparations they had made, and ſpeaks
thereof with ſo great indignation, ſuperci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liouſneſs,
and authority, that <hi>Du Mas</hi> began
thereupon to reſpect and to fear him. They
who had a mind to waſh their hands, did ſo;
and all ſate down. <hi>Du Rincy</hi> ſlighting the
Country-Soupe, would have broke one of
the Loaves; but finding it hard and ſtale,
he flings it at an Apricock Tree that ſtood
near him, and renders it uncapable of bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fruit any more, having bruis'd the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
branches of it. He goes to break a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
loaf, which he finds of the ſame date
of baking, and conſequently as far from
being new as the other, and with the ſame
vigour and promptitude he flings it at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Tree. In ſhort, with ſix or ſeven
loaves, which he found equally hard and
ſtale, he lames ſo many Fruit-Trees, to the
great diſcontent of the Miſtreſs of the houſe,
who made extraordinary clamours at the
deſolation of her Garden. <hi>Du Rincy,</hi> in the
mean time, was not in the leaſt concern'd
at it, ſave only that he proteſted, no body
ſhould eat, till he had new bread brought
him. They ſent to all the Bake-houſes about
the Town, till at laſt they came to one,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60941:42"/>
where they were taking the bread out of
the Oven, which was brought to <hi>du Rincy,</hi>
piping hot, and ſmoaking, ſo that the reſt
of the Company went and gather'd up the
loaves amongſt the bruis'd branches, which
were more eatable than the new bread,
which burnt their Lips. The brisk deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Du Rincy,</hi> both as to action and
diſcourſe, extreamly ſurpriz'd the Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<hi>Du Mas,</hi> and the imperious Aire of his
Countenance was no leſs dreadful to him.
From that very time, he always had <hi>Du Rin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
in his imagination. He never ſlept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
turbulent Dreams, and thoſe Dreams
were never without <hi>Du Rincy.</hi> In fine, the
very fright he took at the demeanour of <hi>du
Rincy</hi> put him into a Feaver, and that Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
prov'd ſo violent, that it carry'd him off
in leſs than fifteen days, and he dy'd in a
raving and diſtracted condition, talking per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
of <hi>Du Rincy.</hi> And this, my Lord,
is all the account of our Concerns, that I
can ſend you at the preſent. Madam <hi>Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
ſayes, that ſhe cannot find any inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in her ſelf to write to you, till ſhe meets
with ſomething that is divertive in your
Letters. That reflection makes me think,
that if you are as much afflicted at <hi>Pons,</hi> as
you were at <hi>Paris,</hi> my Letter will be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60941:43"/>
and moſt unſeaſonable. But Time,
yet much more your own Reaſon, will ere
this have wrought their ordinary effect,
upon an affliction that admits of no remedy.
I ſend you my ſecond Epiſtle. The <hi>Areo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagus</hi>
of good Judges in this Profeſſion, will
have it to be better than the former: but I
am not of their opinion. I am ſtill in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation

'Tis to be lamented that ſhe is not as pretty,

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60941:45"/>
fortune to obtain any thing of happineſs,
without the conqueſt of incredible obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
Be pleas'd to pardon this melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
reflection, in a wretched perſon who
is ready to ſtarve. Threeſcore and ſixteen
days have I been in continual hoſtility with
a hard Froſt. The Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> is out of

            <p>I Was but too true a Prophet, to my ſorrow,
when I heretofore writ to you, that my
misfortune could not be overcome by
any perſon of generoſity and prevalence
not equivalent to yours. It ſtill ſtands out
againſt you, though it be a conſiderable
time ſince you firſt took it into task. Some
eight dayes ſince my Lord Chancellour
was pleas'd to ſtrike out my Fatal Affair,
the Propoſals made by Monſ. <hi>Doublet,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60941:48"/>
haply, that it would be a new grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
upon the People. It was concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoſe Perſons that ſhould be impowr'd
to overſee the unloading of Carts; and it
would have been an eaſie matter, if ſome
would have taken the pains to do it, to
make it appear to him, that the function of
Unloaders or Diſchargers is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a charge or grievance, that it is a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
convenience, and has eſtabliſh'd it ſelf,
time out of mind; that without it, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Carts and Waggons would remain at
the Gates of the City without getting in,
becauſe it is not thought fit that the Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goners
ſhould be truſted with the Money
due for their entrance, and that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargers
ſhould pay, and be anſwerable for
them, and conduct them to the Houſes of
Merchants and Citizens, whoſe habitations
the others are ignorant of, and diſcharge
the Commodities at their own perils; That
the mony which is given them, is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted,
but voluntarily given, as a kind of
Largeſs, beſtow'd only by thoſe that are
willing, without any obligation forcing
them thereto; And, in ſhort, that it paſs'd
at the <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> of the City, aſſoon as the
Provoſt of Merchants, who, before had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
it, for want of throughly examining
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60941:48"/>
the affair, was fully ſatisfy'd, that there
was a neceſſity of creating thoſe functions
into Offices, and that they ought to be
exercis'd, by Perſons who had ſettled habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
and took their Oaths before him,
for the due execution of their Charges,
becauſe people of all conditions employ'd
themſelves therein, even to Souldiers of
the Foot-Guards; and that while thoſe
Raſcals were quarrelling at the Gates, to
get the cuſtome one from the other, and
went a League out of <hi>Paris,</hi> to prevent one
the other's getting of it, the Waggons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
at the Gates, without either being
diſcharg'd, or getting into the City, to the
prejudice of Waggoners, and the Merchants.
And now, my Lord, I think you are as well
inſtructed in the Affair of the Unloaders, as
I am my ſelf; and I would to God, my
Lord Chancellor had had the ſame account
of it. I ſhould have ſufficiently ſatisfy'd
him therein, if I had had but notice of what
has happen'd, or rather, if I had not been
afraid to have my name mention'd in that
affair, contrary to my intention. My Lord,
I beg your pardon for the tediouſneſs of the
relatiion I am forc'd to make you, ſince you
might have done well enough without it:
but it is always obſervable, that when a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60941:49"/>
miſerable perſon has ſome affair wherein
he is deeply concern'd, he derives a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
from that miſery, to be talking of it.
This is the laſt hope of my Wife and my
ſelf; and I muſt needs tell you, that I ſhould
hardly admit of any conſolation, if I did
not repreſent to my ſelf, that I ſerve a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
whoſe promiſes are inviolable, and
one who is able to do me right. Yet can
I not ſtave off the diſcontent, occaſion'd
by ſo ſenſible a diſappointment. For, my
Lord, if you but imagine what will become
of us, if this Affair miſcarries, you would
not be much aſtoniſh'd at the deſpair of
Monſ. <hi>Viſsins</hi> and my ſelf, ſince there will
be a great probability that our mouths may
be ſow'd up. By this, you may meaſure

to requite Monſieur <hi>Peliſson</hi> for his
kindneſs in ſpeaking to you concerning my
Affair, and in giving me an account of the
obliging anſwer you were pleas'd to make
him, then in communicating to you the
ſhort Complement he has written to me

the true ſentiments he has for you, that
I think, I do him a very kind office, by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
you ſo, without his knowing any

glad that you knew it, provided it were
done without his hazarding himſelf to tell
you ſo. It is a difficult matter to ſpeak of
you, even though it were done to your ſelf,
without falling into your praiſes; and it is
as difficult to give you any without diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
you, and yet much more difficult to
forbear giving them. I ſhould therefore
wiſh, as to my own particular, that ſome
body would do ſo much for me, as to tell
you, that you are the moſt generous Perſon

ſome concern to my ſelf? And will you not

the account I receiv'd was, That you were
no fully recover'd of an indiſpoſition which
had, for ſome time, confin'd you to your

and who, without you, would be more
wretched than he is, though his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
be in a manner beyond all example:
Thoſe who have honour'd me with their
love, as you have done, may have been
themſelves fully ſatisfy'd, that my affection
for them has been very great, and it is not
to be thought, that I ſhould now begin to
be ungrateful, towards the moſt generous
Perſon of all thoſe who ever had pity on
me. I think every hour a thouſand, till I
get to <hi>Paris,</hi> to take my Oath of fidelity to

ſits. They who are proſecuted are fully

my Concerns in the Affair of the <hi>Debets.</hi>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:60941:54"/>
Your Lorſhip may be pleas'd to remember,
that it was upon my entreaty you granted
the confirmation of it. The perſons, for
whom I ſollicited your furtherance of it,
proffer'd me a ſmall part in the Affair; but,
when I conſider that I am but ſlowly happy
in all my undertakings, and that I could not
imagine it ſhould come to what it now is, I
choſe rather to content my ſelf with the
payment of ſix hundred Piſtols, which they
have promis'd, by a writing to that purpoſe,
out of the firſt mony that ſhall be receiv'd.
I have now neither any concern in the affair,
nor the mony, which had been promis'd me
for the facilitation of it. If your Lordſhip
will but vouchſafe to ſpeak one word to
the Projector who is to have the benefit of
it, I ſhall have either the one, or the other,
or both. I queſtion not but you will grant
me that favour, ſince I am, more than any
other,</p>

            <p>I Take the liberty to make a requeſt to
you with as much confidence, as if, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the courtſhip of many years ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I had done you ſome ſervice of great
importance. But perſons of your quality,
that is, ſuch, whoſe generoſity is ſo tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
as yours, are not only forward to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
their Servants, and their Friends, but
their favours are extended alſo to all thoſe
that ſtand in need thereof. They are the
perpetual Sanctuaries and Protectors of the
Unfortunate, and the conſtant Repairers of
their Breaches; and for your own part, my
Lord, I think there paſſes not a day, but
ſome diſtreſſed Knight or Lady comes to
beg a Boon of you. I intreat you therefore,
as an unfortunate perſon, and one, who, of
all the World has the greateſt honour for
you, to grant me one. 'Tis only, this, my
Lord, that you would uſe your perſwaſions
to the Provoſt of the Merchants, to forbear
oppoſing the eſtabliſhment of certain Offices
relating to good Government, of which
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60941:55"/>
Offices I have acquir'd the propriety. 'Tis
an Affair which would contribute highly
to the eſtabliſhment of my Concerns, and
ſupply me with four or five thouſand Livers
of annual Rent. But my unhappy Deſtiny,
which does not let ſlip the leaſt occaſion of
doing me an ill turn, has rais'd up a Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pragmatical
fellow, who without any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
in the Affair himſelf, has prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd
the Provoſt, and made him averſe to
the deſign. I have employ'd, to ſollicite
him, Monſieur the Preſident <hi>de Guenegaut,</hi>
who had been ſo kind as to take along with
him Monſieur <hi>de Franquetot,</hi> and my Wife;
but his recommendation of the buſineſs has
prov'd leſs prevalent then a bare <hi>Factum.</hi>
I expect a quite different effect from the
Letter, which I intreat you to write to him,
and to ſend by ſome one of your own Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
Servants. It will be ſufficient, if he
does but know, that I have the honour of
being known to you, to raiſe in him a
thought of my being a perſon worth obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging.
But if you will be farther pleas'd to
tell him, That you look not on me with an
indifferent eye, he will make my affair his
own, ſince he will conceive it in ſome ſort
to be yours, and you will have this ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
thereby, that the moſt zealous of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60941:55"/>

number, and conſequently, that it may

Letter in the world, that I had ſome place

I know there is a vaſt diſtance between a

make an ingenuous acknowledgment of my
natural infirmity, I can as well forbear

have a great affection, or continuing in a
ſerious humour to the end of a Letter,
which I may have begun with MY LORD,
or, MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60941:57"/>
in Capitals. I would not therefore have
you imagine, from what I have ſaid, that
I am thrifty or forgetful of the reſpect I

when occaſion ſhall require it. But
the very ſame man, who ſhall ſometimes

he is writing to you; who ſhall drain the
<hi>Academy of Complements</hi> to fill it with <hi>Rodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montades</hi>

the leaſt of your Qualities, leaſt the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription

will, after all that ceremony, fly
out, and entertain you with trifles, and a

which methinks you ought to have,
when you give a concluſion to ſome great
Affair. In a word, he will endeavour to
<hi>uncatonize</hi> you, if I may preſume to uſe that

important Concerns of State are under de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation;
that is, when you are Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator-General,
Surintendant of the Finan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and Miniſter of State, ſuch a Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virate

a fitter opportunity, and will not ſuffer
me to appear before you, till you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted
your ſelf of thoſe Titles, and aſſume
the place of Monſieur <hi>Fouquet,</hi> I mean the
moſt excellent Perſon in the World; when
you ſhine in your own proper luſtre, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
borrowing that of your Charges and

and ſomewhat in the ſame equipage

I ſhould make no difficulty to entertain
you with any thing that came firſt into my
head, and be the frolickeſt perſon alive,
as long as Heaven were pleas'd to continue
me in the humour. Yet ſhould not that
be, till I had firſt begg'd your permiſſion
to be ſo, ſuch as was given me by the late
Cardinal of <hi>Lyons,</hi> and ſuch as I took my
ſelf, without asking, with the Cardinal <hi>de
Retz,</hi> when he lay by me upon my little
yellow Couch, and talk'd of things no way
relating to the Cabals of <hi>Paris.</hi> I dare
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60941:58"/>
boldly own it, that, in thoſe two Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences,
I triumph'd over the Stoiciſme, and
ſerious temperament, which attends the
red Cap. Time was, when they would
have it to be an Article of my Faith, that
they had a love for me; you may follow
their example, and afford me a little of
your affection, without either bluſhing or
diſparagement, and by the extraordinary
care I took to deſerve their careſſes, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
with what zeal I ſhall be inclin'd to
love you. You have a kindneſs for me,
upon this particular ſcore, that I am a
wretched perſon, and you have done me
more in the ſpace of fifteen dayes, than
the greateſt part of the Peerage of <hi>France</hi>
promis'd me, ever ſince the time I was
condemn'd to the poſture of perpetual ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
Of the laſt Twenty years which I
ſhuffled away of my weary life, there has
not paſt one, but ſome great Lord among
thoſe that come to ſee me at my Chamber,
as people went heretofore to ſee Elephants,
and Eſtriches, or popp'd in thither to paſs
away the afternoon, when they had made
bilk Visits, or have nothing elſe to do; there
has not. I ſay, one year paſs'd, but ſome one
of thoſe titulary Grandees, and mountai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
promiſers of Friendſhip and all the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60941:58"/>
conveniences conſequent thereto, hath
ſhamefully broke his word with me, and
has as often proffer'd either for my Friends
or my ſelf, what I deſir'd not of them. And
yet Monſieur the <hi>Firſt Preſident,</hi> whom I
never had the honour to ſee in my life, ſent
me this laſt Year a conſiderable Preſent by
the Abbot of <hi>Menagius,</hi> and that within a
very ſhort time after I had dedicated a Book
to him; whereas you your ſelf, who were
ignorant of my being in the world, have
honour'd me with your kindneſſes, and that
after a manner yet more obliging, than
thoſe very kindneſſes. I think, my Lord,
that I am not engag'd to make a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
diſcovery of what <hi>I</hi> deſire of you,
whatever Command you have laid on me
to do it: <hi>I</hi> ought to receive the favours
you ſhall do me with all the reſentment of
gratitude that <hi>I</hi> am capable of; but <hi>I</hi> have
not any right to preſcribe them to you, nor
yet to demand any of you. Your own
Generoſity knowes well enough what it
has to do. It is ſufficient, for the quiet
remainder of my life, that, from the place
where you are, you have caſt an eye upon
me in that where <hi>I</hi> am; and <hi>I</hi> queſtion
not, after the obliging Note you were
pleas'd to write to me, and which <hi>I</hi> ſhall

            <p>IT was my fortune this day to be quite
out of mony, a thing not extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to me. I thereupon ſent my Servant
to Monſieur <hi>de Richemont,</hi> to entreat him
to advance one Quarters Rent of my Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
eleven dayes before it became due.
Monſieur <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

               </gap> happen'd to be there, a
Perſon I have not the honour to be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
withal, and I think it is not my fault.
However, he took occaſion to reproach me
with it, as a great miſdemeanour, and moſt
unmercifully ſent me word, that he knew
me not; That I was acquainted only with
Monſieur <hi>de Lorme,</hi> and that I had never
dedicated a Book to him. What ſay you
to the brutality of this gallant Perſon? But
this is not the firſt affront I have receiv'd
from him. I would gladly have a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Character of this unpoliſh'd Lord, and
know, how he ſtands in point of reſpect
with a Maſter ſo eminent for civility, as
Monſieur the Surintendant. I am reſolv'd
to make my complaints to him againſt a
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60941:63"/>

it was my chance to meet with pure
Blanks, and the two ſilver bowls, which
Madam <hi>Scarron</hi> has got, and which muſt not

given me occaſion to envy her good luck,

by the name of <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> diſturb my reſt, as

had that the all-merciful God was pleas'd

ſeem'd to envy me a felicity, which I would

he would oblige me; but I queſtion whether
he will do it much. I believe alſo that he
finds it ſome trouble to raiſe money at the
beginning of a Campagne; but there wants
ſo ſmall a ſum for me to begin mine, and
what I expect from him would contribute
ſo little to the diſtraction he is in, that he
might put a period to mine, without much
augmenting his own. It is your concern to
ſolicite him herein, were it only that you
may be deliver'd from the perſecution of
my Letters. To excite you the more, I am
to tell you, that I was yeſterday put into a
great fright; word was brought me, that
Monſieur <hi>Meraut,</hi> Maſter of the Accompts,
was deſirous to ſee me. I was much troubled
to think what might be the conſequence
of my Landlord's viſit. But his diſcourſe
was only concerning the reparations of his

Some three dayes ſince, I was
fallen very low in the purſe, an accident
which is very ordinary to me. I ſent my

receive every Quarter four hundred <hi>Livers,</hi>
a Penſion beſtow'd on me by Monſieur the
Surintendant. I deſir'd him to do me the

            <p>I Am much troubled to hear of the ſoarneſs
of your Eyes: But what addes to the
trouble, is, that having a great likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of doing much miſchief, they are the
leſs bemoan'd by divers other perſons. It
concerns you to examine whether they have
deſerv'd what they endure, and ſo ſeek out,
in your own virtue, for all the patience, you
now ſtand in need of. For my part, it is
the greateſt of my afflictions, partly out of a
conſideration of my preſent intereſt, and
partly out of that of my future expectation.
For ſince it has been known, that you have
honour'd me with your acquaintance, I find
that I am more conſiderable among ſeveral
perſons. The other day, I only took occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to ſpeak of you, as I ought to do, before
Monſieur <hi>de Scudery,</hi> and this day, I receiv'd
from him the Letter I now ſend you, by
which you will ſee, that he hopes great
things from you, if you but ever ſo little
promote the requeſt which Monſieur <hi>Mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi>

               <hi>Servient</hi> will tell you, that theſe Briefs
from <hi>Rome</hi> are very troubleſome, and I am
ſo more then any one, in recommending
two affairs to you, in the ſpace of eight
dayes. But when I ſolicite for other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
I am as fierce as a Lyon, but for my
ſelf, I am ſo baſhful, that it is with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
repugnance in the World, I importune
any man with my concerns. Since my
Letter is grown ſo long, I muſt tell you fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that upon the firſt ſight of Monſieur
<hi>Servient,</hi> I conceiv'd he would be a perſon
anſwerable to my inclination; his merit
has ſince rais'd in me a veneration for him;
and the kindneſs he has expreſs'd, in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
whether I were alive, has made an
abſolute acqueſt of me to his ſervice. This
proteſtation of mine is as ſincere, as that of

to you yeſterday, becauſe I obſerv'd, that
you expreſs'd a certain liking of them,
with this promiſe, that I ſhall cauſe ſome
others to be tranſcrib'd for you, as alſo ſome
Verſes. But at the preſent, the greateſt
part of my employment is the writing of
Comedies, becauſe my principal ſubſiſtance
depends on it. 'Tis a wretched kind of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
which is not of any great advantage,
though a man beſtowes much of his time
in it, and gains him but little reputation,
when he makes too great expedition. The
others require a great repoſe and ſerenity of
mind: and a man has but little of either of
them, when he is as much diſcompos'd in
his health, as in his affairs. And for my part,
I muſt acknowledge, that I find a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution
of that facetious humour, for
which I am ſo remarkable, ever ſince I have
been reduc'd to a neceſſity of making verſes
for my livelihood, as a perſon damn'd to a
Trade. I am extreamly at a loſs, when I
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60941:67"/>
reflect, that if I expreſs not my thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to Monſieur the Procurator General,
as highly as my reſentment of his favours
adviſes me to do, he may ſuſpect, I have it
not to the degree I ought; and if I do thank
him anſwerably to the deſires I have to do
ſo, he may imagine, that I have a mean and
mercenary ſoul. I am ſufficiently ſatisfy'd
that he is ſo tranſcendently generous, as not
to expect Complements from thoſe whom
he obliges, and goes by this principle, that
that is properly giving, when a man gives
to an uſeleſs perſon, ſuch as I am; whereas
to be liberal to one from whom he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
ſome ſervice, implies ſomewhat of
Commerce, rather then the beſtowing of a
kindneſs. In a word, Sir, there is in this
point a certain nicety which I ought to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
and which I deſire to be inſtructed by
you, who have known him ſo well, and ſo
long. I did not make account to have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

I have ſeen her, heard her, and read the
Letter which you ſhew'd me of hers, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

of her. For Godſake, Madam, let me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60941:71"/>
you, to make it your ſerious buſineſs
not to ſpoil my Verſes, by changing a word,
without which they would be defective.
Her act of humility would make me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
one of injuſtice, and you may tell her
from me, that it has already had its effect
towards God. I aſſure her of it, with as
much certainty, as many others might do,
who think themſelves better inform'd, than
I am, of what paſſes in the Celeſtial Court.
She is but the ſecond of thoſe Ladies, whom
I have canoniz'd before their death; but
ſhe is that of the two, of whoſe Virtue I am
moſt aſſur'd: and I dare affirm, that though
ſhe ſhould, during her life, leave a ſum, to
defray the charges of her Canonization after
her death, yet would it not be ſo much the
effect of her preſumption, as of her wiſdom.
I will tell you more of it, when I ſhall have
the honour to ſee you. But though I am
ſmitten with her merit, more than any
other perſon ever was, yet ſhall I believe
more of her, then I ſhall tell you of her; I,
who cannot ſpeak meanly of what I eſteem,
and who am the moſt tender of the intereſts
of perſons that are like her, when they
have gain'd me by their goodneſs. Oh!
that ſhe had but ſome quarrels that were to

but there is ſo much diſcontent in the laſt,
as gives us occaſion to fear, that now you

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60941:72"/>

is alwayes directed to my Friends, becauſe
it is my preſumption, that they are not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd

I ſhall not therefore ſtick to tell you, that

               </gap> thinks me.
I cannot pretend to be half ſo pleaſant as he;
and that during the ſpace of ſeven or eight
months, that he has made his reſidence at
<hi>Paris,</hi> like a <hi>Rinegrave,</hi> and carrying on
Amours by <hi>Placets, Factums,</hi> and <hi>Letters of

greater diverſion, than I ſhall do while I
live, with all the <hi>Burleſque</hi> and facetious
humour that God has beſtow'd on me. He
has further this advantage over me, that it
is with ſome violence to my ſelf, that I am
pleaſant, whereas he is naturally ſuch, and
without ſo much as thinking of it. But
leaſt my Letter may ſeem as undivertive to
you, as what he writ in yours, upon the
innocent raillery of his moſt humble Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant;
I ſhall ſpeak of ſomething elſe. I ſend
you a Pourtraiture of Madam <hi>Bonneau,</hi>
which I did upon the perſwaſion of Madam

her, and written naturally enough. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60941:72"/>
do not divert much, and are
but perpetual repetitions of the ſame thing.
The <hi>Baronade</hi> is finiſh'd; I ſhall ſend it you,
as ſoon as I have ſhewn it to Monſieur the
Procurator-General. I am much troubled
concerning Monſieur the Mareſchal <hi>d' Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bret;</hi>
'tis the common report at <hi>Paris,</hi> that
he lies very ſick, and ſome ſay, he is to be

to your other Friends, as you are to me.
I have no more ſight of you, then if you
were already admitted into the Celeſtial
Court, to which place you are making all
the haſt you can. And yet it was my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that you were ſufficiently accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated,

that you would break off all corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence

            <p>HEr Highneſs does me a great honour
in but thinking that I am in the
World, and it is no ſmall one you do me,
in believing me capable of drawing a Pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture
well. But though I ſhould be ſo
fondly conceited of my ſelf, as to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
of my ability as to that point, and
that my earneſt inclination to pleaſe you,
ſhould give me that Painting; yet would
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60941:74"/>
the Pourtraitures which her Highneſs has
made, quite diſcourage me from making
any. They are, as far as I am able to judge
of them, the nobleſt of all thoſe that were
ever yet made; and the <hi>Virtuoſo</hi>'s of the
preſent Age were to be bemoan'd, that a
Princeſs ſhould tranſcend them in the glory
of writing well, if it were not highly to
their glory, to ſee her meddle with their
Profeſſion. There is a greater difficulty
in making a good Pourtraiture, then is
imagin'd. A man ſhould have a perfect
knowledge of what he is to draw; and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
that commonly people know not
any well but themſelves, and ſometimes
their intimate friends. Can any perſon of
excellent parts commend himſelf without
much vanity? Or ſhould one make a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of his imperfections to any but his
Confeſſor? In like manner, can a man ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate
the accompliſhments of friends,
without importuning him? Or tell them
ſome truths without hazard of incurring
their diſpleaſure? Nor are the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies
occurrent in the commending of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
perſons leſs conſiderable. For,
as Portraitures ought to be made of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
that are well known, and that men
are remarkable upon the ſcore of their
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60941:75"/>
Quality and Merit; ſo a man runs the
riſque of diſobliging thoſe perſons to whom
he owes reſpect and eſteem, if he gives
them not the commendations they deſerve;
he muſt expect the character of an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
perſon, if he gives them thoſe that
are not truly applicable to them; and how
cautiouſly ſoever commendations may be
given, it is my imagination, that there
is not any thing more troubleſome, to him
that receives them, to him that gives them,
and to thoſe perſons who hear them given.
Beſides theſe general reaſons, upon which I
have taken a reſolution not to make any
Pourtraitures, I have ſome particular ones,
which I queſtion not but you will approve.
A wretched perſon, ſuch as I am, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
goes out of his chamber, has no exact
knowledge of things, but what is had by
the relations of others. I doubt not but
you will grant that to be a great defect in a
Painter, who ought to have his fancy
fraught with a great number of Idaea's,
and apprehenſions, which are not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
otherwiſe then in the converſations
of the greateſt perſons; and I am ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
ſenſible, to my great regret, that
in proceſs of time, a man may grow dull
and ruſty, in his chamber, as much as if he
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60941:75"/>
were in the Country. A Man ſhould have
a ſmartneſs of wit and diſcernment equal to
that of ſo excellent a Princeſs, to make good
Pourtraitures, and be of a quality not infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
to hers, ere he ſhall be able either to
commend or diſpraiſe, ſo as that there ſhall
be no occaſion to quarrel at it. I am,</p>

            </p>
            <p>But I hope ſhe will recover that ſo great
a loſs, when the Court returns to <hi>Paris,</hi> and
that aſſoon as ſhe ſhall have the honour to
be known to that incomparable <hi>Romane,</hi> ſhe
will allow her a place among thoſe; for
whom ſhe has ſome kindneſs. For my part,
I would alſo offer her of my incenſe; for
you know, that we Poets muſt have ſome
Divinity, on whom we may beſtow it. But
I am diſtruſtful of the merit of my Preſent,
as much as I am perſwaded, that ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves,
above any perſon in the World, all
the Hyperboles of the Poets; and you know
that our Ware is contemptible, when it is
directed to any one, before it be deſir'd.
The fulneſs of your <hi>Brouage</hi> cauſes a ſolitude
here in <hi>Paris.</hi> Yet can I not perceive any
ſuch thing in one little houſe; for the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
of being admitted into our ſmall ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
grows warmer and warmer, both in
the Court and the City. Not that we and
our <hi>Paris</hi> would at the preſent enter into
any competition with your Divinities of
<hi>Brouage;</hi> but their true Element is <hi>Paris,</hi>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:60941:78"/>
or the Court; and when by their removal
from <hi>Brouage</hi> they ſhall leave you as naked
as they found you, we can afford you no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
quality, then that of Provincialiſts,
and wretched Iſlanders. Adieu; my hand
growes weary, and I can hardly tell you
that I am,</p>

            <p>I Have met with the firſt draught of the
Letter, which I had written to you. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſecond thoughts it ſeems to me very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent;
but ſince you are ſo deſirous to
ſee it, I ſend it you as it is. You have done
me a ſingular pleaſure, in having me in your
remembrance, and it is withall a great act
of juſtice; for you are ſo far oblig'd to a
perſon who eſteem you to the degree that
I do, as ſometimes to think that he is in the
World: and I muſt intreat you to be aſſur'd,
that your retirement at <hi>Roiſſy</hi> is not a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
affliction to your ſelf, than it is to me,
who am apt to hope, that ſometime or other
you would give me a Viſit at my little
Chamber, if your reſidence were at <hi>Paris.</hi>
This is to be underſtood, when you were
diſappointed of all other meetings and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignations,
and could not beſtow your time
elſewhere. The actions of our Neighbours
ſhould be the Subject of our diſcourſe; and
many times we ſhould recreate our ſelves
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60941:79"/>
by ſome little circumventing tricks, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which, I maintain, that all converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
muſt be loſt in proceſs of time. Mean
time, Monſieur <hi>d'Elbene</hi> and my ſelf often
remember you over a glaſs of <hi>Frontiac;</hi>
wiſhing you were here to do us reaſon. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de Mata</hi> is in <hi>Xaintonge;</hi> I wiſh that he
alſo were at <hi>Paris;</hi> his company would
make your hours ſlide away ſomewhat the
more merrily, whenever you had the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to viſit,</p>
