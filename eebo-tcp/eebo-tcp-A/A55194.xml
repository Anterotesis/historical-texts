            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>L<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>cretius,</hi> endeavouring to prove from the principles of his Philoſophy, that the world had a caſual beginning from the concourſe of <hi>Atomes;</hi> and that Men, as well as the reſt of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, were produc'd from the vital heat and moiſture of their Mother Earth; from the ſame principles is
<pb facs="tcp:47090:4"/>
bound to anſwer this objection, why Men are not daily form'd after the ſame manner, which he tells us is, becauſe the kindly warmth, and procreative faculty of the ground is now worn out: The Sun is a diſabled Lover, and the Earth is paſt her teeming time.</p>
            <p>Though Religion has inform'd us better of our Origine, yet it appears plainly, that not only the Bodies, but the Souls of Men, have decreas'd from the vigour of the firſt Ages; that we are not more ſhort of the ſtature and ſtrength of thoſe gygantick Heroes, than we are of their underſtanding, and their wit. To let paſs thoſe happy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, who were ſtriplings at four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore, and had afterwards ſeven or eight hundred years before them to beget Sons and Daughters; and to conſider Man in reference only to his mind, and that no higher
<pb facs="tcp:47090:4"/>
than the Age of <hi>Socrates:</hi> How vaſt a difference is there betwixt the productions of thoſe Souls, and theſe of ours? How much better <hi>Plato, Ariſtotle,</hi> and the reſt of the Philoſophers underſtood nature; <hi>Thucydides,</hi> and <hi>Herodotus</hi> adorn'd Hiſtory; <hi>Sophocles, Eurypides</hi> and <hi>Menander</hi> advanc'd Poetry, than thoſe Dwarfs of Wit and Learning who ſucceeded them in after times? That Age was moſt Famous amongſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> which ended with the death of <hi>Alexander;</hi> amongſt the <hi>Romans</hi> Learning ſeem'd again to revive and flouriſh in the Century which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd <hi>Cicero, Varro, Saluſt, Livy, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretius</hi> and <hi>Virgil:</hi> And after a ſhort interval of years, (wherein Nature ſeem'd to take a breathing time for a ſecond birth,) there ſprung up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Veſpaſians,</hi> and thoſe excellent Princes who ſucceeded them, a race of memorable Wits; ſuch as were
<pb facs="tcp:47090:5"/>
the two <hi>Plinies, Tacitus,</hi> and <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius;</hi> and as if <hi>Greece</hi> was emulous of the <hi>Roman</hi> learning, under the ſame favourable Conſtellation, was born the famous Philoſopher and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian <hi>Plutarch.</hi> Then whom An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity has never produc'd a Man more generally knowing, or more vertuous; and no ſucceeding Age has equall'd him. His Lives both in his own eſteem, and that of others, accounted the Nobleſt of his Works, have been long ſince ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd into <hi>Engliſh:</hi> But as that Tranſlation was only from the <hi>French,</hi> ſo it ſuffer'd this double diſadvantage, firſt that it was but a Copy of a Copy, and that too but lamely taken from the <hi>Greek</hi> Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal: Secondly that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Language was then unpoliſh'd, and far from the perfection which it has ſince attain'd: So that the firſt Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is not only ungrammatical and
<pb facs="tcp:47090:5"/>
ungraceful, but in many places al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt unintelligible. For which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and leaſt ſo uſeful a piece of Hiſtory, ſhou'd lie oppreſs'd under the rubbiſh of Antiquated words, ſome ingenious and learned Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, have undertaken this Task: And what wou'd have been the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of one Mans Life, will, by the ſeveral endeavours of many, be now accompliſh'd in the compaſs of a year. How far they have ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this laudable attempt, to me it belongs not to determine; who am too much a party to be a Judge: But I have the honour to be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion'd from the Tranſlators of this Volum, to inſcribe their labours and my own, with all humility, to your Graces Name and Patronage. And never was any Man more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious of an employment, of which he was ſo little worthy. Fortune has at laſt gratify'd that earneſt
<pb facs="tcp:47090:6"/>
deſire I have always had, to ſhew my devotion to your Grace; though I deſpair of paying you my acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments. And of all other op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities I have happen'd on the moſt favourable to my ſelf; who, having never been able to produce any thing of my own, which cou'd be worthy of your view, am ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd by the aſſiſtance of my friends, and honour'd with the preſentation of their labours. The Author they have Tranſlated, has been long familiar to you: Who have been converſant in all ſorts of Hiſtory both Ancient and Modern; and have form'd the Idea of your moſt Noble Life from the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Examples contain'd in them; both in the management of publick affairs, and in the private Offices of vertue; in the enjoyment of your better fortune, and ſuſtaining of your worſe; in habituating your ſelf
<pb facs="tcp:47090:6"/>
to an eaſie greatneſs; in repelling your Enemies, in ſuccouring your Friends, and in all traverſes of fortune, in every colour of your Life, maintaining an inviolable fidelity to your Soveraign. Tis long ſince that I have learn'd to forget the art of praiſing; but here the heart dictates to the pen; and I appeal to your Enemies, (if ſo much generoſity and good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can have left you any) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are not conſcious to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that I have not flatter'd.</p>
            <p>Tis an Age indeed, which is only fit for Satyr; and the ſharpeſt I have ſhall never be wanting to launce its Villanies, and its ingratitude to the Government: There are few Men in it, who are capable of ſupporting the weight of a juſt and deſerv'd commendation: But amongſt thoſe few there muſt always ſtand excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Illuſtrious Names of <hi>Ormond</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:47090:7"/>
and of <hi>Oſſory:</hi> A Father and a Son, only Worthy of each other. Never was one Soul more fully infus'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to anothers breaſt: Never was ſo ſtrong an impreſſion made of vertue, as that of your Graces into him: But though the ſtamp was deep, the ſubject which receiv'd it was of too fine a compoſition to be dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Were not priority of time and nature in the caſe, it might have been doubted which of you had been moſt excellent: But Heaven ſnatch'd away the Copy to make the Original more precious. I dare truſt my ſelf no farther on this ſubject; for after years of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, my ſorrow is yet ſo green upon me, that I am ready to tax Providence for the loſs of that Heroick Son: Three Nations had a general concernment in his Death, but I had one ſo very particular, that all my hopes are almoſt dead with
<pb facs="tcp:47090:7"/>
him; and I have loſt ſo much that I am paſt the danger of a ſecond Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck. But he ſleeps with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>envy'd commendation: And has left your Grace the ſad Legacy of all thoſe Glories which he deriv'd from you. An acceſſion which you wanted not, who were ſo rich before in your own vertues, and that high reputation which is the product of them. A long deſcent of Noble Anceſtors was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to have made you great: But Heaven threw it in as over-plus when you were born. What you have done and ſuffer'd for two Royal Maſters has been enough to render you Illuſtrious; ſo that you may ſafely wave the Nobility of your birth, and relie on your actions for your fame. You have cancell'd the debt which you ow'd to your Progenitors, and reflect more brightneſs on their memory than
<pb facs="tcp:47090:8"/>
you receiv'd from them. Your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country, which Providence gave you not leave to preſerve un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one King, it has given you op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity under another to reſtore. You cou'd not ſave it from the Chaſtiſement which was due to its Rebellion, but you rais'd it from ruin after its repentance: So that the Trophies of War were the portion of the Conquerour, but the Triumphs of peace were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd for the vanquiſh'd. The misfortunes of <hi>Ireland</hi> were owing to it ſelf, but its happineſs and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration to your Grace. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt a Lawful Prince, was puniſh'd by an Uſurping Tyrant: But the fruits of his Victory were the rewards of a Loyal Subject. How much that Noble Kingdom has flouriſh'd under your Graces Government, both the Inhabitants and the Crown are ſenſible. The
<pb facs="tcp:47090:8"/>
riches of <hi>Ireland</hi> are increas'd by it, and the Revenues of <hi>England</hi> are augmented. That which was a charge and burden of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is render'd an advantage and ſupport: The Trade and Intereſt of both Countries are united in a mutual benefit; they conſpire to make each other happy; the depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the one is an improvement of its Commerce, the preeminence of the other is not impair'd by the intercourſe, and common neceſſities are ſupply'd by both. <hi>Ireland</hi> is no more a <hi>Cyon,</hi> to ſuck the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Mother Tree; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it overtop'd, or hinder'd from growth by the ſuperiour bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; but the Roots of <hi>England,</hi> diving (if I may dare to ſay it,) underneath the Seas, riſe at a juſt diſtance on the Neighbouring Shore; and there ſhoot up, and bear a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct ſcarce inferiour to the Trunk
<pb facs="tcp:47090:9"/>
from whenee they ſprung. I may raiſe the commendation higher, and yet not fear to offend the truth: <hi>Ireland</hi> is a better Penitent than <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> The Crime of Rebellion was common to both Countries; but the repentance of one Iſland has been ſteady; that of the other, to its ſhame, has ſuffer'd a relapſe: Which ſhews the Converſions of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels to have been real, that of ours to have been but counterfeit. The Sons of Guilty Fathers there have made amends for the diſloyalty of their Families: But here the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants of pardon'd Rebels have only waited their time to copy the wickedneſs of their Parents, and if poſſible to out do it: They diſdain to hold their Patrimonies by acts of Grace and of Indempnity: and by maintaining their old Treaſonable principles, make it apparent that they are ſtill ſpeculative Traytors.
<pb facs="tcp:47090:9"/>
For whether they are zealous Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries or prophane Republicans, (of which two ſorts they are principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compos'd) both our Reformers of Church and Sate, pretend to a power ſuperiour to Kingſhip. The Fanaticks derive their Authority from the Bible; and plead Religion to be antecedent to any ſecular ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation: By vertue of which Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, taking it for granted that their own Worſhip is only true, they arrogate to themſelves the right of diſpoſing the Temporal power ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their pleaſure; as that which is ſubordinate to the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual: So that the ſame Reaſons, and Scriptures, which are urg'd by Popes for the depoſition of Princes, are produc'd by Sectaries for altering the Succeſſion. The Epiſcopal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation has manumiz'd Kings from the Uſurpation of <hi>Rome;</hi> for it preaches obedience and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation
<pb facs="tcp:47090:10"/>
to the lawful Secular power: but the pretended Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of our Schiſmaticks, is to ſet up themſelves in the Papal Chair; and to make their Princes only their Truſtees. So that whether they or the Pope were uppermoſt in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the Royal Authority were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually depreſs'd: The Priſon of our Kings wou'd be the ſame; the Gaol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers only wou'd be alter'd. The broad Republicans are generally Men of Atheiſtick principles, nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Chriſtians, who are beholding to the Font, only that they are ſo call'd, otherwiſe <hi>Hobbiſts</hi> in their politicks and Morals: Every Church is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to them that they own them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of none; becauſe their Lives are too ſcandalous for any. Some of the Sectaries are ſo proud, that they think they cannot ſin; thoſe Common-wealth Men are ſo wicked, that they conclude there is no ſin. Lewdneſs,
<pb facs="tcp:47090:10"/>
Rioting, Cheating and Debauchery, are their work a day practiſe: Their more ſolemn crimes, are unnatural Luſts, and horrid Murthers. Yet theſe are the Patrons of the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts; theſe are the Swords and Bucklers of Gods cauſe; if his cauſe be that of Separatiſts and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells. Tis not but theſe Aſſociates know each other at the bottom, as well as <hi>Simeon</hi> knew <hi>Levi:</hi> The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicans are ſatisfy'd that the Schiſmaticks are Hypocrites, and the Schiſmaticks are aſſur'd that the Republicans are Atheiſts: But their common principles of Government are the chaines that link them: For both hold Kings to be Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of their own making, and by inference to be at their own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing. With this difference, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, that the Canting party face their pretences with a call from God, the debauch'd par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb facs="tcp:47090:11"/>
with a Commiſſion from the people. So that if ever this ill contriv'd and equivocal aſſociation ſhou'd get uppermoſt, they wou'd infallibly contend for the ſupream right; and as it was formerly on their mony, ſo now it wou'd be in their intereſts; <hi>God with us</hi> wou'd be ſet up on one ſide, <hi>and the Common-wealth of</hi> England on the other. But I the leſs wonder at the mixture of theſe two natures, becauſe two Salvage beaſts of different ſpecies and Sexes ſhut up together, will forget their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to ſatisfie their common luſt; and 'tis no matter what kind of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is produc'd betwixt them, ſo the brutal appetite be ſerv'd. I more admire at a third party, who were Loyal when Rebellion was upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, and have turn'd Rebells (at leaſt in principle,) ſince Loyalty has been Triumphant. Thoſe of them whoſe ſervices have not been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded,
<pb facs="tcp:47090:11"/>
have ſome pretence for diſcontent; and yet they give the World to underſtand, that their Honour was not their principle, but their Intereſt. If they are old Royalliſts, 'tis a ſign their vertue is worn out; and will bear no longer; if Sons to Royalliſts they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably been grafted on Whig ſtocks, and grown out of kind; like <hi>China</hi> Oranges in <hi>Portugal:</hi> Their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers part has prevail'd in them, and they are degenerated from the Loyalty of their Fathers.</p>
            <p>But if they are ſuch, as many of them evidently are, whoſe ſervice has been, not only fully but laviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recompens'd, with Honours and preferment, theirs is an ingratitude without parallel; they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd their former merits, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own'd the cauſe for which they fought, bely'd their youth, diſhon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our'd their age; they have wrought
<pb facs="tcp:47090:12"/>
themſelves out of preſent enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for imaginary hopes, and can never be truſted by their new friends, becauſe they have betray'd their old. The greater and the ſtronger ties which ſome of them have had, are the deeper brands of their Apoſtacy: For Arch-Angels were the firſt and moſt glorious of the whole Creation: They were the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing work of God; and had the firſt impreſſions of his Image, what Creatures cou'd be made: They were of kin to Eternity it ſelf; and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting only that acceſſion to be Deities. Their fall was therefore more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious than that of Man, becauſe they had no clay for their excuſe: Though I hope and wiſh the latter part of the Allegory may not hold, and that repentance may be yet allow'd them. But I delight not to dwell on ſo ſad an object: Let this part of the Landſchape be caſt into
<pb facs="tcp:47090:12"/>
ſhadows, that the heightnings of the other may appear more beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. For as Contraries the nearer they are plac'd are brighter, and the <hi>Venus</hi> is illuſtrated by the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the <hi>Lazar,</hi> ſo the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemiſh'd Loyalty of your Grace, will ſhine more clearly, when ſet in competition with their ſtains. When the Malady which had ſeiz'd the Nobler parts of <hi>Britain</hi> threw it ſelf out into the limbs, and the firſt ſores of it appear'd in <hi>Scotland,</hi> yet no effects of it reach'd your Province: <hi>Ireland</hi> ſtood untainted with that peſt: The care of the Phyſician prevented the diſeaſe, and preſerv'd the Country from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. When that Ulcer was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtop'd than cur'd, (for the cauſes of it ſtill remain'd) and that dangerous Symptoms appear'd in <hi>England;</hi> when the Royal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was here trodden under
<pb facs="tcp:47090:13"/>
foot, when one Plot was proſecuted openly, and another ſecretly fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, yet even then was <hi>Ireland</hi> free from our contagion: And if ſome venemous Creatures were produc'd in that Nation, yet it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd they could not live there: They ſhed their poyſon without effect: They deſpair'd of being ſucceſsfully wicked in their own Country, and tranſported their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to another, where they knew 'twas vendible: Where ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation was a Trade, where for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries were countenanc'd, where perjuries were rewarded, where ſwearing went for proof, and where the Merchandize of Death was gainful. That their Teſtimony was at laſt diſcredited, proceeded not from its incoherence: For they were known by their own party when they firſt appear'd; but their folly was then manag'd by the cunning
<pb facs="tcp:47090:13"/>
of their Tutors; they had ſtill been believ'd, had they ſtill follow'd their Inſtructors: But when their wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs fell foul upon their friends, then they were proclaim'd Villains, diſcarded and diſown'd by thoſe who ſent for them; they ſeem'd then firſt to be diſcover'd, for what they had been known too well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; they were decry'd as inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of what only they betray'd: Nay their very wit was magnified leſt being taken for fools, they might be thought too ſimple to forge an accuſation. Some of them ſtill continue here deteſted by both ſides, believ'd by neither: (for even their betters are at laſt uncas'd,) and ſome of them have receiv'd their hire in their own Country: For perjury, which is malice to Mankind, is always accompanied with other Crimes: and tho not puniſhable by our Laws with death,
<pb facs="tcp:47090:14"/>
yet draws a train of vices after it: The Robber, the Murderer and the Sodomite, have often hung up the forſworn villain: And what one ſin took on truſt, another ſin has pay'd. Theſe travelling Locuſts are at length ſwallow'd up in their own Red-Sea. <hi>Ireland</hi> as well as <hi>England</hi> is deliver'd from that fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Plague; for the Sword of Juſtice in your Graces hand, like the Rod of <hi>Moſes,</hi> is ſtretcht out againſt them: And the third part of his Majeſties Dominions is owing for its peace to your Loyalty and vigilance.</p>
            <p>But what <hi>Plutarch</hi> can this age produce to immortallize a life ſo Noble? May ſome excellent Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian at length be found, ſome Writer not unworthy of his Subject, but may his employment be long deferr'd: May many happy years continue you to this Nation and your own; may your praiſes be ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
<pb facs="tcp:47090:14"/>
late; that we may enjoy you living rather than adore you dead. And ſince yet, there is not riſen up amongſt us, any Hiſtorian who is equal to ſo great an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, let us hope that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence has not aſſign'd the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, becauſe his employment is to be long delay'd; becauſe it has reſerv'd your Grace for farther proofs of your unwearyed duty, and a farther enjoyment of your fortune. In which tho no Man has been leſs envy'd, becauſe no other has more Nobly us'd it, yet ſome droppings of the Ages venom have been ſhed upon you: The Supporters of the Crown are plac'd too near it, to be exempted from the ſtorm which was breaking over it. 'Tis true you ſtood involv'd in your own Vertue, and the Malice of your Libellers cou'd not ſink through all thoſe folds to reach you. Your
<pb facs="tcp:47090:15"/>
Innocence has defended you from their attacks, and your pen has ſo Nobly vindicated that Innocence, that it ſtands in need of no other ſecond. The difference is as plainly ſeen, betwixt Sophiſtry and truth, as it is betwixt the ſtile of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and the clumſy ſtifneſs of a Pedant. Of all Hiſtorians God deliver us from Bigots; and of all Bigots from our Sectaries. Truth is never to be expected from Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors whoſe underſtandings are warp'd with Enthuſiaſm: For they judge all actions and their cauſes by their own perverſe principles; and a crooked line can never be the meaſure of a ſtreight one. Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> was us'd to ſay, that a Man was alwaies againſt reaſon, when reaſon wasagainſt a Man: So theſe Authors are for obſcuring truth, becauſe truth would diſcover them. They are not Hiſtorians of an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb facs="tcp:47090:15"/>
but Lawyers of a party: They are retain'd by their principles, and brid'd by their intereſts: Their nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations are an opening of their cauſe; and in the front of their Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, there ought to be written the Prologue of a pleading, <hi>I am for the Plaintiff, or I am for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant.</hi> We have already ſeen large Volumes of State Collections, and Church Legends, ſtuffd with detected forgeries in ſome parts, and gaping with omiſſions of truth in others: Not penn'd I ſuppoſe with ſo vain a hope as to cheat Poſterity, but to advance ſome deſign in the preſent Age: For theſe Legerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main Authors, are for telling ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to keep their trick undiſcover'd; and to make their conveyance the more clean. What calumny your Grace may expect from ſuch Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is already evident: But it will fare with them, as it does with ill
<pb facs="tcp:47090:16"/>
Painters; a Picture ſo unlike in all its features and proportions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects not on the original, but on the Artiſt: For malice will make a piece more unreſembling than ignorance: And he who ſtudies the life, yet bungles, may draw ſome faint imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it; But he who purpoſely avoids nature, muſt fall into gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſque, and make no likeneſs. For my own part I am of the former ſort: And therefore preſume not to offer my unskillfulneſs for ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a deſign as is your illuſtrious life: To pray for its proſperity and continuance is my duty; as it is my Ambition to appear on all occaſions,</p>

            <byline>Written by Mr. DRYDEN.</byline>
            <p>I Know not by what Fate it comes to paſs, that Hiſtorians, who give immortality to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, are ſo ill requited by Poſterity, that their Actions and their Fortunes are uſually forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; neither themſelves incourag'd, while they live, nor their memory preſerv'd entire to future Ages. 'Tis the ingratitude of Mankind to their
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47090:19"/>
greateſt Benefactors, that they, who teach us wiſdome by the ſureſt ways, (ſetting before us what we ought to ſhun or to purſue, by the examples of the moſt famous Men whom they Record, and by the experience of their Faults and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,) ſhould generally live poor and unregarded; as if they were born only for the publick, and had no intereſt in their own well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but were to be lighted up like Tapers, and to waſte themſelves, for the benefit of others. But this is a complaint too general, and the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom has been too long eſtabliſh'd to be remedied; neither does it wholly reach our Author: He was born in an Age, which was ſenſible of his vertue; and found a <hi>Trajan</hi> to reward him, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> did an <hi>Alexander.</hi> But the Hiſtorians, who ſucceeded him, have either been too envious, or too careleſs of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47090:19"/>
none of them, not even his own Country-men, having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us any particular account of him; or if they have, yet their Works are not tranſmitted to us; ſo that we are forc'd to glean from <hi>Plutarch,</hi> what he has ſcatter'd in his Writings, concerning himſelf and his Original: Which (excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that little memorial, that <hi>Suidas,</hi> and ſome few others, have left concerning him) is all we can collect, relating to this great Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher and Hiſtorian.</p>
            <p>He was born at <hi>Chaeronea</hi> a ſmall City of <hi>Boeotia</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> between <hi>Attica</hi> and <hi>Phocis,</hi> and reaching to both Seas. The Climate not much befreinded by the Heavens; for the air is thick and foggy; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Inhabitants partaking of its influence, groſs feeders, and fat witted; brawny, and unthink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, juſt the conſtitution of Heroes:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47090:20"/>
Cut out for the Executive and brutal buſineſs of War; but ſo ſtupid in the deſigning part, that in all the revolutions of <hi>Greece</hi> they were never Maſters, but only in thoſe few years, when they were led by <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas,</hi> or <hi>Pelopidas.</hi> Yet this foggy ayre, this Country of fat wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as <hi>Juvenal</hi> calls it, produc'd three wits, which were comparable to any three <hi>Athenians: Pyndar, Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas,</hi> and our <hi>Plutarch,</hi> to whom we may add a fourth, <hi>Sextus Chae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronenſis,</hi> the Praeceptor of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius;</hi> and the Nephew of our Authour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Choercnea,</hi> (if we may give credit to <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> in the ninth Book of his deſcription of <hi>Greece)</hi> was anciently call'd <hi>Arnè;</hi> from <hi>Arnè</hi> the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Aeolus;</hi> but being ſcituated to the weſt of <hi>Parnaſſus</hi> in that low land country, the natural unwholſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Ayre was augmented by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47090:20"/>
the evening Vapours caſt upon it from that Mountain, which our late Travellers deſcribe to be full of moiſture and marſhy ground in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſ'd in the inequality of its aſcents: And being alſo expos'd to the winds which blew from that quarter, the Town was perpetually unhealthful, for which reaſon, ſayes my Author, <hi>Chaeron,</hi> the Son of <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Thero,</hi> made it be rebuilt, and turn'd it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the riſing Sun; From whence the Town became health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and conſequently populous; in memory of which benefit it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards retain'd his name. But as <hi>Etymologies</hi> are uncertain, and the <hi>Greeks,</hi> above all Nations, given to fabulous derivations of Names, eſpecially, when they tend to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their Country, I think we may be reaſonably content to take the denomination of the Town from its delightful or chearful ſtanding; as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47090:21"/>
the word <hi>Chaeron</hi> ſufficiently implies.</p>
            <p>But to loſe no time, in theſe grammatical <hi>Etymologies,</hi> which are commonly uncertain gheſſes, 'tis a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed that <hi>Plutarch</hi> was here born; the year uncertain; but without diſpute in the reign of <hi>Claudius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joh. Gerrard Voſſius</hi> has aſſign'd his birth in the latter end of that Emperour: Some other Writers of his Life, have left it undecided, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then, or in the beginning of <hi>Nero</hi>'s Empire: But the moſt accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <hi>Rualdus</hi> (as I find it in the <hi>Paris</hi> Edition of <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s Works) has manifeſtly prov'd him to be born in the middle time of <hi>Claudius,</hi> or ſomewhat lower: For <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the inſcription at <hi>Delphos,</hi> of which more hereafter, remembers that <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monius</hi> his Maſter diſputed with him and his Brother <hi>Lamprias</hi> concerning it, when <hi>Nero</hi> made his progreſs into <hi>Greece;</hi> which was in his twelfth year;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47090:21"/>
and the Queſtion diſputed cou'd not be manag'd with ſo much learning as it was, by meer Boyes; therefore he was then ſixteen, or rather eighteen years of age.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Xylander</hi> has obſerv'd that <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> himſelf, in the Life of <hi>Pericles,</hi> and that of <hi>Anthony,</hi> has mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned both <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Domitian,</hi> as his Contemporaries. He has alſo left it on Record in his <hi>Sympoſiaques,</hi> that his Family was ancient in <hi>Chaeronea;</hi> and that for many deſcents, they had born the moſt conſiderable Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in that petty Common-wealth.

This <hi>Nicarchus,</hi> the Great Grand-Father of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> among other Sons, had <hi>Lamprias,</hi> a Man eminent for his Learning; and a Philoſopher, of whom <hi>Plutarch</hi> has made fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent mention in his <hi>Sympoſiaques,</hi> or <hi>Table Converſations,</hi> and amongſt the reſt, there is this obſervation of him, that he diſputed beſt, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravell'd the difficulties of Philoſophy with moſt ſucceſs when he was at Supper, and well warm'd with Wine. Theſe Table Entertainments were part of the Education of thoſe times, their diſcourſes being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the canvaſing and Solution of ſome queſtion, either Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal or Philological, alwayes inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, and uſually pleaſant; for the Cups went round with the debate; and Men were merry and wiſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, according to the Proverb. The Father of <hi>Plutarch</hi> is alſo men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, in thoſe Diſcourſes, whom
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47090:23"/>
our Author repreſents as arguing of ſeveral points in Philoſophy; but his name is no where to be found in any part of the works re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining to us. But yet he ſpeaks of him, as a Man not ignorant in Learning and Poetry, as may appear by what he ſays, when he is introduc'd diſputing in the <hi>Sympo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaques;</hi> where alſo his prudence and humanity are commended, in this following Relation. Being yet very young (ſays <hi>Plutarch)</hi> I was joyn'd, in Commiſſion with another in an Embaſſy to the <hi>Proconſul,</hi> and my Collegue falling ſick was forc'd to ſtay behind, ſo that the whole buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was Tranſacted by me alone. At my return, when <hi>I</hi> was to give account to the Common-wealth of my proceedings, my Father, riſing from his Seat, openly enjoyn'd me not to name my ſelf in the ſingular Number, <hi>I did thus, or thus, I ſay'd</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:47090:23"/>
               <hi>to the Proconſul, but thus we did and thus we ſay'd,</hi> alwaies aſſociating my Companion with me, though abſent in the management: this was done to obſerve, as I ſuppoſe, the point of good manners with his Collegue, that of reſpect to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the City, who had commiſſion'd both, to avoid envy, and perhaps more eſpecially, to take off the forwardneſs of a pert young Miniſter, commonly too apt to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vervalue his own ſervices, and to quote himſelf on every inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able occaſion. The Father of <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> had many Children beſides him; <hi>Timon</hi> and <hi>Lamprias,</hi> his Brothers, were bred up with him, all three inſtructed in the Liberal Sciences, and in all parts of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy. 'Tis Manifeſt from our Author that they liv'd together in great friendlineſs, and in great veneration to their Grand-father
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47090:24"/>
and Father. What affection <hi>Plutarch</hi> bore in parricular to his Brother <hi>Timon</hi> may be gather'd from theſe words of his. As for my ſelf, though fortune on ſeveral occaſions has been favourable to me, I have no obligation ſo great to her, as the kindneſs, and entire friendſhip, which my Brother <hi>Timon</hi> has alwayes born, and ſtill bears me: and this is ſo evident that it cannot but be not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by every one of our acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. <hi>Lamprias,</hi> the youngeſt of the three, is introduc'd by him in his Morals, as one of a ſweet and pleaſant Converſation, inclin'd to Mirth and Raillery; or, as we ſay in Engliſh, a well humour'd man, and a good Companion. The whole Family being thus addicted to Philoſophy, 'tis no wonder if our Author was initiated betimes in Study, to which he was naturally inclin'd. In purſuit of which he
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47090:24"/>
was ſo happy, to fall into good hands at firſt; being recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the care of <hi>Ammonius</hi> an Egyptian, who, having taught Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy with great Reputation at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and from thence travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into <hi>Greece,</hi> ſettled himſelf at laſt in <hi>Athens,</hi> where he was well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, and generally reſpected. At the end of <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> his Life, <hi>Plutarch</hi> relates, that being young, he was a Pentioner in the houſe of this <hi>Ammonius;</hi> and in his <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſiaques</hi> he brings him in diſputing with his Scholars, and giving them inſtruction. For the cuſtom of thoſe times was very much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from theſe of ours, where the greateſt part of our Youth is ſpent in learning the words of dead lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages: The <hi>Grecians,</hi> who thought all <hi>Barbarians</hi> but themſelves, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpis'd the uſe of Forreign tongues; ſo that the firſt Elements of their
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47090:25"/>
breeding was the knowledge of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the accommodation of that knowledge by Moral precepts, to the ſervice of the publick, and the private offices of vertue. The Maſters imploying one part of their time in reading to, and diſcourſing with their Scholars, and the reſt in appointing them their ſeveral Exerciſes either in Oratory or Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy; and ſeting them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim and to diſpute amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. By this liberal ſort of Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ſtudy was ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a burden to them, that in a ſhort time, it became a habit, and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical queſtions, and criticiſms of humanity, were their uſual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations at their Meals. Boyes liv'd then, as the better ſort of Men do now; and their converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ſo well bred and Manly, that they did not plunge out of their depth into the World, when
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47090:25"/>
they grew up; but ſlid eaſily into it, and found no alteration in their Company. Amongſt the reſt, the Reading and Quotations of Poets were not forgotten at their Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and in their Walks; but <hi>Homer, Euripides,</hi> and <hi>Sophocles,</hi> were the entertainment of their hours of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Rods and Ferula's were not us'd by <hi>Ammonius,</hi> as being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the puniſhment of ſlaves, and not the correction of ingenuous free-born Men. At leaſt to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exercis'd by parents, who had the power of life and death over their own Children. As appears by the Example of this <hi>Ammonius,</hi> thus related by our Author.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our Maſter</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>one time, perceiving, at his afternoon Lecture; that ſome of his Scholars had eaten more largely than became the modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Students, immediately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded one of his Free-Men to take</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:47090:26"/>
               <hi>his own Son, and Scourge him in our ſight; becauſe,</hi> ſayd the Philoſopher, <hi>my young Gentleman cou'd not eat his Dinner, without Poynant ſauce, or Vinegar; and at the ſame time he caſt his eye on all of us: So that every Criminal was given to underſtand, that he had a ſhare in the reprehenſion, and that the puniſhment was as well deſerv'd by all the reſt, had the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher not known, that it exceeded his Commiſſion to inflict it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plutarch</hi> therefore having the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of ſuch a Maſter, in few years advanc'd to admiration in knowledge: And that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out firſt Travelling into For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign parts, or acquiring any For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign tongue; though the <hi>Roman</hi> Language at that time was not only vulgar in <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally through the extent of that vaſt Empire, and in <hi>Greece,</hi> which was a Member of it, as our Author
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47090:26"/>
has remark'd towards the end of his <hi>Platonick</hi> queſtions. For like a true Philoſopher, who minded things, not words, he ſtrove not even to cultivate his Mother Tongue with any great exactneſs. And himſelf confeſſes in the beginning of <hi>Demoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henes</hi> his life, that during his abode in <hi>Italy,</hi> and at <hi>Rome,</hi> he had neither the leiſure to ſtudy, nor ſo much as to exerciſe the <hi>Roman</hi> language; (I ſuppoſe he means to write in it, rather than to ſpeak it,) as well by reaſon of the affairs he manag'd, as that he might acquit himſelf to thoſe who were deſirous to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by him in Philoſophy. In ſo much that till the declination of his age, he began not to be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in Latin books; in reading of which it happened ſomewhat oddly to him, that he learnt not the knowledge of things by words; but by the underſtanding and uſe he
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47090:27"/>
had of things, attain'd to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of words which ſignified them. Juſt as <hi>Adam</hi> (ſetting aſide divine illumination) call'd the Creatures by their proper Names, by firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of their natures. But for the delicacies of the Tongue, the turns of the Expreſſion, the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures and connexions of words, in which conſiſt the beauty of that language, he plainly tells us, that tho he much admir'd them, yet they requir'd too great labour for a Man in Age, and plung'd in buſineſs to attain perfectly. Which Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement I ſhou'd be willing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve from a Philoſopher, if I did not conſider, that <hi>Dion Caſſius,</hi> nay even <hi>Herodian,</hi> and <hi>Appian</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, as well as <hi>Polybius</hi> before him, by writing the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtory in the <hi>Greek</hi> language, had ſhewn as manifeſt a contempt of Latin, in reſpect of the other, as <hi>French</hi> Men
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47090:27"/>
now do of <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain to ſpeak, while they live among us: But with great advantage to their trivial conceptions, drawing the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe into their own language, have learnt to deſpiſe our better thoughts, which muſt come deform'd and lame in converſation to them, as being tranſmitted in a Tongue of which we are not Maſters. This is to arrogate a ſuperiority in nature over us, as undoubtedly the <hi>Grecians</hi> did over their Conquerours, by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhing their language for a Standard; it being become ſo much a mode to ſpeak and write <hi>Greek</hi> in <hi>Tully</hi>'s time, that with ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation I have read his Epiſtles to <hi>Atticus,</hi> in which he deſires to have his own conſulſhip written by his friend in the <hi>Grecian</hi> language; which he afterwards perform'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; a vain attempt in my opinion, for any Man to endeavour to excel
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47090:28"/>
in a Tongue which he was not born to ſpeak. This, tho it be digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, yet deſerves to be conſider'd at more leiſure; for the honour of of our Wit and Writings, which are of a more ſolid make than that of our Neighbours, is concern'd in it. But to return to <hi>Plutarch,</hi> as it was his good fortune to be moulded firſt by Maſters the moſt excellent in their kind, ſo it was his own vertue, to ſuck in with an incredible deſire, and earneſt application of mind, their wiſe inſtructions; and it was alſo his prudence ſo to manage his health by moderation of diet and bodily exerciſe, as to preſerve his parts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out decay to a great old age; to be lively and vigorous to the laſt, and to preſerve himſelf to his own en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, and to the profit of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Which was not difficult for him to perform, having receiv'd from nature a conſtitution capable
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47090:28"/>
of labour; and from the Domeſtick example of his Parents, a ſparing ſobriety of diet, a temperance in other pleaſures, and above all an Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitude of commanding his paſſions in order to his health. Thus prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled, and grounded, he conſider'd with himſelf, that a larger Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with learned Men was neceſſary for his accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and therefore, having a Soul inſatiable of knowledge, and being ambitious to excell in all kinds of Science, he took up a reſolution to Travel. <hi>Egypt</hi> was at that time, as formerly it had been, famous for learning; and probably the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs of their Doctrine might tempt him, as it had done <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and others, to converſe with the Prieſt-hood of that Country, which appears to have been particularly his buſineſs by the Treatiſe of <hi>Iſis</hi> and <hi>Oſyris,</hi> which he has left us. In
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47090:29"/>
which he ſhews himſelf not meanly vers'd, in the ancient Theology and Philoſophy of thoſe wiſe Men. From <hi>Egypt</hi> returning into <hi>Greece,</hi> he viſited in his way all the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demies, or Schools of the ſeveral Philoſophers, and gather'd from them many of thoſe obſervations with which he has enrich'd Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, he applyed himſelf, with extream diligence, to collect not only all books which were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in their kind, and already publiſh'd, but alſo all ſayings and diſcourſes of wiſe Men, which he had heard in converſation, or which he had receiv'd from others by Tradition. As likewiſe the Records and publick Inſtruments, preſerv'd in Cities, which he had viſited in his Travels; and which he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſcatter'd through his works. To which purpoſe he took a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47090:29"/>
Journy to <hi>Sparta,</hi> to ſearch the Archives of that famous Commonwealth, to underſtand throughly the model of their ancient Government, their Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlators, their Kings, and their <hi>Ephori,</hi> digeſting all their memor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able deeds and ſayings, with ſo much care, that he has not omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thoſe even of their Women, or their private Souldiers; together with their Cuſtomes, their Decrees, their Ceremonies, and the manner of their publick and private living, both in peace and war. The ſame methods he alſo took in divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Commonwealths, as his Lives, and his <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſufficiently teſtifie. Without theſe helps it had been impoſſible for him to leave in writing ſo many particular obſervations of Men and manners, and as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to have gatherd them,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47090:30"/>
without converſation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with the learned Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaries of his time. To theſe he added a curious Collection of Ancient Statues, Medals, Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Paintings, as alſo of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial ſayings, Epigrams, Epitaphs, Apothegmes, and other Ornaments of Hiſtory, that he might leave nothing unſwept behind him. And as he was continually in Company with Men of learning, in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, ſo his memory was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways on the ſtretch, to receive and lodge their diſcourſes; and his Judgment perpetually employ'd in ſeparating his notions, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing which were fit to be preſerv'd, and which to be reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>By benefit of this, in little time he inlarg'd his knowledge to a great extent in every Science; himſelf in the beginning of the Treatiſe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47090:30"/>
which he has compos'd of <hi>Content, and Peace of mind,</hi> makes mention of thoſe Collections, or Common pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which he had long ſince drawn together for his own particular occaſions: And 'tis from this rich Cabinet that he has taken out thoſe excellent peices, which he has diſtributed to Poſterity, and which give us occaſion to deplore the loſs of the reſidue, which either the injury of time, or the negligence of Coppiers have denyed to us. On this account, tho we need not doubt to give him this general commendation, that he was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of no ſort of learning, yet we may juſtly add this farther, that whoever will conſider through the whole body of his Works, either the deſign, the method, or the contexture of his Diſcourſes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hiſtorical or Moral, or Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of natural Philoſophy, or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Solutions
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47090:31"/>
of Problems Mathematical, whether he arraigns the opinions of others Sects, or eſtabliſhes the Doctrines of his own, in all theſe kinds there will be found, both the harmony of order and the beauty of eaſineſs. His reaſons ſo ſolid and convincing, his inductions ſo pleaſant and agreeable to all ſorts of Readers, that it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged he was Maſter of every Subject which he treated, and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed none but what were improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the benefit of Inſtruction. For we may perceive in his Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the deſire he had to imprint his Precepts in the Souls of his Readers; and to lodge Morality in Families, nay even to exalt it to the Thrones of Soveraign Princes, and to make it the Rule and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of their Government. Finding that there were many Sects of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers then in vogue, he ſearch'd
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47090:31"/>
into the foundation of all their principles and opinions; and not content with this diſquiſition, he trac'd them to their ſeveral foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. So that the <hi>Pythagorean, Epicurean, Stoick</hi> and <hi>Peripatetick</hi> Philoſophy were familiar to him. And tho it may be eaſily obſerv'd that he was chiefly inclin'd to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Plato</hi> (whoſe memory he ſo much reverenc'd, that Annually he celebrated his Birth-day, and alſo that of <hi>Socrates;)</hi> yet he modeſtly contain'd himſelf within the bounds of the latter Academy, and was content, like <hi>Cicero,</hi> only to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound and weigh opinions, leaving the Judgment of his Readers free without preſuming to decide Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically. Yet it is to be confeſs'd, that in the midſt of this moderation, he oppos'd the two extreams of the <hi>Epicurean</hi> and <hi>Stoick</hi> Sects: Both which he has judiciouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batted
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47090:32"/>
in ſeveral of his Treatiſes, and both upon the ſame account, becauſe they pretend too much to certainty, in their Dogma's; and to impoſe them with too great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance; which he, who (follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Academiſts,) doubted more and pretended leſs, was no way able to ſupport. The <hi>Pyrrhonians,</hi> or groſſer ſort of <hi>Scepticks,</hi> who bring all certainty in queſtion, and ſtartle even at the notions of Common ſenſe, appear'd as abſurd to him on the other ſide; for there is a kind of poſitiveneſs in granting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be more likely on one part than on another, which his Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy avoided by inclining the ballance to that hand, where the moſt weighty reaſons, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of truth were viſible. The Moral Philoſophy therefore was his chiefeſt aym; becauſe the principles of it admitted of leſs doubt; and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47090:32"/>
becauſe they were moſt conducing to the benefit of human life. For after the Example of <hi>Socrates</hi> he had found, that the ſpeculations of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Philoſophy, were more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful than ſolid and profitable; that they were abſtruce and thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and much of <hi>Sophiſm</hi> in the ſolution of appearances. That the Mathematicks indeed, cou'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his pains with many demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, but tho they made him wiſer, they made him not more vertuous, and therefore attain'd not the end of happineſs: For which reaſon tho he had far advanc'd in that ſtudy, yet he made it but his Recreation, not his buſineſs. Some Problem of it, was his uſual divertiſement at Supper, which he mingled alſo with pleaſant and more light diſcourſes. For he was no ſowr Philoſopher; but paſs'd his time as merrily as he cou'd,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47090:33"/>
with reference to vertue: He forgot not to be pleaſant while he inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and entertain'd his friends with ſo much chearfulneſs and good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, that his learning was not nauſeous to them; neither were they affraid of his Company ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time. He was not ſo Auſtere as to deſpiſe Riches, but being in poſſeſſion of a large Fortune, he liv'd tho not ſplendidly, yet plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; and ſuffer'd not his friends to want that part of his Eſtate, which he thought ſuperfluous to a Philoſopher.</p>
            <p>The Religion he profeſs'd, to ſpeak the worſe of it, was Heathen. I ſay the Religion he <hi>profeſs'd;</hi> for 'tis no way probable, that ſo great a Philoſopher, and ſo wiſe a Man, ſhould believe the Superſtitions and Fopperies of <hi>Paganiſm:</hi> But that he accommodated himſelf to the uſe and receiv'd Cuſtomes of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47090:33"/>
He was indeed a <hi>Prieſt of Apollo,</hi> as himſelf acknowledges, but that proves him not to have been a <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytheiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have ever thought, that the Wiſe-men in all Ages, have not much differ'd in their opinions of Religion; I mean as it is grounded on human Reaſon: For Reaſon, as as far as it is right, muſt be the ſame in all Men; and Truth being but one, they muſt conſequently think in the ſame Train. Thus it is not to be doubted, but the Religion of <hi>Socrates, Plato,</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> was not different in the main: Who doubtleſs beleiv'd the identity of one Supream Intellectual Being, which we call GOD. But becauſe they who have written the Life of <hi>Plutarch</hi> in other languages, are contented barely to aſſert that our Authour believ'd one God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out quoting thoſe paſſages of his
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47090:34"/>
which wou'd clear the point; I will give you two of them, amongſt many, in his <hi>Morals.</hi> The firſt is in his Book of the <hi>Ceſſation of Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles;</hi> where arguing againſt the <hi>Stoicks</hi> (in behalf of the <hi>Platoniſts,)</hi> who diſputed againſt the plurality of Worlds with this Argument; <hi>That if there were many Worlds, how then cou'd it come to paſs, that there was one only Fate, and one Providence to guide them all? (for it was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the</hi> Platoniſts <hi>that there was but one:) and why ſhould not many</hi> Jupiters <hi>or Gods be neceſſary, for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of many Worlds?</hi> To this <hi>Plutarch</hi> anſwers, <hi>That this their captious queſtion was but trifling: For where is the neceſſity of ſuppoſing many</hi> Jupiters, <hi>for this plurality of Worlds; when one excellent being, indued with mind and reaſon, ſuch as he is, whom we acknowledge to be the Father and Lord of all things, is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient</hi>

            </p>
            <p>That he was no Chriſtian is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt: Yet he is no where found to have ſpoken with contumely of our Religion, like the other Writers of his Age, and thoſe who ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:47090:35"/>
him. <hi>Theodoret</hi> ſays of him, <hi>that he had heard of our holy Goſpel; and inſerted many of our Sacred Myſteries in his Works,</hi> which we may eaſily believe, becauſe the Chriſtian Churches were then ſpread in <hi>Greece;</hi> and <hi>Pliny the younger</hi> was at the ſame time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant amongſt them in <hi>Aſia,</hi> tho that part of our Authors Workes is not now extant, from whence <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret</hi> might gather thoſe paſſages. But we need not wonder that a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher was not eaſie to embrace the divine Myſteries of our Faith. A modern God, as our <hi>Saviour</hi> was to him, was of hard digeſtion to a Man, who probably deſpis'd the vanities and fabulous Relations of all the old. Beſides a Crucfy'd Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of Mankind, a Doctrine at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted by illiterate Diſciples, the Author of it a <hi>Jew,</hi> whoſe Nation at that time was deſpicable, and his Doctrine but an innovation among
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:47090:36"/>
that deſpis'd people, to which the Learned of his own Country gave no credit, and which the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of his Nation puniſh'd with an ignominious death; the Scene of his Miracles acted in an obſcure Corner of the world; his being from Eternity, yet born in time, his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and Aſcenſion, theſe and many more particulars, might eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly choke the Faith of a Philoſopher, who believ'd no more than what he cou'd deduce from the principles of Nature; and that too with a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Academical aſſent, or rather an inclination to aſſent to probability: which he judg'd was wanting in this new Religion. Theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances conſider'd, tho they plead not an abſolute invincible ignor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in his behalf, yet they amount at leaſt to a degree of it; for either he thought them not worth weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or rejected them when
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47090:36"/>
weigh'd; and in both caſes he muſt of neceſſity be ignorant, becauſe he cou'd not know without Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and the Revelation was not to him. But leaving the Soul of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> with our Charitable wiſhes, to his Maker, we can only trace the reſt of his opinions in Religion from his Philoſophy: Which we have ſaid in the General to be <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonick;</hi> tho it cannot alſo be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, that there was a tincture in it of the <hi>Electick</hi> Sect, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun by <hi>Potamon</hi> under the Empire of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and which ſelected from all the other Sects, what ſeem'd moſt probable in their opinions, not adhering ſingularly to any of them, nor rejecting every thing. I will only touch his belief of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. In his two Treatiſes of Oracles, the one concerning the reaſon of their Ceſſation, the other enquiring why they were not given in verſe, as
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47090:37"/>
in former times; he ſeems to aſſert the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> Doctrine of Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migration of Souls. We have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſhewn, that he own'd the the Unity of a Godhead; whom according to his Attributes, he calls by ſeveral names, as <hi>Jupiter</hi> from his Almighty Power, <hi>Apollo</hi> from his Wiſdom, and ſo of the reſt; but under him he places thoſe beings whom he ſtyles <hi>Genii,</hi> or <hi>Daemons,</hi> of a middle nature, betwixt Divine and Human: for he thinks it abſur'd that there ſhou'd be no mean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two extreams, of an Immortal and a Mortal Being: That there cannot be in nature ſo vaſt a flaw, without ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medial kind of life, partaking of them both; as therefore we find the intercourſe betwixt the Soul and body, to be made by the Animal Spirits, ſo betwixt Divinity and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity there is this ſpecies of <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons:</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:47090:37"/>
Who, having firſt been Men, and following the ſtrict Rules of vertue had purg'd off the groſſneſs and faeculency of their earthly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are exalted into theſe <hi>Genii;</hi> and are from thence either rais'd higher into an Aetherial life, if they ſtill continue vertuous, or tumbled down again into Mortal Bodies, and ſinking into fleſh after they have loſt that purity, which conſtituted their glorious being. And this ſort of <hi>Genii,</hi> are thoſe, who, as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor imagines, preſided over Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles: Spirits which have ſo much of their terreſtrial principles remaining in them, as to be ſubject to paſſions and inclinations; uſually beneficent, ſometimes Malevolent to Mankind, according as they refine themſelves, or gather droſs, and are declining into Mortal Bodies. The Ceſſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or rather the decreaſe of Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, (for ſome of them were ſtill
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:47090:38"/>
remaing in <hi>Plutarchs</hi> time) he At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes either to the death of thoſe <hi>Daemons,</hi> as appears by the ſtory of the <hi>Egyptian Thamus,</hi> who was Commanded to declare that the great God <hi>Pan</hi> was dead, or to their forſaking of thoſe places, where they formerly gave out their Oracles; from whence they were driven by ſtronger <hi>Genii,</hi> into ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for a certain Revolution of Ages. Of this laſt nature, was the War of the Gyants againſt the Gods, the diſpoſſeſſion of <hi>Saturn</hi> by <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> the baniſhment of <hi>Apollo</hi> from Heaven, the fall of <hi>Vulcan,</hi> and many others; all which according to our Authours, were the battles of theſe <hi>Genii</hi> or <hi>Daemons</hi> amongſt themſelves. But ſuppoſing, as <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> evidently does, that theſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rits adminiſter'd, under the Supream Being, the affairs of Men, taking care of the vertuous, puniſhing the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47090:38"/>
bad; and ſometimes communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the beſt, as particularly the Genius of <hi>Socrates,</hi> always warn'd him of approaching dangers, and taught him to avoyd them.</p>
            <p>I cannot but wonder that every one, who has hitherto written <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarchs Life,</hi> and particularly <hi>Rualdus,</hi> the moſt knowing of them all, ſhould ſo confidently affirm that theſe Oracles, were given by bad Spirits according to <hi>Plutarch:</hi> As Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, indeed we may think them ſo; but that <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſo thought, is a moſt apparent falſhood: 'Tis enough to convince a reaſonable Man that our Author in his old age, (and that then he doted not, we may ſee by the Treatiſe he has written, that old Men ought to have the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of publick Affairs) I ſay that then he initiated himſelf, in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Rities of <hi>Delphos;</hi> and dyed, for ought we know, <hi>Apollo's Prieſt.</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:47090:39"/>
Now it is not to be imagin'd, that he thought the <hi>God</hi> he ſerv'd a <hi>Caco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemon,</hi> or as we call him a <hi>Devil.</hi> Nothing cou'd be farther from the opinion and practice of this holy Philoſopher than ſo groſs an impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The ſtory of the <hi>Pythias,</hi> or <hi>Prieſteſs of Apollo,</hi> which he relates immediately before the ending of that Treatiſe, concerning the Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Oracles, confirms my aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, rather then ſhakes it: For 'tis there deliver'd, <q>That going with great reluctation, into the Sacred place to be inſpir'd; ſhe came out, foaming at the mouth, her eyes gogling, her breaſt heaving, her voice undiſtinguiſhable, and ſhril, as if ſhe had an Earthquake within her, labouring for vent; and in ſhort, that thus tormented with the God, whom ſhe was not able to ſupport, ſhe died diſtracted in few dayes after. For he had ſayd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:47090:39"/>
that the Devinereſs ought to have no perturbations of mind, or impure paſſions at the time when ſhe was to conſult the Oracle, and if ſhe had, ſhe was no more fit to to be inſpir'd, than an inſtrument untun'd, to render an harmonious ſound:</q> And he gives us to ſuſpect, by what he ſays at the cloſe of this Relation, <q>That this <hi>Pythias</hi> had not liv'd Chaſtly for ſome time before it. So that her death appears more like a puniſhment inflicted for looſe living by ſome holy power, than the meer malignancy of a Spirit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted naturally in miſchief.</q> There is another obſervation which indeed comes nearer to their purpoſe, which I will digreſs ſo far, as to relate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſomewhat appertains to our own Country. <q>There are many Iſlands <hi>(ſays he)</hi> which lie ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about <hi>Britain,</hi> after the manner of our <hi>Sporades:</hi> They are unpeop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:47090:40"/>
and ſome of them are call'd the Iſlands of the Heroes, or the <hi>Genii.</hi>
               </q> One <hi>Demetrius</hi> was ſent by the Emperour, (who by computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the time muſt either be <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligula</hi> or <hi>Claudius)</hi> to diſcover thoſe parts, and arriving at one of the Iſlands next adjoyning to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd, which was inhabited by ſome few <hi>Britains,</hi> (but thoſe held Sacred and inviolable by all their Country-men,) immediatly after his arrival, the air grew black and troubled, ſtrange Apparitions were ſeen, the winds rais'd a Tempeſt, and fiery ſpouts or Whirlwinds ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd dancing towards the Earth. When theſe prodigies were ceas'd the Iſlanders inform'd him, that ſome one of the aerial Beings, ſuperior to our Nature, then ceas'd to live. For as a Taper while yet burning, affords a pleaſant harmleſs light, but is noyſome and offenſive when ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:47090:40"/>
ſo thoſe Hero's ſhine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignly on us, and do us good, but at their death turn all things topſie turvy, raiſe up tempeſts, and infect the air with peſtilential vapours. By thoſe holy and inviolable men, there is no queſtion but he means our <hi>Druydes,</hi> who were neareſt to the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> of any Sect; and this opinion of the <hi>Genii</hi> might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be one of theirs: Yet it proves not that all <hi>Daemons</hi> were thus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious; only thoſe who were to be Condemn'd hereafter into human bodies, for their miſdemeanours in their aerial Being. But 'tis time to leave a ſubject, ſo very fanciful, and ſo little reaſonable as this: I am apt to imagine the natural vapours, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing in the Cave where the Temple afterwards was Built, might work upon the Spirits of thoſe who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd the holy place, as they did on the Shaphard <hi>Coretas,</hi> who firſt found
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:47090:41"/>
it out by accident; and encline them to <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> and prophetick madneſs. That as the ſtrength of thoſe vapours diminiſh'd, (which were generally in Caverns as that of <hi>Mopſus,</hi> of <hi>Trophonius,</hi> and this of <hi>Delphos,)</hi> ſo the inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion decrea'd by the ſame mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: That they happen'd to be ſtronger, when they kill'd the <hi>Pythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> who being conſcious of this, was ſo unwilling to enter. That the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles ceas'd to be given in Verſe, when Poets ceas'd to be the Prieſts, and that the Genius of <hi>Socrates,</hi> (whom he confeſs'd never to have ſeen, but only to have heard in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and unperceiv'd by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,) was no more than the ſtrength of his imagination; or to ſpeak in the Language of a Chriſtian <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt,</hi> his Guardian Angel.</p>
            <p>I pretend not to an exactneſs of method in this Life, which I am
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:47090:41"/>
forc'd to collect by patches from ſeveral Authors; and therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much regard to the connection of times which are ſo uncertain.</p>
            <p>I will in the next place ſpeak of his Marriage. His Wifes name, her Parentage, and Dowry are no where mention'd by him, or any other, nor in what part of his age he Married: Tho 'tis probable, in the flower of it: But <hi>Rualdus</hi> has ingeniouſly gather'd from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing circumſtance, that ſhe was called <hi>Timoxena:</hi> Becauſe <hi>Plutarch</hi> in a Conſolatory Letter to her, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd by the Death of their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in her Infancy, uſes theſe words: <hi>Your</hi> Timoxena <hi>is depriv'd (by death) of ſmall enjoyments; for the things ſhe knew were of ſmall moment, and ſhe cou'd be delighted only with triffles.</hi> Now it appears by the Letter, that the Name of this Daughter was the ſame with her Mothers, therefore
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:47090:42"/>
it cou'd be no other than <hi>Timoxena.</hi> Her knowledge, her conjugal ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, her abhorrency from the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of her Sex, and from ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, her gravity in behaviour and her conſtancy in ſupporting the loſs of Children, are likewiſe Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated by our Author. No other wife of <hi>Plutarch</hi> is found mention'd; and therefore we may conclude he he had no more: By the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for which we Judge that he had no other Maſter than <hi>Ammonius,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis evident he was ſo grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in his nature, that he would have preſerv'd their Memory.</p>
            <p>The number of his Children was at leaſt five; ſo many being men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd by him. Four of them were Sons; of the other Sex only <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moxena,</hi> who died at two years old, as is manifeſt from the Epiſtle above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd. The French Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Amiot,</hi> from whom our old
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:47090:42"/>
Engliſh Tranſlation of the Lives was made, ſuppoſes him to have had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Daughter, where he ſpeaks of his Son-in-Law <hi>Crato.</hi> But the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which <hi>Plutarch</hi> there uſes, is of a larger ſignification; for it may as well be expounded Father-in-law, his Wifes Brother, or his Siſters Husband, as <hi>Budaeus</hi> notes: This I the rather mention, becauſe the ſame <hi>Amiot</hi> is task'd for an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of miſtakes, by his own Country-men of the preſent Age; which is enough to recommend this Tranſlation of our Authour into the Engliſh tongue, being not from any Copy, but from the <hi>Greek</hi> Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. Two other Sons of <hi>Plutarch</hi> were already deceas'd, before <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moxena.</hi> Hs eldeſt <hi>Autobulus,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in his <hi>Sympoſiaques,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whoſe Name is not Recorded. The youngeſt was called <hi>Charon,</hi> who alſo dyed in his Infancy: The
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:47090:43"/>
two remaining are ſuppos'd to have ſurviv'd him. The Name of one was <hi>Plutarch,</hi> after his own; and that of the other <hi>Lamprias,</hi> ſo call'd in memory of his Grand-father. This was he, of all his Children, who ſeems to have inherited his Fathers Philoſophy: And to him we owe the Table or Catalogue of <hi>Plutarchs</hi> Writings, and perhaps alſo the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegms.</hi> His Nephew, but whether by his Brother or Siſter remains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, was <hi>Sextus Chaeroneus,</hi> who was much honour'd by that learned Emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> and who taught him the <hi>Greek</hi> tongue, and the principles of Philoſophy: This Emperour profeſſing <hi>Stoiciſm,</hi> (as appears by his Writings,) inclines us to believe, that our <hi>Sextus Chae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneus,</hi> was of the <hi>Stoick</hi> Sect; and conſequently, that the World has generally been miſtaken, in ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him to have been the ſame man
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:47090:43"/>
with <hi>Sextus Empiricus</hi> the <hi>Sceptick;</hi> whom <hi>Suidas</hi> plainly tells us to have been an <hi>African:</hi> Now <hi>Empiricus</hi> cou'd not but be a <hi>Sceptick,</hi> for he oppoſes all Dogmatiſts, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly them. But I heard it firſt obſerv'd by an ingenious and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned old Gentleman lately deceaſ'd, that many of Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his ſeeming new opinions, are gather'd from thoſe which <hi>Sextus Empiricus</hi> expos'd. The Book is extant, and I refer the curious to it, not pretending to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, or to excuſe him. Some think the Famous Critick <hi>Longinus</hi> was of <hi>Plutarchs</hi> Family, deſcended from a Siſter of his; but the proofs are ſo weak, that I will not inſert them: They may both of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on their proper merits; and ſtand not in want of a Relation to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Tis needleſs to inſiſt on his behaviour in his Family: His Love to his Wife, his Indulgence to his
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:47090:44"/>
Children, his care of their Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are all manifeſt in that part of his Works which is call'd his Morals. Other parts of his diſpoſition have been touch'd already; as that he was courteous and humane to all Men; free from inconſtancy, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the deſire of revenge; which qualities of his, as they have been prais'd by the Authority of other Writers, may alſo be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended from his own Teſtimony of himſelf. <hi>I had rather,</hi> ſays he, <hi>be forgotten in the memory of Men, and that it ſhou'd be ſaid, there neither is, nor was a Man call'd</hi> Plutarch, <hi>then that they ſhould report, this</hi> Plutarch <hi>was unconſtant, changeable in his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, prone to anger and revenge on the leaſt occaſions.</hi> What he was to his Slaves you may believe from this, that in general he accuſes thoſe Maſters of extream hardneſs and injuſtice, who uſe Men like Oxen;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:47090:44"/>
ſell them in their age when they can drudge no longer. <hi>A Man</hi> ſays he, <hi>of a merciful diſpoſition, ought not to retrench the fodder from his Cattle, nor the provender from his Horſes when they can work no longer, but to cheriſh them when worn out and old.</hi> Yet <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,</hi> tho he knew how to moderate his anger, was not on the contrary, ſubject to an inſenſibility of wrongs; not ſo remiſs in exacting duty, or ſo tame in ſuffering the diſobedience of his Servants, that he cou'd not correct when they deſerv'd it: As is manifeſt from the following ſtory, which <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi> had from the mouth of <hi>Taurus</hi> the Philoſopher concerning him. Plutarch <hi>had a certain Slave, a ſaucy ſtubborn kind of fellow; in a word, one of thoſe pragmatical Servants, who never make a fault, but they give a reaſon for it; his juſtifications one time wou'd not ſerve his turn, but his Maſter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:47090:45"/>
               <hi>him to be ſtrip'd; and that the Law ſhould be laid on his back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. He no ſooner felt the ſmart, but he mutter'd that he was unjuſtly puniſh'd, and that he had done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to deſerve the Scourge. At laſt he began to bawl out lowder; and, leaving off his groaning, his ſighs and, his lamentations, to argue the matter with more ſhew of reaſon: And, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch a Maſter, he muſt needs have gain'd a ſmattering of learning, he cryd out that</hi> Plutarch <hi>was not the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher he pretended himſelf to be, That he had heard him waging War againſt all the paſſions; and maintaining that anger was unbecoming a wiſe Man: Nay, that he had written a particular Treatiſe, in commendation of Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. That therefore he contradicted his precepts by his practiſes, ſince aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning himſelf over to his Choler, he exercis'd ſuch inhumane cruelty on the body of his fellow Creature. How's</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:47090:45"/>
               <hi>this, (Mr. Varlet,)</hi> anſwered <hi>Plutarch, by what ſignes and tokens, can you prove I am in paſſion? Is it by my Countenance, my voice, the colour of my face, by my words, or by my geſtures, that you have diſcover'd this my fury? I am not of opinion, that my eyes ſparkle, that I foam at mouth, that I gnaſh my teeth, or that my voice is more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or that my colour is either more pale or more red than at other times; that I either ſhake or ſtamp with madneſs, that I ſay or do any thing unbecoming a Philoſopher: Theſe, if you know them not, are the Symptoms of a Man in rage: In the mean (tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the Officer who ſcourg'd him) while he and I diſpute this matter, mind you your buſineſs on his back.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His love to his Friends and his gratitude to his Benefactors are every where obſervable, in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications of his ſeveral Works, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:47090:46"/>
the particular Treatiſes he has writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to them on ſeveral occaſions, are all ſuitable either to the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters of the Men, or to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition, and the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances under which they were. His love to his Country, is from hence conſpicuous, that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes to have written the Life of <hi>Lucullus,</hi> and to have preſerv'd the memory of his actions, becauſe of the favours he conferr'd on the City of <hi>Chaeronea;</hi> which tho his Country receiv'd ſo long before, yet he thought it appertain'd to him to repay them, and took an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in their acknowledgment. As alſo that he vindicated the <hi>Baeotians</hi> from the calumnies of <hi>Herodotus</hi> the Hiſtorian in his Book concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the malignity of that Author. In which tis obſervable, that his zeal to his Country tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him too far; for <hi>Herodotus</hi>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:47090:46"/>
had ſaid no more of them, than what was generally held to be true in all Ages, concerning the groſſneſs of their wits, their voracity, and thoſe other national vices, which we have already noted on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; therefore <hi>Petrarch</hi> has accus'd our Authour of the ſame malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, for which he tax'd <hi>Herodotus:</hi> But they may both ſtand acquitted, on different accounts: <hi>Herodotus</hi> for having given a true Character of the <hi>Thebans,</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> for endeavouring to palliate the vices of a people from whom he was deſcended. The reſt of his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners without entering into parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, were unblameable, if we excuſe a little proneneſs to ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And regulating his actions by his dreams: But how far this will bear an accuſation I determine not, tho <hi>Tully</hi> has endeavour'd to ſhew the vanity of Dreams, in his
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:47090:47"/>
Treatiſe of <hi>Divinations,</hi> whether I refer the curious.</p>
            <p>On what occaſion he repair'd to <hi>Rome;</hi> at what time of his age he came thither; how long he dwelt there; how often he was there, and in what year he return'd to his own Country, are all uncertain: This we know, that when <hi>Nero</hi> was in <hi>Greece,</hi> which was in his eleventh and twelfth years, our Author was at <hi>Delphos,</hi> under <hi>Ammonius,</hi> his Maſter; as appears by the diſputation then manag'd, concerning the Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the two letters E. I. <hi>Nero</hi> not living long afterwards, 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt indiſputable that he came not to <hi>Rome</hi> in all his Reign. 'Tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable that he wou'd undertake the Voyage during the trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome times of <hi>Galba, Otho</hi> and <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellius;</hi> and we are not certain that he liv'd in <hi>Rome</hi> in the Empire of <hi>Veſpatian:</hi> Yet we may gueſs that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:47090:47"/>
the mildneſs of this Emperours Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, his fame and the vertues of his Son <hi>Titus</hi> aſſum'd into the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire afterwards by his Father, might induce <hi>Plutarch,</hi> amongſt other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, to take this Journy in his time. Tis argu'd from the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſtory, related by himſelf; that he was at <hi>Rome</hi> either in the joynt Reign of the two <hi>Veſpatians,</hi> or at leaſt in that of the ſurvivour <hi>Titus.</hi> He ſays then, in his laſt Book concerning <hi>Curioſity.</hi> 
               <q>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, or rather reading once, at <hi>Rome, Arulenus Ruſticus,</hi> the ſame Man whom afterwards <hi>Domitian</hi> put to death out of envy to his Glory, ſtood hearkning to me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt my Auditors: It ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, that a Souldier, having Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for him, from the Emperour,</q> (who was either <hi>Titus</hi> or his Father <hi>Veſpatian,</hi> as <hi>Rualdus</hi> thinks) <q>broke through the crowd, to deliver him
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:47090:48"/>
thoſe Letters from the Emperour. Obſerving this, I made a pauſe in my diſſertation, that <hi>Ruſticus</hi> might have the leiſure to read the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date which was ſent him; but he abſolutly refus'd to do it, neither wou'd he be intreated to break the Seals till I had wholly made an end of my Speech, and diſmiſs'd the Company.</q> Now I ſuppoſe the ſtreſs of the Argument, to prove that this Emperour was not <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> lies only in this clauſe <hi>(whom</hi> Domitian <hi>afterwards put to death:)</hi> but I think it rather leaves it doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, for they might be <hi>Domiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> Letters which he then receiv'd, and conſequently he might not come to <hi>Rome</hi> till the Reign of that Emperour. This <hi>Ruſticus</hi> was not only a learned but a good Man: He had been <hi>Tribune</hi> of the people under <hi>Nero,</hi> was <hi>Praetor</hi> in the time of <hi>Vitellius,</hi> and ſent Ambaſſadour
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:47090:48"/>
to the Forces, rais'd under the Name of <hi>Veſpatian,</hi> to perſwade them to a peace. What Offices he bore afterwards we know not, but the cauſe of his death, beſides the envy of <hi>Domitian</hi> to his fame, was a certain Book, or ſome Commentaries of his, wherein he had prais'd too much the Sanctity of <hi>Thraſea Paetus</hi> whom <hi>Nero</hi> had Murther'd: And the praiſe of a good Citizen was inſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Tyrant; being, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, exaſperated farther by ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections of <hi>Ruſticus,</hi> who could not commend <hi>Thraſea,</hi> but at the ſame time he muſt inveigh againſt the oppreſſour of the <hi>Roman</hi> Liberty. That <hi>Plutarch</hi> was Married in his own Country, and that before he came to <hi>Rome</hi> is probable; that the fame of him was come before him, by reaſon of ſome part of his works already publiſh'd, is alſo credible, becauſe he had ſo great reſort of the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:47090:49"/>
               <hi>Roman</hi> Nobility, to hear him read immediately, as we believe, upon his coming: That he was invited thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the correſpondence he had with <hi>Soſſius Senecio,</hi> might be one reaſon of his undertaking that Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, is almoſt undeniable. It like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe appears he was divers times at <hi>Rome;</hi> and perhaps, before he came to inhabit there, might make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with this worthy Man <hi>Senecio,</hi> to whom he Dedicated al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all theſe Lives of <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans.</hi> I ſay almoſt all, becauſe one of them, namely that of <hi>Aratus,</hi> is inſcrib'd in moſt expreſs words to <hi>Polycrates</hi> the <hi>Sicyonian</hi> the great Grand-Son of the ſaid <hi>Aratus.</hi> This worthy Patron and friend of <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch, Senecio,</hi> was four times Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul; the firſt time in the ſhort Reign of <hi>Cocceius Nerva,</hi> a vertuous and a learned Emperour; which opinion I rather follow than that of <hi>Aureli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:47090:49"/>
               <hi>Caſſicdorus,</hi> who puts back his Conſulſhip into the laſt of <hi>Domitian,</hi> becauſe it is not probable that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Tyrant ſhould exalt to that Dignity a Man of Vertue. This year falls in with the year of Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ninty nine.</p>
            <p>But the great inducement of our Authour to this journy was certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the deſire he had to lay in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials for his Roman Lives; that was the deſign which he had form'd early, and on which he had reſolv'd to build his fame. Accordingly we have obſerv'd that he had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd over <hi>Greece</hi> to peruſe the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chives of every City; that he might be able to write properly, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Lives of his <hi>Grecian Worthyes,</hi> but the Laws, the Cuſtoms, the Rites, and Ceremonies of every place. Which that he might treat with the ſame Maſtery of skill, when he came to draw his <hi>Parallels</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:47090:50"/>
of the <hi>Romans</hi> he took the invitation of his friends, and particularly of our <hi>Soſſius Senecio</hi> to viſit this Miſtreſs of the World, this impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial City of <hi>Rome;</hi> and, by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of many great and learned men then living, to ſearch the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the Capitol, and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries, which might furniſh him with inſtruments for ſo noble an undertaking. But that this may not ſeem to be my own bare opinion, or that of any modern Author, whom I follow, <hi>Plutarch</hi> himſelf has deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd it as his motive, in the life of <hi>Demoſthenes:</hi> The words are theſe, <q>Whoſoever deſigns to write an Hiſtory, (which tis impoſſible to form to any excellency from thofe materials, that are ready at hand, or to take from common report, while he ſits lazily at home in his own Study, but muſt of neceſſity be gather'd from Forreign obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations

and the ſcatter'd writings of various Authours) it concerns him to take up his Habitation in ſome renoun'd and populous City, where he may Command all ſorts of Books, and be acquainted alſo with ſuch particulars as have eſcap'd the pens of Writers, and are only extant in the memories of Men. Let him inquire diligently, and weigh judiciouſly, what he hears and reads, leſt he publiſh a lame Work, and be deſtitute of thoſe helps which are requir'd to its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</q> Tis then moſt probable, that he paſs'd his days at <hi>Rome,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in reading Philoſophy of all kinds, to the <hi>Roman</hi> Nobility, who frequented his Houſe, and heard him, as if there were ſomewhat more than humane in his words; and his nights (which were his only hours of private Study) in ſearching and examining Records,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:47090:51"/>
concerning <hi>Rome.</hi> Not but that he was intruſted alſo with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of publick affairs in the Empire, during his reſidence in the Metropolis: Which may be made out by what <hi>Suidas</hi> relates of him. <hi>Plutarch</hi> (ſays he) <hi>liv'd in the time of</hi> Trajan, <hi>and alſo before his Reign: That Emperour beſtow'd on him the Dignity of Conſul,</hi> (tho the <hi>Greek,</hi> I ſuppoſe, will bear, that he made him Conſul with himſelf, at leaſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd that honour on him:) <hi>An Edict was alſo made in favour of him, that the Magiſtrates or Officers of</hi> Illyria <hi>ſhould do nothing in that Province without the knowledge and approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of</hi> Plutarch. Now 'tis my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular gueſs (for I have not read it any where) that <hi>Plutarch</hi> had the affairs of <hi>Illyria</hi> (now call'd <hi>Scla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonia)</hi> recommended to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Trajan,</hi> we know, had Wars on that ſide the Empire with <hi>Decebalus</hi>

King of <hi>Dacia;</hi> after whoſe defeat and death, the Province of <hi>Illyria</hi> might ſtand in need of <hi>Plutarchs</hi> Wiſdom to compoſe and civilize it: But this is only hinted, as what poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly might be the reaſon of our Philoſophers ſuperintendency in thoſe quarters; which the <hi>French</hi> Author of his Life, ſeems to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at, as having no relation either to <hi>Chaeronea,</hi> or <hi>Greece.</hi>

            <p>When he was firſt made known to <hi>Trajan</hi> is like the reſt uncertain, or by what means, whether by <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necio,</hi> or any other, he was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to his acquaintance: But 'tis moſt likely, that <hi>Trajan</hi> then a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Man, was one of his Auditors, amongſt others of the Nobility of <hi>Rome.</hi> Tis alſo thought, this wiſe Emperour made uſe of him in all his Councils, and that the happineſs which attended him in his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, together with the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:47090:52"/>
of the Government, which in all his Reign was juſt and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, proceeded from the inſtructions which were given him by <hi>Plutarch. Johannes Sarisberienſis,</hi> who liv'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ſix hundred years ago, has tranſcrib'd a Letter written, as he ſuppos'd, by our Author to that Emperour; whence he had it is not known, nor the original in <hi>Greek</hi> to be produc'd; but it paſs'd for Genuine in that age, and if not <hi>Plutarchs,</hi> is at leaſt worthy of him, and what might well be ſuppos'd a Man of his Character would write; for which reaſon I have here Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated it.</p>

            <p>It may be conjectur'd, and with ſome ſhew of probability, from hence, that our Author not only collected his materials, but alſo made a rough draught of many of theſe parallel Lives at <hi>Rome;</hi> and that he read them to <hi>Trajan</hi> for his inſtruction in Government; and ſo
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:47090:53"/>
much the rather I believe it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all Hiſtorians agree, that this Emperour, tho naturally prudent and inclin'd to vertue, had more of the Souldier than the Scholar in his Education, before he had the happineſs to know <hi>Plutarch;</hi> for which reaſon the <hi>Roman</hi> Lives, and the inſpection into ancient Laws might be of neceſſary uſe to his direction. And now for the time of our Authors abode in the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial City, if he came ſo early as <hi>Veſpatian,</hi> and departed not till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Trajan</hi>'s death, as is generally thought, he might continue in <hi>Italy</hi> near forty years. This is more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, becauſe gather'd from himſelf, that his Lives were almoſt the lateſt of his Works; and therefore we may well conclude, that having model'd, but not finiſh'd them at <hi>Rome,</hi> he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards reſum'd the work in his own Country; which perfecting in his old
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:47090:54"/>
age, he dedicated to his friend <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necio</hi> ſtill living, as appears by what he has written, in the Proem to his Lives.</p>
            <p>The deſire of viſiting his own Country, ſo natural to all Men, and the approaches of old age, (for he could not be much leſs than ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,) and perhaps alſo the death of <hi>Trajan,</hi> prevail'd with him at laſt to leave <hi>Italy;</hi> or if you will have it in his own words, <hi>he was not willing his little City, ſhou'd be one the leſs by his abſence:</hi> After his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn he was, by the unanimous conſent of his Citizens, choſen <hi>Archon,</hi> or Chief Magiſtrate of <hi>Chaeronea;</hi> and not long after admitted himſelf in the number of <hi>Apollo's</hi> Prieſts; in both which employments he ſeems to have continued till his death: Of which we have no particular account, either as to the manner of it, or the year; only tis evident that he liv'd
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:47090:54"/>
to a great old age, always continuing his Studies; that he dyed a natural death, is only preſum'd, becauſe any violent accident to ſo famous a Man would have been recorded: And in whatſoever Reign he deceas'd, the days of Tyranny were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd, and there was then a Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>Series</hi> of Emperours, every one emulating his Predeceſſours ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>
            <p>Thus I have Collected from <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> himſelf, and from the <hi>beſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,</hi> what was moſt remarkable concerning him. In performing which I have labour'd under ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny uncertainties, that I have not been able to ſatisfie my own curioſity, any more than that of others. 'Tis the Life of a Philoſopher, not vary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with accidents to divert the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: More pleaſant for himſelf to live, than for an Hiſtorian, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe. Thoſe Works of his, which
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:47090:55"/>
are irrecoverably loſt, are nam'd in the Catalogue made by his Son <hi>Lamprias,</hi> which you will find in the <hi>Paris Edition,</hi> dedicated to <hi>King Lewis the thirteenth:</hi> But 'tis a ſmall comfort to a Merchant, to peruſe his bill of fraight, when he is certain his Ship is caſt away: Mov'd by the like reaſon I have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that ungrateful task: Yet that the Reader may not be impos'd on, in thoſe which yet remain, tis but reaſonable to let him know, that the Lives of <hi>Hannibal</hi> and <hi>Scipio,</hi> tho they paſs with the ignorant for Genuine, are only the Forgery of <hi>Donato Acciaiolo</hi> a <hi>Florentine.</hi> He pretends to have Tranſlated them from a <hi>Greek</hi> Manuſcript, which none of the Learned have ever ſeen, either before or ſince. But the cheat is more manifeſt from this reaſon which is undeniable, that <hi>Plutarch</hi> did indeed write the Life of <hi>Scipio,</hi> but he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:47090:55"/>
him not with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> but with <hi>Epaminondas:</hi> As appears by the Catalogue, or Nomenclature of <hi>Plutarchs Lifes,</hi> drawn up by his Son <hi>Lamprias,</hi> and yet extant. But to make this out more clearly, we find the <hi>Florentine,</hi> in his Life of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> thus relating, the famous Conference betwixt <hi>Scipio</hi> and him. <q>
                  <hi>Scipio</hi> at that time being ſent Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour from the <hi>Romans,</hi> to King <hi>Antiochus,</hi> with <hi>Publius Villius:</hi> It happen'd then, that theſe two great Captains met together at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and amongſt other diſcourſe, it was demanded of <hi>Hannibal</hi> by <hi>Scipio,</hi> whom he thought to have been the greateſt Captain? To whom he thus anſwer'd; In the firſt place <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> in the ſecond <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> of <hi>Epyrus,</hi> and in the third himſelf: To which, <hi>Scipio</hi> ſmileing thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reply'd; And what wou'd you have thought, had it been your fortune
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:47090:56"/>
to have vanquiſh'd me?</q> 
               <q>to whom <hi>Hannibal,</hi> I ſhould then have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judg'd the firſt place to my ſelf: Which anſwer was not a little plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to <hi>Scipio,</hi> becauſe by it, he found himſelf not diſeſteem'd, nor put into compariſon with the reſt, but by the delicacy and gallantry of a well turn'd compliment, ſet like a Man divine above them all.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now this relation is a meer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendium of the ſame conference, from <hi>Livy.</hi> But if we can conceive <hi>Plutarch</hi> to have written the Life of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> tis hard to believe, that he ſhould tell the ſame ſtory after ſo different, or rather ſo contrary a manner, in another place. For, in the life of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> he thus writes. <q>
                  <hi>Hannibal</hi> adjudg'd the praeeminence to <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> above all Captains, in conduct, and Military skill: Next to <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> he plac'd <hi>Scipio,</hi> and after <hi>Scipio,</hi> himſelf; as we have
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:47090:56"/>
declar'd in the Life of <hi>Scipio.</hi>
               </q> Tis not that I wou'd excuſe <hi>Plutarch,</hi> as if he never related the ſame thing diverſely; for 'tis evident, that through want of advertency he has been often guilty of that errour; of which the Reader will find too frequent Examples in theſe Lives; but in this place, he cannot be charg'd with want of memory or care, becauſe what he ſays here is relating to what he had ſaid for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly: So that he may miſtake the ſtory, as I believe he has done, (that other of <hi>Livy,</hi> being much more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,) but we muſt allow him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what he had before written. From hence I might take occaſion to note ſome other lapſes of our Author, which yet amount not to falſification of truth, much leſs to partiality, or envy, (both which are manifeſt in his Country-man <hi>Dion Caſſius</hi> who writ not long after him,) but are only
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:47090:57"/>
the frailties of humane nature; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes not intentional, but accidental. He was not altogether ſo well vers'd either in the <hi>Roman</hi> language, or in their coyns, or in the value of them; in ſome Cuſtomes, Rites, and Ceremonies, he took paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges on truſt from others, relating both to them and the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> which the Reader may particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find recited in the Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the often prais'd <hi>Rualdus</hi> on our Author. <hi>I</hi> will name but one to avoyd tediouſneſs, becauſe I particularly obſerv'd it, when I read <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the Library of <hi>Trinity Colledge in Cambridge,</hi> (to which foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation I gratefully acknowledge a great part of my Education;) 'tis that <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>Cicero,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Verres,</hi> who was accus'd by him, and repeating a miſerable jeaſt of <hi>Tullys,</hi> ſays that <hi>Verres,</hi> in the <hi>Roman</hi> language, ſignifies a barrow

But we have a better account of the ſignification from <hi>Varro,</hi> whom we have more reaſon to believe, that the Male of that kind, before he is cut, is called <hi>Verres;</hi> after cutting <hi>Majalis,</hi> which is perhaps a diminitive of <hi>Mas,</hi> tho generally the reaſon of the Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mology is given from its being a Sacrifice to the Goddeſs <hi>Maja.</hi> Yet any Man, who will candidly weigh this and the like errours, may excuſe <hi>Plutarch,</hi> as he wou'd a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, miſtaking the propriety of an Engliſh word: And beſides the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of this excuſe, 'tis impoſſible in nature, that a Man of ſo various learning, and ſo covetous of ingroſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all, ſhould perfectly digeſt ſuch an infinity of notions in many Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, ſince to be excellent in one is ſo great a labour.</p>

I ſhould take occaſion to write ſomewhat concerning Hiſtory it ſelf: But I think to commend it is unneceſſary: For the profit and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of that ſtudy are both ſo very obvious, that a quick Reader will be before hand with me, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine faſter than I can write. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that the poſt is taken up alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and few Authors have travell'd this way, but who have ſtrewed it with Rhetorick, as they paſs'd. For my own part, who muſt confeſs it to my ſhame, that I never read any thing but for pleaſure, it has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes been the moſt delightful En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of my life. But they who have employ'd the ſtudy of it as they ought, for their inſtruction, for the regulation of their private manners, and the management of publick affairs, muſt agree with me, that it is the moſt pleaſant School of Wiſdom.</p>

Tis a familiarity with paſt Ages, and an acquaintance with all the Heroes of them. 'Tis, if you will pardon the ſimilitude, a Proſpective-Glaſs carrying your Soul to a vaſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and taking in the fartheſt objects of Antiquity. It informs the underſtanding by the memory: It helps us to judge of what will happen, by ſhewing us the like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions of former times. For Mankind being the ſame in all ages, agitated by the ſame paſſions, and mov'd to action by the ſame inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, nothing can come to paſs, but ſome Preſident of the like nature has already been produc'd, ſo that having the cauſes before our eyes, we cannot eaſily be deceiv'd in the effects, if we have Judgment enough but to draw the parallel.</p>
            <p>God, tis true with his divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, over-rules and guides all actions to the ſecret end he has or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:47090:59"/>
them; but in the way of humane cauſes, a wiſe Man may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcern, that there is a natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection betwixt them; and tho he cannot foreſee accidents, or all things that poſſibly can come, he may apply examples, and by them foretell, that from the like Counſels will probably ſucceed the like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents: And thereby in all concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and all Offices of life, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the two main points, on which depend our happineſs, that is, what to avoid and what to chooſe. The Laws of Hiſtory in general are truth of matter, method, and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of expreſſion. The firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety is neceſſary to keep our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding from the impoſitions of falſhood: For Hiſtory is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fram'd from many particular examples, or inductions: If theſe Examples are not true, then thoſe meaſures of life, which we take from
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:47090:59"/>
them, will be falſe, and deceive us in their conſequence: The ſecond is grounded on the former, for if the method be confus'd: if the words or expreſſions of thought are any way obſcure, then the Idea's which we receive muſt be imperfect; and if ſuch, we are not taught by them what to elect, or what to ſhun. Truth therefore is requir'd, as the foundation of Hiſtory, to inform us; diſpoſition and perſpicuity, as the manner to inform us plainly: One is the being, the other the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being of it. Hiſtory is principally divided into theſe three ſpecies. <hi>Commentaries</hi> or <hi>Annals; Hiſtory</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called; and <hi>Biographia,</hi> or the Lives of particular Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Commentaries</hi> or <hi>Annals</hi> are (as I may ſo call them) naked Hiſtory: Or the plain relation of matter of fact, according to the ſucceſſion of time, deveſted of all other Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:47090:60"/>
The ſprings and motives of actions are not here ſought, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they offer themſelves, and are open to every Mans diſcernment. The method is the moſt natural that can be imagin'd, depending only on the obſervation of months and years, and drawing, in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of them, whatſoever happen'd worthy of Relation. The ſtile is eaſie, ſimple, unforc'd, and unadorn'd with the pomp of figures; Counſels, gueſſes, politick obſervations, ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Orations are avoyded: In few words a bare Narration is its buſineſs. Of this kind the <hi>Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Caeſar</hi> are certainly the moſt admirable; and after him the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals</hi> of <hi>Tacitus</hi> may have place. Nay even the Prince of <hi>Greek</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians, <hi>Thucydides,</hi> may almoſt be adopted into the number. For tho he inſtructs every where by Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, tho he gives the cauſes of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:47090:60"/>
actions, the Counſels of both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and makes Orations where they are neceſſary; yet it is certain, that he firſt deſign'd his work a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary; every year writing down like an unconcern'd ſpectator as he was, the particular occurrences of the time, in the order as they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, and his Eighth book is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly written after the way of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals; tho, out-living the War, he inſerted in his others thoſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, which render his work the moſt compleat, and moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive now extant.</p>
            <p>Hiſtory properly ſo call'd may be deſcrib'd by the addition of thoſe parts, which are not requir'd to <hi>Annals:</hi> And therefore there is little farther to be ſaid concerning it: Only that the dignity and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of ſtile is here neceſſary. That the gueſſes of ſecret cauſes, inducing to the actions, be drawn at leaſt
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:47090:61"/>
from the moſt probable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, not perverted by the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Author to ſiniſter inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations, (of which <hi>Tacitus</hi> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd;) but candidly laid down, and left to the Judgment of the Reader. That nothing of concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be omitted, but things of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial moment are ſtill to be neglected, as debaſing the Majeſty of the Work. That neither partiality or prejudice appear: But that truth may every where be Sacred, <hi>(ne quid falſi dicere audeat, ne quid veri non audeat Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoricus.)</hi> That he neither incline to ſuperſtition, in giving too much credit to Oracles, Prophecies, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinations, and Prodigies; nor to ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion, in diſclaiming the Almighty Providence: But where general opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on has prevail'd of any miraculous accident or portent, he ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it as ſuch, without impoſing his opinion on our belief. Next to <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydides</hi>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:47090:61"/>
in this kind, may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>Polybius</hi> amongſt the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians; Livy,</hi> tho not free from ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, nor <hi>Tacitus</hi> from ill na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, amongſt the <hi>Romans:</hi> Amongſt the modern <hi>Italians, Guicchiardine,</hi> and <hi>D'Avila,</hi> if not partial; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all Men in my opinion, the plain, ſincere, unaffected, and moſt inſtructive <hi>Philip de Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> amongſt the <hi>French;</hi> tho he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gives his Hiſtory the humble Name of <hi>Commentaries.</hi> I am ſorry I cannot find in our own Nation (tho it has produc'd ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable Hiſtorians) any proper to be ranked with theſe. <hi>Buchanan</hi> indeed for the purity of his Latin, and for his learning, and for all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther endowments belonging to an Hiſtorian, might be plac'd amongſt the greateſt, if he had not too much lean'd to prejudice, and too mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſty declar'd himſelf aparty of a
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:47090:62"/>
cauſe, rather than an Hiſtorian o it. Excepting only that, (which I deſire not to urge too far, on ſo great a Man, but only to give cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his Readers concerning it,) our Iſle may juſtly boaſt in him, a Writer comparable to any of the Moderns, and excell'd by few of the Ancients.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Biographia,</hi> or the Hiſtory of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Mens Lives, comes next to be conſider'd; which in dignity is inferiour to the other two; as being more confin'd in action, and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Wars and Counſels, and all other publick affairs of Nations, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they relate to him, whoſe Life is written, or as his fortunes have a particular dependance on them, or connection to them: All things here are circumſcrib'd, and driven to a point, ſo as to terminate in one: Conſequently if the action, or Counſel were manag'd by Collegues,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:47090:62"/>
ſome part of it muſt be either lame or wanting; except it be ſupply'd by the Excurſion of the Writer: Herein likewiſe muſt be leſs of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety for the ſame reaſon; becauſe the fortunes and actions of one Man are related, not thoſe of many. Thus the actions and atchievements of <hi>Sylla, Lucullus,</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> are all of them but the ſucceſſive parts of the <hi>Mithridatick War:</hi> Of which we cou'd have no perfect image, if the ſame hand had not given us the whole, tho at ſeveral views, in their particular Lives.</p>
            <p>Yet, tho we allow, for the reaſons above alledg'd, that this kind of writing is in dignity inferiour to <hi>Hiſtory</hi> and <hi>Annalls,</hi> in pleaſure and inſtruction it equals, or even ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells both of them. 'Tis not only commended by ancient practice, to celebrate the memory of great and worthy Men, as the beſt thanks
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:47090:63"/>
which Poſterity can pay them; but alſo the examples of vertue are of more vigor, when they are thus contracted into individuals. As the Sun beams, united in a burning-glaſs to a point, have greater, force than when they are darted from a plain ſuperficies; ſo the vertues and actions of one Man, drawn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into a ſingle ſtory, ſtrike upon our minds a ſtronger and more lively impreſſion, than the ſcatter'd Relations of many Men, and many actions; and by the ſame means that they give us pleaſure they afford us profit too. For when the underſtanding is intent and fix'd on a ſingle thing, it carries cloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer to the mark, every part of the object ſinks into it, and the Soul receives it unmixt and whole. For this reaſon <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> Commends the unity of action in a Poem; becauſe the mind is not capable of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:47090:63"/>
digeſting many things at once, nor of conceiving fully any more than one Idea at a time. Whatſoever diſtracts the pleaſure, leſſens it. And as the Reader is more concern'd at one Mans fortune, than thoſe of many; ſo likewiſe the Writer is more capable of making a perfect Work, if he confine himſelf to this narrow compaſs. The lineaments, features, and colourings of a ſingle picture may be hit exactly; but in a Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-piece of many figures, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral deſign, the ordinance or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of it, the Relation of one figure to another, the diverſity of the poſture, habits, ſhadowings, and all the other graces conſpiring to an uniformity, are of ſo difficult per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, that neither is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of particular perſons of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten perfect, nor the beauty of the piece compleat: For any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable errour in the parts, renders the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:47090:64"/>
whole diſagreeable and lame. Thus then the perfection of the Work, and the benefit ariſing from it are both more abſolute in <hi>Biography</hi> than in Hiſtory: All Hiſtory is only the precepts of Moral Philoſophy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd into Examples: <hi>Moral Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy</hi> is divided into two parts, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thicks</hi> and <hi>Politicks;</hi> the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs us in our private offices of vertue; the ſecond in thoſe which relate to the management of the Common-wealth. Both of theſe teach by Argumentation and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning: Which ruſh as it were into the mind, and poſſeſs it with violence: But Hiſtory rather allures than forces us to vertue. There is nothing of the Tyrant in Example; but it gently glides into us, is eaſie and pleaſant in its paſſage, and in one word reduces into practiſe, our ſpeculative notions. Therefore the more powerful the Examples are,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:47090:64"/>
they are the more uſeful alſo: And by being more known they are more powerful. Now unity, which is defin'd is in its own nature more apt to be underſtood, than mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity, which in ſome meaſure participates of infinity. The reaſon is <hi>Ariſtotles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Biographia,</hi> or the Hiſtories of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Lives, tho circumſcrib'd in the ſubject, is yet more extenſive in the ſtile than the other two: For it not only comprehends them both, but has ſomewhat ſuperadded, which neither of them have. The ſtile of it is various, according to the occaſion. There are proper places in it, for the plainneſs and nakedneſs of narration, which is aſcrib'd to Annals; there is alſo room reſerv'd for the loftineſs and gravity of general Hiſtory, when the actions related ſhall require that manner of expreſſion. But
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:47090:65"/>
there is withal, a deſcent into mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute circumſtances, and trivial paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of life, which are natural to this way of writing, and which the dignity of the other two will not admit. There you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted only into the rooms of ſtate; here you are led into the private Lodgings of the Heroe: you ſee him in his undreſs, and are made Familiar with his moſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate actions and converſations. You may behold a <hi>Scipio</hi> and a <hi>Lelius</hi> gathering Cockle-ſhells on the ſhore, <hi>Auguſtus</hi> playing at bounding ſtones with <hi>Boyes;</hi> and <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> riding on a Hobby-horſe among his Children. The Pageantry of Life is taken away; you ſee the poor rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Animal, as naked as ever nature made him; are made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his paſſions and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and find the <hi>Demy-God</hi> a <hi>Man. Plutarch</hi> himſelf, has more than
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:47090:65"/>
once defended this kind of Relating little paſſages. For in the Life of <hi>Alexander</hi> he ſays thus. <hi>In writing the Lives of Illuſtrious Men I am not tyed to the Laws of Hiſtory: Nor does it follow, that becauſe an action is great, it therefore manifeſts the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and vertue of him who did it; but on the other ſide ſometimes a word, or a caſual jeſt, betrays a Man more to our knowledge of him, than a Battel fought wherein ten thouſand Men were ſlain, or ſacking of Cities, or a courſe of Victories.</hi> In another place he quotes <hi>Xenophon</hi> on the like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: <q>The ſayings of great Men, in their familiar diſcourſes and amidſt their Wine, have ſomewhat in them, which is worthy to be tranſmitted to Poſterity.</q> Our Author therefore needs no excuſe, but rather deſerves a commendation, when he relates, as pleaſant, ſome ſayings of his <hi>Heroes,</hi> which appear, (I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:47090:66"/>
it) very cold and inſipid mirth to us. For 'tis not his meaning to commend the jeſt, but to paint the Man; beſides, we may have loſt ſomewhat of the Idiotiſm of that Language in which it was ſpoken; and where the conceit is couch'd in a ſingle word, if all the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of it are not critically under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, the grace and the pleaſantry are loſt. But in all parts of <hi>Bio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy,</hi> whether familiar or ſtately, whether ſublime, or low, whether ſerious or merry, <hi>Plutarch</hi> equally excell'd: If we compare him to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Dion Caſſius</hi> is not ſo ſincere, <hi>Herodian,</hi> a lover of truth, is often times deceiv'd himſelf, with what he had falſly heard reported; then the time of his Emperours exceeds not in all above ſixty years; ſo that his whole Hiſtory will ſcarce amount to three Lives of <hi>Plutarch. Suetonius</hi> and <hi>Tacitus</hi> may be call'd
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:47090:66"/>
alike, either Authors of Hiſtories, or Writers of Lives: But the firſt of them runs too willingly into obſcene deſcriptions, which he teaches while he relates; the other beſides what has already been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him, often falls into obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and both of them have made ſo unlucky a choice of times, that they are forc'd to deſcribe rather Monſters than Men; and their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours are either extravagant Fools, or Tyrants, and moſt uſually both. Our Author on the contrary, as he was more inclin'd to commend than to diſpraiſe, has generally cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen ſuch great Men as were famous for their ſeveral vertues; at leaſt ſuch whoſe frailties or vices were over-pois'd by their excellencies; ſuch from whoſe Examples we may have more to follow than to ſhun. Yet, as he was impartial, he diſguis'd not the faults of any Man. An
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:47090:67"/>
Example of which is in the Life of <hi>Lucullus;</hi> where, after he has told us, that the double benefit which his Country-men, the <hi>Chae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneans,</hi> receiv'd from him, was the chiefeſt motive which he had to write his Life, he afterwards rips up his Luxury, and ſhews how he loſt, through his miſ-management, his Authority, and his Souldiers love. Then he was more happy in his digreſſions than any we have nam'd. I have alwayes been pleas'd to ſee him, and his imitator, <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taign,</hi> when they ſtrike a little out of the common road: For we are ſure to be the better for their wandring.</p>
            <p>The beſt quarry lies not always in the open field: And who would not be content to follow a good Huntſman over Hedges and Dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches when he knows the Game will reward his pains? But if we mark him more narrowly, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:47090:67"/>
that the great reaſon of his frequent ſtarts, is the variety of his Learning: He knew ſo much of Nature, was ſo vaſtly furniſh'd with all the treaſures of the mind, that he was uneaſie to himſelf, and was forc'd, as I may ſay, to lay down ſome at every paſſage, and to ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his riches as he went: Like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Alexander</hi> or <hi>Adrian,</hi> he built a City, or planted a Colony in every part of his progreſs; and left behind him ſome memorial of his greatneſs. <hi>Sparta,</hi> and <hi>Thebes,</hi> and <hi>Athens,</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> the Miſtreſs of the World, he has diſcover'd in their foundations, their inſtitutions, their growth, their heigth, the decay of the three firſt, and the alteration of the laſt. You ſee thoſe ſeveral peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in their different laws, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies, and forms of Government, in their Warriours, and Senators, and Demagogues. Nor are the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:47090:68"/>
of Poetry, and the illuſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſimilitudes forgotten by him; in both which he inſtructs as well as pleaſes: Or rather pleaſes that he may inſtruct.</p>
            <p>This laſt reflection leads me na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, to ſay ſomewhat in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of his ſtile, tho after having juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prais'd him for copiouſneſs of learning, integrity, perſpicuity, and more than all this for a certain air of goodneſs which appears through all his Writings, it were unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be critical on his Elocution: As on a tree which bears excellent fruit, we conſider not the beauty of the bloſſoms: For if they are not pleaſant to the eye, or delightful to the ſcent, we know at the ſame time that they are not the prime intention of Nature, but are thruſt out in order to their product; ſo in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> whoſe buſineſs was not to pleaſe the ear, but to charm and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:47090:68"/>
to inſtruct the mind, we may eaſily forgive the cadences of words, and the roughneſs of expreſſion: Yet for manlineſs of Eloquence, if it abounded not in our Author, it was not wanting in him: He neither ſtudyed the ſublime ſtile, nor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the flowry. The choice of words, the numbers of periods, the turns of Sentences, and thoſe other Ornaments of ſpeech, he neither ſought, nor ſhun'd. But the depth of ſence, the accuracy of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the diſpoſition of the parts and contexture of the whole, in ſo admirable and vaſt a field of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and laſtly the copiouſneſs, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of words, appear ſhining in our Author. Tis indeed, obſerv'd of him, that he keeps not always to the ſtile of proſe, but if a Poetical word, which carries in it more of Emphaſis or ſignification, offer it ſelf at any time, he refuſes it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:47090:69"/>
               <hi>Homer</hi> or <hi>Eurypides</hi> have us'd it: But if this be a fault I know not how <hi>Xenophon</hi> will ſtand excus'd. Yet neither do I compare our Author with him, or with <hi>Herodotus</hi> in the ſweetneſs and graces of his ſtile, nor with <hi>Thuyidides</hi> in the ſolidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and cloſeneſs of expreſſion. For <hi>Herodotus</hi> is acknowledg'd the Prince of the <hi>Ionick,</hi> the other two of the <hi>Attick</hi> eloquence. As for <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,</hi> his ſtile is ſo particular, that there is none of the Ancients, to whom we can properly reſemble him. And the reaſon of this is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious; for being converſant in ſo great variety of Authors, and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting from all of them, what he thought moſt excellent, out of the confuſion, or rather mixture of all their ſtiles, he form'd his own, which partaking of each, was yet none of them; but a compound of them all, like the <hi>Corinthian</hi> metal, which had
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:47090:69"/>
in it Gold, and Braſs, and Silver, and yet was a ſpecies by its ſelf. Add to this, that in <hi>Plutarchs</hi> time, and long before it, the purity of the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue was corrupted, and the native ſplendour of it had taken the tarniſh of <hi>Barbariſm,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the filth and ſpots of dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating Ages. For the fall of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires always draws after it the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and Eloquence of the people: They, who labour under misfortunes or ſervitude, have little leiſure to cultivate their mother Tongue: To conclude, when <hi>Athens</hi> had loſt her Soveraignity to the <hi>Peloponneſians,</hi> and her liberty to <hi>Philip,</hi> neither a <hi>Thucydides,</hi> nor a <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> were afterwards produc'd by her.</p>
            <p>I have formerly acknowledg'd many lapſes of our Author, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd through his inadvertency, but he is likewiſe tax'd with faults, which reflect on his Judgment in matters
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:47090:70"/>
of fact, and his Candour in the compariſons of his <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> Both which are ſo well vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated by <hi>Montaign,</hi> that I need but barely to tranſlate him. <q>Firſt then he is accus'd of want of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in reporting things incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: For proof of which is alledg'd the ſtory he tells of the <hi>Spartan</hi> boy, who ſuffer'd his bowels to be torn out by a young Fox which he had ſtolen, chooſing rather to hide him under his Garment till he died, then to confeſs his robbery. In the firſt place this example is ill choſen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe tis difficult to ſet a bound to the force of our internal faculties, tis not defin'd how far our reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may carry us to ſuffer: The force of bodies may more eaſily be determin'd than that of Souls: Then of all people the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> by reaſon of their rigid inſtitution, were moſt harden'd to undergo labours,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:47090:70"/>
and to ſuffer pains. <hi>Cicero,</hi> before our Authors time, tho then the <hi>Spartan</hi> vertue was degenerated, yet avows to have ſeen himſelf ſome <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> boys, who to make tryal of their patience, were plac'd before the Altar of <hi>Diana,</hi> where they endur'd ſcourging, till they were all over bloody, and that not only without crying, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven without a ſigh or groan: Nay, and ſome of them ſo ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of this reputation, that they willingly reſign'd their Lives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hands of their tormentors. The ſame may be ſaid of another ſtory, which <hi>Plutarch</hi> vouches with an hundred witneſſes, that in the time of Sacrifice, a burning coal by chance, falling into the ſleeve of a <hi>Spartan</hi> boy, who held the Cenſer, he ſuffer'd his Arm to be ſcorch'd ſo long without moving it, that the ſcent of it reak'd up
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:47090:71"/>
to the Noſes of the Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>For my own part, who have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in ſo vaſt an Idea of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonian</hi> magnanimity, <hi>Plutarchs</hi> ſtory, is ſo far from ſeeming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible to me, that I neither think it wonderful nor uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: For we ought not to meaſure poſſibilities or impoſſibilities by our own ſtandard, that is, by what we our ſelves cou'd do or ſuffer. Theſe, and ſome other ſlight ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, are made uſe of, to leſſen the opinion of <hi>Plutarchs</hi> Judgment: But the common exception againſt his candor, is, that in his parallels of <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> he has done too much honour to his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in matching them with He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes, with whom they were not worthy to be compar'd. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this, there are produc'd the compariſons of <hi>Demoſthenes</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:47090:71"/>
and <hi>Cicero, Ariſtides</hi> and <hi>Cato, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander</hi> and <hi>Sylla, Pelopidas</hi> and <hi>Marcellus, Ageſilaus</hi> and <hi>Pompey:</hi> Now the ground of this accuſation is moſt probably the luſtre of thoſe <hi>Roman</hi> names, which ſtrikes on our imagination. For what proportion of glory is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a <hi>Roman Conſul,</hi> or <hi>Proconſul</hi> of ſo great a Common-wealth, and a <hi>ſimple Citizen</hi> of <hi>Athens?</hi> But he who conſiders the truth more near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and weighs not honours with honours, but Men with Men, which was <hi>Plutarchs</hi> main deſign, will find in the Ballance of their manners, their vertues, their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments and abilities, that <hi>Cicero</hi> and the <hi>Elder Cato,</hi> were far from having the overweight againſt <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> and <hi>Ariſtides.</hi> I might as well complain againſt him in behalf of his own Country-men: For neither was <hi>Camillus</hi> ſo famous
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:47090:72"/>
as <hi>Themiſtocles;</hi> nor were <hi>Tiberius</hi> and <hi>Cajus Gracchus</hi> comparable to <hi>Agis</hi> and <hi>Cleomenes</hi> in regard of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: Much leſs was the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Numa</hi> to be put in Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance againſt that of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> or the modeſty and temperance of <hi>Scipio,</hi> againſt the ſolid Philoſophy and perfect vertue of <hi>Epaminondas:</hi> Yet the diſparity of victories, the reputation, the blaze of Glory, in the two laſt were evidently on the <hi>Roman</hi> ſide. But as I ſaid before, to compare them this way, was the leaſt of <hi>Plutarchs</hi> aim; he openly declares againſt it: For ſpeaking of the courſe of <hi>Pompeys</hi> fortune, his exploits of War, the greatneſs of the Armies which he commanded, the ſplendour and number of his Triumphs, in his compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> I believe, ſays he, that if <hi>Xenophon</hi> were now alive, and would indulge himſelf
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:47090:72"/>
the liberty to write all he could to the advantage of his Heroe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſilaus,</hi> he would be aſham'd to put their acts in competition. In his compariſon of <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander;</hi> there is, ſays he, no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of equality, either in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their victories, or in the danger of their Battels; for <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander</hi> only gain'd two naval fights, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now this is far from partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the <hi>Grecians.</hi> He who wou'd convince him of this vice, muſt ſhew us in what particular Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he has been too favourable to his Countrymen, and make it out in general where he has faild in matching ſuch a <hi>Greek</hi> with ſuch a <hi>Roman;</hi> which muſt be done by ſhewing how he could have pair'd them better; and naming any other in whom the reſemblance might have been more perfect. But an equitable Judge who takes things
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:47090:73"/>
by the ſame handle which <hi>Plutarch</hi> did, will find there is no injury of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to either party, tho there be ſome diſparity betwixt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: For he weighs every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance by it ſelf, and judges ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately of it: Not comparing Men at a lump, nor endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to prove they were alike in all things, but allowing for diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of quality or fortune, ſhewing wherein they agreed or diſagreed, and wherein one was to be preferr'd before the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I thought I had anſwer'd all that cou'd reaſonably be objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Authors judgement; but caſually caſting my eye on the works of a French Gentleman, deſervedly famous for Wit and Criticiſm, I wonder'd, amongſt many commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> to find this one reflection. <q>As for his Compariſons,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:47090:73"/>
they ſeem truly to me very great; but I think he might have carried them yet farther, and have pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated more deeply into humane nature: There are folds and receſſes in our minds which have eſcap'd him; he judges man too much in groſs; and thinks him not ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, as he is often from himſelf: The ſame perſon being juſt, unjuſt, merciful, and cruel; which qualities ſeeming to bely each other in him, he Attributes their incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtences to forreign cauſes: Infine, if he had diſcrib'd <hi>Catiline,</hi> he wou'd have given him to us, either prodigal or Covetous: That <hi>alieni appetens ſui profuſus,</hi> was above his reach. He could never have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd thoſe contrarieties in the ſame ſubject, which <hi>Saluſt</hi> has ſo well unfolded, and which <hi>Montaign</hi> ſo much better underſtood.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Judgment, cou'd not have
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:47090:74"/>
proceeded, but from a man who has a nice taſte in Authors; and if it be not altogether juſt 'tis at leaſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, but I am confident, that if he pleaſe to conſider this following paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage taken out of the life of <hi>Sylla,</hi> he will moderate, if not retract his cenſure.</p>
            <p>
               <q>In the reſt of his manners he was unequal, irregular different from himſelf: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. He took many things by rapine, he gave more: Honour'd men immoderately, and us'd them contumeliouſly: was ſubmiſſive to thoſe of whom he ſtood in need, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting over thoſe who ſtood in need of him: So that it was doubtful, whether he were more form'd by nature to arrogance or flattery. As to his uncertain way of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he would ſometimes put men to death on the leaſt occaſion; at other times he would pardon the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:47090:74"/>
greateſt Crimes: So that judging him in the whole, you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude him to have been naturally cruel, and prone to vengeance, but that he could remit of his ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when his intereſts requir'd it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here methinks our Author ſeems to have ſufficiently underſtood the folds and doubles of <hi>Sylla's</hi> diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; for his Character is full of variety, and inconſiſtences. Yet in the concluſion, 'tis to be confeſs'd that <hi>Plutarch</hi> has aſſign'd him a bloody nature: The clemency was but artificial and aſſum'd, the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty was inborn: But this cannot be ſaid of his rapine, and his prodigali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for here the <hi>alieni appetens, ſui profuſus</hi> is as plainly deſcrib'd, as if <hi>Plutarch</hi> had borrow'd the ſenſe from <hi>Saluſt:</hi> And as he was a great Collector, perhaps he did. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:47090:75"/>
he judg'd rightly of <hi>Sylla,</hi> that naturally he was cruel: For that quality was predominant in him; and he was oftener revengeful than he was merciful. But this is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to vindicate our Authors Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from being ſuperficial, and I deſire not to preſs the Argument more ſtrongly againſt this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who has Honour'd our Country by his long Reſidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us.</p>
            <p>It ſeems to me, I muſt confeſs that our Author has not been more hardly treated by his Enemies, in his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring other Men, than he has been by his friends, in their comparing <hi>Seneca</hi> with him. And herein, even <hi>Montaign</hi> himſelf is ſcarcely to be defended. For no man more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd <hi>Plutarch,</hi> no man was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter acquainted with his excellences, yet this notwithſtanding, he has
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:47090:75"/>
done too great an honour to <hi>Seneca,</hi> by ranking him with our Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher and Hiſtorian, him, I ſay, who was ſo much leſs a <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> and no <hi>Hiſtorian:</hi> Tis a Reputation to <hi>Seneca,</hi> that any one has offer'd at the compariſon: The worth of his Adverſary makes his defeat advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious to him; and <hi>Plutarch</hi> might cry out with Juſtice; <hi>Qui cum victus erit, mecum certaſſe feretur.</hi> If I had been to find out a parallel for <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,</hi> I ſhould rather have pitch'd on <hi>Varro</hi> the moſt learned of the <hi>Romans,</hi> if at leaſt his Works had yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd; or with <hi>Pomponius Atticus,</hi> if he had written. But the likeneſs of <hi>Seneca</hi> is ſo little, that except the ones being Tutor to <hi>Nero,</hi> and the other to <hi>Trajan,</hi> both of them ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to <hi>Rome,</hi> yet rais'd to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt dignities in that City, and both Philoſophers tho of ſeveral Sects; (for
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:47090:76"/>
               <hi>Seneca</hi> was a <hi>Stoick, Plutarch</hi> a <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonician,</hi> at leaſt an Academick, that is, half <hi>Platoniſt</hi> half <hi>Sceptick:)</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſome ſuch faint reſemblances as theſe, <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſeem to have as little Relation to one another, as their native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Greece.</hi> If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them in their inclinations or humours, <hi>Plutarch</hi> was ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and pleaſant, <hi>Seneca</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, and melancholly. <hi>Plutarch</hi> a lover of converſation, and ſober feaſts: <hi>Seneca</hi> reſerv'd; uneaſie to himſelf when alone, to others when in Company. Compare them in their manners, <hi>Plutarch</hi> every where appears candid, <hi>Seneca</hi> often is cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious. <hi>Plutarch,</hi> out of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural humanity, is frequent in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending what he can; <hi>Seneca,</hi> out of the ſowrneſs of his temper, is prone to Satyr, and ſtill ſearching
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:47090:76"/>
for ſome occaſion to vent his gaul. <hi>Plutarch</hi> is pleas'd with an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of praiſing vertue; and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca,</hi> (to ſpeak the beſt of him,) is glad of a pretence to reprehend vice. <hi>Plutarch</hi> endeavours to teach others, but refuſes not to be taught himſelf; for he is always doubtful and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive: <hi>Seneca</hi> is altogether for teaching others, but ſo teaches them, that he impoſes his opinions; for he was of a Sect too im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious and dogmatical, either to be taught or contradicted. And yet <hi>Plutarch</hi> writes like a man of a confirm'd probity, <hi>Seneca</hi> like one of a weak and ſtaggering ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſeems to have van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd vice, and to have triumph'd over it: <hi>Seneca</hi> ſeems only to be combating and reſiſting, and that too but in his own defence. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Plutarch</hi> is eaſie in his diſcourſe,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:47090:77"/>
as one who has overcome the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty: <hi>Seneca</hi> is painful, as he who ſtill labours under it. <hi>Plutarchs</hi> Vertue is humble and civiliz'd: <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi>'s haughty and illbred. <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> allures you, <hi>Seneca</hi> commands you. One wou'd make Vertue your Companion, the other your Tyrant. The ſtyle of <hi>Plutarch</hi> is eaſie and flowing; that of <hi>Seneca</hi> preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitous and harſh. The firſt is even, the ſecond broken.

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:47090:77"/>
to have partaken of their ſtiles; for <hi>Plutarchs</hi> was equal, ſmooth, and of the ſame tenour: <hi>Seneca's</hi> was tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, unconſtant and full of revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The Life of <hi>Plutarch</hi> was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable, as the Reader cannot but have obſerv'd; and of all his Writings there is nothing to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as having the leaſt tendency to vice; but only that little Treatiſe, which is intituled <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, wherein he ſpeaks too broadly of a ſin, to which the Eaſtern and Southern parts of the World are moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious: But <hi>Seneca</hi> is ſaid to have been more libertine than ſuited with the gravity of a Philoſopher, or with the auſterity of a <hi>Stoick.</hi> An ingenious <hi>Frenchman,</hi> eſteems as he tells us, his perſon rather than his works; and values him more as the <hi>Praeceptor</hi> of <hi>Nero,</hi> a Man ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of the Empire, and as the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:47090:78"/>
of <hi>Agrippina,</hi> than as a teacher of Morality. For my part I dare not puſh the commendation ſo far: His courage was perhas praiſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, if he endeavour'd to deliver <hi>Rome</hi> from ſuch a Monſter of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, as <hi>Nero</hi> was then beginning to appear: His ambition too was the more excuſable, if he found in himſelf an ability of governing the World, and a deſire of doing good to human kind: But as to his good fortunes with the Empreſs, I know not what value ought to be ſet on a wiſe Man for them. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be that Women generally liking without Judgment, it was a Conqueſt for a Philoſopher once in an age, to get the better of a fool. However methinks there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of aukward in the adventure: I cannot imagine without laughter, a <hi>Pedant,</hi> and a <hi>Stoick,</hi> making
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:47090:78"/>
love in a long gown; for it puts me in mind of the civilities which are us'd by the Cardinals and Judges in the dance of the Rehearſal: If <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippina</hi> wou'd needs be ſo laviſh of her favours, ſince a Sot grewn au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeous to her, becauſe he was her Husband, and nothing under a Wit, cou'd attone for <hi>Claudius,</hi> I am half ſorry that <hi>Petronius</hi> was not the Man: We cou'd have born it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from his Character, than from one who profeſs'd the ſeverity of vertue, to make a Cuckold of his Emperour and Benefactour. But let the Hiſtorian anſwer for his own Relation: Only, if true, 'tis ſo much the worſe, that <hi>Seneca,</hi> after having abus'd his bed, cou'd not let him ſleep quiet in his grave. The <hi>Apocolocynthiſis,</hi> or mock deification of <hi>Claudius</hi> was too ſharp and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting on his memory: And <hi>Seneca</hi>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:47090:79"/>
tho he could Preach forgiveneſs to others, did not practice it himſelf in that Satyr: Where was the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and inſenſibility of a <hi>Stoick,</hi> in revenging his Baniſhment with a Libel? Where was the Morality of a Philoſopher, in defaming and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of an harmleſs fool? And where was common humanity, in railing againſt the dead? But the tallent of his malice is viſible in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places: He cenſures <hi>Mecenas,</hi> and I believe juſtly, for the looſeneſs of his manners, the voluptuouſneſs of his life, and the effeminacy of his ſtyle; but it appears that he takes pleaſure in ſo doing; and that he never forc'd his nature, when he ſpoke ill of any Man. For his own ſtile, we ſee what it is, and if we may be as bold with him, as he has been with our old Patron, we may call it a ſhatter'd Eloquence,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:47090:79"/>
not vigorous, not united, not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied; but broken into fragments; every part by it ſelf pompous, but the whole confus'd and unhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious. His Latin, as <hi>Monſieur St. Evremont</hi> has well obſerv'd, has nothing in it of the purity, and elegance of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his times; and 'tis of him and of his imitators, that <hi>Petronius</hi> ſaid; <hi>pace veſtrâ liceat dixiſſe, primi omnium eloquentiam perdidiſtis.</hi> The <hi>Controverſiae ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiis vibrantibus pictae,</hi> and the <hi>vanus Sententiarum ſtrepitus,</hi> make it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that <hi>Seneca</hi> was tax'd under the perſon of the old Rhetorician. What quarrel he had to the Unckle and the Nephew, I mean <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Lucan,</hi> is not known; but <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronius</hi> plainly points them out; one for a bad Orator, the other for as bad a Poet: His own eſſay of the Civil War is an open defiance
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:47090:80"/>
of the <hi>Pharſalia;</hi> and the firſt O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>Eumolpus,</hi> as full an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment of <hi>Seneca's</hi> falſe Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. After all that has been ſaid, he is certainly to be allowed a great wit, but not a good Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher: Not fit to be compar'd with <hi>Cicero,</hi> of whoſe reputation he was emulous, any more than <hi>Lucan</hi> is with <hi>Virgil:</hi> To ſum up all in few words, conſider a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher declaiming againſt riches, yet vaſtly rich himſelf; againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice, yet puting out his Mony at great Extortion here in <hi>Britain;</hi> againſt honours, yet aiming to be Emperour; againſt pleaſure, yet enjoying <hi>Agrippina,</hi> and in his old age married to a beautiful young Woman: And after this, let him be made a <hi>Parallel to Plutarch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, with the uſual vanity of <hi>Dutch</hi> Prefacers, I could load
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:47090:80"/>
our Author with the praiſes and commemorations of Writers: For both Ancient and Modern have made Honourable mention of him. But to cumber pages with this kind of ſtuff were to raiſe a diſtruſt in common Readers that <hi>Plutarch</hi> wants them. <hi>Rualdus</hi> indeed has Collected ample Teſtimonies of them; but I will only recite the names of ſome, and refer you to him for the particular quotations. He reckons <hi>Gellius, Euſebius, Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merius</hi> the Sophiſter, <hi>Eunapius, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillus</hi> of <hi>Alexandria, Theodoret, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gathias, Photius</hi> and <hi>Xiphilin</hi> Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs of <hi>Conſtantinople, Johannes Sarisberienſis,</hi> the famous <hi>Petrarch, Petrus Victorius,</hi> and <hi>Juſtus Lipſius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Theodorus Gaza,</hi> a Man lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Latin Tongue, and a great reſtorer of the <hi>Greek,</hi> who liv'd above two hundred years ago,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:47090:81"/>

            <p>With this mind and theſe thoughts he ſet forward, with a deſign to doe injury to no body, but to repel and revenge himſelf of all thoſe that ſhou'd offer any.

               </note> perſwaded him to poiſon <hi>Theſeus</hi> at a Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet to be prepar'd for him as a civility to a Stranger.

            <p>From hence they ſay is deriv'd the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom among the Palleneans to have no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages or any alliance with the people of <hi>Agnus,</hi> nor to ſuffer their Cryers to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce in their Proclamations theſe words, ſolemnly us'd in all other parts of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Now <hi>Theſeus,</hi> longing to be in action, and withall deſirous to make himſelf popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, left <hi>Athens</hi> to fight with the Bull of <hi>Marathon;</hi> which did no ſmall miſchief to <note place="margin">

               </note> the inhabitants of <hi>Tetrapolis.</hi> And having overcome it, he brought it alive in triumph through the City, and afterwards ſacrific'd it to <hi>Apollo.</hi> And as to what concerns <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cale</hi> and the ſtory of her receiving and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining <hi>Theſeus</hi> in this expedition, it ſeems to be not altogether void of truth; for from hence the people round about, meeting upon a certain day, offer'd a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, which they call'd <hi>Hecaleſium,</hi> to <hi>Jupiter Hecalion,</hi> in honour of <hi>Hecale,</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:47090:92"/>
whom, by a diminutive name, they call'd <hi>Hecalene,</hi> becauſe ſhe, (as the cuſtom of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient people is,) ſhew'd her affection to <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus</hi> by ſuch diminutive names: and having made a vow to <hi>Jupiter</hi> for him as he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the fight, that if he return'd in ſafety, ſhe wou'd offer Sacrifices in thanks of it, and dying before he came back, ſhe receiv'd this return of her hoſpitality by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Theſeus,</hi> as <hi>Philochorus</hi> relates the ſtory.</p>
            <p>Not long after arrived the third time from <hi>Crete</hi> the collectours of the Tribute which the Athenians paid 'em upon the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing occaſion. <hi>Androgeus</hi> having been trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly <note place="margin">

But being told by the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, that if they appeas'd and reconcil'd <hi>Minos,</hi> the anger of the Gods wou'd ceaſe, and they ſhou'd enjoy reſt from the miſeries they labour'd under; they ſent Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, and, with much ſupplication, were at laſt reconcil'd, having entred into an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement to ſend to <hi>Crete</hi> the ſpace of nine years a Tribute of ſeven young Men and as many Virgins, as the general Writers agree;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47090:92"/>
and the moſt tragical ſtory that goes about concerning this matter ſays, that the <hi>Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taure</hi> deſtroy'd them, or that they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring in the Labyrinth, and finding no poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible means of getting out, miſerably ended their lives there. And that this <hi>Minotaure</hi> was (as <hi>Euripides</hi> hath it)
<q>
                  <l>A mingled form, where two ſtrange ſhapes combin'd;</l>
                  <l>And different Natures, Bull and Man were joyn'd.</l>
               </q>
But <hi>Philochorus</hi> writes that the Cretans will by no means allow the truth of this, but ſay that the Labyrinth was onely an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47090:93"/>
of an opinion that theſe youth were not ſlain by <hi>Minos,</hi> but that they ſpent the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of their days in ſlavery at <hi>Crete;</hi> and that the Cretans, to acquit themſelves <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Cretans Offering to</hi> Apollo.</note> of an ancient Vow which they had made, were us'd to ſend an Offering of the firſt fruits of their Men to <hi>Apollo</hi> of <hi>Delphos,</hi> and that ſome deſcendants of theſe Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Slaves were mingled with 'em and ſent amongſt 'em; and of theſe they that were not able to get their living there remov'd from thence, firſt into <hi>Italy,</hi> and inhabited the Country round about <hi>Japygia;</hi> from thence again that they remov'd to <hi>Thrace</hi> and were nam'd Bottieans, and that this is the reaſon why in a certain Sacrifice the Bottiean Women ſing a Hymn beginning thus <hi>Let us go to Athens.</hi> And from this that it appear'd how dangerous it was to incurr the hatred of a City that was Miſtreſs of Eloquence and a Muſe. For <hi>Minos</hi> was always ill ſpoken of, and repreſented ever as a very ill man upon the Athenian Stages, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did <hi>Heſiod</hi> at all help him when he calls him <hi>The moſt Royal Minos,</hi> nor <hi>Homer</hi> when he ſtyles him <hi>The Companion of Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> But the Tragedians prevailing made him alway appear from the Stage as a cruel and inhumane Prince. But that really <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos</hi> was a very good King and Law-giver, and that <hi>Rhadamanthus</hi> was a Judge under
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47090:93"/>
him and a preſerver of the Statutes that he ordain'd.</p>
            <p>Now when the time of the third Tribute was come, and that the Fathers who had any young men for their Sons were to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by lot to the choice of thoſe that were to be ſent, there aroſe freſh diſcontents and accuſations againſt <hi>Aegeus</hi> among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who were full of grief and indignation, that he, who was the cauſe of all their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, was the onely perſon exempt from the puniſhment; but ſettling his Kingdom up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Baſtard and a foreign Son, took no notice of them whom he left deſtitute and without Children. Theſe things very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly <note place="margin">Theſeus <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers himſelf voluntarily to be ſent to</hi> Crete.</note> affected <hi>Theſeus,</hi> who thinking it but juſt not to avoid, but rather partake of, the ſufferings of his fellow Citizens, offer'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for one without any lot; all the reſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring him for the greatneſs of his Spirit and loving him for his care of the publick: and <hi>Aegeus,</hi> after all his prayer and intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, finding him inflexible and not to be perſwaded, proceeded to the chooſing of the reſt by lot. But <hi>Helanicus</hi> writes that the Athenians did not ſend the young Men and Virgins as they were choſen by lot, but that <hi>Minos</hi> himſelf coming thither made his own choice, and that he pitch'd upon <hi>Theſeus</hi> before all others, upon conditions agreed between 'em, that the Athenians
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47090:94"/>
ſhou'd furniſh 'em with a Ship, and that the young men that were to ſail with him ſhou'd carry no weapon of War; but that if the <hi>Minotaure</hi> was deſtroy'd, this Tribute ſhou'd ceaſe.</p>
            <p>The two former times of the payment of the Tribute there appearing no hopes of ſafety or return, they ſent forth the Ship with a black Sail, as to unavoidable deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but now <hi>Theſeus</hi> encouraging his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſpeaking greatly of himſelf, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that he ſhou'd kill the <hi>Minotaure,</hi> he gave the Pilot another Sail which was White, commanding him as he return'd, if <hi>Theſeus</hi> eſcap'd, to make uſe of that, but if not to ſail with the Black one, and to hang out that ſign of his misfortune and ſorrow. But <hi>Simonides</hi> ſays that the Sail which <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geus</hi> deliver'd to the Pilot was not White but Purple dyed in Grain, with the Flower of a certain Tree, commanding him to <note place="margin">

taking along with him <hi>Ariadne</hi> and the young Athenian Captives. <hi>Pherecydes</hi> adds that he bored holes in the Keels of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Ships to hinder their purſuit.

               </note> the envy of all <hi>Crete.</hi> For his power grew grievous and inſupportable by reaſon of the inſolence of his manners, and beſides he had been accus'd of two near a familiarity with <hi>Paſiphae</hi> the Queen: Which was the reaſon that, when <hi>Theſeus</hi> deſir'd the Combat, <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos</hi> ſo eaſily comply'd.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47090:95"/>
remitted the Tribute to the Athenians. But <hi>Clidemus</hi> gives an account of theſe things peculiar to himſelf, very prolix and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a great way off. That it was a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree conſented to by all <hi>Greece,</hi> that no Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel from any place containing above five perſons ſhould be permitted to ſail, <hi>Jaſon</hi> onely excepted, who was made Captain of the great Ship <hi>Argo</hi> to ſail about and ſcour the Sea of Pyrates.

by his Grandfather <hi>Pittheus</hi>'s permiſſion, he caus'd to be built and fitted out at <hi>Troe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zene,</hi> that ſo his deſign might be carried on with the greateſt ſecrecy. As ſoon as ever his Fleet was in readineſs he ſet ſail, and none of the Cretans having any knowledge of his coming, but imagining, when they ſaw his Fleet, that they were Friends, and Veſſels of their own, he ſoon made himſelf maſter of the Haven, and immediately ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a deſcent farther into the Iſland, and having with him <hi>Daedalus</hi> and the other Fugitives for his Guides, he arriv'd at <hi>Cnoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi>

But all that the Poets have ſung of theſe matters, or that Fables have made more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous than ordinary, every body (as I may ſay) hath it in his mouth. But <hi>Paeon</hi> the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47090:97"/>
Amathuſian, has ſet forth a different rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe things that has ſomewhat pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar in it. For he writes that <hi>Theſeus,</hi> being driven by a Storm upon the Iſle of <hi>Cypros,</hi> and having aboard with him <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adne,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ariadne <hi>left in</hi> Cypros.</note> big with Child, and extremely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compos'd with the rowling of the Sea, ſet her on Shore, and left her there alone in that weak condition, to return to and help the Ship, where, on a ſudden, by a violent Wind, he was again forc'd out to Sea. That the Women of the Iſland receiv'd <hi>Ariadne</hi> very kindly, and adminiſtred all manner of comfort to her, that was extremely afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and almoſt dead with grief for being left behind. That they counterfeited kind Letters and deliver'd them to her, as ſent from <hi>Theſeus,</hi> and, when ſhe fell in Labour, were very diligent in performing to her all the offices that belong to Women. But that ſhe dy'd in Child-bed before ſhe could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd, <note place="margin">Her death.</note> and was by them honourably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terr'd. That ſoon after <hi>Theſeus</hi> return'd, and was greatly afflicted for her loſs, and at his departure left a conſiderable ſum of money among thoſe of the Iſland, ordering them to ſacrifice and pay divine honour to <hi>Ariadne;</hi> and cauſed two little Images to be made and dedicated to her, one of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and the other of Braſs. Moreover that on the ſecond day of <hi>September,</hi> which is
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47090:97"/>
ſacred to <hi>Ariadne,</hi> they have this Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <note place="margin">A Ceremony inſtituted in memory of Her.</note> among their Sacrifices, to have a youth lye in, and with his voice and geſture coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit all the pains of a Woman in Travail; and that the Amathuſians call the Grove in which they ſhew her Tomb the Grove of <hi>Venus Ariadne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Different yet from this account ſome of the Naxians write, that there were two <hi>Minos</hi>'s and two <hi>Ariadne</hi>'s, one of which, they ſay, was married to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Naxos,</hi> and bore a Son nam'd <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylus.</hi> But that the other, of a later age, was raviſhed by <hi>Theſeus,</hi> and being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards deſerted by him, retir'd to <hi>Naxos,</hi> with her Nurſe <hi>Corcyna,</hi> whoſe Grave they yet ſhew. That this <hi>Ariadne</hi> alſo dy'd there, and was worſhip'd by the Iſland, but in a different manner from the former; for her day is celebrated with Feaſts, and Revels and an univerſal Joy: but all the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices perform'd to the latter are mingled with ſorrow and mourning.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Theſeus,</hi> in his return from <hi>Crete,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Theſeus <hi>his return from</hi> Crete.</note> put in at <hi>Delos,</hi> and having ſacrific'd to the God of the Iſland, and dedicated to the Temple the Image of <hi>Venus,</hi> which <hi>Ariad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi> had given him, he danc'd with the young Athenians a Dance, that, in memory of him, is ſtill preſerv'd among the Inhabitants of <hi>Delos,</hi> which in a certain order had turnings
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47090:98"/>
and returnings that imitated the intricate windings of the Labyrinth. And this Dance, as <hi>Dicaearchus</hi> writes, is call'd among the Delians, The Crane. This he danc'd round the Ceratonian Altar, ſo call'd from its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compacted together and adorn'd onely with Horns taken from the left ſide of the Head. They ſay alſo that he inſtituted Games in <hi>Delos,</hi> where he was the firſt that began the cuſtom of giving a Palm to the Victors.</p>
            <p>When they were come near the coaſt of <hi>Attica,</hi> ſo great was the joy for the happy ſucceſs of their Voyage that, neither <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus</hi>

                  <hi>His and his Pilots for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to</hi> Aegeus.</note> himſelf, nor the Pilot, remembred to hang out the Sail which ſhould have been the token of their ſafety to <hi>Aegeus,</hi> who, knowing nothing of their ſucceſs, for grief threw himſelf headlong from a Rock and periſh'd in the Sea. But <hi>Theſeus</hi> being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd at the Port of <hi>Phalera,</hi> paid there the ſacrifices which he had vow'd to the Gods at his ſetting out to Sea, and ſent a Herald to the City to carry the news of his ſafe return. At his entrance into the City the Herald found the people for the moſt part full of grief for the loſs of their King, others, as may be well believ'd, as full of joy for the meſſage that he brought, and wholly bent to make much of him and crown him with Garlands for ſo acceptable news;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47090:98"/>
which he indeed accepted of, but hung them upon his Heralds ſtaff; and thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to the Sea ſide before <hi>Theſeus</hi> had finiſh'd his libation to the Gods, he ſtay'd without, for fear of diſturbing the holy Rites; but as ſoon as the Sacrifice was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he entred and related the whole ſtory of the King's Death: upon the hearing of which, with great lamentations and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed tumult of grief they ran with all haſte to the City. And from hence, they ſay, it comes that at this day, in the Feaſt <hi>Oſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoria</hi> the Herald is not crown'd but his ſtaff, and that the People then preſent ſtill break out at the Sacrifice into this ſhout, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>
               <hi>Theſeus,</hi> after the Funeral of his Father, paid his Vows to <hi>Apollo</hi> the ſeventh day of <hi>October;</hi> for on that day the Youth that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd with him ſafe from <hi>Crete</hi> made their entry into the City. They ſay alſo that the cuſtom of boyling Pulſe at this Feaſt is deriv'd from hence, becauſe the young men that eſcap'd, put all that was left of their proviſion together, and boiling it in one common Pot feaſted themſelves with it, and with great rejoycing did eat all together.

Although ſome hold opinion that this Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony is retain'd in memory of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclidae,</hi> who were thus entertain'd and brought up by the Athenians.

Ship became a ſtanding Example among the Philoſophers, when-ever they diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted about things that encreaſe, one ſide holding, That the Ship remain'd the ſame, and the other as fiercely contending that it was not the ſame.</p>
            <p>The Feaſt call'd <hi>Oſcophoria,</hi> or the Feaſt of <hi>Boughs,</hi> which to this day the <hi>Athenians</hi> celebrate, was then firſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by <hi>Theſeus.</hi> For he took not with him the full number of Virgins, which by lot were to be carri'd away, but ſele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted two Youths, with whom he had an intimate familiarity, of fair and woman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh faces, but of a manly and forward ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and having by frequent Baths, and avoiding the heat and ſcorching of the Sun, with a conſtant uſe of all the Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Waſhes, and Dreſſes, that ſerve to the adorning of the Head, or ſmoothing the Skin, or improving the Complexion, in a manner chang'd them from what they were before, and having taught them further to counterfeit the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry voice, and carriage, and gate of Virgins, ſo that there could not be the leaſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence perceiv'd, he undiſcover'd by any, put them into the number of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Maids deſign'd for <hi>Crete.</hi> At his return he and theſe two Youths led up a ſolemn Proceſſion, with Boughs and Vine-bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches

The reſt fearing his Power, which was already grown very formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and knowing his courage and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:47090:101"/>
choſe rather to be perſwaded than forc'd into a Compliance. He then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd all the diſtinct Courts of Juſtice, and Council-Halls, and Corporations, and built one common <hi>Prytaneum</hi> and Council-Hall, where it ſtands to this day; and out of the old and the new City he made one, which he nam'd <hi>Athens,</hi> ordaining a common Feaſt and Sacrifice to be for ever obſerv'd, which he call'd <hi>Panathenaea,</hi> or the Sacrifice of all the United <hi>Athenians.</hi> He inſtituted alſo another Sacrifice, for the ſake of Strangers that would come to fix in <hi>Athens,</hi> call'd <note n="*" place="margin">Metaecaea, (<gap reason="foreign">

Farther yet deſigning to enlarge his City, he invited all Strangers to come and enjoy equal Priviledges with the Natives, and ſome are of opinion that the common form of Proclamation in <hi>Athens, Come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all ye People,</hi> were the words that <hi>Theſeus</hi> cauſed to be proclaim'd, when he thus ſet up a Commonwealth, conſiſting, in a manner, of all Nations.

Multitude that flow'd in, to be turn'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Confuſion, and be left without any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or degree, but was the firſt that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Commonwealth into three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Ranks, the Noblemen, the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen, and Artificers. To the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity he committed the choice of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, the teaching and diſpenſing of the Laws, and the interpretation of all holy and Religious things; the whole City, as to all other Matters, being as it were reduc'd to an exact Equality, the Nobles excelling the reſt in Honour, the Husbandmen in Profit, and the Artificers in Number. And <hi>Theſeus</hi> was the firſt, who, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays, out of an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Popular Government parted with the Regal Power, and which <hi>Homer</hi> alſo ſeems to witneſs in his Catalogue of the Ships, where he gives the Name of <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> to the <hi>Athenians</hi> only.</p>
            <p>He then coyned Money, and ſtamp'd it with the Image of an Ox, either in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the <hi>Marathonian Bull,</hi> or of <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> whom he vanquiſh'd, or elſe to put his People in mind to follow Husbandry, and from this Coin came the expreſſion ſo frequent among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> of a thing being worth ten or a hundred Oxen. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this he joyned <hi>Megara</hi> to <hi>Attica,</hi> and erected that famous Pillar in the Streights
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47090:102"/>
of <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> which bears an Inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of two lines, ſhewing the bounds of the two Countreys that meet there. On the Eaſt-ſide the Inſcription is thus:

He alſo inſtituted annual Games, in emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>Hercules,</hi> being ambitious, that as the <hi>Greeks</hi> by that Hero's appointment celebrated the <hi>Olympian</hi> Games to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> ſo by his inſtitution they ſhould celebrate the <hi>Iſthmian</hi> Games to the Honour of <hi>Neptune.</hi> For thoſe that were there before obſerv'd, dedicated to <hi>Melicerta,</hi> were perform'd privately and in the night, and conſiſted rather of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Ceremonies, than of any open Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle or publick Feaſt. But ſome there are who ſay, that the <hi>Iſthmian</hi> Games were firſt inſtituted in memory of <hi>Sciron,</hi> at the Expiation which <hi>Theſeus</hi> made for his Murder, upon the account of the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of kindred which was between them, <hi>Sciron</hi> being the Son of <hi>Canethus</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niocha,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Pittheus;</hi> tho' others write, that <hi>Sinnis</hi> and not <hi>Sciron</hi>

was their Son, and that to his Honour and not to the others theſe Games were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd by <hi>Theſeus;</hi> and <hi>Hellanicus</hi> and <hi>Andro</hi> of <hi>Halicarnaſſus</hi> write, that at the ſame time he made an agreement with the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that they ſhould allow them that came from <hi>Athens</hi> to the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the <hi>Iſthmian</hi> Games, as much ſpace to behold the Spectacle in, as the Sayl of the Ship that brought them thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtretcht to its full extent could co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and that in the firſt and moſt honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Place. Concerning the Voyage <note place="margin">
                  <hi>His Voyage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the</hi> Euxine Sea.</note> that he made in the <hi>Euxine Sea,</hi> there are different Relations; for <hi>Philochorus</hi> and ſome others write, that he undertook this Expedition with <hi>Hercules,</hi> offering him his Service in the War againſt the <hi>Amazons,</hi> and had <hi>Antiope</hi> given him for the reward of his Valour: but others, as <hi>Pherecydes, Hellanicus</hi> and <hi>Herodorus</hi> write, that he made this Voyage many years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Hercules,</hi> with a Navy under his own Command, and took the <hi>Amazon</hi> Priſoner; and indeed this ſeems to come neareſt the truth, for we do not read that any other of all thoſe that accompani'd him in this Action, took any <hi>Amazon</hi> Priſoner. Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the former, <hi>Bion</hi> writes, that he ſtole her away by deceit, and fled; for the <hi>Amazons</hi> (he ſays) being natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Lovers of Men, were ſo far from flying from <hi>Theſeus</hi> when he touch'd upon their Coaſts, that they entertain'd him with great civility, and ſent him Preſents to his Ship; but he having invited <hi>Antiope,</hi> who brought them, to come aboard, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſet Sayl and carri'd her away. <hi>Menecrates,</hi> that wrote the Hiſtory of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caea</hi> in <hi>Bithynia,</hi> adds, that <hi>Theſeus</hi> having <hi>Antiope</hi> aboard his Veſſel, cruiſed for ſome time about thoſe Coaſts, and that there were in the ſame Ship three young No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen of <hi>Athens,</hi> that accompani'd him in this Voyage, all Brothers, whoſe Names were <hi>Euneus, Thoas,</hi> and <hi>Soloon.</hi> The laſt of theſe fell deſperately in Love with <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiope,</hi> but conceal'd it with all poſſible care; only to one of his moſt intimate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance he reveal'd the Secret, and employ'd him to break his paſſion to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiope;</hi> ſhe rejected his pretences with a very ſharp denial, yet carri'd her ſelf to him with all outward appearances of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, and very prudently made no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint to <hi>Theſeus</hi> of any thing that had happen'd; but <hi>Soloon,</hi> urg'd by deſpair, leap'd into a River near the Sea-ſide, and drowned himſelf. As ſoon as <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus</hi> was acquainted with his Death, and his unhappy Love that was the cauſe of it, he was extreamly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47090:104"/>
and in the heighth of his grief, an Oracle which he had formerly receiv'd at <hi>Delphos,</hi> came into his mind; for he had been commanded by the Prieſteſs of <hi>Apollo Pythius,</hi> that where-ever in his Travels he was moſt ſorrowful, and under the greateſt affliction, he ſhould build a City there, and leave ſome of his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to be Governours of the Place. For this cauſe he there founded a City, which he call'd from the Name of <hi>Apollo, Pytho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>He builds</hi> Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thopolis.</note> and in honour of the unfortunate Youth, he nam'd the River that runs by it, <hi>Soloon,</hi> and left the two ſurviving Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers entruſted with the care of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Laws, joyning with them <hi>Hermus,</hi> one of the Nobility of <hi>Athens,</hi> from whom a certain Place in the City is call'd, <hi>The Houſe of Hermus;</hi> tho' by an error in the accent of the word, it has been falſly taken for <hi>the Houſe of Hermes,</hi> or <hi>Mercury,</hi> and the Honour that was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to the Heroe, transferr'd to the God. And this was the riſe and ground of the <hi>Amazonian</hi> War, a War of no ſmall conſequence, or in which the <hi>Athenians</hi> might think they had to do with Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards or Women. For it is impoſſible that they ſhould have plac'd their Camp in the very City, and joyn'd Battel in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of it, near the Temple of the <hi>Muſes,</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:47090:104"/>
unleſs having firſt conquer'd the Country round about, they had without any delay or fear mov'd boldly on to <hi>Athens.</hi> That they made ſo long a Journey by Land, and paſſed an Arm of the <hi>Cimmerian Boſphorus</hi> that was frozen, as <hi>Hellanicus</hi> writes, is difficult to be believ'd. This is certain, that they encamp'd in the City, and may be ſufficiently confirm'd by the Names that the Places thereabout yet retain, and the Graves and Monuments of thoſe that fell in the Battel. Both Armies now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſight, there was a long pauſe and doubt on each ſide which ſhould give the firſt Onſet: At laſt <hi>Theſeus</hi> having ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic'd to <hi>Fear,</hi> in obedience to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of an Oracle he had receiv'd, gave them Battel; and this happen'd in the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gives Battel to the</hi> Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons.</note> Month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in which to this very day the <hi>Athenians</hi> celebrate the Feaſt, that is nam'd from that Month wherein this Battel was fought. But <hi>Clidemus,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to be very nice in each particular of this Affair, writes, that the left Wing of the <hi>Amazons</hi> mov'd towards the Place which is yet call'd <hi>Amazonium,</hi> and the right to a Place call'd <hi>Pnyx,</hi> near <hi>Chryſa,</hi> upon which the <hi>Athenians,</hi> iſſuing from behind the <hi>Muſes</hi> Temple, fell upon them; and that this is true, the Graves of thoſe that were ſlain, to be ſeen in the Street
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:47090:105"/>
that leads to the Gate call'd <hi>Piraica,</hi> by the Temple of the Hero <hi>Chalcodus,</hi> are a ſufficient proof. And here it was that the <hi>Athenians</hi> were routed, and ſhameful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turn'd their backs to Women, as far as to the Temple of the <hi>Furies.</hi> But freſh ſupplies coming in from <hi>Palladium, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dettus,</hi> and <hi>Lyceum,</hi> charg'd their right Wing, and beat them back into their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Tents, in which Action a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the <hi>Amazons</hi> were ſlain. At length, after four months, a Peace was concluded <note place="margin">Peace conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> between 'em by the mediation of <hi>Hippoly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> (for ſo this Hiſtorian calls the <hi>Amazon</hi> which <hi>Theſeus</hi> marri'd, and not <hi>Antiope)</hi> tho' others write that ſhe was ſlain with a Dart by <hi>Molpadia,</hi> fighting by <hi>Theſeus</hi> ſide, and that the Pillar which ſtands by the Temple at the entring into the <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi> ground, was erected to her Honour. Nor is it to be wonder'd that the Hiſtory of things ſo very ancient, ſhould be ſo various and uncertain. It is farther ſaid, that thoſe of the <hi>Amazons</hi> that were wounded, were privately ſent away by <hi>Antiope</hi> to <hi>Chalcis,</hi> where many by her care recover'd, but thoſe that dy'd were buri'd in the Place that is to this time call'd <hi>Amazonium.</hi> That this War was ended by a mutual League and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is evident both from the Name of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:47090:105"/>
the Place adjoyning to the Temple of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus,</hi> call'd from the ſolemn Oath there taken, <hi>Horcomoſium,</hi> and alſo from the ancient Sacrifice which is celebrated to the <hi>Amazons,</hi> the day before the Feaſt of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus.</hi> The <hi>Megarians</hi> pretend alſo that ſome of the <hi>Amazons</hi> were buried in their City, and ſhew for one of their Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, a Tomb in the figure of a Lozenge, in the paſſage from the Market-place to a Place call'd <hi>Rhus.</hi> It is ſaid likewiſe, that others of 'em were ſlain near <hi>Chaero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea,</hi> and buried near a little Rivulet, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly call'd <hi>Thermodon,</hi> but now <hi>Haemon,</hi> of which I have formerly wrote in the Life of <hi>Demoſthenes.</hi> It appears further, that the Paſſage of the <hi>Amazons</hi> through <hi>Theſſaly</hi> was not without oppoſition, for there are yet to be ſeen many of their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres near <hi>Scotuſſaea</hi> and <hi>Cynocephalae.</hi> And this is as much as is worthy the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, concerning the <hi>Amazons.</hi> For the account which the ancient Author of a <hi>Poem</hi> call'd <hi>Theſeis,</hi> gives us, of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of the <hi>Amazons,</hi> how that <hi>Antiope,</hi> to revenge her ſelf upon <hi>Theſeus,</hi> for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing her and marrying <hi>Phaedra,</hi> came down upon the City with her Train of <hi>Amazons,</hi> was defeated, and had moſt of her Followers ſlain by <hi>Hercules,</hi> is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly nothing elſe but Fable, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:47090:106"/>
of a Poet. It is true indeed that <hi>Theſeus</hi> marri'd <hi>Phaedra,</hi> but that was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of <hi>Antiope,</hi> by whom he had a Son call'd <hi>Hippolytus,</hi> or, as <hi>Pindar</hi> writes, <hi>Demophoon.</hi> As to the Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which befel both <hi>Theſeus</hi> and his Son, ſince none of the Hiſtorians have contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted the Tragick Poets that have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of them, they are altogether to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd for truths, as they are deliver'd from the Stage.

                  <hi>The occaſion of the Friendſhip between</hi> The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus <hi>and</hi> Peiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thous.</note> 
               <hi>Peirithous,</hi> is ſaid to have been thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun. The Fame of the matchleſs Strength and Valour of <hi>Theſeus</hi> being ſpread through all <hi>Greece, Peirithous</hi> was enflam'd with a deſire to be ſatisfi'd, and make a tryal himſelf of what he had heard ſo much by Report; to this end he ſeized a Herd of Oxen which belong'd to <hi>Theſeus,</hi> and was driving them away from <hi>Marathon,</hi> when News was brought that <hi>Theſeus</hi> purſu'd him in Arms; upon which, diſdaining to fly, he turn'd back and went on to meet him. But as ſoon as ever they had view'd one another, each ſo admir'd the Gracefulneſs and Beauty, and was ſeiz'd with ſuch a Reverence for the Bravery and Courage of the other, that they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat all thoughts of Fighting; and <hi>Peiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thous</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:47090:107"/>
firſt ſtretching out his hand to <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus,</hi> bade him be Judge in this Caſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and promis'd to ſubmit willingly to what-ever he demanded, in ſatisfaction for the injury he had done. But <hi>Theſeus</hi> not only forgave him all the damages he had ſuſtain'd, but entreated him to be his Friend and Brother in Arms; and there immediately they ſwore an inviolable friendſhip to each other. After this <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithous</hi> married <hi>Deidamia,</hi> and invited <hi>Theſeus</hi> to the Wedding, entreating him to come and ſee his Countrey, and enter into alliance with the <hi>Lapithae;</hi> he had at the ſame time invited the <hi>Centaurs</hi> to the Feaſt, who growing hot with Wine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be very inſolent and lewd, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd violence to the Women, which ſo enrag'd the <hi>Lapithae,</hi> that they took im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate revenge upon them, ſlaying ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them upon the Place; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards having overcome them in Battel, drove the whole Race of them out of their Countrey, <hi>Theſeus</hi> all along taking their part, and fighting on their ſide. But <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus</hi> gives a different Relation of theſe things. That <hi>Theſeus</hi> came not to the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Lapithae</hi> till the War was already begun, and that it was in this Journey that he had the firſt ſight of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi> having made it his buſineſs to find
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:47090:108"/>
him out at <hi>Trachine,</hi> where he had choſen to reſt himſelf after all his wandrings and his labours, and that this Enterview was honourably perform'd on each part with extream Civility, Reſpect and Admiration of each other. Yet it is more credible what other Hiſtorians write, that there were before frequent Enterviews between them, and that it was by the means of <hi>Theſeus</hi> that <hi>Hercules</hi> was initiated and admitted to the Ceremonies of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs <hi>Ceres,</hi> having, by his interceſſion alſo, been firſt purifi'd, upon the account of ſeveral raſh Actions of his former Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſeus</hi> was now fifty years old, as <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanicus</hi> reports, when he raviſh'd <hi>Helen,</hi> who was very young, and not of Age to be marri'd. Wherefore ſome Writers, to take away this Accuſation of one of the greateſt Crimes that is laid to his charge, ſay, that he did not ſteal away <hi>Helen</hi> himſelf, but that <hi>Idas</hi> and <hi>Lynceus</hi> were the Raviſhers, who brought her to him, and committed her to his charge, and that therefore he refus'd to reſtore her at the demand of <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux;</hi> or, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to others, that her own Father <hi>Tyndarus</hi> ſent her to be kept by him, for fear of <hi>Enarſphorus</hi> the Son of <hi>Hippocoon,</hi> who would have carri'd her away by force
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:47090:108"/>
when ſhe was yet a Child. But the moſt probable Relation, and that which has moſt Witneſſes on its ſide, is this: <hi>Theſeus</hi> and <hi>Peirithous</hi> went both together to <note place="margin">

great Dog which he kept, <hi>Cerberus,</hi> with whom he order'd all that came as Suitors to his Daughter to fight, and promis'd her to him that ſhould overcome the Beaſt. But having been inform'd, that the deſign of <hi>Peirithous</hi> his coming was not to court his Daughter, but to force her away, he cauſed them both to be ſeized, and threw <hi>Peirithous</hi> to be torn in pieces by his Dog, and clapt up <hi>Theſeus</hi>

            <p>About this time, <hi>Meneſtheus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Peteus,</hi> who was great Grandſon to <hi>Erectheus,</hi> the firſt Man that is recorded to have affected Popularity, and ingratia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf with the Multitude, ſtirr'd up and exaſperated the moſt eminent Men of the City, who had long born a ſecret grudge to <hi>Theſeus,</hi> and poſſeſt them with a belief that <hi>Theſeus</hi> had taken from them their ſeveral little Kingdoms and Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, that ſo having pent them all up in one City, he might uſe them as his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and Slaves.

But it was very difficult to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver theſe Reliques, or ſo much as to find out the Place where they lay, by reaſon of the inhoſpitable and ſavage temper of the barbarous People that inhabited the Iſland. But afterwards when <hi>Cimon</hi> took the Iſland, (as is related in his Life) and had a great deſire to find out the Place where <hi>Theſeus</hi> was buried, he by chance ſpy'd an Eagle upon a riſing ground peck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with her Beak, and tearing up the

the Place was call'd <hi>Rome.</hi> Some ſay, <hi>Roma,</hi> Daughter of that <hi>Trojan</hi> Lady who was married to <hi>Latinus, Telemachus</hi>'s Son, was Mother to <hi>Romulus;</hi> others, that <hi>Aemilia,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Aeneas</hi> and <hi>Lavinia,</hi> had him by the God <hi>Mars;</hi> and others give you little leſs than meer Fables of his Original.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Oracle of <hi>Tethys</hi> in <hi>Thuſcany</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſulted, the reſult of it was that ſome young Virgin ſhould accept of its Court, and ſhe ſhould have a Son famous in his Generation, eminent for Vertue, good Fortune, and ſtrength of Body. <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chetius</hi> told the Prophecy to one of his own Daughters, and commanded her to entertain the Lover; but ſhe ſlighting the Matter, put her Woman on the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of it. <hi>Tarchetius</hi> hearing this, in great indignation impriſon'd the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, purpoſing to put 'em to death; but being deterr'd from Murder by the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs <hi>Veſta</hi> in a Dream, enjoyn'd them for their puniſhment the working a piece of Cloth, in their Chains as they were, which when they finiſh'd, they ſhould be

ſuffer'd to marry; but what-ever they work'd by day, <hi>Tarchetius</hi> commanded others to unravel in the night. In the mean time the Waiting-woman was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd of two Boys, whom <hi>Tarchetius</hi> gave into the hands of one <hi>Teratius,</hi> with ſtrict Command to deſtroy 'em; but he expos'd 'em to Fortune by a River-ſide, where a Wolf conſtantly came and ſuckled 'em, and the Birds of the Air brought little mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of Food, which they put into their mouths; till a Neat-herd ſpying 'em, was firſt ſtrangely ſurpriz'd, but venturing to draw nearer, took the Children up in his arms. This was the manner of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and thus they grew up till they ſet upon <hi>Tarchetius,</hi> and overcame him.

Yet here too are ſtill more Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples rais'd: As for Example; The Kings of <hi>Alba</hi> deſcending lineally from <hi>Aeneas,</hi> the Succeſſion devolv'd at length upon two Brothers, <hi>Numitor</hi> and <hi>Amulius. Amulius</hi> to divide things into two equal ſhares, put in equivalency to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom all the Treaſury and Gold that was
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:47090:117"/>
brought from <hi>Troy. Numitor</hi> choſe the Kingdom; but <hi>Amulius</hi> having the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and being able to do more with that than <hi>Numitor,</hi> he both with a great deal of eaſe took his Kingdom from him, and withal fearing leſt his Daughter might have Children, made her a Veſtal Nun, in that condition for ever to live a ſingle and Maiden Life. This Lady ſome call'd <note n="*" place="margin">His Mother.</note> 
               <hi>Ilia,</hi> others <hi>Rhea,</hi> and others <hi>Sylvia;</hi> however not long after ſhe was, contrary to the eſtabliſh'd Laws of the Veſtals, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd to be with Child, and ſhould have ſuffer'd the moſt cruel puniſhment, had not <hi>Antho,</hi> the King's Daughter, media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with her Father for her; nevertheleſs ſhe was confin'd, and debarr'd all humane converſation, that ſhe might not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd without his knowledge. In time ſhe brought forth two Boys, extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry both in the bigneſs and beauty of their Bodies: Whereupon <hi>Amulius</hi> becoming yet more fearful, commanded a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to take and caſt 'em away; this Man ſome call <hi>Fauſtulus;</hi> others ſay, <hi>Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulus</hi> was the Man who brought them up; <note place="margin">Fauſtulus.</note> who-ever the Servant was, he put the Children in a ſmall Trough, and went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the River with a deſign to caſt them in; but ſeeing the Waters flow, and pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in mighty ſurges upon him, he
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:47090:117"/>
fear'd to go nigher, but dropping the Children near the Bank, went himſelf off; the River overflowing, the Flood at laſt bore up the Trough, and gently wafting it, landed 'em on a very pleaſant Plain, which they now call <note n="*" place="margin">Cermanum.</note> 
               <hi>Cermanum,</hi> formerly <hi>Germanum,</hi> perhaps from <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>Brothers.</hi> Near this Place grew a wild Fig-tree, which they call'd <hi>Ruminalis,</hi> either from <hi>Romulus,</hi> (as it is vulgarly thought) or from <note n="*" place="margin">Ruminor <hi>ſignifies to chew the Cud.</hi>

               <hi>Rumilia,</hi> in ſacrificing to whom they made no uſe of Wine, but Milk. While the Infants lay here, Hiſtory tells us, a ſhe-Wolf nurs'd 'em, and a little <note n="*" place="margin">

Whence it was not altogether incredible what the Mother of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſaid, that ſhe conceiv'd with Child by the God <hi>Mars,</hi> tho' they ſay that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake was put upon her by <hi>Amulius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:47090:118"/>
being by him robb'd of her Honour, who appear'd to her all in Armour, and ſo committed a Rape upon her Body.</p>
            <p>Others think the firſt riſe of this Fable came from the Childrens Nurſe, purely upon the ambiguity of a word; for the <hi>Latines</hi> not only call'd Wolves, <hi>Lupae,</hi> but alſo lewd and proſtitute Women: And ſuch an one was the Wife of <hi>Fauſtulus,</hi> who nurtur'd theſe Children, <hi>Acca Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentia</hi> by Name; to her the <hi>Romans</hi> offer Sacrifices, and to her in the Month <hi>April</hi> the Prieſt of <hi>Mars</hi> does offer up a ſpecial Libation, and they call it the <hi>Laurentian Feaſt;</hi> they honour alſo another <hi>Lauren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> much upon the like occaſion; as thus:</p>
            <p>The Keeper of <hi>Hercules</hi>'s Temple ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, it ſeems, little elſe to do, propos'd to his Deity a Game at Dice, laying down, that if he himſelf won, he would have ſomething valuable of the God, but if he was beaten, he would ſpread him a noble Table, and procure withal a fair Lady to lye with him. Upon theſe terms, reckoning firſt the Chances that were thrown for the God, and then for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he found plainly he had loſt: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs being willing Matters ſhould be adjuſted, and thinking it honeſt to ſtick to the Propoſals he made himſelf, he both
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:47090:118"/>
provided the Deity a good Supper, and feeing <hi>Laurentia,</hi> who was a fine Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, tho' not as yet a fam'd Beauty, treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her in the Temple, where he had alſo laid a Bed, and after Supper lock'd her in, as if the God were really to enjoy her; and indeed it is ſaid, the Deity did truly bed the Lady, and commanded her in the Morning to walk the Streets, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Man ſhe met firſt, him to ſalute, and make her Friend. The Man ſhe met was by Name <hi>Tarrutius,</hi> far ſtricken in years, but of a competent ſubſiſtence, without Children, and had always liv'd a ſingle Life: This Man <note n="*" place="margin">

It was reported of her, being now a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated Beauty, and eſteem'd the Miſtreſs of a God, that ſhe ſuddenly diſappear'd near the Place where the firſt <hi>Laurentia</hi> lay buried; the Place is at this day call'd <note n="*" place="margin">Velabrum.</note> 
               <hi>Velabrum,</hi> becauſe, the River frequently overflowing, they went over in Ferry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boats much about this Place to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, which manner of Waftage the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> call <hi>Velatura;</hi> others derive the Name from <hi>Velum</hi> a <hi>Veil,</hi> becauſe the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiters of publick Shews, generally ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

The reaſon of their Names <hi>(Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> and <hi>Remus)</hi> was, as you find it in Story, becauſe they were ſeen <note n="*" place="margin">Ruma <hi>ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying a Dug.</hi>
               </note> ſucking of the Wolf. In their very Infancy, the noble ſtructure of their Bodies preſently diſcover'd the natural greatneſs of their Minds and Thoughts; and when they grew up, they both prov'd of great Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and Manhood, attempting all Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes that ſeem'd hazardous, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill a Courage altogether undaunted. But <hi>Romulus</hi> ſeem'd rather to excel in Wiſdom, and to have an Underſtanding more adapted to politick Affairs, in his Life and Converſation amongſt his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, both in feeding his Flock, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:47090:119"/>
his Dogs for Hunting, raiſing a great opinion in all, that he was born ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to rule and govern than be a Subject. To their Comrades, nay Inferiors, they were affable and courteous; but the King's Servants, his Bayliffs and Overſeers, as being in nothing better Men than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they deſpis'd and ſlighted, nor were the leaſt concernd at their commands and menaces. They us'd honeſt Paſtimes, and liberal Studies, eſteeming Sloth and Idleneſs not to be commendable, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Exerciſes, as Hunting and Running, catching of Robbers, taking of Thieves, and delivering the wrong'd and oppreſſed from injury.

At which <hi>Numitor</hi> being highly incens'd, they little regarded it, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united their Forces, and picking up a great many needy Fellows and Servants, began a ſeditious and mutinous Riot; and <hi>Romulus</hi> employing himſelf then at a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, (for he was a lover of holy Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and Prophecies) <hi>Numitor</hi>'s Neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:47090:120"/>
meeting with <hi>Remus,</hi> upon a ſmall Journey he was making, fell upon him, and ſome few Blows and Wounds paſſing between them, took <hi>Remus</hi> Priſoner, who being carried before <hi>Numitor,</hi> and there accus'd of Miſdemeanors, he would not puniſh him himſelf, fearing his Brother might be angry, but went to him, and deſir'd Juſtice might be done him, as he was his Brother, and was affronted by his Servants. The Men of <hi>Alba</hi> likewiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the thing ill, and thinking the Man diſhonourably us'd, <hi>Amulius</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to deliver <hi>Remus</hi> up into <hi>Numitor</hi>'s hands, to uſe him as he thought fit. He therefore took and carried him home, and being ſtruck with admiration of the Youth's Perſon, in proportion and ſtrength of Body exceeding all Men, and perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his very Countenance the courage and preſence of his Mind, which ſtood undaunted and unſhaken in his preſent Calamities, and hearing farther all the Enterpriſes and Actions of his Life, were anſwerable to what he ſaw of him, but chiefly (as it ſeem'd) God influencing and directing the Inſtruments of great Works, he having a deſire and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to enquire into the truth of him, in gentle terms and with a kind aſpect rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a confidence and hope in him, ask'd

him, Who he was, and whence he was deriv'd. He taking heart, ſpoke thus: <hi>I will, Sir, hide nothing from you, for you</hi>

               <hi>ſeem to be of a more Princely temper than</hi> Amulius, <hi>in that you give a hearing, and examine fairly, before you puniſh, but he condemns before the Cauſe is heard. Firſt then, We (for we are Twins) thought our ſelves the Sons of</hi> Fauſtulus <hi>and</hi> Laurentia, <hi>the King's Servants; but ſince we have been accus'd, and aſpers'd with Calumnies, and brought in peril of our Lives here before you, we hear great things of our ſelves, the truth whereof will appear from the iſſue of this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger we are in. Our Birth is ſaid to have been miraculous, our foſtering and nurture in our Infancy ſtill more ſtrange; by Birds and Beaſts, to whom we were caſt out, by them were we fed, that is, by the Milk of a Wolf, and the ſmall morſels of a Woodpecker, as we lay in a little Trough by the ſide of a River; the Trough is now in being, and is preſerv'd with braſs plates round it, and an Inſcription in old obſcure Characters on it, which may prove hereafter but very inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant tokens to our Parents, when we are dead and gone. Numitor,</hi> upon theſe words, and recollecting the time too, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the young Man's Looks, ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the hope that flatter'd him, but took care how to come at his Daughter
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:47090:121"/>
privately, (for ſhe was ſtill kept under re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint) to talk with her concerning theſe Matters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fauſtulus</hi> hearing <hi>Remus</hi> was taken, and deliver'd up, begg'd <hi>Romulus</hi> to aſſiſt in his reſcue, informing him then plainly of the Particulars of his Birth, not but he had before given him ſome hints of it, and told him as much as an attentive Man might make no ſmall Concluſions from it; he himſelf, full of Concern, and fear of not coming in time, took the Trough, and ran inſtantly to <hi>Numitor;</hi> but giving a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion to ſome of the King's Centry at his Gate, and being gaz'd upon by 'em, and perplex'd with their impertinent Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, could not but diſcover the Trough under his Cloak; now by chance there was one among 'em who was at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of the Children, and was one im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in the Office; he ſeeing the Trough, and knowing it by its Make and Inſcription, gueſs'd at the buſineſs, and without farther delay telling the King of it, brought in the Man to be examin'd. In theſe many and great Diſtractions, <hi>Fauſtulus</hi> neither approv'd himſelf altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther undaunted, neither was he wholly forc'd out of all: He confeſs'd indeed the Children were alive, but liv'd a great way from <hi>Alba;</hi> that he himſelf was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:47090:121"/>
to carry the Trough to <hi>Ilia,</hi> who had often greatly deſir'd to ſee and handle it, for a confirmation of the hopes of her Children. As Men generally do, who are troubled in mind, and act either in fear or paſſion, it ſo fell out <hi>Amulius</hi> now did; for he ſent in all haſte a Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, both otherwiſe an honeſt Man, and a ſure Friend to <hi>Numitor,</hi> with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to enquire of <hi>Numitor,</hi> whether any tidings had come to him of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as if they were in being; now the Man being come, and ſeeing how little <hi>Remus</hi> wanted of being receiv'd into the Arms and Embraces of <hi>Numitor,</hi> he both ſtrengthned the belief of his hope, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd withal to recover Matters with all expedition; and he himſelf clos'd with 'em, and acted joyntly; the ſtrictneſs of time, tho' they had been deſirous, did not ſuffer them to demur. For <hi>Romulus</hi> was now drawn very near, and many of the Citizens out of fear and hatred of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulius,</hi> revolted to his ſide; beſides he brought great Forces with him, divided into Companies, conſiſting each of an 100 Men, every Captain carrying a ſmall bundle of Graſs and Shrubs tyed to a Pole; the <hi>Latines</hi> call ſuch bundles, <hi>Manipuli,</hi> and from hence it is that in their Armies they call their Captains, <hi>Manipulares;</hi>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:47090:122"/>
               <hi>Rhemus</hi> gaining upon the Citizens with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and <hi>Romulus</hi> making Attacks from without, the Tyrant not knowing either what to do, or what Expedient to think of for his ſecurity, in that Amazement and Diſtraction, was taken and put to death. <note place="margin">Amulius <hi>is ſlain.</hi>
               </note> Theſe are for the moſt part the Relations of <hi>Fabius</hi> and <hi>Diocles Peparethius,</hi> (who I think is the firſt that writes of the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Rome)</hi> which ſome ſuſpect are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fabulous and made Stories; but they ought not wholly to be disbeliev'd, if Men would conſider Fortune, what ſtrange things it ſometimes brings about, and take an eſtimate of the Actions of the <hi>Romans,</hi> how improbable it is they could arrive at this Greatneſs, had they not ſome miraculous Original, attended with great and extraordinary Circumſtances.</p>

               <hi>Amulius</hi> now being dead, and Matters quietly diſpos'd, the two Brothers would neither dwell in <hi>Alba</hi> without governing there, nor were they willing to take the Government into their own hands, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Life of their Grandfather.

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:47090:122"/>
this was the moſt ſpecious pretence they could make, of their departure; tho' perhaps it was neceſſary, ſo many ſhoals of Slaves and Fugitives continually flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to 'em, either to be totally diſſolv'd, by diſperſing them, or elſe to plant a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony elſewhere with 'em; for that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Alba</hi> did not think Fugitives worthy of being receiv'd and incorporated Citizens among them, firſt plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd, from the Adventure upon their Women, which really was not attempted out of any violent luſt, but deliberately, purely out of want and neceſſity of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Wives, whom they afterwards ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly lov'd and honour'd.</p>
            <p>Not long after the firſt foundation of the City, they opened a Sanctuary of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge for all Fugitives, which they call'd the Temple of the God <hi>Aſylaeus,</hi> where they receiv'd and protected all, delivering none back, either the Servant to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, the Debtor to his Creditors, or the Murtherer into the hands of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, ſaying, it was a priviledg'd Place, and they could ſo maintain it by an Order of the Holy Oracle; inſomuch that the City grew preſently very populous, for they ſay, it conſiſted at firſt of no more than a 1000 Houſes: But of that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>

Their minds being fully bent upon Building, there aroſe preſently a difference <note place="margin">Romulus <hi>and</hi> Remus <hi>differ about the Place</hi>
               </note> about the Place where. <hi>Romulus</hi> he built a Square of Houſes, which he call'd <hi>Rome,</hi> and would have the City be there; <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> laid out a piece of Ground on the <hi>Aventine</hi> Mount, well fortified by nature, which was from him call'd <hi>Remonius,</hi> but now <hi>Rignarius;</hi> concluding at laſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the Conteſt by a Divination from a flight of Birds, and placing themſelves apart at ſome diſtance, to <hi>Remus,</hi> they ſay, appear'd ſix Vulturs, to <hi>Romulus</hi> double the number; others ſay, <hi>Remus</hi> did truly ſee his number, and that <hi>Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> feign'd his, but when <hi>Remus</hi> came to him, that then he did indeed ſee twelve. Hence it is that the <hi>Romans</hi> in their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinations from Birds, do chiefly regard the Vultur, tho' <hi>Herodorus Pontius</hi> relates, that <hi>Hercules</hi> was always very joyful when a Vultur appear'd to him upon any Action, for it is a Creature the leaſt hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of any, pernicious neither to Corn, Plants, or any Cattel; it preys only upon Carrion, and never kills or hurts any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thing; and as for Birds, it touches not them tho' they are dead, as being of its own Species, whereas Eagles, Owls, and Hawks, prey upon all their own fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Creatures;

            <p>When <hi>Remus</hi> knew the Cheat, he was much diſpleas'd; and as <hi>Romulus</hi> was caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up a Ditch, where he deſign'd the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the City-Wall, ſome pieces of the Work he turn'd to ridicule, others he trampled on and ſpurn'd at; at laſt as he was in contempt skipping over the Work, ſome ſay, <hi>Romulus</hi> himſelf ſtroke him; others, that <hi>Celer,</hi> one of his Companions: however there fell <hi>Remus;</hi> in that Scuffle <note place="margin">Remus <hi>is ſlain.</hi>

This Trench they call'd <hi>Mundus,</hi> (the whole World) making which their Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they deſign'd the City in a Circle round it. Then the Founder fitted to a Plow a brazen Plow-ſhare, and yoking together a Bull and a Cow, drew himſelf a deep Line or Furrow round the Bounds; the buſineſs of them that follow'd after,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:47090:124"/>
was to ſee what-ever Earth was thrown up, ſhould be turn'd all inwardly towards the City, and not to ſlip a Clod that fell outwards. With this Line did they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the Wall, all within which were the Territories of the City, which they call'd <hi>Pomaerium,</hi> from <hi>Poſt murum,</hi> or <hi>Pone maenia,</hi> by the cutting off or chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome Letters; where they deſign'd to make a Gate, there they lifted up the Plow, and left a ſpace for it; whereupon they eſteem the whole Wall as holy, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where the Gates are; for had they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged them alſo ſacred, they could not, without offence to Religion, have had a free ingreſs and egreſs for the Neceſſaries of humane Life, ſome whereof are in themſelves unclean.

               <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Graecian</hi> Months have little or no Analogy; theſe ſay, the day <hi>Romulus</hi> began to build was infallibly the <hi>30th.</hi> of the month, at which time there was an Eclipſe of the Moon, which happen'd in the <hi>3d.</hi> year of the <hi>6th.

            <p>After the Overthrow of the <hi>Ceninenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> the <hi>Sabines</hi> ſtill protracting the time in Preparations, the People of <hi>Fidena, Cruſtumerium,</hi> and <hi>Antemna,</hi> joyn'd their Forces againſt the <hi>Romans;</hi> Battel was no ſooner joyn'd, but they were likewiſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately defeated, &amp; ſurrendred up to <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus</hi> their Cities to be ſpoil'd, their Lands and Territories to be divided, &amp; themſelves to be tranſplanted to a Colony at <hi>Rome.</hi>

And thus did <hi>Tatius</hi> behave himſelf towards <hi>Tarpeia,</hi> for he commanded the <hi>Sabines,</hi> in regard to their Contract, not to refuſe her the leaſt part of what they wore on their left Arms; upon that he himſelf firſt took his Bracelet off his Arm, and threw that together with his Buckler at her, and all the reſt following, ſhe, being born down and <note place="margin">And is kill'd in recompence.</note> quite ſmother'd with the multitude of Gold and their Shields, died under the great weight and preſſure of them; nay, <hi>Tarpeius</hi> himſelf being proſecuted by <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus,</hi> was found guilty of Treaſon, as <hi>Juba</hi> ſays, <hi>Sulpitius Galba</hi> relates.

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:47090:132"/>
Place, which had but a few narrow Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, inconvenient either for refuge or purſuit. It happen'd too, the River ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving overflowed not many days before, there was left behind in the Plain, where now the Market ſtands, a deep blind Mud and Slime, which, tho' it did not appear much to the eye, and was not eaſily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided, yet at bottom was very deceitful and dangerous; upon which the <hi>Sabines</hi> being unwarily about to enter, had good luck befel them; for <hi>Curtius,</hi> a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Man, eager of Honour, and of aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thoughts, being mounted on Horſe-back, gallop'd a good diſtance before the reſt, but his Horſe was mired, and he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd a while by Whip and Spur to diſintangle him, but finding it impoſſible, he quitted his Horſe, and ſaved himſelf; the Place from him to this very time is call'd the <hi>Curtian Lake.</hi> The <hi>Sabines</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving eſcaped this danger, began the Fight very ſmartly, the fortune of the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very dubious, tho' many were ſlain; amongſt whom was <hi>Hoſtilius,</hi> who, they ſay, was Husband to <hi>Herſilia,</hi> and Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father to that <hi>Hoſtilius</hi> who reign'd after <hi>Numa.</hi> It is probable there were many other Battels in a ſhort time after, but the moſt memorable was the laſt, in which <hi>Romulus</hi> having receiv'd a Wound on his
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:47090:133"/>
Head by a Stone, and being almoſt fell'd to the ground by it, and diſabled to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain the Enemy, the <hi>Romans</hi> upon that yielded ground, and being driven out of the Field, fled to the <hi>Palatium. Romulus</hi> by this time recovering his Wound a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, running upon his Men in flight, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to their Arms again, and with a loud voice encouraged them to ſtand and fight. But being overpowr'd with the number, and no body daring to face about, he ſtretching out his hands to Heaven, pray'd to <hi>Jupiter</hi> to ſtop the Army, and not to neglect but rather maintain the <hi>Roman</hi> Cauſe, which was now in extream danger. This Prayer both wrought a great Reverence in many for their Prince, and a ſtrange reſolution too on the ſudden in their minds. The Place they firſt ſtood at was, where now is the Temple of <hi>Jupiter Stator,</hi> (which may be interpreted the <hi>Stayer)</hi> there they rallied their Forces, and repuls'd the <hi>Sabines</hi> even to the Place call'd now <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi> and the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Veſta;</hi> where both Parties preparing to renew the Fight, were prevented by a ſtrange and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible ſight; for the Daughters of the <note place="margin">Are parted by the Women.</note> 
               <hi>Sabines</hi> which were formerly ſtoln, came running, in great confuſion, ſome on this ſide, ſome on that, with miſerable cryes
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:47090:133"/>
and lamentations, like diſtracted Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, into the midſt of the Army, and among the dead Bodies, to come at their Husbands and at their Fathers, ſome with their young Babes in their Arms, others their Hair looſe about their Ears, but all calling now upon the <hi>Sabines,</hi> then upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> in the moſt tender and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing words. Hereupon both melted into compaſſion, and fell back, that they might ſtand betwixt the Armies. Now did a ſtrange lamentation ſeize all, and great grief was conceiv'd at the ſight of the Women, and at their Speech much more, which from Expoſtulations and high words, ended in Entreaties and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications.</p>

But the Ceremonies that then paſs, render the Original of the thing more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to be gueſs'd at; for there are Goats kill'd, then two young Noblemen's Sons being brought, ſome are to ſtain their Foreheads with the bloody Knife, others preſently to wipe it off with Wool dipt in Milk; then the young Boys muſt laugh after their Foreheads are wiped; that done, having cut the Goats-skins into Thongs, they run about naked, only with ſomething about their middle, laſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

all they meet; the young Wives do never avoid their ſtrokes, fancying it does help Conception and Child-birth. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing is proper to this Feaſt, for the <hi>Luperci</hi> to ſacrifice a Dog. <hi>Butas,</hi> a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Poet, who writ a fabulous account of the <hi>Roman</hi> Cuſtoms in Elegies, ſays, that <hi>Romulus,</hi> after the Conqueſt of <hi>Amulius,</hi> ran joyfully to the Place where the Wolf gave them ſuck, and that in imitation of that, this Feaſt was, and that two young Noblemen ran:
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Striking at all, as when from</hi> Alba <hi>Town,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Romulus <hi>and</hi> Remus <hi>with their Swords did run,</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
And that the bloody Knife applied to their Foreheads, was a ſign of the danger they were then in of being ſlain, and the cleanſing of them in Milk, was in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of their food and nouriſhment. But <hi>Caius Aulius</hi> writes, that before the City was built, the Cattel of <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> on a day going aſtray, they, praying to the God <hi>Faunus,</hi> ran about to ſeek them naked, that they might not be troubled with ſweat, and that for that Reaſon the <hi>Luperci</hi> run naked. And if this Sacrifice be by way of Purification, a Man might gueſs they uſed a Dog for that very pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; for the <hi>Graecians</hi> in their Luſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

But if they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this as an act of Gratitude to the Wolf, that nouriſh'd and preſerv'd <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus,</hi> they do not abſurdly in killing a Dog, as being an Enemy to Wolves, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it is perhaps for hindering the <hi>Luperci</hi> when they run.</p>
            <p>They ſay too, <hi>Romulus</hi> was the firſt that conſecrated holy Fire, and inſtituted holy Virgins, call'd <hi>Veſtals;</hi> others aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe it to <hi>Numa Pompilius;</hi> nevertheleſs they write, <hi>Romulus</hi> was otherwiſe emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently religious, and well skill'd in the Art of Prophecying, and upon that carri'd a <hi>Lituus,</hi> which is a crooked Rod, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Soothſayers deſcribe the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Heavens.

               <hi>Gods of the Earth.</hi> This too is obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as a ſingular thing in <hi>Romulus,</hi> that he appointed no puniſhment for real Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricide, but call'd all Murder ſo, thinking the latter a deteſtable ſin, but the other impoſſible, and for a long time he ſeem'd to have rightly thought ſuch a ſin could never be, for in almoſt 600 years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, no body committed the like in <hi>Rome;</hi> and <hi>Lucius Oſtius,</hi> after the Wars of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> is recorded to have been the firſt Parricide.

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:47090:138"/>
of an open Quarrel betwixt them, for otherwiſe they carried themſelves fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one to another, and adminiſtred Affairs together with the greateſt unanimity. The Relations of them that were ſlain, being debarr'd of juſtice by reaſon of <hi>Tati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> fell upon him as he was ſacrificing with <hi>Romulus</hi> at <hi>Lavinium,</hi> and ſlew him, commending and extolling <hi>Romulus</hi> for a juſt Prince. <hi>Romulus</hi> took the Body of <hi>Tatius,</hi> and buried it very ſplendidly in the <hi>Aventine Mount,</hi> near the Place call'd <hi>Armiluſtrium,</hi> but altogether neglected revenging his Murder. Some Authors write, the City of <hi>Laurentum,</hi> fearing the conſequence, delivered up the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers of <hi>Tatius;</hi> but <hi>Romulus</hi> paſs'd it over, ſaying, One Murder was requited with another. This gave occaſion of Talk and Jealouſie, as if he were well pleas'd at the removal of his Copartner in the Government. Nothing of theſe things either diſturbed or rais'd any Feud among the <hi>Sabines,</hi> but ſome out of Love to him, others out of fear of his Power, ſome again reverencing him as a God, they all lived peacefully in admiration and awe of him; many foreign Nations too did much admire <hi>Romulus;</hi> the ancient <hi>Latines</hi> they ſent, and enter'd into League and Confederacy with him. <hi>Fidenae</hi> he

But when the ſame Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs fell upon <hi>Laurentum,</hi> then every body judged it was divine Vengeance that fell upon both Cities, for the neglect of executing Juſtice, upon the Murder of <hi>Tatius</hi> and the Ambaſſadors. But the Murderers on both ſides being deliver'd up and puniſh'd, the Peſtilence viſibly abated, and <hi>Romulus</hi> purified the Cities with Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, which, they ſay, even now are perform'd at the Gate call'd <hi>Ferentina.</hi>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:47090:139"/>
But before the Plague ceaſed, the <hi>Cameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> invaded the <hi>Romans,</hi> and over-ran the Countrey, thinking, by reaſon of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, they were unable to withſtand them; but <hi>Romulus</hi> preſently made Head againſt them, and gain'd the Victory, with the ſlaughter of 6000 Men; he then took their City, and brought half of them he found there to <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſent from <note place="margin">Cameria <hi>is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</hi>

Extremities of War, but permitted them to be ſlain, ſhould challenge their Lands and Houſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when in the hands of others. But being ſcornfully retorted upon by <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus</hi> in his Anſwers, they divided them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into two Bodies; with one they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd the Garriſon of <hi>Fidenae,</hi> the other march'd againſt <hi>Romulus;</hi> that which went againſt <hi>Fidenae,</hi> got the Victory, and ſlew 2000 <hi>Romans;</hi> the other was worſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Romulus,</hi> with the loſs of 8000 Men.

But what ſome write, that of 14000 that fell that day, above half were ſlain by <hi>Romulus</hi>'s own hand, is both very fabulous and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incredible: Such an Oſtentation do the <hi>Meſſenians</hi> make of <hi>Ariſtomenes,</hi> who, they ſay, offer'd 300 Victims for as many <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> he himſelf ſlew. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my being thus routed, <hi>Romulus</hi> ſuffering thoſe that were left to make their eſcape, drew up his Forces againſt the City; they, having ſuffer'd ſuch great damages, did not venture to oppoſe him, but humbly ſuing to him, contracted a League and Friendſhip for an 100 years; but he never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs

Honeſty and Oath of him that ſpoke it, and a certain divine Paſſion, like an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm, ſeized on all Men, for no body contradicted it, but laying aſide all Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies and Detractions, they prayed to <hi>Quirinus,</hi> and ſaluted him God.</p>
            <p>This is like ſome of the <hi>Graecian</hi> Fables of <hi>Ariſteas</hi> the <hi>Proconneſian,</hi> and <hi>Cleomedes</hi> the <hi>Aſtypalaeian;</hi> for, they ſay, <hi>Ariſteas</hi> died in a Fuller's Work-houſe, and, his Friends coming to him, his Body vaniſh'd; and that ſome preſently after coming a Journey, ſaid, they met him travelling towards <hi>Croton.</hi> And that <hi>Cleomedes,</hi> being an extraordinary ſtrong and gygantic Man, and withal crazed and mad, committed many deſperate Freaks: At laſt in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain School-houſe, ſtriking a Pillar that ſuſtain'd the Roof with his Fiſt, broke it in the middle, ſo the Houſe fell and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the Children in it; and being pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, he fled into a great Cheſt, and ſhutting to the Lid, held it ſo faſt, that many Men with all their ſtrength could not force it open; afterwards breaking the Cheſt to pieces, they found no Man in it alive or dead; at which being aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, they ſent to conſult the Oracle at <hi>Delphi;</hi> to whom the Propheteſs made this Anſwer:</p>
            <p>

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:47090:143"/>
ſhe was carrying to her Grave, vaniſh'd, and a Stone was found lying on the Bier. And many ſuch Improbabilities do your fabulous Writers relate, deifying Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures naturally mortal; tho' altogether to diſown a divine Power, is an unholy and diſingenuous thing; ſo again to mix Heaven and Earth, is as ridiculous; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt reject ſuch Vanities, being aſſur'd that, according to <hi>Pindar,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>All humane Bodies yield to Deaths decree,</l>
                  <l>The Soul ſurvives to all eternity.</l>
               </q>
For that alone is deriv'd from the Gods, thence it comes, and thither it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns: not with the Body, but when it is moſt free and ſeparated from it, and is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together pure and clean, and diſengag'd from the fleſh; for the dry Soul (as <hi>Heracli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> phraſes it) is beſt, which flies out of the Body, as Lightning breaks from a Cloud; but that which is clogg'd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumber'd with the Body, is like a groſs and cloudy Vapour, hard to be kindled and mount on high. We muſt not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, contrary to Nature, ſend the Bodies too of good Men to Heaven; but again we muſt really believe that, according to a divine Nature and Juſtice, their vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Souls are tranſlated out of Men into Heroes; out of Heroes into demi-Gods; out of demi-Gods, (if they are, as by expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, perfectly purg'd and ſanctified, and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:47090:143"/>
disburden'd of all Paſſions attending Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity) they are, not as in any humane Polity alter'd, but really and according to right Reaſon chang'd and tranſlated into Gods, receiving the greateſt and moſt bleſſed perfection.</p>

Some ſay, this was not in imitation of a Flight, but of a quick and haſty Onſet, giving this account of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:47090:144"/>
it: After the <hi>Gauls,</hi> who had taken <hi>Rome,</hi> were driven out by <hi>Camillus,</hi> and the City had not as yet recover'd her ſtrength, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Latines,</hi> under the Command of <hi>Livius Poſthumius,</hi> took this time to march againſt her. The Army ſitting down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Rome,</hi> an Herald was ſent, ſignifying that the <hi>Latines</hi> were deſirous to renew their former Alliance and Affinity, (that was now almoſt decayed) by contracting new Marriages between both Nations; if therefore they would ſend forth a good number of their Virgins and Widows, they ſhould ſettle into a Peace and Friendſhip, as they formerly did with the <hi>Sabines</hi> upon the like Conditions. The <hi>Romans</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, they both dreaded a War, yet thought a Surrender of their Women little better than a meer Captivity. Being in this doubt, a Servant-maid call'd <hi>Philotis,</hi> (or as ſome ſay, <hi>Teutola)</hi> advis'd them to do neither, but rather, by a Stratagem, both to avoid Fighting, and the giving up of ſuch Pledges. The Stratagem was this, that they ſhould ſend her ſelf, with a company of handſom Wenches well dreſs'd, to the Enemy, inſtead of Free-born Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, and ſhe would in the night light up a Torch, at which the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould come arm'd and ſurprize them aſleep. The <hi>Latines</hi> were thus deceiv'd, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly <hi>Philotis</hi> ſet up a Torch in a wild
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:47090:144"/>
               <hi>Fig-tree,</hi> skreening it behind with Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Coverlets from the ſight of the Enemy: But it was plain to the <hi>Romans:</hi> when they ſaw it, they ran furiouſly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether out of the Gates, haſtening one another what they could, ſo falling in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly upon the Enemy, they defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. Upon that they made a Feaſt of Triumph, call'd the <hi>Nones of the Goats,</hi> becauſe of the wild Fig-tree, call'd by the <hi>Romans, Caprificus,</hi> or the Goat-Fig; and they feaſt the Women without the City in Arbors made of Fig-tree boughs, and the Maids meet and run about playing; afterwards they fight in Sport, and throw Stones one at another, in memory they did then aid and aſſiſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Men in Fight. This many Authors do not admit for true: for the calling upon one anothers Names by day, and the going out to the <hi>Goats-Marſh,</hi> as to Sea, ſeems to agree more to the former Relation, unleſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps both the Actions, done at ſeveral times, might have happen'd on the ſame day of the Week.

                  <hi>The Compariſon of</hi> Romulus <hi>and</hi> Theſeus.</head>
               <p>THis is all I ever happen'd to hear of <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Theſeus,</hi> worthy of memory. Firſt, <hi>Theſeus</hi> ſeem'd, out of his own free-will, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any compulſion, when he might have reign'd in ſecurity at <hi>Trazene,</hi> in the enjoyment of no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious Empire, to have affected great Actions by himſelf. The other to eſcape preſent Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and a puniſhment that threatned him, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Plato,)</hi> grew valiant purely out of fear; and dreading the extreameſt Inflictions, attempted great Enterprizes out of meer neceſſity. Again, His greateſt Action was only the killing of one King of <hi>Alba;</hi> whereas the by-Adventures and Preludes of the other were the Conqueſts of <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, Scinnis, Procruſtes</hi> and <hi>Corynetes;</hi> by reducing and killing of whom, he ridded <hi>Greece</hi> of very vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Oppreſſors, before any of them that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, knew who did it; and he might then without any trouble as well have gone to <hi>Athens</hi> by Sea, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering he himſelf never was in the leaſt injured by thoſe Robbers; whereas <hi>Romulus</hi> could not but be in Action whilſt <hi>Amulius</hi> lived. A great teſtimony of this is, that <hi>Theſeus,</hi> for no wrong done himſelf, but for the ſake of others, did fall upon theſe Villains; but <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus,</hi> as long as they themſelves ſuffer'd no ill by the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, permitted him to opprefs all others. And if it be a great thing to have been wounded in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel by the <hi>Sabines,</hi> to have kill'd King <hi>Acron,</hi> and to have conquer'd many Enemies; we may oppoſe to theſe Actions, the Battel with the <hi>Centaurs,</hi> and the Feats done againſt the <hi>Amazons.</hi> But what <hi>Theſeus</hi> adventur'd, in offering himſelf vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily with the other young Boys and Virgins, as part of the Tribute into <hi>Crete,</hi> either to be a
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:47090:145"/>
Prey to a Monſter, or a Victim upon the Tomb of <hi>Androgeus,</hi> or, what is leaſt of all, to live vilely and diſhonourably in ſlavery to inſulting and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el Men; a Man cannot expreſs what an Act of Boldneſs, or Courage, or Juſtice to the Publick, or of Honour and Bravery, that was. So that methinks the Philoſophers did not define Love ill, to be <hi>the ſervice of the Gods in aſſiſting and preſerving Youth;</hi> for the Love of <hi>Ariadne,</hi> above all, ſeems to be the proper work and deſign of ſome God, in order to preſerve <hi>Theſeus;</hi> and indeed we ought not to blame her for loving him, but rather won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all Men and Women were not alike affected towards him; and if ſhe alone were ſo, truly I dare pronounce her worthy of the Love of a God, who was her ſelf ſo great a Lover of Vertue and Goodneſs, and the braveſt Man.</p>
               <p>But both theſe naturally affecting Government, neither lived up to the true Character of a King, but flew off, and ran, one into Popularity, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into Tyranny, falling both into the ſame fault out of different Paſſions. For a Prince's chief end is to preſerve his Empire, which is done no leſs by avoiding Indecencies, than by maintaining a deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum in all things: Who-ever is either too remiſs or too ſtrict in this, is no more a King or a Prince, but either too popular a Man, or too lordly, and ſo becomes either odious or contemptible to his Subjects. This ſeems to be the fault of Eaſineſs and good Nature, the other of Pride and Severity; but if we muſt not in all reſpects impute Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes to the Fates, but conſider in them the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of mens Manners and Paſſions, as the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and inconſiderate effects of Wrath and Anger, a Man can neither excuſe one in his Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to his Brother, nor the other to his Son. Tho' the Anger of <hi>Theſeus</hi> is more excuſable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:47090:146"/>
it proceeded from a greater Cauſe, as being ſtruck with the ſeverer Laſh. <hi>Romulus,</hi> having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreed with his Brother, adviſedly and deliberately upon the Concerns of the Publick, one would think, he could not of the ſudden have been put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſo great paſſion; but Love, and Jealouſie, and the Complaints of his Wife, (which few Men can avoid being provoked with) ſeduced <hi>Theſeus</hi> to commit that Outrage upon his Son. And what is more, <hi>Romulus</hi> in his Anger committed an Action of moſt unfortunate Conſequence; but that of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus</hi> ended only in words, ſome evil-ſpeaking, and a few old Peoples Curſes, the reſt of the Youth's mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery ſeems to proceed from Fortune; ſo that ſo far a Man would give his Vote on <hi>Theſeus</hi>'s part. But the chiefeſt matter in the other is this, that his Performances proceeded from very ſmall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings; for both the Brothers being thought Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and the Sons of Swineherds, before they were Free-men themſelves, they gave liberty to almoſt all the <hi>Latines,</hi> obtaining at once all the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Titles, as deſtroyers of their Countreys Enemies, preſervers of their Friends and Kindred, Princes of the People, Founders, not removers of Cities; for ſuch an one was <hi>Theſeus,</hi> who raiſed and compiled only one Houſe out of many, demoliſhing many Cities bearing the Names of ancient Kings and Heroes. But <hi>Romulus</hi> did the ſame afterwards, forcing his Enemies to deface and ruine their own Dwellings, and to ſojourn with their Conquerors; not altering at firſt or increaſing a City that was before, but building one from the ground, acquiring likewiſe to himſelf, Lands, a Countrey, a Kingdom, Wives, Children, and Relations. He kill'd or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed no body, but encouraged thoſe that wanted Houſes and Dwelling-places, if willing to be of a Society, and become Citizens. Robbers and Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:47090:146"/>
he ſlew not, but he ſubdued Nations, he overthrew Cities, he triumph'd over Kings and Princes; and as to <hi>Remus,</hi> it is doubtful by whoſe Hand he was cut off, it is generally imputed to others. His Mother he apparently retriev'd from death, and placed his Grandfather, who was brought under baſe and diſhonourable Vaſſalage, in the ancient Throne of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> to whom he did voluntarily many good Offices, but never annoyed him, no not through ignorance it ſelf. But <hi>Theſeus,</hi> in his forgetfulneſs and inadvertency of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand concerning the Flag, can ſcarcely methinks by any Excuſes, or before the moſt candid Judges, avoid the imputation of Parricide; which a certain <hi>Athenian</hi> perceiving it very hard to make an excuſe for, feigns that <hi>Aegaeus,</hi> at the arrival of the Ship, running haſtily to a Tower to ſee what News, ſlip'd and fell down, either for want of accidental help, or that no Servants attended him in that haſte to the Sea-ſide. And indeed thoſe faults com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the Rapes of Women, admit of no plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible excuſe in <hi>Theſeus:</hi> Firſt, In regard to the often repetition of the Crime; for he ſtole <hi>Ariadne, Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe, Anaxo</hi> the <hi>Trazaenian,</hi> at laſt <hi>Helena,</hi> when he was an old Man, and ſhe not marriageable, being too young and tender, and he at an Age paſt even lawful Wedlock. Then the Cauſe; for the <hi>Trazaeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Lacedaemonian,</hi> and <hi>Amazonian</hi> Virgins, beſide that they were not betrothed to him, were not worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to raiſe Children by, than the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who were derived from <hi>Ereſtheus</hi> and <hi>Cecrops;</hi> but it is to be ſuſpected, theſe things were done out of luſt, and the ſatisfaction of the fleſh. <hi>Romulus</hi> when he had taken near 800 Women, he choſe not all, but only <hi>Herſilia</hi> (as they ſay) for himſelf, the reſt he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided among the Chief of the City; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, by the reſpect, and tenderneſs, and juſtice
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:47090:147"/>
ſhewn towards them, he diſcovered, that this Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Injury, was a moſt commendable and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick Exploit to eſtabliſh a Society; by which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termix'd and united both Nations, and made it the fountain of all after-Friendſhip, and of Power with them. And that it was the Cauſe of Reverence, and Love, and Conſtancy in Matrimony, time can witneſs; for in 230 years neither any Husband de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted his Wife, nor any Wife her Husband; but, as the moſt curious among the <hi>Graecians</hi> can tell you the firſt Parricide, ſo the <hi>Romans</hi> all well know, that <hi>Spurius Carvilius</hi> was the firſt who put away his Wife, accuſing her of Barrenneſs. The Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Matters do teſtifie for ſo long a time; for upon thoſe Marriages, the two Princes ſhar'd in the Dominion, and both Nations fell under the ſame Government. But from the Marriages of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus</hi> proceeded nothing of Friendſhip or Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for the advantage of Commerce, but Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Wars, and the Slaughter of Citizens, and at laſt the loſs of the City <hi>Aphidnae,</hi> where, only out of the compaſſion of the Enemy, whom they entreated and careſſed like Gods, they but juſt miſs'd ſuffering, what <hi>Troy</hi> did by <hi>Paris. Theſeus</hi> his Mother was not only in danger, but ſuffered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo what <hi>Hecuba</hi> did, in being deſerted and deſtitute of her Son; unleſs that of her Captivity be not a fiction, as I could wiſh both that and moſt other things of him were. What is fabulouſly related concerning both their Divinity, you will find a great difference in it; for <hi>Romulus</hi> was preſerved by the ſpecial Favour of the Gods; but the Oracle gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Aegaeus,</hi> commanding him to abſtain from all ſtrange and foreign Women, ſeems to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, that the Birth of <hi>Theſeus</hi> was not agreeable to the Will of the Gods.</p>

            <p>THere is ſo much incertainty in the accounts which Hiſtorians have left us of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> the Law giver of <hi>Sparta,</hi> that ſcarcely any thing is aſſerted by one of them which is not call'd into queſtion, or contradicted by the reſt. Their ſentiments are quite different as to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily he came of, the Voyages he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took, the place, and manner of his death, but moſt of all when they ſpeak of the Laws

he made, and the Commonwealth which he founded. They cannot by any means be brought to an agreement as to the very Age in which this excellent perſon liv'd: for ſome of them ſay that he flouriſhed in the time of <hi>Iphitus,</hi> and that they two jointly contrived the Ordinance for the ceſſation of Arms during the Solemnity of the <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick</hi> Games. Of this opinion was <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and for confirmation of it he alledges an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription upon one of the copper Coits uſed in thoſe Sports, upon which the name of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> continued undefac'd to his time.

whoſe Life is before us: but as <hi>Eutychidas</hi> ſays, he was the ſixth from <hi>Patrocles,</hi> and the eleventh from <hi>Hercules.</hi> Be this as it will, <hi>Sous</hi> certainly was the moſt renown'd of all his Anceſtours, under whoſe conduct the Spartans ſubdu'd <hi>Ilotos,</hi> and made Slaves of the <hi>Ilotes,</hi> and added to their Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by Conqueſt, a good part of <hi>Arcadia.</hi> There goes a ſtory of this King <hi>Sous,</hi> that
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:47090:150"/>
being beſieged by the Clitorians in a dry and ſtony place, ſo that he could come at no water, he was at laſt conſtrained to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with them upon theſe hard terms, that he would reſtore to them all his Conqueſts, provided that Himſelf <note n="*" place="margin">A ſubtile promiſe.</note> and <hi>all his Men</hi> ſhould drink of a Spring not far diſtant from his Camp: after the uſual Oaths and Ratifications, he call'd his Souldiers toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and offered to him that would forbear drinking half his Kingdom for a reward: their thirſt was ſo much ſtronger than their ambition, that not a man of them was able to forbear: in ſhort, when they had all drank their fill, at laſt comes King <hi>Sous</hi> himſelf to the Spring, and, having ſprinkled his face onely, without ſwallowing one drop, he marched off in the face of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, refuſing to yield up his Conqueſts, becauſe himſelf, and <hi>all his men</hi> (according to the Articles) had not drank of their water.</p>
            <p>Although he was juſtly had in admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as well for his wit and abſtinence as for his warlike exploits, yet was not his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſirnamed from him but from his Son <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rytion,</hi> (of whom they were call'd <hi>Eurytio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides:)</hi> the reaſon of this was, that <hi>Eury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> took a courſe never practis'd by his wiſe Predeceſſours, which was to flatter and cajole his own Subjects, by ſlackening the reigns of the Royal Authority. But

ſee what followed! the people, inſtead of growing more tractable by it, made new encroachments upon him every day: inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that, partly by taking advantages of the too great <hi>eaſineſs</hi> or <hi>neceſſities</hi> of the ſucceeding Princes, partly by tiring out and vexing thoſe which uſed ſeverity, they at laſt brought the Government into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and ſoon after the whole Kingdom into Anarchy and confuſion. In this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable eſtate things continu'd a long time, and amongſt its other tragical effects, it cauſed the death of the Father of <hi>Lycurgus:</hi> for as the good King was endeavouring to quell a riot in which the parties were come to blows, he was among them moſt barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly <note n="†" place="margin">

marry her when he came to the Crown. Though he was extremely incens'd againſt the Woman for this unnatural propoſal, yet wiſely ſmothering his reſentments, and making ſhew of cloſing with her, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd the Meſſenger with a world of thanks, and expreſſions of joy, but withall diſſuaded her earneſtly from procuring her ſelf to miſcarry, becauſe that the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent means uſed in ſuch caſes would impair her health, if not endanger her life: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all aſſuring her, that himſelf would ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, that the Child, as ſoon as born, ſhould be taken <hi>out of the way.</hi> By theſe and ſuch like artifices, having drawn on the Woman to the time of her lying in, as ſoon as ever he heard that ſhe was in labour, he ſent ſome of his Council to be by and obſerve all that paſt, with order, that if it were a Girle they ſhould deliver it to the Women, but if a Boy, that they ſhould bring it to him whereſoever he were, and whatſoever a-doing. It ſo fell out that as he was at Supper with his principal Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, the Queen was brought to bed of a Boy, who was ſoon after preſented to him as he was at the Table: he, taking him tenderly into his arms, ſaid to thoſe about him, behold, my Lords of <hi>Sparta,</hi> here is a King born unto us; this ſaid, he laid him down upon the Chair of State, and nam'd

him <hi>Charilaus;</hi> that is, <hi>the Joy of the people:</hi> becauſe they were ſo much tranſported with joy both at the birth of the young Prince, and the contemplation of the noble Mind and Juſtice of <hi>Lycurgus:</hi> and yet his good reign laſted onely eight months. But <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus</hi> was <hi>in nature</hi> a <hi>Prince,</hi> and there were more who obeyed him upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his eminent Vertues, than becauſe he was Regent to the King, and had the treaſure and ſtrength of the Nation in his hands. Yet could not all this <hi>enſure</hi> him from envy, which made a puſh at him (as <note place="margin">Lycurgus <hi>envied.</hi>
               </note> is uſual) before he was well ſettled in his high Truſt; the Heads of this Faction were the Kindred and Creatures of the Queen-mother, who pretended not to have been dealt with ſutably to her quality; and her Brother <hi>Leonidas,</hi> in a warm debate which fell out betwixt him and <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> went ſo far as to tell him to his face, <hi>that he was very well aſſured that e'er long he ſhould ſec him King;</hi> by this reflecting inſinuation he endeavour'd to make the people jealous of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> thus preparing the way for an accuſation of him, as though he had made away with his Nephew, if he ſhould chance to fail, though by a natural death; words of the like import were deſignedly caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad by the Queen-mother and her adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:47090:152"/>
Being exceedingly troubled at this, and not knowing what it might come to, he thought it his wiſeſt courſe to decline their envy by a voluntary exile, and ſo tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel from place to place untill his Nephew came to marriageable years, and by having a Son had ſecured the Succeſſion: ſetting <note place="margin">Lycurgus <hi>his Travels.</hi>
               </note> ſail therefore with this reſolution, he firſt arrived at <hi>Crete,</hi> where having conſidered their ſeveral Forms of Government, and got an acquaintance with the principal men amongſt them, ſome of their Laws he very much approv'd of, and reſolv'd to make uſe of them in his own Country, and a good part of them he rejected as uſeleſs. Amongſt the perſons there the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown'd for their ability and wiſedom in State matters was one <hi>Thales,</hi> whom <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus,</hi> by repeated importunities and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of Friendſhip, at laſt perſuaded to go over to <hi>Lacedaemon.</hi> When he came thither, by his outward appearance and character, he ſeem'd no other than a Lyrick Poet, but in reality he perform'd the part of one of the ableſt Law-givers in the world: the very Songs which he compos'd were pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical exhortations to obedience and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord: The ſweetneſs of the Meaſures and the cadence of the Verſe, ſuting with the Subject, both ſerious and delightfull, had ſo great an influence on their minds, that
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:47090:152"/>
they were inſenſibly ſoftned and civiliz'd: inſomuch that at laſt they renounced their private feuds and animoſities, which had kept them ſo long at variance to their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable diſadvantage, and re-united them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into a cheerfull and unanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence for the publick welfare: ſo that it may truly be ſaid that <hi>Thales</hi> prepared the way for <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> by removing the rubbiſh and clearing the ground-plot, that he might raiſe upon it the laſting Fabrick of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Crete</hi> he ſailed to <hi>Aſia,</hi> with deſign (as is ſaid) to examin the difference betwixt the Manners and Government of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans (who were very wiſe and temperate) and thoſe of the Ionians, a corrupt and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate people: as Phyſicians, by the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition they find betwixt a healthfull and ſickly body, are enabled to diſtinguiſh the ſwelling of a Dropſie from a good and thriving habit, and a real health from that which but appears ſo. Here had he the firſt ſight of <hi>Homer</hi>'s Works, which were <note place="margin">Homer<hi>'s Works brought to light by</hi> Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus.</note> preſerved in all probability by the poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Cleobulus:</hi> and having obſerv'd that the few looſe expreſſions and actions of ill example which are to be found in his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems, were very much out-weigh'd by thoſe grave maxims of State and rules of Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (which are frequently couch'd under
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:47090:153"/>
thoſe very Fictions) he ſet himſelf eagerly to tranſcribe and digeſt them into order, as thinking they would be of good uſe in his own Country: and to his immortal honour be it ſaid, he was the firſt who brought the Works of this moſt admirable Poet into credit in <hi>Greece:</hi> for though ſome fragments of them lay ſcattered before in a few private hands (who ſet a great value upon them,) yet were they never publiſhed together, nor generally admired, before the time of <hi>Lycurgus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Aegyptians ſay that he took a Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and that, being much ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <note place="margin">This Story of the Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by ſome Greek Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</note> with their way of ſeparating the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery from their Handy-crafts and Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks, he reſolv'd to imitate them at <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemon:</hi> and this diſtinction of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, as it prevented <hi>confuſion,</hi> it encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and cauſing <hi>regularity,</hi> added <hi>beauty</hi> to the State. But as for his Voyages into <hi>Spain, Africk,</hi> and the <hi>Indies,</hi> and his conferences there with the <hi>Gymnoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtes,</hi> the whole relation (as far as I can find) reſts on the ſingle credit of <hi>Ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> the Son of <hi>Hipparchus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During the abſence of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> though he was cheaply parted with, he was dearly miſs'd at <hi>Lacedaemon,</hi> and a great many Embaſſies were ſent to pray his return, for Kings indeed we have (ſaid they) who wear
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:47090:153"/>
the marks and aſſume the titles of Royalty, but as for the inward qualities of their minds, they have nothing by which they are to be diſtinguiſh'd from their Subjects: adding, that in him alone was the true foundation of Sovereignty to be ſeen, a Nature made to Rule, and a <hi>Genius</hi> of that ſtrength that it made him at the ſame time <hi>lov'd</hi> and <hi>reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced</hi> by the people. Though this ſeem'd a little to reflect, yet were not the Kings themſelves averſe from his return, for they look'd upon his preſence as a bulwark for them againſt the growing inſolencies of the people.</p>
            <p>Things being in this poſture at his return, <note place="margin">His return and the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations he made.</note> he apply'd himſelf without loſs of time to a through Reformation, and reſolv'd to change the whole face of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: for what could a few particular Laws and a partial alteration avail, when there was an univerſal corruption of all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and degrees of men in the State? He took therefore the courſe wiſe Phyſicians uſe, when they have to doe with one who labours under a complication of Diſeaſes, they are not content to obviate one or two of them, but follow him with purges and letting bloud, untill they have quite drain'd him of the peccant humours, and exhauſted the corrupt maſs of his bloud; this done, they reſtore him by degrees, and preſcribe
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:47090:154"/>
a regimen of Diet quite contrary to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: the Reader will eaſily make the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. Having thus projected things, away he goes to <hi>Delphi</hi> to conſult <hi>Apollo</hi> there, which having done, and offered his Sacrifice, he returned with that renowned Oracle, in which he is call'd Beloved of <note place="margin">
                  <hi>This Oracle is extant at length in</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus.</note> God, and rather God than Man; that his Prayers were heard, that his Laws ſhould be the beſt, and the Commonwealth which obſerved them the moſt famous in the world. Encouraged by theſe things, he ſet himſelf to bring over to his ſide the leading men of <hi>Sparta,</hi> exhorting them to give him a helping hand in this great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking: he broke it firſt to his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar friends, and then by degrees he gained others, at laſt he animated them all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to put his deſign in execution. When things were ripe for action he gave order to thirty of the principal men of <hi>Sparta</hi> to be ready arm'd at the Market-place by break of the day, to the end that he might ſtrike a terrour into the oppoſite party: <hi>Hermip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> hath ſet down the names of twenty of the moſt eminent of them; but the name of him whom <hi>Lycurgus</hi> moſt confided in, and who was of moſt uſe to him, both in making his Laws and putting them in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, was <hi>Arithmiadas.</hi> Things growing to a tumult, King <hi>Charilaus</hi> apprehending
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:47090:154"/>
that it was a Conſpiracy againſt his Perſon, took Sanctuary in the Temple of <hi>Minerva</hi> the Protectreſs; being ſoon after undecei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and put in heart again, and having taken an Oath of them that they had no treaſonable deſigns, he quitted his Refuge, and himſelf alſo entred into the confederacy with them: of ſo gentle and flexible a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition he was, and almoſt too good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd for a King: to which <hi>Archelaus</hi> his Partner in the Government alluded, when hearing him highly extoll'd for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he ſaid, how can he be otherwiſe than a gracious Prince, for he is good even to the worſt of men?</p>
            <p>Amongſt the many changes and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which <hi>Lycurgus</hi> made, the firſt and of greateſt importance was the eſtabliſhment of the Senate, which having a power equal to the Kings in matters of great conſequence did (as <hi>Plato</hi> expreſſes it) with its phlegm allay and qualifie the hot complexion of a Monarchy, ſerv'd as a Rampart againſt the inſolence of the people, and always kept the Commonwealth in <hi>good temper.</hi> For the State which before had no firm Baſis to ſtand upon, but lean'd one while towards an abſolute Monarchy (when the Kings had the upper hand) and another while towards a pure Democracy (when the people had the better of it) found in this eſtabliſhment
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:47090:155"/>
of the Senate a counterpoiſe, which always kept things in a juſt <hi>aequilibrium.</hi> For the Twenty Eight always adhered to the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker ſide, and put themſelves like a weight into the lighter Scale, untill they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the other to a Ballance. As for the determinate number of Twenty Eight, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is of opinion that it ſo fell out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe two of the Aſſociates for want of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage fell off from the enterpriſe; but <hi>Sphae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> aſſures us that there were but twenty eight of the Confederates at firſt: perhaps there is ſome myſtery in the number which conſiſts of ſeven multiply'd by four, and is the firſt of perfect numbers after ſix, being, as that is, equal to its ſides. For my part, I cannot believe that <hi>Lycurgus</hi> had any ſuch niceties in his head, but pitch'd upon the number of Twenty Eight, that, the two Kings being reckoned amongſt them, they might be Thirty in all. So eagerly ſet was <hi>Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> upon this Eſtabliſhment invented by himſelf, that he took a Journey to <hi>Delphi</hi> to credit it by the approbation of the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, who gave him the famous <hi>Rhetra,</hi> or fundamental Statute, which runs thus. <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>

The people then being thus aſſembled in the open air, it was not allow'd to any one of their order to give his advice, but onely either to ratifie or reject what ſhould be propounded to them by the King or Senate. But becauſe it fell out afterwards that the people made gloſſes and explanations of Laws contrary to the intent of the Kings and Senate, and ſometimes too by adding or raſing out whole Sentences perverted the ſenſe, King

For indeed the Prerogative being thus kept within ſome reaſonable bounds, <hi>at once</hi> he freed himſelf from the envy, and ſecur'd himſelf from the danger, to which an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited juriſdiction lies expoſed. So that the Spartan Kings fared much better after it than their neighbours at <hi>Meſſene</hi> and <hi>Argos;</hi> who by ſcrewing their Prerogative too high, crack'd it, and for want of yielding a little to the populacy, loſt all.</p>
            <p>Indeed, whoſoever ſhall take a proſpect of the Seditions and civil Wars which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell theſe bordering Nations, (to whom they were as near related in bloud as ſituation) will find good reaſon to admire the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found wiſedom and providence of <hi>Lycurgus;</hi> for theſe three States in their firſt riſe were equal, or, if there were any odds they lay on the ſide of the Meſſenians and Argives, who in the deciſion of the Country were more
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:47090:157"/>
fortunate than the Spartans: yet was their flouriſh but of ſmall continuance, ſoon fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into confuſion, partly by the tyrannical diſpoſition of their Kings, and partly by the ungovernableneſs of the people: ſo that now their ſervile and diſgracefull condition makes it appear to the whole world, that it is one of the greateſt bleſſings which heaven can ſend down upon any Nation, to give them ſo wiſe a Law-giver who could ſet bounds to thoſe two interſering powers, and of ſuch jarring elements frame an orderly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. But of this I ſhall ſay more in its due place.</p>
            <p>After the creation of the thirty Senatours his next task, and indeed the moſt hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous he ever undertook, was the making a new diviſion of their Lands. For there was a very ſtrange inequality amongſt the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Sparta,</hi> ſo that the City was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with a multitude of beggarly and neceſſitous perſons, whilſt the Lands and Money were engroſſed by a few: therefore to the end that he might baniſh out of the State Luxury and Arrogance (the vices of the rich,) and Envy and Knavery, (the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al faults of the poor) and the ſource of all miſchiefs, Want and Superfluity, he obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of them to renounce their properties, and to conſent to a new diviſion of the Land: that they ſhould live all with the equality
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:47090:157"/>
and friendlineſs of co-heirs and Brothers: ſo that there being no other way left to mount to a degree of eminence above the reſt than to become more valiant and more vertuous than they, <hi>ambition began to be a good ſubject,</hi> and ſet men upon the uſe of thoſe means by which true honour is to be acquir'd.</p>
            <p>Having got their conſent to his propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals he immediately put them in execution: and having exactly ſurvey'd the whole Country of <hi>Laconia,</hi> he divided it into thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand equal ſhares, and the Liberties of the City of <hi>Sparta</hi> into nine thouſand, and theſe he diſtributed to the Inhabitants of the City, as he did the others to them who dwelt in the Country. Some Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours ſay that he made but ſix thouſand lots for the Citizens of <hi>Sparta,</hi> and that King <hi>Polydore</hi> added three thouſand more. Others ſay that <hi>Polydore</hi> doubled the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Lycurgus</hi> had made, which (according to them) was but four thouſand five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. A lot was ſo much as to yield one year with another about ſeventy Buſhels of Grain, for the Maſter of the Family, and twelve for his Wife, with a ſutable propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Oil and Wine. And this he thought ſufficient to keep their bodies in good health and luſty, and as for ſuperfluities he deſign'd wholly to retrench them. It is reported
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:47090:158"/>
that as he returned from a Journey ſome time after the diviſion of the Lands, in har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt time, the ground being newly reap'd, obſerving the Sheaves to be all equal, and the Shocks of the ſame bigneſs, he ſmiling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid to thoſe about him, methinks <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemon</hi> is like the inheritance of a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Brothers, which have newly made a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion amongſt themſelves.</p>
            <p>Not contented with this, he reſolv'd to make a diviſion of their Movables too, that there might be no odious diſtinction or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality left amongſt them; but finding that it would be very dangerous to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it openly, he bethought himſelf of this ſtratagem. He commanded that all Gold and Silver Coin ſhould be cry'd down, and that onely a ſort of Money made of Iron ſhould be current, whereof a great weight and quantity was but very little worth: ſo that to lay up twenty or thirty pounds there was requir'd a pretty large Chamber, and to remove it, nothing leſs than a yoke of Oxen. By this invention, it is ſcarcely to be imagin'd, how many exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable Vices were baniſh'd <hi>Lacedaemon:</hi> for who would rob another of ſuch a ſcurvy ſort of Coin? who would injuſtly detein it? who would cheat and circumvent, be brib'd or turn Knight of the Poſt to compaſs it? when that it was not eaſie to be hid
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:47090:158"/>
when a man had it, nor brought a man any credit in the world by the poſſeſſion of it, nor could ſerve for any uſe when you had cut it in pieces: for when it was red hot and juſt ſtamp'd, they quench'd it in Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and by that means made it almoſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malleable by its hardneſs.</p>
            <p>In the next place he baniſh'd all Arts that were not abſolutely neceſſary; but here he might almoſt have ſpar'd his Proclamation: for they of themſelves would have gone after the Gold and Silver, the money which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd being not ſo proper payment for cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Pieces: for being of Iron it was ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly portable, neither if they ſhould take ſo much pains as to export it, would it paſs amongſt the other Grecians, who were ſo far from valuing it that they thought it one of the moſt ridiculous things in the world. Thus was foreign Traffick almoſt utterly cut off, for neither could the Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans buy any Merchandiſe of Strangers, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did any Merchants think it worth the while to bring in their Goods to any part of <hi>Laconia.</hi> For the ſame reaſon, they were not peſtered with any <hi>pedantical</hi> Teachers of Rhetorick, with Gypſies, Fortune-tellers, and Calculatours of Nativities; No pimping corrupters of youth brought their Ladies of compoſition, or their Boys to be unnatural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abus'd there; no Gold-ſmiths and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravers,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:47090:159"/>
no Jewellers and Perfumers were to be found amongſt them, <hi>for there was no money:</hi> ſo that Luxury being depriv'd of that which fed and fomented it (being quite ſtarv'd out) was forc'd to quit their Country, and ſeek it ſelf one elſewhere. For the rich had no preeminence here over the poor, and their riches and abundance, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no opportunity of appearing and boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of it ſelf in publick, were forced to remain uſeleſs at home, a <hi>coſtly prey</hi> to the ruſt and the moth. Their thoughts being thus taken off from things ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, they became excellent Artiſts in thoſe which were neceſſary: ſo that Bedſteads, Chairs and Tables, and ſuch like ſtaple U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſils in a Family, were admirably well made there: particularly their Cup was very much in faſhion, and bought up by Souldiers, as <hi>Critias</hi> reports, for the colour and thickneſs of the Cup hindred the mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs of the dirty water (which upon mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches muſt often be drunk) from being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: and the figure of it was ſuch that the mud ſank to the bottom, or ſtuck to the ſides, ſo that onely the pureſt part of the water came to the mouth of him that drank in it. And this skill of theirs, though in minute things, was mainly owing to their Law-giver, who took off their minds from the endleſs care of providing the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:47090:159"/>
means and inſtruments of Luxury, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend onely to thoſe things which were of daily and indiſpenſable uſe.</p>
            <p>The laſt and moſt maſterly ſtroke of this excellent Philoſopher, by which he ſtruck at the very roots of Luxury, and extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated utterly the deſire of riches, was the Ordinance he made that they ſhould all eat in common, of the ſame meat, and of ſuch kinds as were ſpecify'd in the Decree: by which it was expreſly forbid to pamper themſelves in private, to uſe rich Couches, and magnificent Tables, abuſing the labours of excellent Workmen, and <hi>delivering</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up into the hands of their Butchers and Cooks, who us'd to <hi>cramme</hi> them in corners as they fatted up the <hi>Beaſts</hi> and the <hi>Poultery</hi> they fed on: by this way of life their manners were not onely corrupted but their bodies too were enfeebled, ſo that giving the rein to their ſenſual appetites they ſtood in need of long ſleep and hot <hi>Bagnio's,</hi> and, in a word, of as much care and attendance as if they were continually <hi>ſick.</hi> It was certainly an extraordinary thing to have brought about ſuch an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe as this, but a greater yet to have ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the frugality of their publick Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, that their riches ſhould be privileg'd from the hands of rapine, nay rather (as <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> obſerves) ſhould be utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded,

For the rich be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oblig'd to partake of the ſame fare with the poor, they could not make uſe of, or enjoy their choice viands, nor ſo much as pleaſe their vain humours, by making a ſhew and vaunting of them to the world. So that the common Proverb that <hi>Plutus</hi> (the God of Riches) is blind, was no where ſo literally verify'd as in <hi>Sparta:</hi> for there he was kept continually <hi>blind,</hi> or rather like a dead Carcaſe, ſenſeleſs, motionleſs, as when he lay <hi>wrapt</hi> up in the dark <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails</hi> of the earth. Nor could they take any refection in private before they came to the publick Halls, for every one had an eye upon them who did not eat and drink with a good ſtomach, and reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched them with the name of dainty and effeminate.</p>
            <p>This laſt Ordinance bore very hard upon the wealthier ſort of men, ſo that being out of all patience they made an inſurrection againſt <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> and from ill words came to blows, ſo that at length he was forced to run out of the Aſſembly, and make to Sanctuary to ſave his life: by good hap he got before all the reſt, excepting one <hi>Alcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> (a young Gentleman otherwiſe not ill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd, but too haſty and cholerick) who
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:47090:160"/>
came up ſo cloſe to him, as that, whilſt he turn'd himſelf about to ſee who was near him, he ſtruck him upon the face, and beat out one of his eyes. The incomparable <hi>Philoſopher</hi> was ſo far from being daunted and diſcouraged by this accident, that he ſtop'd ſhort, and ſhew'd his reverend face all in a gore bloud to his ingratefull Country-men: they were ſo ſtrangely ſurpris'd and aſham'd to ſee it, that they immediately begg'd pardon, offer'd him any ſort of repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and delivered <hi>Alcander</hi> into his hands to be puniſhed as he ſhould think fit. <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> having thank'd them for their care of his perſon, diſmiſs'd them all, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting onely <hi>Alcander;</hi> taking him with him into his Houſe he neither did nor ſaid any thing ſeverely to him, but diſmiſſing thoſe whoſe place it was, he ordered <hi>Alcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> to wait upon him at Table: the young man, though not uſed to ſervile employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, without murmuring or repining did as he was commanded: being thus near him he had opportunity to obſerve in him (beſides the natural goodneſs and mildneſs of his temper) an extraordinary ſobriety in his diet, and a ſtrength of complexion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from it, which no labours and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues were able to ſurmount. He was ſo raviſh'd with admiration of theſe excellent qualities, that of an enemy he became one
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:47090:161"/>
of his moſt zealous admirers, and told his Friends and Relations, that <hi>Lycurgus</hi> was not that <hi>moroſe</hi> and <hi>ill-natur'd</hi> man whom they had formerly took him for, but of the ſweeteſt and moſt <hi>Gentleman-like</hi> diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the world. And thus did <hi>Lycurgus</hi> (for <hi>chaſtiſement</hi> of his fault) make of a wild and diſſolute young man one of the diſcreeteſt Citizens of <hi>Sparta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In memory of this accident <hi>Lycurgus</hi> built a Temple to <hi>Minerva,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilete,</hi> from a word which in the <hi>Dorick</hi> Dialect ſignifies the preſerver of the ſight: for ſome Authours, of which <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> is one (who wrote a Treatiſe of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of <hi>Sparta)</hi> ſay that he was wounded indeed, but did not loſe his eye with the blow: and this was the cauſe of the dedication of that Temple. Be this as it will, certain it is, that this miſadventure was the cauſe that the Lacedemonians ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bring any arms, no not ſo much as a ſtaff into their publick Aſſemblies.</p>
            <p>But to return to their publick repaſts, which had ſeveral names in Greek: for the Candiots call'd them '<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, that is, Feaſts of Love, becauſe that
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:47090:161"/>
by eating and drinking together they had opportunity of making Friends. To put in my own conjecture, perhaps they were ſimply call'd '<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (Eating-houſes) for ſuch the word is by the ſubtraction of one let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. They met by companies of Fifteen, over or under, and each of them ſtood bound to bring in monthly a Buſhel of Meal, eight Galons of Wine, five Pounds of Cheeſe, two Pounds and an half of Figs, for their deſſert, and a little Money to buy Fleſh and Fiſh withall. Beſides this, when any of them made Sacrifice to the Gods they always ſent a dole to the Common-hall: and likewiſe when any one of them had been a Hunting, he ſent thither a part of the Veniſon he had kill'd, and theſe two were the onely allowable excuſes for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping at home. This cuſtom of eating to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether was obſerv'd ſtrictly for a great while afterwards: inſomuch that <hi>Agis,</hi> King of <hi>Lacedaemon,</hi> having vanquiſh'd the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, and ſending for his Commons at his return home, becauſe he deſired to eat pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately with his Queen, was refus'd by the <hi>Polemarchi:</hi> which refuſal, when he reſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo much as to omit the Euchariſtical Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices which uſed to be made for a War happily ended, they were ſo far from ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his pardon, that they ſet a fine upon his head, and obliged him to pay it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:47090:162"/>
They us'd to ſend their Children to theſe Tables as to Schools of temperance and good husbandry: here they were inſtructed in State-affairs, not by mercenary <hi>Pedants,</hi> but, by experienced <hi>Stateſmen:</hi> here they learn'd the art of Converſation, to <hi>droll</hi> without <hi>reflecting,</hi> and to make jeſts at the <hi>coſt</hi> of no man's reputation: and withall to take a jeſt with the ſame innocence and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concernedneſs that they gave one. In this point of good breeding the Lacedemonians exceeded all the people of <hi>Greece:</hi> but if any man were out of humour, or was not of a nature to bear a jeſt, upon the leaſt hint given there was no more to be ſaid to him: it was cuſtomary alſo for the eldeſt man in the company to tell each of them, as they came in, <hi>Look ye, Sir, not a word ſaid in company muſt go out of this Door,</hi> and withall he pointed to it. When any one had a deſire to be admitted into any of theſe little Societies he was to go through this manner of probation: each man in the company took a little ball of ſoft bread (a cuſtom much like that of <hi>bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotting</hi> in other places) which they were to throw into a deep Baſin, which a waiter carried round upon his head: thoſe that lik'd the perſon to be choſen drop'd their Ball into the Baſin without altering the figure; and thoſe who diſliked him preſs'd
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:47090:162"/>
it betwixt their fingers, and made it flat: and this ſignify'd as much as a <hi>negative</hi> voice; for if there were but one of theſe flatted pieces in the Baſin the Suiter was rejected: ſo curious they were in the choice of their company, and ſo tender of diſgu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting any one member in it, by taking in a man unacceptable to him. Their principal Diſh was a ſort of black Broth, which was ſo much valued that the elderly ſort fed onely upon that, leaving what fleſh there was to the younger ſort.</p>
            <p>They ſay that a certain King of <hi>Pontus,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The ſame ſtory is told of</hi> Dionyſius <hi>the Tyrant.</hi> Cic. Tuſc.</note> having heard much of this black Broth of theirs, ſent for a Lacedemonian Cook on purpoſe to make him ſome: he had no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner taſted it but he found it was abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable: the Cook ſeeing him out of conceit with it, told him: <hi>Sir, to make this Broth reliſh you ſhould have bath'd your ſelf firſt in the River of</hi> Eurotas.</p>
            <p>Having eaten and drank thus moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly every man went to his home without <hi>lights;</hi> for the uſe of them was utterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, to the end that they might accuſtom themſelves to march boldly in the dark. And ſuch was the order and faſhion of their Meals.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lycurgus</hi> would never reduce his Laws into writing, nay it is expreſly forbid in the <hi>Rhetra;</hi> for he thought that the moſt
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:47090:163"/>
material points, and ſuch as moſt directly tended to the publick welfare, being <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed</hi> on the hearts of their youth by a good education, and by a conſtant and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual obſervance of them, becoming a <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> nature, would ſupply the place of a <hi>Law</hi> and Law-giver in them all the reſt of their lives: and as for things of leſſer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, as pecuniary contracts, and ſuch like, the forms of which ought to be chang'd as occaſion requires, and in tract of time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come inſufficient for the ends they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for, he thought it the beſt way to leave them to every man's diſcretion, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe no certain form at all: he left there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no inviolable cuſtom in ſuch caſes, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that the manner and form of bargai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſhould be altered according to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of time, and determinations of men of the ſoundeſt judgment. For he was perſuaded that without good educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the beſt Laws in the world ſignify'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and where that was they were in a manner ſuperfluous.</p>
            <p>One branch then of the <hi>Rhetra</hi> was that their Laws ſhould not be written, another branch of it is particularly levell'd againſt Luxury and expenſiveneſs: for by it it was ordained, That the Ceilings of their Houſes ſhould onely be wrought by the Ax, and their Gates and Doors ſmooth'd onely by
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:47090:163"/>
the Saw. And this was not without my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery: for if <hi>Epaminondas</hi> could ſay with ſo good a grace, inviting ſome Friends to his Table, <hi>Come, Gentlemen, be ſecure, Treaſon would never come to ſuch a poor Dinner as this;</hi> why might not this great Law-giver in all probability have thought that ſuch ill-favour'd Houſes would never be capable of receiving Luxury and ſuperfluity? For a man muſt have a more than ordinary ſhare of folly that would furniſh ſuch Rooms with embroidered Beds, and Hangings of Arras, that would be ſerv'd in Plate upon a rough-hewn Table, and pretend to <hi>pomp</hi> and <hi>magnificence</hi> in a Houſe which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt too narrow for the <hi>neceſſities</hi> of life. And doubtleſs he had good reaſon to think that they would proportion their Beds to their Houſe, and their Coverlets to their Beds, and that the reſt of their Goods and Furniture would be ſutable to them. It is reported that King <hi>Leotichidas,</hi> the firſt of that name, was ſo little uſed to the ſight of carv'd Work, that, being entertain'd at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> in a ſtately Room, he was much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd to ſee the Timber and Ceiling ſo fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrought, and asked his Hoſt, <hi>whether the Trees grew ſo in his Country?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A third Ordinance of this forementioned <hi>Rhetra</hi> was, That they ſhould not make War often, or long, with the ſame Enemy,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:47090:164"/>
leſt that they ſhould train and inſtruct them in the art of War by having often to doe with them: and by forcing them to defend themſelves, at length teach them to be the aggreſſours: and for breaking this Law was <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> much blamed a long time after, by making ſuch continual incurſions into <hi>Boeotia,</hi> that at length he taught that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to make head againſt the Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: and therefore <hi>Antalcidas,</hi> ſeeing him wounded one day, ſaid to him, that he was very well paid for making the Thebans good Souldiers whether they would or no. And theſe Laws were called the <hi>Rhetra,</hi> that is to ſay, not inventions of Man's Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but Divine Sanctions and Revelations from Heaven.</p>
            <p>In order to the good Education of their Youth (which, as I ſaid before, he thought the moſt important and nobleſt Work of a Law-giver) he went ſo far back as to take into conſideration their very Conception and Birth, by regulating their Marriages. For <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> wrongs the memory of this excellent Perſon, by bearing us in hand, <note place="margin">Pol. <hi>lib.</hi> 7.</note> that, after he had try'd all manner of ways to reduce the Women to more modeſty and ſobriety, he was at laſt forced to leave them as they were: becauſe that in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of their Husbands, who ſpent the beſt part of their lives in the Wars, their Wives
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:47090:164"/>
made themſelves abſolute Miſtreſſes at home, and would be treated with as much reſpect as if they had been ſo many Queens. But by his good leave it is a miſtake; for he took for that Sex too all the care that was poſſible: for an inſtance of it he ordered the Maidens to exerciſe themſelves with Wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, Running, throwing the Bar and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting the Dart, to the end that the Fruit they conceived might take deeper root, and grow ſtrong, and ſpread it ſelf in ſtrong and healthy Bodies; and withall that they might be the more able to undergo the pains of Child-bearing. And to the end he might take away their over-great tenderneſs, and that <hi>acquired</hi> womaniſhneſs which vain cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom hath added to the <hi>natural,</hi> he ordered that they ſhould go naked as well as the young Men, and dance too in that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at their ſolemn Feaſts and Sacrifices, ſinging certain Songs, whilſt the young Men ſtood in a ring about them, ſeeing and hearing them: in theſe Songs they now and then gave a ſatyrical glance upon thoſe who had miſ-behaved themſelves in the Wars; and ſometimes ſang encomiums up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe who had done any gallant action, and by theſe means enflamed the younger ſort with an emulation of their glory. Thoſe that were thus commended went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way brave and well ſatisfy'd with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:47090:165"/>
and thoſe who were rally'd were as ſenſibly touch'd with it as if they had been formally and ſeverely reprimanded, and ſo much the more, becauſe the Kings and whole Court ſaw and heard all that paſs'd. Now though it may ſeem ſtrange that Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhould appear thus naked in publick, yet may it be ſaid that <hi>true</hi> modeſty was obſerv'd and wantonneſs excluded; they were ſufficiently clad in their <hi>native</hi> innocence and ſimplicity, and wore the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the lovely original couple. The end of their exerciſe was to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more active and vigorous, to the end that they might bear away the prize one from another, and at laſt come to diſpute it with the Men. From hence came that ſenſe of honour and nobleneſs of ſpirit, of which we have an inſtance in <hi>Gorgo,</hi> the Wife of King <hi>Leonidas,</hi> who being told, in diſcourſe with ſome foreign Ladies, that the Women of <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> were they onely of the world who had an Empire over the Men, ſhe briskly reparty'd, that there was good reaſon, for they were the onely Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who brought forth Men. Laſtly, theſe publick proceſſions of the Maidens, and their appearing naked in their exerciſes and dancings, were provocations and baits to ſtir up and allure the young Men to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: and that, not upon <hi>Geometrical rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:47090:165"/>
(as <hi>Plato</hi> calls them) ſuch as Intereſt, and equality of Fortune and Birth, but from the <hi>ſweet</hi> conſtraint and unſophiſticated dictates of nature, from that <hi>myſterious</hi> agreement and <hi>ſympathy</hi> of minds which alone can make men happy in a married eſtate. Beſides this, that he might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Marriage more effectually, thoſe who continued Batchelours were made infamous by Law; for they were excluded from the ſight of thoſe publick proceſſions in which the young Men and Maidens danc'd naked: nay, the Officers compell'd them to march naked themſelves round the Market-place in the very depth of Winter, ſinging a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Song to their own diſgrace, that they juſtly ſuffer'd this puniſhment for diſobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Laws. Moreover they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of that reſpect and obſervance which the younger ſort were oblig'd to pay to their elders: and therefore no man found fault with what was ſaid to <hi>Dercyllidas,</hi> a great Captain, and one who had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Armies; who, as he came into the place of Aſſembly, a young man, inſtead of riſing and making room for him, told him, Sir, you muſt not expect that honour from me being young, which cannot be return'd to me by a Child of yours when I am old.</p>

Such reaſons may be alledg'd in favour of this Paradox of <hi>Lycurgus;</hi> but this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that ſo long as theſe Ordinances were obſerv'd, the Women there were ſo far from that ſcandalous Liberty which hath ſince been objected to them, that they knew not what the name of Adultery meant. A proof of this we have in <hi>Geradas,</hi> a very ancient Spartan, who being ask'd by a ſtranger, what puniſhment their Law had appointed for Adulterers, he anſwer'd, there are no Adulterers in our Country: but, replyed the ſtranger, ſuppoſe there were one, and the crime prov'd againſt him, how would you puniſh him? he anſwer'd, that the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender muſt pay to the Plaintiff a Bull with a Neck ſo long as that he might drink of the River that ran at the foot of <hi>Taygetus</hi> over the top of the Mountain: the man being ſurpris'd at this ſaid, why, 'tis impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to find ſuch a Bull; <hi>Geradas</hi> ſmilingly reply'd, 'twas juſt as poſſible to find an Adulterer in <hi>Sparta.</hi> And ſo much I had to ſay of their Marriages.</p>

Their Nurſes too were ſo carefull and experienc'd that, without uſing Swadling-bands, their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were all ſtreight, well proportion'd and beautifull; and beſides they us'd them to any ſort of meat, and ſometimes to bear the want of it, not to be afraid of the dark,

or to be alone, nor to be wayward, and peeviſh, and crying, as they are generally in other Countries, through the imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent care and fondneſs of thoſe who look to them. Upon this account Spartan Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were often bought up, or hir'd by people of other Countries: and it is reported that ſhe who ſuckled <hi>Alcibiades</hi> was a Spartan: but if he was fortunate in his Nurſe he was not ſo in his School-maſter: for his Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian <hi>Pericles</hi>

            <p>Nor was it lawfull for the Father himſelf to breed up the Children after his own fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; but as ſoon as they were ſeven years old they were to be enroll'd in certain Companies and Claſſes, where they all liv'd under the ſame Orders and Diſcipline, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their exerciſes, and recreating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <note place="margin">Their Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes.</note> together. Of theſe, he who ſhew'd the moſt conduct and courage, was made Captain; they had their eyes always upon him, obeyed his orders, and underwent patiently whatſoever puniſhment he inflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: ſo that the whole courſe of their edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:47090:169"/>
was one continued exerciſe of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and perfect obedience. The old men too were Spectatours of their performances, and oft-times hatch'd quarrels, and ſet them together by the ears, that by thoſe <hi>early</hi> indications they might perfectly learn their natures, and know which would be valiant, which a coward when they ſhould come to more dangerous encounters: as for Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, they gave them juſt enough to ſerve their turn; their chief care was to make them good Subjects, to fit them to endure the <hi>fatigues of long and tedious marches, and never to return without victory from the field.</hi> To this end, as they grew in years their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes were proportionably increas'd; their heads were ſhav'd, they were accuſtomed to go bare-foot, and for the moſt part to play naked.</p>

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:47090:169"/>
Thiſtle-down with their Ruſhes, this kept them warm, and as well contented they were with it, as if it had been the beſt Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-bed in the world. By that time they were come to this age, there was not any of the more hopefull Lads who had not a lover to bear him company; The old men too had an eye upon them, coming often to the Schools to hear and ſee them contend either in wit or ſtrength with one another: and this they did as ſeriouſly and with as much concern as if they were their Fathers, their Tutours, or their Magiſtrates; ſo that there ſcarcely paſſed a moment without putting them in mind of their duty, nor was there any place ſo privileg'd but that they were puniſh'd if they had neglected it.</p>
            <p>Beſides all this, there was always one of the beſt and honeſteſt men in the City ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to undertake the charge and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of them: he again rang'd them into ſeveral little Bands, and ſet over each of them for their Captain the diſcreeteſt and moſt metall'd of thoſe they call'd <hi>Irenes,</hi> (which were uſually twenty years old, and thoſe who were about eighteen were call'd <hi>Mell-Irenes,</hi> as much as to ſay, who would ſhortly be Men:) This young man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was their Captain when they fought, and their Maſter at home, uſing them for the offices of his Houſe; ſending the ſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieſt
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:47090:170"/>
of them to fetch Wood, and the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker and leſs able to gather Salads and Herbs, <note place="margin">Their Diet.</note> and theſe they muſt either go without or ſteal them; and this they did by creeping into the Gardens, or conveying themſelves very cunningly and cloſely into the Eating-houſes: and it concern'd them ſo to doe, for if they were taken in the fact they were whip'd without mercy; and that, not for want of <hi>honeſty</hi> but for want of <hi>wit,</hi> becauſe they did not lay their deſign well, and were not fine and cunning in their faculty. They ſtole too all other meat they could lay their <note place="margin">Their Thieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> hands on, looking out ſharp and watching all opportunities, when people were aſleep or more careleſs than uſual. If they were caught they were not onely puniſh'd with whipping but hunger too, being reduc'd to their ordinary, which was but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſlender, and ſo contriv'd on purpoſe, that being preſs'd by hunger they might caſt about to help themſelves by ſome ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile conveyance or adventurous action: and this was the principal deſign of their hard fare: another there was not inconſiderable, that they might grow the better in tallneſs; for the vital ſpirits not being over-burthened and oppreſſed by too great a quantity of nouriſhment (which neceſſarily diſcharges it ſelf into thickneſs and breadth) do by their natural lightneſs and agility mount

upwards; and the ſubſtance of the Body not being groſs or in two great a quantity, does more eaſily follow the <hi>faſhioning</hi> hand of Nature, whereas groſs and over-fed Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are ſtubborn and untractable, and ſhe can at beſt make but a bungling piece of work of them. This we find by experience in Women which take Phyſick whilſt they are with Child; for though the Children be by that means made ſomething leaner and of a leſs ſize, yet are they, for the moſt part, lovely of aſpect, and extraordinary well ſhap'd; the remaining matter, after the ſeparation of the groſſer humours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more ſupple and pliable and recipient of its form, which is always <hi>exact</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> in its kind, when the matter is <hi>capable</hi> of it.

Uſing them thus early to paſs a right judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon perſons and things, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themſelves of the abilities or defects of their Country-men: if they had not an Anſwer ready, they were look'd upon as of a <hi>dull</hi> and <hi>careleſs diſpoſition,</hi> and to have little or no ſenſe of Vertue and Honour: beſides this, they were to give a good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for what they ſaid, and in as few words and as comprehenſive as might be: he that failed of this, or anſwered not to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe (inſtead of a Ferule) had his Thumb bit by his Maſter. It ſo fell out ſometimes that the <hi>Iren</hi> did this in the preſence of the old Men and Magiſtrates, that they might ſee whether he puniſhed them juſtly and in due meaſure or not: and though he did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs they would not reprove him before his Scholars, (leſt it ſhould diminiſh their reſpect to him) but when they were gone he himſelf was call'd to an account, and underwent a correction too, if he had run

            <p>It is a thing remarkable that their <hi>Lovers</hi>

(By the way ſo much in faſhion was this ſort of love among them, that the moſt ſtay'd and vertuous Matrons would own publickly their paſſion to a modeſt and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull Virgin.) And though ſeveral mens fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies met in one perſon, yet did not this cauſe any ſtrangeneſs or jealouſie among them, but rather was the beginning of a very intimate friendſhip, whilſt they all jointly conſpired to render the belov'd Boy the moſt accompliſh'd in the world.</p>
            <p>They taught them alſo a natural and <note place="margin">Their ſhort Sayings.</note> gracefull way of ſpeaking, enlivened with a touch of inoffenſive raillery, and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending a great deal of matter in few words. For <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> who ordered that a great piece of money (as is aforeſaid) ſhould be but of an inconſiderable value, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary would allow no diſcourſe to be <hi>cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,</hi> which did not contain in few words a great deal of uſefull and <hi>weighty</hi> ſenſe: ſo that Children there by a habit of long ſilence and meditation had ſuch a preſence
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:47090:172"/>
and quickneſs of mind as to give very ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing anſwers, and oft-times ſpeak Apothegms to the aſtoniſhment of the hearers; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the incontinence of the Tongue, like the other ſort of incontinence, fruſtrates the ends of ſpeaking, as that does of generation. From hence the pithineſs of the Laconian Speech; an inſtance of which we have in King <hi>Agis,</hi> who when a pert Athenian laugh'd at their ſhort Swords, and ſaid that the Jugglers and Mountebanks ſwallow'd them in the publick Shows and Theatres, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him, And yet our Enemies cannot endure the ſight of them; and as their Swords were ſhort and ſharp, ſo were their Sayings: and truly in my judgment there is in this conciſe way of ſpeech ſomething which I know better than I can expreſs, which flies <hi>level</hi> to the mark, and does more execution than a whole volee of words ſhot at rovers. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> himſelf, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined this manner of ſpeaking, was one of the beſt examples of it, as appears by his anſwer to one who by all means would have a popular Government in <hi>Lacedaemon:</hi> Begin Friend, ſaid he, and make a trial in thy own Family. Another ask'd him why he allow'd of ſo mean and trivial Sacrifices to the Gods? he reply'd, That we may always have ſomething to offer to them. Being ask'd, What ſort of Martial Exerciſes

But that they were indeed enemies to talkativeneſs theſe following inſtances are an authentick and ſufficient proof.

In ſhort, their anſwers were ſo ſententious and pertinent that one ſaid well, that to be a Philoſopher or a Lacedemonian ſignified the ſame thing. And though they were a very active people they exerciſed their Minds much more than their Bodies.</p>

Nor were they leſs carefull to ſing and compoſe well than to expreſs themſelves in proper terms and to ſpeak to the <hi>point.</hi> And their very Songs had ſuch a life and ſpirit in them, that they enflam'd and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh'd mens minds with a deſire to doe great and good Actions; the ſtyle of them was plain and without affectation; the ſubject always ſerious and moral; moſt uſually it <note place="margin">Their Poetry.</note> was in <hi>praiſe</hi> of ſuch men as had dy'd in the <hi>bed of honour</hi> for defence of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or in <hi>deriſion</hi> of thoſe who would not venture their lives willingly in ſo good a cauſe: the former they declared happy, and almoſt Gods, and the latter they deſcrib'd as moſt miſerable and below the condition of men.

The expreſſion was different and ſutable to their ſeveral ages: for you muſt underſtand that they had three Choirs of them in their ſolemn Feſtivals, the firſt of the old Men, the ſecond of the young Men, and the laſt of the Children: (to give a taſte of them) the old Men began thus,

And even before they engag'd in Battel the King did firſt ſacrifice to the Muſes (in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood) <note place="margin">Their going to Battel.</note> to put them in mind of the manner of their education, and of the ſevere judgment that would be paſs'd upon their actions, and thereby to animate them to the performance of ſome gallant Exploit: ſometimes too the Lacedemonians abated a little the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their manners in favour of their young men, ſuffering them to curle and perfume their Hair, and to have coſtly Arms, and fine Clothes; and as well pleas'd they were to ſee them marching out full of metal and ſpirit to an Engagement as the other Graecians were to ſee their trim'd Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes neighing, and preſſing for the <note n="*" place="margin">He alludes to the Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick Games.</note> courſe. And therefore when they came to be well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown Lads they took a great deal of care of their Hair, to have it parted and trim'd, eſpecially againſt a day of Battel, purſuant to a ſaying of their Law-giver, that a large head of Hair ſet off a good Face to more advantage, and thoſe that were ugly it made more ugly and dreadfull.</p>

When they were in the Field their Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes were generally more moderate, their Fare not ſo hard, nor ſo ſtrict a hand held over them by their Officers, ſo that they were the onely people in the world to whom <hi>War</hi> gave <hi>repoſe.</hi> When their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was drawn up in Battel array, and the Enemy near, the King ſacrific'd a Goat, commanded the Souldiers to ſet their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands upon their heads, and the Pipers to play the Tune of the Hymn to <hi>Caſtor,</hi> and himſelf advancing forwards began the <hi>Pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> which ſerv'd for a ſignal to fall on. It was at once a delightfull and terrible ſight to ſee them march on to the Tune of their Flutes, without ever troubling their Order or confounding their Ranks, no diſorder in their minds or change in their countenance, but on they went to the hazard of their lives as unconcernedly and cheerfully as if it had been to lead up a Dance, or to hear a conſort of Muſick. Men in this temper were not likely to be poſſeſſed with <hi>fear,</hi> or tranſported with <hi>fury,</hi> but they proceeded with a <hi>deliberate Valour,</hi> full of hope and good aſſurance, as if ſome Divinity had ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly aſſiſted them. The King had always about his perſon ſome one who had been crown'd in the Olympick Games: and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account a Lacedemonian refus'd a conſiderable preſent which was offered to
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:47090:176"/>
him upon condition that he would not come into the Liſts, and having with much to doe thrown his Antagoniſt, ſome of the Spectatours ſaid to him, And now, Sir La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonian, what are you the better for your Victory? he anſwered ſmiling, O, a great deal, Sir, <hi>for I ſhall have the honour to fight by the ſide of my Prince.</hi> After they had routed an Enemy they purſu'd him till they were well aſſured of the Victory, and then they ſounded a retreat, thinking it baſe and unworthy of a Graecian people, to cut men in pieces who durſt not look them in the face or lift up their hands againſt them. This manner of dealing with their Enemies did not onely ſhew their magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity but had a politick end in it too; for knowing that they kill'd onely thoſe who made reſiſtance, and gave quarter to the reſt, they generally thought it their beſt way to conſult their ſafety by flight. <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pias</hi> the Sophiſter ſays that <hi>Lycurgus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was a very valiant and experienced Commander. <hi>Philoſtephanus</hi> attributes to him the firſt diviſion of the Cavalry into <note n="*" place="margin">

man, and one that lov'd quietneſs and peace. Notwithſtanding all this <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mippus</hi> tells us that he had no hand in the Ordinance, that <hi>Iphitus</hi> made it, and <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus</hi> came onely as a Spectatour, and that by mere accident too. Being there he heard a voice of one behind him, blaming, and wondering at him that he did not encourage his Country-men to reſort to ſo illuſtrious an Aſſembly; turning about and ſeeing no man, he concluded that it was a voice from Heaven, and thereupon immediately went to <hi>Iphitus,</hi> and was aſſiſtant to him in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Ceremonies of that Feaſt, which by his means were better eſtabliſh'd, more famous and magnificent than before that time they were.</p>
            <p>To return to the Lacedemonians. Their diſcipline and order of life continued ſtill after they were full grown men. No one was allowed to live after his own fancy; but the whole City reſembled a great Camp in which every man had his ſhare of proviſions, and buſineſs ſet out, and look'd upon himſelf not ſo much born to ſerve his own ends as the intereſt of his Country. Therefore if they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded nothing elſe, they went to ſee the Lads perform their Exerciſes, to teach them ſomething uſefull, or to learn it themſelves of thoſe who knew better. And here I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:47090:177"/>
but declare my opinion, that one of the greateſt bleſſings <hi>Lycurgus</hi> procur'd to his people was, the abundance of leiſure, which proceeded from his forbidding to them the exerciſe of any mean and mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Trade; for it was but loſt labour to waſte themſelves with anxiety and toil to heap together a great deal of money, which when they had got was but uſeleſs lumber in their houſe; for the <hi>Ilotes</hi> till'd their ground for them, and paid them yearly in kind the quantity above-mention'd, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any trouble of theirs. To this purpoſe there goes a ſtory of a Lacedemonian who happened to be at <hi>Athens</hi> in Aſſiſes time in which a Citizen had been puniſh'd for <hi>idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and came home much diſcontented and comfortleſs: the Lacedemonian was much ſurpriz'd at it, and deſired his Friend to ſhew him the man who was condemned for <hi>living like a Gentleman:</hi> ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath them they eſteemed all mechanical employments, and the care of heaping up riches.</p>
            <p>I need not tell you that upon the prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of Gold and Silver all Law-ſuits im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ceas'd, for there was now no <hi>griping</hi> avarice, or poverty oppreſſed, but equality with abundance, and a quiet life with ſobriety. All their time (except when <note place="margin">How they ſpent their time.</note> they were in the Field) was taken up in

the Aſſembly they paſs'd in order without ſpeaking a word.

and murthered them in cold bloud, as <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydides</hi> ſays in his Hiſtory of the Pelopon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſian War. The ſame Authour tells us, that a good number of them being <note n="*" place="margin">In token of Freedom granted.</note> crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by proclamation, and enfranchiſed for their good ſervices, and led about to all the Temples in token of honour, diſappeared all of a ſudden, being about the number of two thouſand, and no man neither then nor ſince could give an account how they came by their deaths. And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> adds that the <hi>Ephori,</hi> ſo ſoon as they were entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Office, us'd to declare War againſt them, that they might be maſſacred with a pretence of <hi>Law.</hi> It is confeſs'd on all hands, that the Spartans dealt with them very hardly; for it was a thing common to force them to drink to exceſs, and to lead them in that condition into their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Halls, that their Children might ſee what <hi>a contemptible and beaſtly ſight a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken man is:</hi> they made them to dance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely Dances, and ſing ridiculous Songs, forbidding them expreſly to meddle with any that were ſerious, for they <hi>would not have them prophaned by their mouths:</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account when the Thebans made an Invaſion into <hi>Laconia,</hi> and took a great number of the <hi>Ilotes</hi> priſoners, they could by no means perſwade them to ſing the Odes of <note n="†" place="margin">Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Poets.</note>

So that it was tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerved by one, that in <hi>Sparta</hi> he who was Free was moſt ſo, and he that was a Slave there was the greateſt Slave in the world. For my part I am of opinion that theſe outrages and cruelties began to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd in <hi>Sparta</hi> long after the time of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus,</hi> namely ſoon after the great Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, at which time the <hi>Ilotes</hi> made a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Inſurrection, and, joyning with the Meſſenians, laid the whole Country waſte, and brought the City to the greateſt extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity it had ever been reduc'd to.

               <hi>God</hi> himſelf hath given ſo great a character of his Vertue.</p>
            <p>To draw now towards the laſt Scenes of his Life: when he perceiv'd that his Laws had taken deep root in the minds of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men, that cuſtom had rendred them fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar and eaſie, that his Commonwealth grew apace <hi>daily,</hi> and was <hi>now able to go alone,</hi> he had ſuch a <hi>calm</hi> joy and contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mind, as <note n="*" place="margin">

the Maker of the World had, when he had finiſh'd and ſet this <hi>great Machine</hi> a moving, and found every thing <hi>very good</hi> and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to anſwer his <hi>great Idoea;</hi> ſo <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> taking an unſpeakable pleaſure in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the <hi>greatneſs</hi> and <hi>beauty</hi> of his Work, ſeeing every ſpring and particle of his new Eſtabliſhment in its due order and courſe, at laſt he conceived a vaſt thought to make it <hi>immortal</hi> too, and, as far as humane forecaſt could reach, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver it down <hi>unchangeable</hi> to poſterity. To bring this to paſs, he called an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Aſſembly of all the people, he told them that he now thought every thing rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably well eſtabliſh'd, both for the good of the publick and for the happineſs of each particular, but that there was one thing ſtill behind, and that of the greateſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which he thought not fit to impart untill he had conſulted the Oracle; in the mean time his deſire was that they would punctually obſerve his Laws without any the leaſt alteration untill his <hi>return,</hi> and then he would doe as the God ſhould direct him. They all conſented readily, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to haſten his Voyage: but before he departed he adminiſtred an Oath to the two Kings, the Senate and Commons, that they would inviolably obſerve his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces during his abſence. This done he ſet ſail
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:47090:182"/>
for <hi>Delphos,</hi> and having ſacrific'd to <hi>Apollo,</hi> ask'd him, <hi>Whether he approv'd of the Laws he had eſtabliſh'd?</hi> the Oracle anſwered, <hi>That his Laws were excellent, and that the people which obſerv'd them ſhould live in happineſs and renown.

and the other, that it might be a ſeal and confirmation of his Laws, eſpecially ſince that his Country-men had ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſworn the obſervation of them untill his return: nor was he deceived in his expectations, for the City of <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> continued the chief City of all <hi>Greece</hi> for the ſpace of five hundred years, mainly by their ſtrict obſervance of <hi>Lycurgus</hi>'s Laws; in all which time there was no manner of alteration made during the reign of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Kings, untill the time of <hi>Agis,</hi> the Son of <hi>Archidamus.</hi> For the new Creation of the <hi>Ephori</hi> (<note n="*" place="margin">Tribunes <hi>too were eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd at</hi> Rome <hi>to maintain the privileges of the people, but in time they prov'd the ruine of the popular Government.</hi>
               </note> who at firſt were choſen in favour of the people) were ſo far from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing, that they very much confirm'd the power of the Senate.</p>
            <p>In the time of <hi>Agis</hi> Gold and Silver found a way into <hi>Sparta,</hi> and all thoſe miſchiefs which attend the immoderate deſire of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. <hi>Lyſander</hi> promoted much this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, for by bringing in rich Spoils from the Wars, although himſelf was incorrupt, yet by this means he fill'd his Country with Avarice and Luxury, directly againſt the Laws and Ordinances of <hi>Lycurgus;</hi> which ſo long as they were in force <hi>Sparta</hi> reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſome holy Perſonage or particular Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher (ſo unanimous they were and as it were <hi>acted</hi> by <hi>one</hi> Soul) rather than a great Commonwealth and Metropolis of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:47090:183"/>
an Empire. And as the Poets feign of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi> that with his Lion's Skin and his Club, he went over the world, puniſhing the Wicked and extirpating Tyrants; ſo may it be ſaid of the Lacedemonians, that with a piece of <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>And therefore I cannot but wonder at thoſe who ſay, that the Spartans were good and obedient Subjects, but not skill'd in the art of governing; and for proof of it alledge a Saying of King <hi>Theopompus,</hi> who when one ſaid that <hi>Sparta</hi> held up ſo long becauſe their Kings <hi>could command well,</hi> he reply'd,

            <p>However it was not the deſign of <hi>Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> that his City ſhould govern a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others; he thought rather that the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of a Kingdom, as of a private man, conſiſted chiefly in the exerciſe of Vertue, and mutual love of the Inhabitants; his principal aim was to make them nobly min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, content with their own, not apt to follow vain hopes, but moderate in all their <note place="margin">He ſeems to reflect upon the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd their State by ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving raſhly to enlarge it.</note> enterpriſes; and by conſequence able to maintain themſelves and continue long in ſafety.

as it was never thought of before him, ſo can it ſcarcely be imitated in following ages; ſo that he ſtands for an undeniable proof, that a <hi>perfect</hi> wiſe man was not ſo mere a notion and chymaera as ſome men thought.

            <p>It was the thirty ſeventh year, accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Foundation of <hi>Rome,</hi> when <hi>Romulus</hi> then reigning, did on the fifth day of the Month of <hi>July,</hi> called the Capratine Nones, offer a publick Sacrifice at the Lake of <hi>Capra,</hi> in preſence of the Senate and People of <hi>Rome:</hi> But then on a ſudden a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe ſo furious a Tempeſt, which, with black Clouds and Thunder rending the Air, made an eruption on the Earth, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted the common people with ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, that they fled and were diſperſed; In this Whirlwind <hi>Romulus</hi> diſappeared, his <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Fate of</hi> Romulus.</note> Body being never ſince found either living or dead. This accident gave occaſion to the world to cenſure very hardly the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Patricians; as if that they, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weary of Kingly Government, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:47090:188"/>
of late by the imperious deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Romulus</hi> towards them, had plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt his Life and made him away, that ſo they might aſſume the Authority and Government into their own hands: but this report was ſoon confuted by the teſtimony of <hi>Proclus,</hi> a noble perſon, who ſwore that he ſaw <hi>Romulus</hi> catched up into Heaven in his Arms and Veſtments, and as he aſcended cry'd out, that they ſhould here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſtyle him by the name of <hi>Quirinus;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Whence nam'd</hi> Quirinus.</note> which atteſtation gained ſo much credit in the minds of the People, that they ordain'd Divine honours to be perform'd towards him, as to one not dead but tranſlated to a ſublimer ſtate, above the condition of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal nature.</p>
            <p>This commotion being appeaſed, the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was greatly divided about the election <note place="margin">
                  <hi>A conteſt in</hi> Rome <hi>about chuſing a King.</hi>
               </note> of another King, for the minds of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Romans and the new Inhabitants were not as yet grown into that perfect u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and coalition of ſpirits, but that there were diverſities of Factions amongſt the Commonalty, and jealouſies and emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons amongſt the Senatours; for though all agreed that it was neceſſary to have a King, yet what Perſon or of what Nation was the diſpute. For thoſe who had been builders of the City with <hi>Romulus,</hi> though they had already yielded a ſhare of their Lands and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:47090:188"/>
dwellings to the Sabines, who were Aliens, yet could not be perſwaded to reſign into their hands the Regal Authority. On the other ſide the Sabines alledged, that their King <hi>Tatius</hi> being deceaſed, they had pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceably ſubmitted to the obedience of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus,</hi> ſo that now their turn was come to have a King choſen out of their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nor did they eſteem themſelves infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the Romans, nor to have contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted leſs than they to the increaſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> which without their numbers and aſſociati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could never have merited the name of a City.</p>
            <p>Thus did both parties argue and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute their cauſe; but leſt in the mean time Sedition and diſcord ſhould occaſion Anarchy and confuſion in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; it was agreed and ordained, That the hundred and fifty Senatours ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchangeably execute the Office of ſupreme Magiſtrate, and with all the formalities and rites of Regality offer the ſolemn Sacrifices, and diſpatch judicial Cauſes for the ſpace of ſix hours by day and ſix by night; the which viciſſitude and equal diſtribution of power would remove all emulation from amongſt the Senatours, and envy from the people; when they could behold one ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated to the degree of a King, levelled in a few hours after, to the private condition of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:47090:189"/>
a Subject: which Form of Government was termed by the Romans, <hi>Interregnum.</hi> Nor yet could this plauſible and modeſt way of Rule eſcape the cenſure of the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, who termed it a deſign of ſome few, who, to aboliſh the Kingly Government, intended to get the power into their own hands: and therefore to circumvent this <note place="margin">Their final determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> plot, they came at length to this concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the party which did elect ſhould chooſe one out of the body of the other; that if the Romans were Electours, they were to make choice of a Sabine; and if the Sabines elected, they were to chooſe a Roman: this was eſteemed the beſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to reconcile all parties and intereſts, for that the created Prince would be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to favour the one for their ſuffrages in his election, as he was the other on ſcore of relation and conſanguinity. In purſuance of this agreement the Sabines remitted the choice to the ancient Romans, being more inclinable to receive a Sabine King elected by the Romans, than to ſee a Roman ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted by the Sabines: conſultations being accordingly held, <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> of the Sabine race, was elected; a perſon ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and of that high reputation, that <note place="margin">Numa <hi>cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen King.</hi>
               </note> though he were not actually reſiding at <hi>Rome,</hi> yet no ſooner was he nominated than accepted by the Sabines with applauſe and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:47090:189"/>
acclamation, equal to that freedom which the Romans ſhewed in his election.</p>
            <p>The choice being declared and made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, principal men of both parties, were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to compliment and intreat the Prince, that he would be pleaſed to accept the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Kingly Government. Now this <hi>Numa</hi> reſided at a famous City of the Sabines called <hi>Cures,</hi> whence both the Romans and Sabines gave themſelves the name of <hi>Quirites,</hi> as a comprehenſive <note place="margin">

               </note> name for both Aſſociates; <hi>Pomponius,</hi> an illuſtrious perſon, was his Father, and he the youngeſt of his four Sons, being by Divine Providence born on the eleventh of the Kalends of <hi>May,</hi> which was the day on which the Foundation of <hi>Rome</hi> was laid; he was endued with a Soul rarely tempered by Nature, and diſpoſed to Vertue, and excellently improved by Learning, Patience and the ſtudies of Philoſophy; by which advantages of Art he regulated the diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly motions of the Mind, and rendred Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Oppreſſion, which had once an honourable eſteem amongſt the barbarous Nations, to be vile and mean, making it appear, that there was no other Fortitude than that which ſubdu'd the Affections, and reduc'd them to the terms and reſtraints of Reaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:47090:190"/>
Thus whilſt he baniſhed all luxury and ſoftneſs from his own home, he gave a clear and manifeſt indication to all Citizens and ſtrangers of his ſound and impartial judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not delighting himſelf in divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or profitable acquiſitions, but in the worſhip of the immortal Gods, and in the rational contemplation of their Divine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Nature; to all which renown and fame, he added this farther glory, that he took <hi>Tatia</hi> for his Wife, who was the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">

This <hi>Tatia,</hi> as is reported, after ſhe had lived for the ſpace of thirteen years with <hi>Numa</hi> in conjugal ſociety, dyed; and then <hi>Numa,</hi> leaving the converſation of the Town, betook himſelf to a Country life, and in a ſolitary manner dwelt in the Groves and Fields conſecrated to the Gods; where, <note place="margin">Numa <hi>inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate with the Goddeſs</hi> Egeria.</note> the common fame was, he gained ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance and familiarity with the Goddeſs

               <hi>Egeria,</hi> that he lived in thoſe retirements free from all diſturbances and perturbations of mind, and being inſpired with the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime and elevated pleaſure of a celeſtial mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, he had arrived to a beatitude in this life, and to a clear notion of Divine Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
            <p>There is no doubt, but that ſuch fancies as theſe, have had their original from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fables; ſuch as the Phrygians recount of <hi>Atis,</hi> the Bythinians of <hi>Herodotus,</hi> the Arcadians of <hi>Endymion,</hi> and a thouſand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Demons which paſt Ages recorded for Saints, that were beatified and beloved of the Gods; nor doth it ſeem ſtrange, if God, who places not his affection on Horſes or Birds, ſhould not diſdain to dwell with the vertuous, and entertain a ſpiritual conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with wiſe and devout Souls: though it be altogether irrational to believe, that the Divine Eſſence of any God or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon is capable of a ſenſual or carnal love or paſſion for humane Beauty: And yet the wiſe Egyptians, did not conceive it an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd fancy to imagin, that a Divine Eſſence might by a certain ſpiritual impulſe apply it ſelf to the nature of a Woman, and lay the firſt beginnings of generation, though on the other ſide they concluded it impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for the Male-kind to have any congreſs or mixture with a Goddeſs, not conſidering
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:47090:191"/>
that there can be no real coition, but where there is a mutual communication of one to the other. The truth of the matter is this, thoſe men are onely dear to the Gods, <note place="margin">What perſons acceptable to the Gods.</note> who are vertuous, and thoſe are beloved by them whoſe actions are regulated by the rules of Divine Wiſedom: and therefore it was no errour of thoſe who feigned, that <hi>Phor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas, Hyacinthus</hi> and <hi>Admetus</hi> were beloved by <hi>Apollo;</hi> or that <hi>Hippolytus,</hi> the Sicyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian was ſo much in the favour of a certain God, that as often as he ſailed from <hi>Sicyon</hi> to <hi>Cirrha,</hi> the God rejoyced and inſpired the Pythian Propheteſs with this heroick Verſe,
<q>

It is reported alſo that <hi>Pan</hi> became enamou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of <hi>Pindar</hi> for his Verſes, and that a bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified Demon honoured <hi>Heſiod</hi> and <hi>Archilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> after their deaths by the Muſes; it is ſaid alſo that <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> ſojourned with <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phocles</hi> in his life-time, of which many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are extant to theſe days; and that being dead, another Deity took care to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his Funeral-rites: wherefore if any credit may be given to theſe particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, why ſhould we judge it incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that a like Spirit of the Gods ſhould

inſpire <hi>Zaleucus, Minos, Zoroaſter, Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus, Numa,</hi> and many others; or that the Gods ſhould conferr a meaner proportion of their favours on thoſe who were Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Commonwealths, or buſied in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Laws, and adminiſtration of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical affairs of Kingdoms? Nay it is moſt reaſonable to believe, that the Gods in their ſober humour are aſſiſtent at the counſels and ſerious debates of theſe men to inſpire and direct them; as they do alſo Poets and Muſicians, when in a more pleaſant mood, they intend their own divertiſement: but, as <hi>Bacchylis</hi> ſaid, thoughts are free, and the way is open to every man's ſentiment; yet in reallity it cannot be denied, but that ſuch men, as <hi>Lycurgus, Numa</hi> and others, who were to deal with the ſeditious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of Fanatick Citizens, and the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant diſpoſition of the multitude, might lawfully eſtabliſh their Precepts with the pretence of Divine Authority, and cheat them into ſuch Politicks as tend to their own happineſs.

               </note> the Ambaſſadours came to make him offers of the Kingdom; the Speakers were <hi>Proculus</hi> and <hi>Veleſus,</hi> the firſt was an ancient Roman, and the other of the Tatian Faction, and zealous for the Sabine party. Their Speech
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:47090:192"/>
was ſhort, but pithy, ſuppoſing, that when they came to tender a Kingdom there nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded no long Oration or Arguments to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him to an acceptance: but contrary to their expectation they found that they were forc'd to uſe many reaſons and intreaties to allure him from his quiet and retir'd life, to accept the Government of a City, whoſe Foundation was laid in War, and grown up in martial Exerciſes; wherefore, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his Father and <hi>Martius</hi> his Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he returned anſwer in this manner; <q>That ſince every alteration of a man's life is dangerous to him, it were mere <note place="margin">His Anſwer to the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours.</note> madneſs for one that is commodious and eaſie, and provided with all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for a convenient ſupport, to ſeek or endeavour a change, though there were nothing more in it, than that he prefers a turbulent and an uncertain life before a quiet and a ſecure condition. It is not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult for a man to take his meaſures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſtate of this Kingdom by the example of <hi>Romulus,</hi> who did not eſcape a ſuſpicion, of having plotted againſt the life of his Collegue <hi>Tatius;</hi> nor was the Senate free from the accuſation, of having treaſonably murthered their Prince <hi>Romulus.</hi> And yet <hi>Romulus</hi> had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to be thought of Divine race, and to be conſerved by a miraculous manner
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:47090:192"/>
in his infancy; how then can we who are ſprang from mortal ſeed, and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with principles and rudiments recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the men you know, be able to ſtruggle with ſuch apparent difficulties? It is none of the leaſt of my commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that my humour renders me unfit to reign, being naturally addicted to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and pleaſed in the receſſes of a quiet life: I muſt confeſs that I am zealous of Peace, and love it even with paſſion, and that the converſation of men who aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble together to worſhip God, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an amicable charity, is my chief bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs and delight; and what time may be ſpared from this more neceſſary duty, I employ in cultivating my Lands and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving my Farms. But you Romans, whom <hi>Romulus</hi> perhaps may have left en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in unavoidable Wars, require an active and brisk King, who may, cheriſh that warlike humour in the people which their late ſucceſſes have encouraged and excited to a warm ambition of enlarging their Dominions: and therefore ſuch a Prince as in this conjuncture ſhould come to inculcate Peace, and Juſtice, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion into the minds of the people, would appear ridiculous and deſpicable to them who reſolve on War and Violence, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire rather a martial Captain than a paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Moderatour.</q>

The Romans perceiving by theſe words, that he refuſed to accept the Kingdom, were the more inſtant and urgent with him, that he would not forſake and deſert them in this condition, by ſuffering them to relapſe into their former ſedition and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil diſcord; which they muſt unavoidably do, if he accepted not their proffer, there being no perſon, on whom both parties could accord, but on himſelf; and at length <note place="margin">He is impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tun'd by his Father and Kinſman to accept it.</note> his Father, and <hi>Martius,</hi> taking him aſide, perſwaded him to accept this offer, which was important, and rather was conferred from Heaven than from Men. <q>Though (ſaid they) you remain contented with your own Fortune, and court neither Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches nor Power, yet being endued with excellent Vertue, you may reaſonably imagine, that ſuch a Talent of Juſtice was not given by the Gods to be hidden or concealed; and that, ſince the juſt Government of a Kingdom is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſervice a man can perform towards God, he ought therefore by no means to decline and refuſe Empire and Rule, which was the true ſphere and ſtation of wiſe and renowned men; and in which they had ſuch an aſcendant over mankind, as to influence their Souls with affections to Vertue, and to a religious worſhip of the Gods, in the moſt ſolemn and pompous

manner, it being natural to men to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion and conform themſelves by the example and actions of their Prince. <hi>Tatius,</hi> though a Foreigner, was yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, and in eſteem of the Romans; and the memory of <hi>Romulus</hi> was ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to them, that after his deceaſe, they voted Divine Honours to be paid to him; and now who knows, but that this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being victorious, may be ſatiated with the War, and with the Trophies and Spoils they have acquired, and may gladly entertain a gentle and pacifick Prince, who being a lover of Juſtice may reduce the City into a model and courſe of Laws and judicial proceedings? And in caſe at any time the affections of this people ſhould break forth into a furious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous deſire of War; were it not better then to have the reigns held by ſuch a moderating hand, as is able to divert the fury another way, and ſpend it ſelf on Foreigners? by which means thoſe malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant humours which are the cauſes of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil diſcord, will perſpire and evaporate, and all the Sabines, and neighbouring people, be reconciled and joined in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeperable union and alliance with the City.</q>

            <p>To theſe reaſons and perſwaſions ſeveral other auſpicious Omens (as is reported)
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:47090:194"/>

            <p>
               <hi>Numa</hi> yielding to theſe perſwaſions and reaſons, having firſt performed Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, proceeded to <hi>Rome;</hi> being met in his way by the Senate and People, who with an impatient deſire came forth to receive him; the Women alſo welcomed him with joyfull acclamations, and Sacrifices were offered for him in all the Temples, and ſo univerſal was the joy, that they ſeem'd not to receive a King, but the addition of a new Kingdom. In this manner he deſcended into the <hi>Forum,</hi> where <hi>Spurius Vetius,</hi> whoſe turn it was to be Governour at that hour, putting it to the Vote, Whether <hi>Numa</hi> ſhould be King; they all with one voice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent cried out a <hi>Numa,</hi> a <hi>Numa.</hi> Then were <note place="margin">His religious Policy.</note> the Regalities and Robes of Authority brought to him, but he refuſed to be inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with them, untill he had firſt conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and been confirmed by the Gods: ſo being accompanied by the Prieſts and <note n="*" place="margin">Soothſayers.</note> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurs he aſcended the Capitol, which at that time the Romans called the <hi>Tarpeian</hi> Rock.
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:47090:194"/>
Then the chief of the Augurs covered his head, and turned his face towards the South; and, ſtanding behind him, laid his right hand on the head of <hi>Numa,</hi> and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, caſting his eyes every way, in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome auſpicious ſignal from the Gods.

            <p>The firſt thing he did at his entrance <note place="margin">The firſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations he made, what.</note> into Government was to diſmiſs the Band of three hundred men, which had been <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus</hi>'s Life-guard, called by them <hi>Celeres;</hi> for that the maintenance of ſuch a force would argue a diffidence of them that choſe him, ſaying that he would not rule over that people of whom he conceived the leaſt diſtruſt. The next thing he did, was to add to the two Prieſts of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> a third in honour of <hi>Romulus,</hi> who was called <hi>Quirinalis.</hi> The Romans ancien<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

            <p>When <hi>Numa</hi> had by theſe actions inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated himſelf into the favour and affection of the people, he began to diſpoſe the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the City, which as yet was obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and rendred hard as iron by War, to become more gentle and pliable by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of humanity and juſtice. It was then if ever the critical motion of the City, and, as <hi>Plato</hi> properly ſtyles it, the time when it was in its higheſt fermentation.

the Rammer layes upon them. Wherefore <hi>Numa,</hi> judging that it was the maſter-piece of his Art to mollifie and bend the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born and inflexible ſpirits of this people, began to operate and practice upon them <note place="margin">An awfull ſenſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion the chief expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce obdurate ſpirits.</note> with the principles of Religion. He ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed often, and uſed ſupplications and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Dances, in which moſt commonly he officiated in perſon, being ever attended with a grave and religious company; and then at other times he divertiſed their minds with pleaſures and delightfull exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, which he ever intermixed with their devotions, ſo as to cool their fiery martial ſpirits; and then to affect their fancies with a fear and reverence of God, he made them believe that ſtrange Apparitions and Viſions were ſeen, and prophetick Voices heard, and all to ſeaſon and poſſeſs their minds with a ſenſe of Religion.</p>
            <p>This method which <hi>Numa</hi> uſed made it <note place="margin">Numa <hi>why thought fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar with</hi> Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras.</note> believed that he was much converſant with <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and that he drew and copied his learning and wiſedom from him; for that in his inſtitutions of a Commonwealth, he lays down Religion for the firſt Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ground of it. It is ſaid alſo that he affected the exteriour garb and geſtures of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and to perſonate him in all his motions. For as it is ſaid of <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi> that he had taught an Eagle to come
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:47090:196"/>
at his lure, and ſtoop at his call, and that as he paſſed over the heads of the people, aſſembled at the Olympick Games, he made him ſhew his golden Thigh, with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rare arts and feats, which appeared miraculous; on which <hi>Timon Philaſius</hi> wrote this diſtick,
<q>
                  <l>Pythagoras, <hi>that he might common fame acquire,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Did with his golden Verſe mens minds inſpire.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
In like manner <hi>Numa</hi> affected the ſtory of a mountain Nymph to be in love with him, and that he entertained familiar converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Muſes, from whom he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the greateſt part of his Revelations; and having amongſt them a particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion for the Lady which he named <hi>Tacita,</hi> he recommended the veneration of her to the Romans, which he did perhaps in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Pythagorean Silence. His o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion alſo of Images is very agreeable to the Doctrine of <hi>Pythagoras;</hi> who taught, that the Firſt Principle of Being, which is not capable to be affected with ſenſual paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, is inviſible, and incorrupt, and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be comprehended by abſtracted ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations of the mind. And for this reaſon he forbad the Romans to repreſent God in
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:47090:196"/>
the form of Man or Beaſt, nor was there <note place="margin">
                  <hi>No Imagery in the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worſhip amongſt the Romans for the firſt</hi> 160 <hi>years.</hi>
               </note> any painted or graven Image of a Deity ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted amongſt them for the ſpace of the firſt hundred and ſixty years; all which time their Temples and Chapels were free and pure from Idols and Images, which ſeem'd too mean and beggarly repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God, to whom no acceſs was allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able but by the mind raiſed and elated by divine contemplation. His Sacrifices alſo had great ſimilitude with the Victims of <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras,</hi> which were not celebrated with effuſion of Bloud, but conſiſted of the flour of Wheat, or Wine, and ſuch ſort of blen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Offerings. And to make appear the inclination that <hi>Numa</hi> had to <hi>Pythagoras</hi> by other inſtances; there is a certain Drama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Poet, a very ancient Authour and a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> who, in a certain Book of his dedicated to <hi>Antenor,</hi> reports, that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was made a Free-man of <hi>Rome;</hi> and that <hi>Numa</hi> gave to one of his four Sons the name of <hi>Mamercus,</hi> which was the name of one of the Sons of <hi>Pythagoras;</hi> from whence, as they ſay, is ſprung that ancient Patrician Family of the Aemilians, for that the King ſuperadded the ſirname to him of <hi>Aemilius,</hi> to denote the ſoftneſs of his words, and the fluency of his ſpeech. I remember that when I was at <hi>Rome,</hi> I heard many ſay, that when the Oracle directed two
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:47090:197"/>
Statues to be raiſed, one to the wiſeſt, and another to the moſt valiant man of <hi>Greece,</hi> they preſently erected two of Braſs, one repreſenting <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> and the other <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, to paſs by theſe matters, which are full of uncertainty, and not ſo important as to be worth our time to inſiſt long on; we ſhall proceed to things more pertinent, and ſhew, that the original conſtitution of Prieſts, which are called <hi>Pontifices,</hi> is aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed <note place="margin">Numa <hi>firſt conſtituted the</hi> Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> unto <hi>Numa,</hi> and that he himſelf, offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating in the firſt and primary Order, took upon himſelf the name of <hi>Pontifex,</hi> or High Prieſt; aſſuming that title of <hi>Potens,</hi> or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull, as if thoſe, whoſe Office obliged them to an attendance on the Gods, were endued with a ſuper-eminent power and arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment above all others: ſome will have this name to be given by way of ſuper-excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, as to a ſole Moderatour, in whoſe power it is to ordain and appoint the times when Sacrifices and Divine Services are to be performed. But the moſt common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is the moſt abſurd, which derives this word from <hi>Pons,</hi> which Latin ſignifies a Bridge, ſaying, that anciently the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and holy Sacrifices were offered on Bridges, the care of which, both in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and repairing, was the chief incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bence of the Prieſts, and that it was not
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:47090:197"/>
onely eſteemed by the Romans to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull but an abominable impiety to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh or diſorder the Planks or Fabrick of a Bridge; becauſe that by appointment of the Oracle, it was to be onely of Timber, and faſtned with wooden Pins without Nails, or Cramps of Iron; and that the Stone Bridge was built many years after, when <hi>Aemylius</hi> was Queſtor, and that the old Bridge of Wood was demoliſhed in the Reign of <hi>Ancus Martius,</hi> who was the Grand-ſon of <hi>Numa</hi> by his Daughter.</p>
            <p>The Office of <hi>Pontifex,</hi> or Chief Prieſt, <note place="margin">The Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Office what.</note> was to interpret the Divine Law and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies; and did not onely preſcribe rules for publick Ceremony, but regulated the Sacrifices of private perſons, not ſuffering them in the heat of their devotion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the more ſolemn Offerings, but direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in every thing with what Sacrifices the Gods were to be worſhipped and appeaſed. He was alſo Guardian of the Veſtal Virgins, the inſtitution of whom and of their perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <note place="margin">The Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Veſtals.</note> Fire, was attributed to <hi>Numa,</hi> who perhaps fancied the nature of pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted Flames to be agreeable to chaſte and unpolluted Bodies, or that Fire which conſumes but produces nothing, alludes beſt to the ſterile condition of Virgins. This Veſtal Fire was ordained after the example of that in <hi>Greece,</hi> and particularly at <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos</hi>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:47090:198"/>
and <hi>Athens,</hi> onely with this difference, that here it was conſerved by Virgins but there by Widows, who were paſt the years and deſires of Marriage; and in caſe by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny accident it ſhould happen, that this Fire became extinct, as the holy Lamp was at <hi>Athens,</hi> under the tyranny of <hi>Ariſtion,</hi> and at <hi>Delphos,</hi> when that Temple was burnt by the Medes, and at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the time of the War with <hi>Mithridates,</hi> and of their own civil diſſentions, when not onely the Fire was extinguiſhed but the Altar demoliſhed: and then afterwads to kindle this Fire again it was eſteemed an impiety to light it from the common ſparks or flame, but from the pure and unpolluted rays of the Sun; the which they performed by an Inſtrument framed of three equal angles, which being placed in oppoſition to the Sun, collects the rays into one centre, and ſo attenuates the air, that it immediately gives fire to any combuſtible matter from the intenſe reflexion and reverberation of the Sun beams. Some are of opinion that theſe Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtals had no other care or buſineſs than the conſervation of this Fire; but others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that they were keepers of thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Secrets, which are concealed and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to all others but themſelves; of which we have made mention in the life of <hi>Camil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> ſo far as the revelations of ſuch myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:47090:198"/>
are conſiſtent with due reſpect to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. <hi>Gegania</hi> and <hi>Verenia,</hi> as is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, were the names of the two firſt Virgins which were conſecrated and ordained by <hi>Numa;</hi> next <hi>Canuleia</hi> and <hi>Tarpeia</hi> ſucceeded them; to which <hi>Servius</hi> afterwards added two more, the which number of four hath continued to this our age.</p>
            <p>The Statutes preſcribed by <hi>Numa</hi> for the <note place="margin">The Laws appointed for the Veſtal Virgins.</note> Veſtals were theſe. That they ſhould vow to keep a leaſe of their Virginity, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in a chaſte or unſpotted condition, for the ſpace of thirty years; the firſt ten whereof they were like Novitiates, obliged to learn the Ceremonies, and practiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Rules of their Religion; then they took the degree of Prieſteſs, and for other ten years exerciſed the Sacerdotal Function; and the remaining ten they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in teaching and inſtructing others. Thus the whole term being compleated, it was lawfull for them to marry, and leaving then the ſacred Order, they were at liberty to chooſe ſuch a condition of life as did moſt indulge, and was gratefull to their own hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: but this permiſſion few (as they ſay) made uſe of; becauſe it was obſerved, that their change of life was never accompanied with contentment, being ever after ſad and melancholy; for which reaſon they confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned themſelves untill old age and the hour of
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:47090:199"/>
death to the ſtrict and decent rules of a ſingle life.</p>
            <p>But this ſevere condition was recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <note place="margin">Their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges.</note> by other privileges and prerogatives; as that they had power to make a Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the life-time of their Father, that they had a free adminiſtration of their own affairs without Guardian or Tutor, which was the privilege of women who were the Mothers of three Children: when they went abroad they had the <hi>Faſces</hi> carried before them; and if perchance in their walks abroad it were their fortune to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter a Malefactour leading to execution, they had the privilege to free him from death; upon oath made, that the occaſion was accidental and not deſigned or of ſet purpoſe. Whoſoever preſſed upon the Chair on which they were carried was guilty of a capital crime, and immediately puniſhed with death. If theſe Veſtals committed any faults they were puniſhable by the High Prieſt onely, who, as the nature of the offence required, whipped them naked in a dark place, and under the caution of a Veil or Curtain; but ſhe that had been defiled, or permitted her ſelf to be deflou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, was buried alive near the Gate which is called <hi>Collina;</hi> where a little mount of Earth is raiſed, called in Latin <hi>Agger;</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it is a narrow Room, to which a deſcent
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:47090:199"/>
is made by Stairs: here they prepare a Bed, and light up a Lamp, and provide a ſmall quantity of Victuals, ſuch as Bread, Water in a Bottle, Milk and Oil; that ſo that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which had been conſecrated and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the moſt divine and myſterious ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, might not be ſaid to periſh by a death ſo deteſtable as that of Famine. The party thus condemned, is carried to execution through the Market-place in a Litter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhe is covered and bound with Cords, ſo that the voice of her cries and laments can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be heard; all people with ſilence go out of the way as ſhe paſſes, and ſuch as follow accompany the Bier with ſolemn and tacite ſorrow; and indeed ſuch is the ſadneſs which the City puts on on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, that there is no ſpectacle of grief which appears of more common and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral concernment than this. When they come to the place of Execution, the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers looſe the Cords, and then the High Prieſt, lifting his hands to Heaven, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mures ſome certain prayers to himſelf, then the Priſoner being ſtill covered is brought forth, and led down by the ſteps unto her Houſe of darkneſs; which being done, the Prieſts retire, and the Stairs being drawn up, the Earth is preſſed and crouded in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Vault is filled. And this was the puniſhment of thoſe who broke their Vow
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:47090:200"/>
of Virginity. It is ſaid alſo that <hi>Numa</hi> built the Temple of <hi>Veſta,</hi> which was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for a conſervatory of the Holy Fire, in an orbicular form, to repreſent perhaps the Frame of the Univerſe, in the centre of which the Pythagoreans place the element of Fire, and give it the name of <hi>Veſta</hi> and Unity: and yet they do not hold that the Earth is immovable, or that it is ſituated in the middle region of the Globe; but keeps a circular motion about the ſeat of Fire: nor do they account the Earth amongſt the chief or primary Elements; following the opinion of <hi>Plato,</hi> who, they ſay, in his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and philoſophical age, held that the Earth had a lateral poſition, for that the middle or centre was reſerved for ſome more noble and refined Body.</p>
            <p>There was yet a farther uſe of the High Prieſt, and that was to order the Proceſſion at funeral Rites, according to the method preſcribed by <hi>Numa,</hi> who taught, that there was no uncleanneſs in the contact of dead Corpſes, but a part of the ſervice owing to the ſubterranean Gods: amongſt which they worſhipped the Goddeſs <hi>Libitina</hi> as the chief of thoſe who preſided over the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies performed at Burials; whether they meant hereby <hi>Perſephone,</hi> or (as ſome of the learned Romans will have it) <hi>Venus,</hi> for they, not without good reaſon, attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:47090:200"/>
the beginning and end of Man's liſe to the ſame original cauſe and virtue of a Deity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Numa</hi> alſo preſcribed Rules for regulating the days of Mourning, according to certain <note place="margin">The regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</note> times and ages. As for example, a Child of three years, and ſo upwards to ten, was to be mourned for, for ſo many months as it was years old; and the longeſt time of mourning for any perſon whatſoever was not to exceed the term of ten months: which alſo was the time appointed unto Widows to lament the loſs of their deceaſed Husbands; before which they could not without great indecency paſs unto ſecond Marriages; but in caſe their incontinence was ſuch as could not admit ſo long an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence from the Marriage-bed, they were then to ſacrifice a Cow with Calf for expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of their fault.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Numa</hi> alſo was Founder of ſeveral other Orders of Prieſts; two of which are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be here mentioned, namely the <hi>Salii</hi> and the <hi>Feciales,</hi> which, with other inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are clear proofs of the great devotion and ſanctity of this Perſon. Theſe <hi>Fecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Feciales, <hi>an Order of Prieſts, whence ſo ſtyled.</hi>
               </note> whoſe name in my opinion is derived from their Office, were the Arbitratours to whom all Controverſies were referred rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to War and Peace; for it was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable to take up Arms untill they had
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:47090:201"/>
declared all hopes and expedients rejected which tended to an accommodation; by the word Peace, we mean a determination of matters in diſpute by Law, and not by Violence or Force. The Romans common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpatched the <hi>Feciales,</hi> who were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Heralds, to thoſe who had offered them injury, requiring ſatisfaction; and in caſe they made not reſtitution or juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns, they then called the Gods to witneſs againſt them and their Country, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced War: the ſenſe of the <hi>Feciales</hi> in this caſe was of abſolute neceſſity, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their conſent it was neither lawfull for the Roman King, nor yet for the people to take up Arms; and from them the General took his rules concerning the juſtice of his cauſe, which being adjudged, and the War determined; the next buſineſs was to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate of the manner and ways to manage and carry it on. It is believed, that the ſlaughter and deſtruction which the Gauls made of the Romans, was a juſt judgment on the City for neglect of this religious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding: for that when a foreign Nation beſieged the Cluſinians, <hi>Fabius Ambuſtus</hi> was diſpatched to their Camp with Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of Peace; but they returning a rude and peremptory Anſwer thereunto, <hi>Fabius</hi> imagined that his Treaty was at an end, and that he had fully complied with the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:47090:201"/>
duty of his Embaſſie; and therefore raſhly engaging in a War, challenged the ſtouteſt and braveſt of the enemy to a ſingle Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat. It was the fortune of <hi>Fabius</hi> to kill his adverſary and to take his ſpoils, which when the Gauls underſtood, they ſent a Herald to <hi>Rome</hi> to complain againſt <hi>Fabius,</hi> who, before a War was publiſhed, had, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Law of Nations, made a breach of the Peace. The matter being debated in the Senate, the <hi>Feciales</hi> were of opinion, that <hi>Fabius</hi> ought to be conſigned into the hands of the Gauls; but he, being pre-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed of this judgment, fled to the people, by whoſe protection and favour he was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured: on this occaſion, the Gauls marched with their Army to <hi>Rome,</hi> where, having taken the Capitol, they ſacked the City. The particulars of all which are at large re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in the Hiſtory of <hi>Camillus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the original of the <hi>Salii</hi> is this: In the eighth year of the reign of <hi>Numa,</hi> that terrible Peſtilence, which was ſpread over all <hi>Italy,</hi> did likewiſe miſerably infeſt the City of <hi>Rome;</hi> at which the Citizens being greatly affrighted, and deſpairing of health, were again comforted by the report of a brazen Target, which (they ſay) fell from Heaven into the hands of <hi>Numa,</hi> and of which they relate ſtrange effects, opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the virtue of this miraculous Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler;
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:47090:202"/>
and that <hi>Numa</hi> having had conference with the Nymph <hi>Egeria,</hi> and ſome of the Muſes, he was aſſured, that that Target was ſent from Heaven for the cure and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the City; and that, becauſe on the conſervation thereof the common health and benefit depended, he was ordered by them to make eleven others, ſo like in all dimenſions and form to the original; that in caſe there ſhould be a deſign to ſteal it away, the true might not be diſtinguiſhed or known from thoſe which were counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited; by which means there would be more difficulty to defeat the counſels of Fate, or invert the order of divine Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination: He farther declared, that he was commanded to conſecrate that place and the Fields about it to the Muſes, where he had often entertained a free intercourſe and communication with them; and that the Fountain which watered that Field ſhould be made ſacred and hallowed for the uſe of the Veſtal Virgins, who were to waſh and cleanſe the penetralia of their Sanctuary with thoſe Holy Waters. The truth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was ſpeedily verified by a miraculous ceſſation of the Peſtilence; whereupon <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> immediately delivered this Target to the beſt Artiſts to have others made in a juſt likeneſs in all particulars thereunto; but none was able to arrive unto a perfect
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:47090:202"/>
ſimilitude in all undiſtinguiſhable reſpects, untill at length one <hi>Veturius Mamurius,</hi> an excellent Maſter, happily hit upon it, and made one ſo to repreſent the other in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, that <hi>Numa</hi> himſelf was at a ſtand, and could not diſtinguiſh the true from that which was counterfeited. The keeping of which Targets was committed to the charge of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Prieſts, which are called <hi>Salii;</hi> who did <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the</hi> Salii.</note> not receive their name, as ſome imagine, from one <hi>Salius,</hi> a certain Dancing-maſter, who was born at <hi>Samothrace,</hi> or at <hi>Manti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea,</hi> who taught the way of dancing in Arms; but rather from that Dance which the <hi>Salii</hi> themſelves uſe, when in the month of <hi>March</hi> they carry the ſacred Targets through the City; at which proceſſion they are habited in a ſhort Caſſock, girt with a broad Belt claſp'd with braſs Buckles; on their heads they wore a copper Helmet, and ever and anon ſounded on the Targets with ſhort Cemyters: in this manner they proceeded with a nimble motion, and juſt meaſures of their Feet, and with ſuch hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and various turns, as demonſtrated great ſtrength and agility of body. Theſe Targets were called <hi>Ancylia</hi> from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of them; for they were not made in a round or orbicular form but oval and with certain folds or pleats cloſing one over the other, they fitted the Elbow by their
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:47090:203"/>
cubical Figure, and thence were called <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cylia,</hi> from <gap reason="foreign">

               </note> theſe ſeveral Orders of Prieſts, he erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Royal Palace near the Temple of <hi>Veſta,</hi> called to this day <hi>Regium;</hi> where he ſpent the moſt part of his time, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing Rules for Divine Service, inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:47090:203"/>
the Prieſts, and with zeal and devotion attending in perſon on the Offices of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. He built another Houſe upon the Mount <hi>Quirinalis;</hi> which place they ſhew to this day. In all publick Proceſſions and ſolemn Prayers, Tipſtaves or Huſhers were ſent before to give notice to the people that they ſhould forbear their work, and attend to the Divine Solemnity: for they ſay that the Pythagoreans did not hold it ſufficient reverence towards the Gods to worſhip them in a negligent manner, as when the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Proceſſions did obviouſly occur, but obliged their Scholars to go out from their Houſes and with prepared hearts attend to Divine Supplications: ſo <hi>Numa</hi> in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <note place="margin">Indifference and Diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs great hindrances to Devotion.</note> decreed, that his Citizens ſhould neither ſee nor hear Divine matters in a perfuncto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry manner, and with wandring thoughts, but laying aſide all diſtractions of mind, and cares of the world ſhould apply and elevate their meditations to Religion; and the ways and ſtreets ſhould be clear of noiſe or laments, or other incumbrances which might obſtruct or diſturb the ſolemnity and ſeriouſneſs of devotion. Something of this cuſtom remains at <hi>Rome</hi> to this day; for when the Conſul begins to ſacrifice or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiate; they call out to the People, <hi>Hoc age,</hi> or <hi>attend to the work in hand,</hi> and is as much as with us, <hi>Let us Pray,</hi> whereby
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:47090:204"/>
the Auditours then preſent were admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed to compoſe and recollect their thoughts for prayer: And as <hi>Pythagoras</hi> had certain Precepts and Sayings, ſuch as theſe: <hi>Thou ſhalt not make a Peck Meaſure thy ſeat to ſit on. Thou ſhalt not ſtir the Fire with a Sword. When thou goeſt forwards, look not behind thee. When thou ſacrificeſt to the celeſtial Gods, let it be with an odd number, and when to the terreſtrial let it be with even.</hi> So likewiſe <hi>Numa</hi> delivered other Sentences of an obſcure and abſtruſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; ſuch as theſe: <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to the Gods an offering of Wine proceeding from a Vine which was never pruned. No ſacrifices ſhall be performed without Meal. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe a circular motion in adoration of the Gods, and ſit down when you have worſhipped.</hi> The two firſt Precepts ſeem to denote, that <note place="margin">Probable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures of the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy of the ſeveral Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip.</note> urbanity and a natural complaiſance with the world is a part of Religion; and as to the turning which the Worſhippers are to uſe in divine adoration, it is to repreſent the orbicular motion of the world. But in my opinion, the meaning rather is, that he who comes to worſhip, enters the Temple with his face towards the Eaſt; where, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come up as high as the Chancel, he turns towards the Weſt, and then back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the Eaſt, perfecting the whole office of his prayers to that God who is Maker
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:47090:204"/>
of the Univerſe: unleſs perhaps this change of poſture may allude to the Egyptian Wheels, which were Hieroglyphicks of the inſtability of humane fortune, and that where God ſhould fix and eſtabliſh our lot and condition, we ſhould there reſt conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and repoſe our ſelves with intire reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the Divine pleaſure. They ſay alſo, that the ſitting quiet and in a repoſed poſture after worſhip did denote a conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or grant of the petitions they made, and was an aſſurance of everlaſting felicity in the future life: and that this ſtill and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentary ceſſation from work was the full ſtop or period of buſineſs already perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; from whence now deſigning to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin others, they were to preſent themſelves before the Gods, to obtain their bleſſings, and ſucceſs on that which was to follow. And this form of Ceremony did very well ſute with the preceding Doctrine, which taught that men ought not to approach the Gods in a tranſitory way, and with diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted minds, but, laying aſide all worldly cares and wandring fancies, ſhould then onely pray when their thoughts are poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with Divine Meditation. By ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline as this, recommended by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant practice and example of the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, the City did ſo inſenſibly paſs into a religious temper and frame of devotion, and
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:47090:205"/>
ſtood in that awe and reverence of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of <hi>Numa,</hi> that they received and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with an undoubted aſſurance, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he delivered, though never ſo fabulous, his authority being ſufficient to make the greateſt abſurdities and impoſſibilities to paſs for matters and points of Faith.</p>
            <p>There goes a ſtory, That he once invited a great number of Citizens to an entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <note place="margin">

               </note> at which the Diſhes in which the Meat was ſerved were very homely and plain, and the Commons ſhort, and the Meat ill dreſſed: the Gueſts being ſate, he began to tell them, that the Goddeſs which was his familiar Spirit, and always conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant with him, was then at that time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, when on a ſudden the Room was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with all ſorts of pretious Pots and Diſhes, and the mean Fare converted into a moſt magnificent Feaſt, adorned with all ſorts of the moſt delicious Viands. But the Dialogue which is reported to have paſſed between him and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> ſurpaſſes all the fabulous Legends that were ever invented. They ſay, that before Mount <hi>Aventine</hi> was inhabited or incloſed within the Walls of the City, that two Demi-gods, which were <hi>Picus</hi> and <hi>Faunus,</hi> did uſually frequent the Fountains and cloſe ſhades of that place; which ſome will have to be two Satyrs of the Titanian race; who being expert in the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:47090:205"/>
faculty of Phyſick, and dexterous in leger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demain and magical ſpells, like the <hi>Dactyli</hi> of Mount <hi>Ida,</hi> made a Journey through all the parts of <hi>Italy. Numa</hi> contriving one day to ſurpriſe theſe Demi-gods, mingled the Waters of the Fountain of which they did uſually drink with Wine and Honey, which ſo pleaſed theſe liquoriſh Deities, that he eaſily enſnared and took them; but then they changed themſelves into many various forms and ſhapes, intending, under horrid and unknown tranſmutations, to make their eſcape: but, finding themſelves entrapped in inextricable toils, and in no poſſibility to get free, revealed unto him many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets and future events; and particularly a charm againſt. Thunder and Lightning, which they compoſed of Onions, and Hair, and the Bones of a Fiſh: but ſome deny, and ſay, that theſe Demi-gods did not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the ſecret of this charm to <hi>Numa;</hi> but that they, by the force of their Magick Art and Spells, had conſtrained <hi>Jove</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to deſcend from Heaven to ſatisfie the demands of <hi>Numa,</hi> and that he then, in an angry manner anſwering his enquiries, told him, that if he would charm the Thunder and Lightning, he muſt doe it with Heads: How, ſaid <hi>Numa,</hi> with the Heads of Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? No, reply'd <hi>Jupiter,</hi> of Men. But <hi>Numa,</hi> willing to divert the cruelty of this
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:47090:206"/>
Receipt, turned it another way, ſaying, Your meaning is, the Hairs of Mens Heads; No, reply'd <hi>Jupiter,</hi> of living Men: then <hi>Numa,</hi> being inſtructed by the Goddeſs <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geria,</hi> ſeemed to miſtake, and ſay, How! with the Bones of the Fiſh <hi>Maena?</hi> which, being the three ingredients that compoſe the charm, ſo operated on <hi>Jupiter,</hi> that he returned again to Heaven pacified and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed. This place was ever afterwards called <hi>Elicium,</hi> or <hi>Ilicium,</hi> from the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which ſignifies propitious or mercifull; and in this manner this Magick Spell was effected.</p>
            <p>Such was the ſuperſtitious humour of that Age, which the example of the Prince <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The people of</hi> Rome <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally inclin'd to ſuperſtition in</hi> Numa<hi>'s reign.</hi>
               </note> had wrought in the Minds of the Vulgar, that nothing was ſo abſurd and ridiculous in Religion which gain'd not belief; and <hi>Numa</hi> himſelf was ſaid to have been poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ſuch a confidence and fiducial truſt in the Gods, that when it was told him, that the Enemy was near at hand, he ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly anſwered, <hi>That he feared them not, let them come at their peril, for he was then ſacrificing to the Gods.</hi> It was he alſo that built the Temples of <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Terminus;</hi> and taught the Romans ſuch reſpect to Faith, that it was the greateſt Oath, and the moſt obligatory that they could ſwear; and to the God <hi>Terminus</hi> they offer unto this
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:47090:206"/>
day the bloud of Beaſts, both in publick and private Sacrifices, upon the borders and ſtone marks of their Land: though ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe Sacrifices were ſolemnized without bloud, it being the Precept and Doctrine of <hi>Numa</hi> to offer nothing to the God <hi>Terminus,</hi> but what was pure and free of bloudy cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty; for that he, whoſe incumbence it was to fix boundaries, was thereby conſtituted an Arbiter of Peace and Juſtice, puniſhing thoſe who removed their neighbours Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, or invaded his right. It is very clear, that it was this King who firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed bounds to the juriſdiction of <hi>Rome;</hi> for <hi>Romulus</hi> would have betrayed his own cauſe, and plainly diſcovered how much he had encroached on his neighbours Lands, had he ever ſet limits to his own; which as they are fences and curbs againſt arbitrary invaſions, to thoſe who obſerve them, ſo they ſerve for evidences to ariſe in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt thoſe, who break over and violate the borders with which they are circumſcribed. The truth is, the portion of Lands which the Romans poſſeſſed at the beginning, was very narrow, untill <hi>Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> by War enlarged them; and which <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> afterwards divided amongſt the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Commonalty, that he might ward them againſt violent neceſſity, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways puts men upon injurious deſigns and
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:47090:207"/>
ſhifts, and that by placing them in Farms, he might accuſtom them to a deſire of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, <note place="margin">Numa <hi>a friend and advancer of Husbandry.</hi>
               </note> and a regular way of living; for as there is nothing that ſo reconciles the minds of men to Peace, as Husbandry and a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try liſe; ſo it makes them abhorr all vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and gives them courage and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to defend their ſowed Lands and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures from the encroachment of their neighbours. Wherefore <hi>Numa,</hi> that he might take and amuſe the hearts of his Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens with Agriculture or Husbandry, which is an employment that rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets civility and a peaceable temper than great opulency and riches, he divided all the Lands into ſeveral parcels, to which he gave the name of <hi>Pagus</hi> or Borough, and over every one of them he ordained a Chief or Arbitrator in judicial cauſes; and taking a delight ſometimes to ſurvey his Colonies in perſon, he made judgment of every man's inclinations and manners, by his induſtry, and the improvements he had made, of which being witneſs himſelf, he preferred thoſe to honours and authority who had merited moſt; and on the contrary reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the ſluggiſhneſs of ſuch, who had given themſelves over to a careleſs and a negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent life. But above all, which was a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal <note place="margin">He firſt divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</note> point of his Politicks, he divided the people into ſeveral Companies: for as the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:47090:207"/>
City did conſiſt, or rather was diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed (as we have ſaid) by two ſorts of Tribes; from whence dangerous Factions, Tumults and Seditions did ariſe; he contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to caſt them into divers ſmall moulds and models: for as hard and diſſenting Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are not eaſily incorporated, ſo long as they remain in their groſs bulk, but being beaten into a powder, or melted into ſmall Atoms, are often cemented and conſolida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into one; ſo this people, being ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and diſtinguiſhed into ſmall diviſions, were afterwards with leſs difficulty united into one Body: wherefore diſtinguiſhing the whole City by their ſeveral Arts and Profeſſions; he formed the Companies of Muſicians, Goldſmiths, Maſons, Dyers, Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, Skinners, Braſiers and Potters; and all other Handy-crafts men he compoſed and reduced into a ſingle Company, appointing unto every one their reſpective Halls, Courts and other privileges belonging to their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, which they held by the Charters received from this Prince. In this manner all factious diſtinctions began to ceaſe in the City; there being no perſon farther eſteemed under the notion of a Sabine, a Roman or a Tatian, but all were compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under the general denomination of a Citizen of <hi>Romulus;</hi> whereby all other terms growing out of uſe and faſhion, the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:47090:208"/>
national animoſities reconciled of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and all diſſolved into the common tye and relation of a Roman Citizen.</p>
            <p>He is alſo much to be commended for the repeal, or rather amendment of that Law, which gives power to Fathers to ſell their Children; for he exempted ſuch as were married from that ſubjection, condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally that they had matched themſelves with the liking and conſent of their Parents: for it ſeemed a very hard and unjuſt thing, that a woman, who had given her ſelf in marriage to a man whom ſhe judged free, ſhould afterwards find her ſelf betrayed and caſt away upon a Husband that was a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</p>
            <p>He attempted alſo to draw a Scheme of <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the year inſtituted by</hi> Numa.</note> the Heavens, and thereunto conform a Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar and Ephemerides of the Year, which though it was not perfect, yet it was not altogether without ſome learned conjectures, and ſuch as reduced the account of the Year to ſome tolerable regulation: for during the Reign of <hi>Romulus,</hi> their Months had no certain or equal term; for ſome of them contained 20 Days, others 35, others more; the which errour proceeded from want of a true knowledge of the different motions of the Sun and Moon; onely they kept to this account, that the whole courſe of the Year contained 360 Days. <hi>Numa</hi> alſo farther
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:47090:208"/>
obſerving, that there was eleven Days dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Lunary and the Solary Year: for that the Moon compleated her Anniverſary courſe in 354 Days, and the Sun in 365; to remedy which inequality, he doubled the eleven Days, and after every two Year added an interſtitial to follow the Month of <hi>February,</hi> which the Romans cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Month of <hi>Mercidinus;</hi> but this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count hath ſince that time received a better amendment. He alſo altered the order of the Months; for <hi>March,</hi> which was recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the firſt, he put into the third place; and <hi>January,</hi> which was the eleventh, he made the firſt; and <hi>February,</hi> which was the twelfth and laſt, to be the ſecond. Some will have it, that it was <hi>Numa</hi> alſo which added the two Months of <hi>January</hi> and <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary:</hi> for in the beginning, when men <note place="margin">Various, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations of the year.</note> were ignorant and barbarous, they compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a Year of ten Months: the Arcadians in <hi>Greece</hi> had onely four, in <hi>Arcanania</hi> they accounted by ſix; and the Egyptians had at firſt but one Month, which afterwards they divided into four, according to the ſeaſons of the Year: which Country of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> though it ſeem new to us, is yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by an ancient people; for if we may believe their Chronicles (unleſs they account Months for Years) their Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies are deduced from great Antiquity.
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:47090:209"/>
And that the Romans at firſt comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the whole Year within ten, and not twelve Months, plainly appears by the name of <hi>December,</hi> which ſignifies the tenth Month, and is the laſt in order: and that <hi>March</hi> was the firſt is likewiſe evident, for that the fifth Month after it was called <hi>Quintilis,</hi> and the ſixth <hi>Sextilis,</hi> and ſo the reſt; ſo that if <hi>January</hi> and <hi>February</hi> had in this account preceded <hi>March, Quintilis</hi> had been put in the ſeventh place, and ſo called <hi>September.</hi> It is alſo very probable, that this firſt Month was dedicated by <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus</hi> to <hi>Mars;</hi> the ſecond to <hi>Venus,</hi> called <hi>April,</hi> from the Greek word <hi>Aphrodites;</hi> which the Women ſolemnize in honour of that Goddeſs, adorning their heads on the Kalends, or firſt days of it, with Myrtle Garlands. But others will not allow of the derivation of this word from <hi>Aphrodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> but rather deduce it from the word <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perio,</hi> which in Latin ſignifies, to open, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that this Month is in the high Spring, when all Buds and Flowers open and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe themſelves: the next is called <hi>May,</hi> from <hi>Maia</hi> the Mother of <hi>Mercury,</hi> to whom this Month was made ſacred: then <hi>June</hi> follows, ſo called from <hi>Juventus,</hi> or youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the Year, which is then warm, and gay, and in its juvenile ſeaſon. To the other Months alſo they gave denominations
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:47090:209"/>
according to their order, ſo the fifth was called <hi>Quintilis, Sextilis</hi> the ſixth, and ſo the reſt <hi>September, October, November</hi> and <hi>December:</hi> Afterwards <hi>Caeſar,</hi> when he had overcome <hi>Pompey,</hi> changed the name of the Month <hi>Quintilis</hi> to that of <hi>Julius,</hi> which we call <hi>July;</hi> as alſo that of <hi>Sextilis</hi> was changed into <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> which was a ſirname to the Succeſſour of <hi>Caeſar. Domitian</hi> alſo in imitation hereof gave the two other fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Months the names of <hi>Germanicus</hi> and <hi>Domitianus,</hi> but, he being ſlain, they recovered their ancient denominations of <hi>September</hi> and <hi>October;</hi> but the two laſt have ever reſerved their names without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny alteration. The Months which were added, and tranſpoſed in their order by <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> was <hi>February,</hi> which deduces its name from <hi>Februo,</hi> ſignifying a purification by Sacrifice; for then they offered Plants, and celebrated the Feaſt of <hi>Lupercalia,</hi> in which many Ceremonies agree with the Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities uſed at the Luſtrations or clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing days: but <hi>January</hi> was ſo called from <hi>Janus,</hi> and a precedency of order given to it by <hi>Numa</hi> before <hi>March,</hi> which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to the God <hi>Mars;</hi> intimating in my opinion thereby, that the Arts and civil ſtudies of Peace are to be preferred before warlike or martial employments. For this <hi>Janus,</hi> whether he were a Daemon, or Demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>god,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:47090:210"/>
or a King, was certainly a great Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lititian and lover of Arts and Sciences, whereby he transformed the incult natures of men into a gentle and civil diſpoſition; for which reaſon they figure him with two Faces, beholding at the ſame time both ſtates and conſtitutions of humane kind. His Temple at <hi>Rome</hi> hath two Gates, which they call the Gates of <hi>Mars;</hi> becauſe they ſtand open in the time of War, and ſhut in the times of Peace, of which latter there was very ſeldom an example; for when the Roman Empire was enlarged and extended to its utmoſt bounds, it was ſo encompaſſed with barbarous Nations and Enemies, that it was ſeldom or never at peace: onely in the time of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> after he had overcome <hi>Anthony,</hi> that Temple was ſhut; as likewiſe not many years before, when <hi>Marcus Atilius</hi> and <hi>Titus Manlius</hi> were Conſuls; but then it continued not ſo long, before that Wars breaking out, the Gates of <hi>Janus</hi> were again opened: but during <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Gates of</hi> Janus<hi>'s Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple never open in</hi> Numa<hi>'s reign.</hi>
               </note> the Reign of <hi>Numa,</hi> which continued for the ſpace of forty three years, thoſe Gates were ever ſhut, there being a profound quiet without the noiſe or clattering of Arms: for not onely the people of <hi>Rome</hi> were animated with a ſpirit of peace, which they enjoyed under the juſt proceedings of a pacifick Prince; but even the neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:47090:210"/>
Cities, as if they had been inſpired with the ſame inclinations, breathed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a ſalubrious and gentle air of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual friendſhip, and amicable correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and being raviſhed with the delights <note place="margin">Happy reſults of Peace.</note> which Juſtice and Peace produce, every one apply'd himſelf to the management of his Lands and Farm, to the education of his Children, and worſhip of the Gods: Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val days, and Sports, and Banquets were the common divertiſements; and Families entertained and treated their acquaintance and friends in ſuch a free and open manner, that all <hi>Italy</hi> ſecurely converſed with each other without fears, or jealouſies, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, being all poſſeſſed with that Divine Spirit of Love and Charity, which flowed from <hi>Numa</hi> as from a Fountain of Wiſedom and Equity: ſo that the Hyperbolies, which the Poets of thoſe days uſed, and the flights which are allowable in Verſe, were flat and not able to reach with their higheſt expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions the happineſs of thoſe days;
<q>
                  <l>When Spears, and Swords, and direfull Arms of War</l>
                  <l>Were laid aſide, and ruſtied in their places;</l>
                  <l>No Trumpet ſounds alarm'd the publick peace,</l>
                  <l>But all ſecurely ſlept—</l>
               </q>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:47090:211"/>
For during the whole Reign of <hi>Numa,</hi> there was neither War, nor Sedition, nor Plots deſigned againſt the State, nor did any Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion prevail, or the ambition and emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of great Men attempt upon the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for indeed men ſo reverenced his Vertue, and ſtood in ſuch awe of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which, they believed, was guarded by a particular care of Divine Providence, that they deſpaired of all ſucceſs in their ſiniſter intentions: and then that happy Fortune, which always attends the life of men who are pure and innocent, beſtowed a general eſteem and good reputation on him; and verified that ſaying of <hi>Plato,</hi> which ſome Ages after he delivered in relation to the happineſs of a well formed Commonwealth: For, ſaith he, where the Royal Power, by God's Grace, meets with a mind and ſpirit addicted to Philoſophy, there Vice is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued and made inferiour to Vertue: no man is really bleſſed but he that is wiſe; and happy are his Auditours, who can hear and receive thoſe words which flow from his mouth: there is no need of compulſion or menaces to ſubject the multitude, for that <note place="margin">A vertuous example moſt conſpicuous and enticing in a Prince.</note> luſtre of vertue which ſhines bright in the good example of a Governour, invites and inclines them to wiſedom, and inſenſibly leads them to an innocent and happy life, which being conducted by friendſhip and

concord, and ſupported on each ſide with temperance and juſtice, is of long and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting continuance; and worthy is that Prince of all rule and dominion, who makes it his buſineſs to lead his Subjects into ſuch a ſtate of felicity. This was the care of <hi>Numa,</hi> and to this end did all his actions tend.</p>
            <p>As to his Children and Wives, there is a diverſity of reports by ſeveral Authours: ſome will have it that he never had any other Wife than <hi>Tatia,</hi> nor more Children than one Daughter called <hi>Pompilia:</hi> others will have it that he left four Sons; namely, <hi>Pompo, Pinus, Calpus</hi> and <hi>Mamercus,</hi> every one of which had iſſue, and from them deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended the noble and illuſtrious Families of <hi>Pomponi, Pinari, Calpurni</hi> and <hi>Mamerci,</hi> to which for diſtinction ſake was added the ſirname of Royal. But there is a third ſort of Writers, which ſay that theſe pedigrees are but a piece of flattery uſed by the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds, who, to incurr favour with theſe great Families, deduced their Genealogies from this ancient Lineage; and that <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilia</hi> was not the Daughter of <hi>Tatia,</hi> but born of <hi>Lucretia,</hi> to whom he was married after he came to his Kingdom: howſoever all of them agree in opinion, that ſhe was married to the Son of that <hi>Martius</hi> who perſwaded him to accept the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:47090:212"/>
and accompanied him to <hi>Rome,</hi> where, as a ſignal of honour, he was choſen into the Senate; and after the death of <hi>Numa,</hi> ſtanding in competition with <hi>Tullus Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilius</hi> for the Kingdom, and being diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of the Election, in high diſcontent killed himſelf: howſoever his Son <hi>Martius,</hi> who had married <hi>Pompilia,</hi> reſiding at <hi>Rome,</hi> was the Father of <hi>Ancus Martius,</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Tullus Hoſtilius</hi> in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and was but five years of age, when <hi>Numa</hi> died.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Numa</hi> lived ſomething above eighty years, and then (as <hi>Piſo</hi> writes) was not taken out <note place="margin">Numa<hi>'s Death and honourable Interment.</hi>
               </note> of the world by a ſudden or acute Diſeaſe, but by a chronical Diſtemper, by which he lingred long, and at laſt expired. At his Funerals all the glories of his Life were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate; for the kind people, and his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly companions, met to honour and grace the rites of his Interment with Garlands and contributions from the publick: the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natours carried the Bier on which his Corps was laid, and the Prieſts followed and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied the ſolemn proceſſion; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of this dolefull pomp was compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of Women and Children, who lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſuch tears and ſighs, as if they had bewailed the death or loſs of a deareſt relation taken away in the flower of his age, and not of an old and out-worn King.

It is ſaid that his Body, by his particular command, was not burnt, but that he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered two ſtone Coffins to be made, in one of which he appointed his Body to be laid, and the other to be a repoſitory for his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Books and Writings, and both of them to be buried under the Hill <hi>Janiculum;</hi> thereby imitating the Legiſlatours of <hi>Greece,</hi> who, having wrote their Laws in Tables, which they called <hi>Cirbas,</hi> did ſo long incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the contents of them, whilſt they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, into the minds and hearts of their Prieſts, till their underſtandings became living Libraries of thoſe ſacred Volumes; it being eſteemed a profanation of ſuch myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <note place="margin">To commit to writing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Precepts held a profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by the Grecian Law-givers.</note> to commit their ſecrets unto dead letters.

Such is the fortune of good men, that their Vertue ſurvives their Bodies, and that the envy and emulation which evil men conceive againſt them is ſoon extinguiſhed; but their reputation and glory is immortal, and ſhines with more ſplendour after their death, than in the time when they were li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and converſant in the world: and as to <hi>Numa,</hi> the actions of the ſucceeding Kings ſerved as ſo many Foils to ſet off the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his majeſtick Vertues: for after him there were five Kings; the laſt of which was made an exile, being depoſed from his Crown: of the other four, three were by treaſon aſſaſſinated and murthered; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who was <hi>Tullus Hoſtilius</hi> that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſucceeded <hi>Numa,</hi> whilſt he derided his vertues, and eſpecially his devotion and religious worſhip, reproached his memory, as a cowardly and mean ſpirited Prince; and, diverting the minds of the people from their peaceable and honeſt courſe of life to wars and depredations, was himſelf ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by an acute and tormenting Diſeaſe; which cauſed him to change his mind and <note place="margin">Even Atheiſts in <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

It was glorious to poſſeſs a Throne in Righteouſneſs and Judgment; and great bravery on the other ſide to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Juſtice before a Kingdom: the ſame ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue which made the one appear worthy of Regal power, exalted the other to a degree of ſo much eminence, that it ſeemed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention in him to ſtoop unto a Crown: laſtly, as Muſicians tune their Harps accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Note; ſo the one let down the high flown ſpirits of the people at <hi>Rome</hi> to a lower Key, as the other ſcrewed them up at <hi>Sparta</hi> to a higher Note, which were fallen flat by diſſoluteneſs and riot. For it was not ſo much the buſineſs and care of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> to reaſon his Citizens into peace, or to perſwade them to put off their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, or ungird their Swords; as it was to moderate their love to Gold or Silver, or the profuſeneſs of their Tables, or to abate their extravagancies in rich Clothes and Furniture: nor was it neceſſary to preach unto them, that, laying aſide their Arms, they ſhould obſerve the Feſtivals, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to the Gods; but rather, that, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derating the affluence of their Tables and
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:47090:215"/>
exceſs of diet, they ſhould become tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and abſtemious, and employ their time in laborious and martial exerciſes: ſo that the one moulded his Citizens into what hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour he pleaſed, by a gentle and ſoft way of argument; the other with danger and hazard of his perſon, ſcarce worked upon the affections of a diſſolute people. It is certain, that <hi>Numa</hi> was naturally endued with a more gentle and obliging way, which mollified the harſh diſpoſition of his people, and made them tractable and lovers of juſtice: but <hi>Lycurgus</hi> was more rigid and (ſince we muſt mention it) we cannot excuſe his ſeverity againſt the <hi>Ilotes,</hi> or term it other than a cruel action; and in the ſum of all conclude, that <hi>Numa</hi> was far the more moderate and plauſible Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour; granting even to Servants a licence to ſit at meat with their Maſters at the Feaſt of <hi>Saturn,</hi> that ſo they alſo might have ſome taſte and reliſh of the ſweetneſs of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.

                  </note> was introduced by <hi>Numa</hi> on this juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that becauſe the Servants were inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in cultivating the grounds and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering the Fruits which the Earth produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, there ſhould be a time appointed when they might enjoy the fruits of their labours, in a more free and delightfull manner: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will have it to be in remembrance of
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:47090:215"/>
that age of <hi>Saturn,</hi> when there was no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between the Lord and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; but all lived as Kindred and Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in a parity and condition of equality. In ſhort, it ſeems that both aimed at the ſame deſign and intent, which was to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and incline their people to modeſty and frugality; but as to their other vertues, the one availed himſelf moſt on Fortitude, and the other on Juſtice: unleſs we will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute their different ways to the different temperaments of their people; for <hi>Numa</hi> did not out of cowardiſe or fear affect Peace, but becauſe he would not be guilty of thoſe injuries which are the neceſſary conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of War: nor did <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> out of a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of violence and fury, promote and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite a ſpirit of War in his people, but rather encouraged the art of War, and inclined their minds, which were ſoft and enervated by Luxury, to martial Exerciſes; that ſo they might be the better prepared to repell injuries, and reſiſt the invaſions of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies: in this manner both having occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to operate on their Citizens, and make a change and alteration in their humours and manners, the one cut off the ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and exceſſes, whilſt the other ſupplied the defects of that which was wanting.</p>
               <p>The frame of <hi>Numa</hi>'s Politicks did moſt ſute with the conſtitution of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:47090:216"/>
and more reſpected the humour of a popular Government; for having ranged his people into ſeveral Companies, ſuch as Goldſmiths, Muſicians, Shoo-makers, and other Handicraft Trades, he cheriſhed <note place="margin">Numa <hi>ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of Trade,</hi> Lycurgus <hi>of martial Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline.</hi>
                  </note> them and gave them privileges by their Charters: but the Government of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> was more Ariſtocratical, conferring the greateſt authority on the Nobility, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the profeſſion of mechanical Arts, and Trades, to be the employment onely of Strangers, and of the low and baſer Commonalty. The Citizens he allowed onely to manage the Spear and Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler; becauſe that being the Miniſters and Servants of <hi>Mars,</hi> they had no great need of knowledge or literature more than to obſerve the words of command, and obey their Leaders, intending by their diſcipline of War to enable them to defend themſelves and offend their enemy: for to men that were really made Free and become Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men all trade and traffick was forbidden; and the gainfull and pecuniary Arts, and the care of Proviſions, and preparing Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and Banquets, made the buſineſs onely of Servants, or of the <hi>Ilotes.</hi> But <hi>Numa</hi> made none of theſe diſtinctions, onely he took care that men grew not rich by Spoils or Prizes taken in the War, all other profits and acquiſitions being allowable by the Law,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:47090:216"/>
and not diſhonourable in the eſteem of the world: nor did he endeavour to level mens Eſtates, or reduce them to an equality, but gave every man a liberty to amaſs wealth, and grow as rich as he was able; but took no care to provide againſt poverty, which, by the additions of poor people, which flocked to the City, increaſed daily. In the beginning of all, he ought to have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed or diſcountenanced covetouſneſs, whilſt there was no great diſparity in the eſtates of men, and whilſt the balance was equal; and, after the example of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> have obviated thoſe many and great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs which proceeded from avarice, as the fountain and original of them all: and yet <hi>Lycurgus</hi> is not to be blamed for eſtabliſhing the Agrarian Law, which was a dividing of Lands amongſt the people, nor was <hi>Numa</hi> to be reproved for not admitting ſuch Law or Cuſtom in his juriſdiction: becauſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality was the Baſis and foundation of his Commonwealth, but the caſe of <hi>Numa</hi> was far different; for the diviſion of Lands having been formerly admitted and made, the taking them away or altering mens pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties in them, could not have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed without the troubles and dangers which follow ſuch innovations.</p>
               <p>Now as to Marriages, and the regular way of increaſing the world, they both
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:47090:217"/>
agreed on ſuch political Conſtitutions as <note place="margin">Their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Laws and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, chiefly deſign'd to prevent Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie.</note> ſhould clear the mind of Husbands from all torment of jealouſie, and yet their Cuſtoms and Laws herein were diverſly qualified. For when a Roman thought himſelf to have a ſufficient proviſion of Children, in caſe his neighbour who had none, ſhould come and deſire him to accommodate him with his Wife, that he alſo might have the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of iſſue from his fruitfull Woman; he had a lawfull power to lend her to him who deſired her, either for a certain time, or elſe to looſe the bonds of Marriage, and conſign her into the hands of her Paramour for ever. But the Laconian had another rule, for it was allowable for him to afford the uſe of his Wife to any other that deſired to have Children by her, and yet ſtill to keep her in his Houſe, and retain the bond and conditions of Marriage in the ſame force and vertue as before: nay many Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands (as we have ſaid) would often invite men of handſome Features and comely Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to their Houſes, in hopes of Children of the like ſhapes and beauty, which they adopted and acknowledged for their own. What difference was there then between theſe ſeveral cuſtoms? unleſs it be this, That the free uſe which the Laconians indulged of their Women was a remedy againſt the humour of jealouſie, which often affects
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:47090:217"/>
men with ſuch torment of mind, that their days conſume in ſorrow and diſquiet: the other of the Romans conſerved ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for the modeſty of Women, and the ſacredneſs of Marriage, not enduring a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of Wives in the ſame Houſe, nor a transferring of the right of them to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, unleſs the matrimonial Knot were firſt diſſolved. Moreover the Conſtitutions of <hi>Numa</hi> as to Virgins were more ſevere, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing rules to keep them modeſt, and free from all ſuſpicions of unchaſtity: but the Orders of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> were in that point more diſſolute, giving more liberty to Maids and ſingle Women; which afforded to the Poets ſubject for their raillery, as <hi>Ibycus</hi> who gave them the Epithet of <gap reason="foreign">

This manner of Habit gave the Women <note place="margin">
                     <hi>An undecent practice of the Women of</hi> Laconia.</note> ſuch confidence, that they hen-peck'd their Husbands; and not onely bore the greateſt ſway at home, but alſo had the privilege of Votes in publick Aſſemblies: but the Matrons under the Government of <hi>Numa</hi> were ruled with better decorum; for though the Husbands were very indulgent to their Sabine Wives, endeavouring to compenſate for their Rape, in the Reign of <hi>Romulus,</hi> by extraordinary kindneſs, howſoever their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty was reſtrained within ſome terms of modeſty, which taught them ſobriety and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and to abſtain from Wine and freedom of diſcourſe, and long viſits, unleſs in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany or preſence of their Husbands: So that when at a certain time a Woman had the confidence to plead her own cauſe at the Bar in a place of Judicature; it ſeemed ſo ſtrange and monſtrous a thing, that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſent to enquire of the Oracle, what ſuch a prodigy in nature did portend: and indeed the vertue of modeſt Women is beſt illuſtrated by comparing them with the miſchievous examples of thoſe that were lewd and impudent: For as the Greek Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians record in their Annals the names
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:47090:218"/>
of thoſe who firſt unſheathed the Sword of Civil War, or murthered their Brothers, or were Parricides and killed their Fathers; ſo the Roman Writers report, that <hi>Spurius</hi>

                  <hi>Carvilius</hi> was the firſt who divorced his Wife; being a caſe that never before hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the ſpace of 230 years from the Foundation of the City: and that one <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lea,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Pinarius,</hi> was the firſt that had any quarrel or debate with her Mother-in-law, <hi>Gegania,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Tarquinius Superbus:</hi> ſo excellent were the Laws and Conſtitutions of the conjugal Rites of that City, that ſuch peccadillio's as theſe were recounted for flagitious crimes, and the leaſt failures in them at firſt were reputed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous, and fit to be branded and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with ſhame in the Hiſtory of thoſe times. Now the Laws which <hi>Lycurgus</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, either in relation to Virgins or mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Women, were different: for he eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming procreation of Children to be the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal end of Marriage, would fix no ſet term of age, when Men or Women ſhould be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed capable of giving their conſents to each other in Marriage; for he thought that nature being the principal guide in that matter ſhould not be reſtrained with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, which produces hatred and fear; but rather being gently indulged, when youth, and love, and kindneſs move; the
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:47090:219"/>
coition might be more ſatisfactory, and conſequently the Children become more robuſt, ſtrong and healthfull.</p>
               <p>But the Romans deſigning in the firſt place to deliver the Bodies of their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters pure and undefiled into the embraces and poſſeſſion of the Husband, made it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for Fathers to marry their Daughters at twelve years of age, or under: which firſt way of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> ſeems more agreeable to the deſires of Nature, which onely reſpects the procreation of Children; but the other is better adapted to make a conjugal life com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, and calculated for the rules of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral living. Howſoever thoſe general rules which <hi>Lycurgus</hi> preſcribed for education of Children, for their meetings together and viſits, as alſo thoſe regulations he made in their Feaſts, or Compotations, Exerciſes and Sports, do argue, that <hi>Numa</hi> was in ſome manner inferiour to him in the art and myſtery of giving Laws: For as to <note place="margin">

                  </note> education, <hi>Lycurgus</hi> was of opinion, That Parents were rather obliged to follow the inclinations and genius of their Children, than to adhere to any fixt or formal rule of Diſcipline: as for example, if a Father de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to make his Son a Husbandman, or a Carpenter, a Braſier, or a Muſician; will he not firſt conſult his genius or inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, before he oblige him to a Profeſſion
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:47090:219"/>
whereunto he hath no delight, and for which he hath no Talent or capacity? For as paſſengers who embark together on the ſame Ship, though they have diverſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and apply themſelves to different in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, yet when Storms ariſe, whereby the whole Cargaſon is endangered, they forſake the thoughts of their private concernments, that they may unite their hands and heads for the common conſervation; in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the Legiſlatours or Law-makers, whoſe buſineſs is the publick good, are not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to give or preſcribe ſtanding rules for every particular action or private affair, but ſuch onely as reſpect the common uſe and benefit.</p>
               <p>And ſince we may blame the common ſort of Legiſlatours, who, either for want of power or knowledge, take falſe meaſures in the Maxims they lay down for fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Laws: how much rather may we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept againſt the conduct of <hi>Numa,</hi> who for the reputation of his wiſedom onely being called and invited by the general conſent of a new and unſettled people to be their King, did not in the firſt place provide and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute rules for the education of Children and the diſcipline of Youth; for want of which men become ſeditious and turbulent, and live not quiet in their Families or pariſhes; but when they are inured from their Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles

to good Principles, and inſtructed from their Infancy in the rules of Morality, they receive ſuch impreſſions of Vertue as make them ſenſible of that benefit and eaſe which peace and mutual agreement brings to a Commonwealth. This with many others, was one of the Politicks of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> and was of great uſe in the confirmation and eſtabliſhment of his Laws. An inſtance we have in the practice of Swearing and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Oaths a part of Religion, which had <note place="margin">An Oath held ſacred by the Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> proved very inſignificant, unleſs that by good diſcipline a principle had been at firſt inſtilled of the ſacredneſs of ſuch a Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and this was the cauſe that the Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians, having ſucked in theſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples with their milk, were poſſeſſed with a moſt reverend eſteem of all his Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſo that the main points and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of his Law, continued for above 500 years in force with ſtrict obſervance, and without any violation. But <hi>Numa,</hi> whoſe whole deſign and aim was peace, and to conſerve his people in ſuch a ſenſe of Religion and Divine worſhip as might conduce to the preſent tranquillity, did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver make proviſions for a future condition, or for the time of War: and therefore no ſooner did he expire his laſt breath, than peace vaniſhed with it, and immediately after his deceaſe the Gates of <hi>Janus</hi> Temple
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:47090:220"/>
flew wide open; and as if War had been long pent up within thoſe Walls, it ruſh'd forth like a mighty Storm infeſting all <hi>Italy</hi> with bloud and ſlaughter: and thus that excellent Fabrick, and compoſition of Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Juſtice was diſſolved, for want of early principles, inſtilled by good educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Remiſſneſs in bringing up of youth preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to the Roman State.</note> into youth, which are the foundation to ſupport it, and the neceſſary cement which unites all together, in a fixed and immutable habit. What then (may ſome ſay) hath <hi>Rome</hi> been prejudiced by her Wars? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that this queſtion, which men make, who take their meaſures from the advance of Riches and Power exalted with Luxury, rather than from that Innocence and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Mind, which is always accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with tranquillity and peace, is not to be reſolved by a ſudden anſwer, but by a long and philoſophical diſcourſe. Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it makes much for <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> that ſo ſoon as the Romans deſerted the Doctrine and Diſcipline of <hi>Numa,</hi> their Empire grew and their power encreaſed: whenas on the contrary, ſo ſoon as the Lacedemonians fell from the Inſtitutions of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> the Fabrick of their Government diſſolved with their Laws, and, the Grecian Empire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loſt, they alſo were reduced to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt point of deſolation and ruine.

almoſt Divine in the circumſtances of <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> for he was an Alien, and yet courted againſt his own inclinations to accept a Kingdom; the frame of which though he entirely altered, yet he performed it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out force or coaction, and with ſuch lenity that nothing was acted but with the aſſent and concurrence of the people. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> on the other ſide favoured the Nobility, and made them the Lords and Rulers over the Commons; and yet that Government was well tempered alſo, and duly poiſed by Wiſedom and Juſtice.</p>

               </note> name was <hi>Euphorion,</hi> contrary to the opinion of all thoſe who have written con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him: for they generally agree that he was the Son of <hi>Exeſtides,</hi> a man of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate wealth and power in the City; but of a noble Stock, being deſcended from <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drus:</hi>
               <pb n="276" facs="tcp:47090:223"/>
his Mother, as <hi>Heraclides Ponticus</hi> affirms, was Couſin to <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and thoſe two at firſt were great Friends, partly becauſe they were a kin, and partly becauſe <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> was a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lov'd</hi> Piſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratus.</note> gracefull man, and they ſay <hi>Solon</hi> lov'd him: and that is the reaſon, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that when afterwards they differ'd about the Government, their enmity never produc'd any hot and violent paſſion, they remembred their old kindneſſes, and that kept the flame of their love and dear af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection ſtill alive: For that <hi>Solon</hi> was Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, <note place="margin">Solon <hi>lov'd Boys.</hi>
               </note> and unable ſtoutly to reſiſt the force of Beauty, we may conjecture by his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems; and by a Law he forbad Slaves to perfume themſelves, or love Boys, making that an honourable action, and onely fit for Gentlemen, and as it were inviting the Worthy to the practice, when he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Unworthy to forbear. <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> likewiſe is reported to have lov'd one <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> and to have conſecrated his Statue in the Academy, where thoſe light their Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that win the ſacred <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>: <hi>Solon,</hi> as <hi>Ermippus</hi> writes, when his Father had ruin'd his Eſtate in doing benefits and kindneſſes to other men, though he had Friends enough that were willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to his relief, yet he was aſham'd to be beholding to others, ſince he was deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:47090:223"/>
from a Family who were accuſtomed to doe kindneſſes rather than receive them. He therefore apply'd himſelf to Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe; <note place="margin">Solon <hi>turns Merchant.</hi>
               </note> though others aſſure us that <hi>Solon</hi> tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel'd rather to get Learning and Experience than to raiſe an Eſtate: 'tis certain that he was a lover of Wiſedom, for when he was old he would ſay,
<q>I grow old ſtill learning many things.</q>
But he was no admirer of Riches, eſteeming thoſe equally wealthy
<q>
                  <l>Who ſees vaſt heaps of Gold at his command,</l>
                  <l>Fine Horſes, and a fair Eſtate in Land;</l>
                  <l>And Him, to whom indulgent Fate beſtow'd</l>
                  <l>Sufficient wealth to buy him Clothes and Food:</l>
                  <l>But if to this a Wife, and pratling Boys,</l>
                  <l>And youth, and grace, He hath the height of Joys.</l>
               </q>
And in another place,
<q>
                  <l>I would be rich, and yet to raiſe my purſe</l>
                  <l>Not cheat, for wealth ſo got the Gods will curſe.</l>
               </q>
Now 'tis no ſhame for a prudent man and a good Citizen not to be ſolicitous about ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities, or to look after competent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries. In his time (according to <hi>Heſiod)</hi> a Trade was not diſhonourable, nor did it

debaſe the quality of the profeſſours; but Merchandiſe was a worthy Calling, which brought home the good things which the barbarous Nations enjoy'd, was the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of friendſhip with their Kings, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Experience. Some Merchants have built great Cities, as the Founder of <hi>Maſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> that man ſo much eſteem'd by the Gauls that live about the <hi>Rhone:</hi> ſome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo report that <hi>Thales</hi> and <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> the Mathematician traded; and that <hi>Plato</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray'd the charges of his Travels by ſelling Oil in <hi>Aegypt.</hi> Now <hi>Solon</hi>'s ſoftneſs and profuſeneſs, his diſcourſe of pleaſures in his Poems, too looſe for a Philoſopher, were occaſion'd by his trading life; for having ſuffer'd a thouſand dangers, 'twas fit they ſhould be recompenc'd with pleaſure and enjoyments: but that he accounted himſelf rather poor than rich is evident from theſe lines;</p>

               <l>Some wicked men are rich, ſome good are poor;</l>
               <l>I would not change my Vertue for their ſtore:</l>

               <l>Whilſt wealth now flies to this man, now to that.</l>
            </q>
            <p>At firſt he us'd his Poetry onely in trifles, <note place="margin">Solon <hi>a Poet.</hi>
               </note> in vain humours, and to paſs away his idle hours: but afterwards his Numbers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein'd

moral Sentences, and many tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Commonwealth, which he did not write for the bare ſake of the Hiſtory; but to apologize for his own actions, and ſometimes to correct, chaſtiſe and ſtir up the Athenians to noble performances. Some report that he deſign'd to put his Laws in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Poem, and began it thus,</p>
            <q>
               <l>
                  <hi>We humbly beg a bleſſing on our Laws</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>From mighty</hi> Jove, <hi>and honour and applauſe.</hi>
               </l>
            </q>
            <p>Of moral Philoſophy, as moſt of the then <note place="margin">Learned one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Politicks.</note> wiſe men, he chiefly eſteemed Politicks; in Phyſicks he was very rude and illiterate, as appears by this,
<q>
                  <l>Soft Snow and Hail fall from a frozen Cloud;</l>
                  <l>From glaring Lightning Thunder roars aloud?</l>
                  <l>The Winds make the Seas rough, they vex the Main;</l>
                  <l>But when they ceaſe to blow, 'tis ſmooth and plain.</l>
               </q>
And indeed 'tis probable, that at that time <hi>Thales</hi> onely had rais'd wiſedom above prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice into ſpeculation; and the other ſix were call'd wiſe from their prudence in Politick concerns. Fame delivers that they had an

enterview at <hi>Delphos,</hi> and another at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi>

Now the ſtrangers at firſt conteſting with the Fiſhers about the Tripod, and the Cities eſpouſing the quarrel ſo far as to engage themſelves in a War; <hi>Apollo</hi> decided the Controverſie, by commanding to preſent it to the wiſeſt Man: and firſt it was ſent to <hi>Miletum</hi> to <hi>Thales,</hi> the Coans freely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting him with that for which they fought all the Mileſians, but <hi>Thales</hi> declaring <hi>Bias</hi> the wiſer perſon, it was ſent to him; from him to another; and ſo going round them all, it came to <hi>Thales</hi> a ſecond time; and at laſt, being carried from <hi>Miletum</hi> to <hi>Thebes,</hi> it was there dedicated to <hi>Apollo Iſmenius. Theophraſtus</hi> writes, that it was firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to <hi>Bias</hi> at <hi>Priene;</hi> and next to <hi>Thales</hi> at <hi>Miletum;</hi> and ſo through all it returned to <hi>Bias,</hi> and was afterwards ſent to <hi>Delphos.</hi>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:47090:225"/>
This is a general report, onely ſome inſtead of a Tripod ſay this preſent was a Cup ſent by <hi>Croeſus;</hi> others a piece of Plate that one <hi>Buthocles</hi> had left. 'Tis reported that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacharſis</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Anacharſis <hi>and</hi> Solon <hi>acquainted.</hi>
               </note> and <hi>Solon,</hi> and <hi>Solon</hi> and <hi>Thales</hi> were familiarly acquainted, and ſome have deliver'd parts of their diſcourſe: For (they ſay) <hi>Anacharſis</hi> coming to <hi>Athens,</hi> knock'd at <hi>Solon</hi>'s Door, and told him, That he being a ſtranger was come to be his Gueſt, and contract a Friendſhip with him: and <hi>Solon</hi> replying, 'Tis better to ſeek Friends at home, <hi>Anacharſis</hi> return'd, Then you that are at home take me as a Gueſt and as a Friend: <hi>Solon</hi> ſomewhat ſurpriſed at the briskneſs of that Repartee, receiv'd him kindly, and kept him ſome time with him, whilſt he was managing the Commonwealth, and contriving his Laws; which when <hi>Anachar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> underſtood, he laught at him, for ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining the Citizens unruly deſires and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions could be reſtrain'd by theſe Laws, which were like Spider's Webs, and would catch, 'tis true, the weak and poor, but <note place="margin">Anacharſis<hi>'s ſaying of Laws.</hi>
               </note> are eaſily broken by the mighty and rich. To this <hi>Solon</hi> return'd, Men keep their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes when neither ſide can get any thing by the breaking of them; and he would ſo fit his Laws to the Citizens, that all ſhould underſtand 'twas more eligible to be juſt and obey, than act contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:47090:226"/>
But the event rather agreed with the conjecture of <hi>Anacharſis,</hi> than <hi>Solon</hi>'s hope. <hi>Anacharſis,</hi> being one time at the Aſſembly, ſaid, he wondred much that in <note place="margin">Anacharſis <hi>ſaying of the Grecian Aſſemblies.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Greece</hi> the Wiſe men ſhould propoſe cauſes, and Fools determine.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Solon</hi> came to <hi>Thales</hi> at <hi>Miletum,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Solon <hi>and</hi> Thales <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted.</hi>
               </note> he wondred that <hi>Thales</hi> took no care to get him a Wife and Children. To this <hi>Thales</hi> made no anſwer for the preſent, but a few days after dealt with a ſtranger to pretend that he came from <hi>Athens</hi> ten days ago; and <hi>Solon</hi> enquiring what news there, the man, according to his inſtructions, reply'd, None, but concerning a young man's Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral which the whole City celebrated; for he was (as the ſtory went) the Son of an honourable Man, and the moſt vertuous of his Citizens; who was not then at home, but had been travelling a long time. <hi>Solon</hi> reply'd what a miſerable man is he! but what was his name? I have heard it, ſays the Man, but have now forgotten it, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there was a great talk of his Wiſedom and his Juſtice. Thus <hi>Solon</hi> was drawn <note place="margin">Thales <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</hi>
               </note> on by every anſwer, and his fears height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, till at laſt, being extremely concern'd, he mention'd his own name, and ask't the ſtranger if that young man was not call'd <hi>Solon</hi>'s Son; and the ſtranger aſſenting, he began to beat his head, and to doe and ſpeak
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:47090:226"/>
all thoſe things which uſually come from men in ſo great a paſſion: But <hi>Thales</hi> held him, and with a ſmile ſaid, Theſe things, <hi>Solon,</hi> keep me from Marriage and getting Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which are too great for your courage and your conſtancy to ſupport; however be not concern'd at the report, for 'tis a Fiction. This <hi>Ermippus</hi> delivers from <hi>Pataecus,</hi> who boaſted that he had <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s Soul. But 'tis <note place="margin">We ſhould ſeek conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies though we muſt once loſe them.</note> weak and abſurd not to ſeek conveniencies for fear of looſing them, for upon the ſame account, we ſhould neither love Wealth, Glory, nor Wiſedom, ſince we may fear to be depriv'd of all theſe: nay, even Vertue it ſelf, than which there is no greater, nor more deſirable poſſeſſion, is often loſt by Sickneſs or Enchantments: Now <hi>Thales,</hi> though unmarried, could not be free from ſolicitude, unleſs he likewiſe took no care of his Friends, his Kinſmen, or his Country; nay (as Hiſtory delivers) he adopted <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſthus</hi> his Siſter's Son. For the Soul, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a principle of kindneſs in it ſelf, and being born to love, as well as perceive, think or remember, inclines, and fixes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome ſtranger, when ſhe hath none of her own to embrace. And as when an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate wants a lawfull Heir, ſtrangers or Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards endeavour to win the kind poſſeſſour, and when they have once gotten his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, his care and tenderneſs encreaſeth with
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:47090:227"/>
his love; inſomuch that ſome men that are rigid againſt the Marriage-bed, and ſlight the fruit of it, when their Servant's or Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot's Boy is ſick or dies, are almoſt kill'd with grief, and miſerably lament. Some have very meanly, and below the dignity of a Man mourn'd for the loſs of a Dog, or Horſe; others upon the death of vertuous Children, have not been concern'd, nor guilty of a mean action; but paſs'd the reſt of their lives like men, and according to the principles of reaſon. For 'tis not bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, but weakneſs that prompts a Man to continual grief, and makes thoſe fear whom Reaſon hath not arm'd againſt For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, inſomuch that they cannot enjoy the thing that they deſire, the fear of loſing it ſtill vexing, and bringing conſtant racks and torments to their minds. Now we muſt not provide againſt the loſs of Wealth, by Poverty; or of Friends, by refuſing all acquaintance; or of Children, by getting none, but by Morality and Reaſon: But of this too much.</p>

Things being thus ordered, the Megarenſians were allur'd with the appearance, and, coming near, leap'd eager upon their prey, ſo that not one of them eſcaped, and the Athenians preſently ſet Sail for the Iſland, and took it.

            <p>Now the Cylonian villany had a long while diſturb'd the Commonwealth, even from that time when <hi>Megacles</hi> the Archon perſwaded the conſpiratours with <hi>Cylon</hi> that took ſanctuary in <hi>Minerva</hi>'s Temple, to ſtand to a fair trial; and they tying a thred to the Image, and holding one end of it, went down to the Tribunal: but when they came to the Temple of the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the thred brake of its own accord, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which, as if the Goddeſs had refus'd them protection, they were ſeiz'd by <hi>Megacles,</hi> and the other Magiſtrates: as many as were without the Temples were ſtoned, thoſe that fled for ſanctuary were butchered at the Altar, and onely thoſe eſcaped who made their application to the Wives of the Magiſtrates.

<pb n="292" facs="tcp:47090:231"/>
other parties from prevailing: At the ſame time alſo the Poor quarrelling with the Rich about the inequality of Eſtates, the City ſeem'd in a deſperate condition and to be freed from its diſturbances and ſettled by a Tyranny alone: for all the People were indebted to the Rich; and either they manur'd their Grounds, paying them ſix parts of the encreaſe, and were therefore call'd <hi>Hectemorii</hi> and <hi>Thetes:</hi> or elſe they engaged their Body for the debt, and might be ſeized by their Creditours; ſo ſome of them were made Slaves at home, others ſold to ſtrangers; ſome (for no Law forbad it) were forc'd to ſell their Children, or run their Country to avoid the cruelty of their Creditours; but the moſt and ſtouteſt of the People roſe, and exhorted one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſtand to it to chuſe a Leader, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the ſavage exactours, divide the Land, and change the Government.

               </q>
From which 'tis manifeſt that he was a man of great reputation before he gave his Laws. The ſeveral jeers that were put upon him for refuſing the Power, he delivers in theſe words:
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Sure</hi> Solon <hi>was a ſoft, a ſhallow fool,</hi>

                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Yet he, mean Soul, refus'd to take the draught:</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>For elſe to have enjoy'd but one day's reign</hi>

               </q>
Thus he makes the Many and the Raſcals ſpeak of him. Yet though he refus'd the Government he was not too remiſs in the
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:47090:232"/>
Affairs, he did not appear mean and crou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching <note place="margin">Solon<hi>'s good behaviour.</hi>
               </note> to the powerfull; nor made his Laws to pleaſure thoſe that choſe him; for where 'twas well before he apply'd no remedy, nor altered any thing, for fear leſt unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling, and bringing the Commonwealth into a confuſion, he ſhould be too weak to new model and raiſe it to a tolerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; but what he thought he could ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect by perſwaſion upon the pliable, and by force upon the ſtubborn, that he did; joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (as he himſelf ſpeaks) force and juſtice; and therefore when he was afterwards ask'd if he had left the Athenians the beſt Laws that could be given, he reply'd, I have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed the beſt They could receive. The way which the Athenians uſe to take off from the badneſs of the thing, by giving it a good and innocent appellation, as for a Whore a Miſtreſs; for Taxes Rates; for Garriſons Guards; for Priſons Houſes of Cuſtody; ſeem'd at firſt to be <hi>Solon</hi>'s con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance, who nam'd this taking off the Peoples Debts <hi>Seiſacthia,</hi> a throwing off a Burthen: for the firſt thing which he ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled <note place="margin">Solon <hi>frees the People from their Debts.</hi>
               </note> was that what Debts remain'd ſhould be forgiven, and no man for the future ſhould engage his Body for a ſum of Money: Though ſome (as <hi>Androtion)</hi> affirm that the Debts were not taken off; but the uſe onely leſſened, which ſo pleas'd the People,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:47090:233"/>
that they nam'd that kindneſs <hi>Seiſacthia,</hi> together with the enlarging their Meaſures, and encreaſing the value of their Money; for he made a Pound which before contain'd but ſeventy three Drachms, to contain an hundred, ſo that though the number of pieces in the payment was equal, the value was leſs; which prov'd a conſiderable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to thoſe that were to diſcharge great Debts, and no loſs to the Creditours: But moſt agree that 'twas the taking off the Debts that was call'd <hi>Seiſacthia,</hi> which is confirm'd by ſome places in his Poem, where he glories that he had remov'd the Tyes from their Eſtates, that heretofore they were Slaves now Free, that ſome which were ſeiz'd for their Debts he had brought back from other Countries, where by the length of their exile they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten their Mother Tongue, and ſome he had ſet at liberty which were in cruel ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very at home. When he was deſigning this, a very unlucky thing hapned; for when he had reſolv'd to take off the Debts, and was thinking on a good way and fit beginning for the action, he told ſome of his Friends, <hi>Conon, Clinias</hi> and <hi>Hipponicus,</hi> in whom he had a great deal of confidence, that he would not meddle with the Lands, but onely free the People from their Debts; they uſing the advantage, took up vaſt ſums
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:47090:233"/>
of Money and purchaſed ſome large Farms, and when the Law was enacted they kept the Poſſeſſions, and would not return the Money; which brought <hi>Solon</hi> into a great ſuſpicion and diſlike, as if he himſelf had not been abus'd, but was concern'd in the contrivance: but he preſently ſtop'd this ſuſpicion by releaſing his Debtours of five Talents (for he had lent ſo much) accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Law: others, as <hi>Goluzelus</hi> the Rhodian, ſay fifteen, but his Friends were ever afterward called <hi>Chreocopidoe.</hi> In this he pleas'd neither Party, for the Rich were angry for their Money, and the Poor that the Land was not divided, and (as <hi>Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> ordered in his Commonwealth) all le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd to one degree. He 'tis true being the Eleventh from <hi>Hercules,</hi> and having reign'd many years in <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> had gotten a <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between</hi> Solon <hi>and</hi> Lycurgus.</note> great reputation, power and Friends which he could uſe in modelling his State; and applying force more than perſwaſion inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he loſt his eye in the ſcuffle, brought about the moſt effectual means to preſerve and unite a State by not permitting any to be Poor or Rich in his Commonwealth. But <hi>Solon</hi> could not riſe to that by his Polity, yet he acted to the height of his power, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing but the good will and good opinion of his Citizens to rely on: And that he offended moſt that look'd for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:47090:234"/>
poſture of Affairs, he declares in theſe words:
<q>

                  <l>And ſquint upon me with their envious eyes!</l>

But in a little time being ſenſible of the <note place="margin">Solon <hi>entru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with all the power.</hi>

And for the greater ſecurity of the weak Commons, he gave all liberty to enter an Action againſt another for an injury; ſo <note place="margin">Solon<hi>'s Laws about Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi>

That, ſays he, where thoſe that are not injur'd equally proſecute the unjuſt with thoſe that are: when he had conſtituted the <hi>Areopagus</hi> of the yearly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, <note place="margin">

proud and imperious; he ſettled another Court of four hundred, a hundred out of <note place="margin">

<pb n="302" facs="tcp:47090:236"/>
obſcurity in this Table, and it ſhould run thus, Thoſe that are convicted of ſuch of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences as belong to the cognizance of the Areopagites, <hi>Ephetae,</hi> or the <hi>Prytanes,</hi> when this Law was made, ſhould remain ſtill in diſgrace whilſt others are reſtor'd: and this was his meaning. Amongſt his other <note place="margin">The Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in a Tumult.</note> Laws, that is very peculiar, and ſurpriſing, which makes all thoſe infamous who ſtand Neuters in a Sedition; for it ſeems, he would not have any one inſenſible and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of the Publick, and, ſecuring his private affairs, glory that he had no feeling of the diſtempers of his Country: but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently joyn with the good party and thoſe that had the right upon their ſide, aſſiſt, and venture with them, rather than ſhift out of harms way and watch who would get the better. But that ſeems an abſurd <note place="margin">The Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Hier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſes.</note> and fooliſh Law, which permits an Hiereſs, if her lawfull Husband prove impotent, to lye with his neareſt Kinſman: yet ſome ſay, this Law was well contriv'd againſt thoſe, who, conſcious of their own inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, yet, for the ſake of the portion, would match with Hiereſſes, and make uſe of Law to put a violence upon Nature; for now ſince ſhe can lye with whom ſhe pleaſe, they muſt either abſtain from ſuch Marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges or continue them with diſgrace, and ſuffer for their covetouſneſs and deſign'd
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:47090:236"/>
affront: beſides 'tis well done to confine her to her Husband's neareſt Kinſman, that the Children may be of the ſame Family; and agreeable to this is the Law that the Bride and Bridegroom ſhall be ſhut into a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and eat a Quince together, and that her Husband is oblig'd to go in to ſuch an Heireſs thrice a Month, for though he gets no Children, yet 'tis an honour and due af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which an Husband ought to pay to a vertuous chaſte Wife; it takes off all pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty differences, and will not permit their little quarrels to proceed to a rupture.</p>
            <p>In all other Marriages he forbad Dowries <note place="margin">Concerning other Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages.</note> to be given, the Wife was to have three ſuits of Clothes, a little inconſiderable Houſhold-ſtuff, and that was all: for he would not have Marriages contracted for gain, or an Eſtate, but for pure Love, kind Affection, and to get Children. <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> when his Mother advis'd him to marry one of his Citizens, Indeed, ſays he, by my Tyranny I have broken my Country's Laws, but cannot put a violence upon thoſe of Nature by an unſeaſonable Marriage. Such diſorder is never to be ſuffer'd in a Commonwealth, nor ſuch unſeaſonable and unperforming Marriages, which neither at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their due end, nor fruit: but any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident Governour or Law-giver might ſay to an old Man that takes a young Wife,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:47090:237"/>
what is ſpoken to <hi>Philoctetes</hi> in the Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; Poor Wretch, in what a fit condition art thou to be married! and if he finds a young Man with a rich old Woman, like a Partridge growing fat upon the duty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move him to a Virgin that needs a Husband; and of this enough.</p>
            <p>Another commendable Law of <hi>Solon</hi>'s is <note place="margin">Not to ſpeak evil of the Dead.</note> that which forbids men to ſpeak evil of the Dead; for 'tis pious to think them ſacred, and juſt not to meddle with thoſe that are gone, and politick to prevent the perpetui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of diſcord: He likewiſe forbad them to ſpeak evil of the Living in the Temple, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Tribunal, in the Court, or at the Games; or elſe to pay three Drachmas to the private perſon, and two to the publick; for never to be able to rule paſſion ſhews a weak nature, and ill-breeding: and always to moderate it, is very hard, and to ſome impoſſible: Now the matter of Laws muſt be poſſible if the maker deſigns to puniſh few in order to their amendment, and not many to no purpoſe.</p>
            <p>He is likewiſe much commended for his <note place="margin">Concerning Wills.</note> Law concerning Wills, for before none could be made; but all the wealth and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of the deceaſed belonged to his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but he permitted them, if they had no Children, to beſtow it on whom they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; eſteeming Friendſhip a ſtronger Tye
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:47090:237"/>
than Kindred, and Affection than Neceſſity; and thus made every man's Eſtate in the diſpoſal of the poſſeſſour: yet he allow'd not all ſorts of Legacies, but thoſe onely which were not extorted by the phrenzy of a Diſeaſe, charms, impriſonment, force, or the perſwaſions of his Wife; with good reaſon thinking it all one between deceit and neceſſity, flattery or compulſion, ſince both are equally powerfull to perſwade a man from Reaſon.</p>
            <p>He regulated the Walks, Feaſts, and <note place="margin">Laws concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Women.</note> Mourning of the Women; and took away every thing that was either unbecoming or immodeſt: when they walk'd abroad no more than three Coats were allow'd them; a half penny-worth of meat and drink, nor a Basket above a cubit high; and at night they were not to ſtir but in a Chariot; with a Torch before them. The Mourners <note place="margin">Concerning Mourning.</note> tearing themſelves to raiſe pity, and their lamentations at Strangers Funerals he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad. To offer an Ox at the Grave was not permitted; nor to bury above three Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with the Body, or viſit the Tombs of any beſides their own Family, unleſs at the very Funeral; moſt of which are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe forbidden by our Laws, but this is farther added in ours, that thoſe that are convicted of extravagance in their Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, are to be puniſhed as ſoft and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:47090:238"/>
by the Cenſors of the Women.</p>
            <p>He obſerving the City was fill'd with <note place="margin">Solon <hi>inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Trades.</hi>
               </note> perſons that flock'd from all parts into <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica,</hi> for ſecurity of living, and that moſt of the Country was barren and unfruitfull; and the Traders at Sea imported nothing to thoſe that could give them no exchange: he brought his Citizens to Trade; and made a Law, that no Son ſhould be oblig'd to relieve his Father, who had not bred him up to any Calling. 'Tis true, <hi>Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between</hi> Lycurgus <hi>and</hi> Solon.</note> having a City free from all Strangers, and enough, or (according to <hi>Euripides)</hi> ſufficient for twice ſo many; and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Labourers about <hi>Sparta,</hi> who ſhould not be kept idle, but be broken with continual toil and work, he did well to take off his Citizens from Trades laborious and mechanical, and keep them to their Arms, and teach them onely the Art of War. But <hi>Solon</hi> fitting his Laws according to the ſtate of Things, and not ordering Things according to his Laws, and finding the ground ſcarce rich enough to maintain the Farmers, and altogether unable to feed the lazy multitude; he brought Trades into credit, and ordered the Areopagites to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine how every man got his living, and chaſtiſe the idle: But that Law was more <note place="margin">Law about the Sons of Harlots.</note> rigid which (as <hi>Heraclides Ponticus</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers) declar'd the Sons of Harlots not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:47090:238"/>
to relieve their Fathers, for he that will not marry doth not take a Woman for Children, but for pleaſure, and thus hath his juſt reward, having no pretence to upbraid his Children, to whom he hath made their very Birth a ſcandal and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. But in ſhort, many of <hi>Solon</hi>'s Laws <note place="margin">Solon<hi>'s Laws about Women.</hi>
               </note> about Women are abſurd; for he permitted any one to kill an Adulterer that found him in the Act; if any one forc'd a free Woman, an hundred Drachma's was the Fine; if he entic'd her, twenty; except thoſe that tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for a price, I mean common Whores; for they go openly to thoſe that hire them. He made it unlawfull to ſell a Daughter, or a Siſter, unleſs, being yet unmarried, ſhe was found wanton with a Man. Now 'tis irrational to puniſh the ſame Crime ſometimes very ſeverely and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, and ſometimes very lightly and as 'twere in ſport, with a trivial Fine, unleſs there being little Money then in <hi>Athens,</hi> that ſcarcity made thoſe Mulcts the more grievous puniſhment. The value of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices muſt be one Sheep, and a Drachma for a Buſhel. The Victor in the Iſthmian <note place="margin">The ſcarcity of Money.</note> Games was to have for reward an hundred Drachma's. The Conquerour in the Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an five hundred. He that caught a Dog Wolf, five Drachma's, he that kill'd a Bitch, one: the former ſum (as <hi>Demetrius Phale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus</hi>

aſſerts) was the value of an Ox, the latter of a Sheep: but thoſe prices which in his ſixteenth Table he ſets on the choice Sacrifices were certainly far greater, for elſe they are very little in compariſon of the preſent. The Athenians, their Fields <note place="margin">Whence the Athenian Tribes call'd.</note> being better for Paſture than Corn, were from the beginning great enemies to Wolves; and ſome affirm their Tribes did not take their names from the Sons of <hi>Javan,</hi> but from the different ſorts of Occupation that they followed; the Souldiers were call'd <hi>Hoplitae,</hi> the Craftſ-men <hi>Ergatae;</hi> and of the remaining two, the Farmers, <hi>Georgi,</hi> and the Shepherds and Graſiers <hi>Aigicorae.</hi> Beſides, ſince the Country hath but few <note place="margin">Solon<hi>'s Law about Wells.</hi>
               </note> Rivers, Lakes, or large Springs, and many us'd Wells which they had dug; there was a Law made that where there was a publick Well within a <hi>Hippicon</hi> (that is four Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs) all ſhould draw at that; but when it was farther off they might provide a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Well: and if they had dug ten fathom deep and could find no Water they had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to fetch ten Gallons a day from their neighbours: for he thought it prudent to make proviſion againſt want but not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage lazineſs. Beſides, he ſhew'd his <note place="margin">Laws concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Planting and other things.</note> skill in the orders about planting, for any one that would plant another Tree, was not to ſet it within five foot of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's

Field; but if a Fig or an Olive, not within nine: for their Roots ſpread farther, nor can they be planted near all ſorts of Trees without damage, for they draw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the nouriſhment, and hurt ſome by their venomous effluviums. He that would dig a Pit or a Ditch, was to dig it at as far a diſtance from his neighbour's Ground as it was deep: and he that would raiſe ſtocks of Bees, was not to raiſe them within three hundred feet of thoſe which another had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready rais'd: He permitted onely Oil to be exported, and thoſe that did export any other Fruit, the Archon was ſolemnly to curſe; or elſe pay himſelf an hundred Drachma's: and this Law was written in his firſt Table, and therefore let none think thoſe liars that affirm, the exportation of Figs was heretofore unlawfull; and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former againſt the Delinquents call'd a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cophant.

<pb n="310" facs="tcp:47090:240"/>
did, not to diſcourage Strangers, but rather invite them, by making them ſecure of the privileges of that Government: and beſides he thought they would prove the more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Citizens, who had been forc'd from their own Country, or voluntarily forſook it.</p>
            <p>But the Law concerning publick Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments was peculiarly <hi>Solon</hi>'s, for if any <note place="margin">Law about publick Feaſts.</note> man came often, or if he that was invited refus'd, they were puniſhed; for he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that one was greedy, the other a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temner of the publick: All his Laws he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed for an hundred years, and writ them in wooden Tables nam'd <hi>Axonas,</hi> which might be turn'd round in oblong ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; ſome of their relicks may be now ſeen in the common Hall at <hi>Athens.</hi> Theſe (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> affirms) are called <hi>Cyrbes,</hi> and <hi>Cratinus</hi> the Comedian, ſomewhere ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Draco</hi> and <hi>Solon,</hi> ſays, in thoſe <hi>Cyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes</hi> they now parch Peaſe.

            <p>That <hi>Solon</hi> ſhould diſcourſe with <hi>Croeſus,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Solon <hi>with</hi> Croeſus.</note> ſome think not agreeable with Chronology; but I cannot reject ſo credible a relation, and ſo well atteſted, and (what is more) ſo agreeable to <hi>Solon</hi>'s temper, ſo worthy his wiſedom and greatneſs of mind, becauſe forſooth it doth not agree with ſome Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nological Canons, which thouſands have endeavoured to regulate, and yet to this day could never bring the differing opinions to any agreement. And therefore they ſay <hi>Solon</hi> coming to <hi>Croeſus</hi> at his requeſt, was in the ſame condition, as an inland Man when firſt he goes to ſee the Sea; for as he fanſies every River he meets with to be the Ocean, ſo <hi>Solon,</hi> as he paſs'd through the Court, and ſaw a great many Nobles richly dreſs'd, and proudly attended with a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Guards and Footboys, thought every one had been the King, till he was brought to <hi>Croeſus,</hi> who was deck'd with all the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Jewels, Purple and Embroidery; all that could make him fine, and admired, that he might appear the moſt glorious and gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſpectacle. Now when <hi>Solon</hi> came before him, and ſeem'd not at all ſurpris'd, nor
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:47090:242"/>
gave <hi>Croeſus</hi> thoſe complements he expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but ſhew'd himſelf to all diſcerning eyes, to be a Man that deſpiſed ſuch gaudy vanities; he commanded them to ſhew him all his Wealth, though he did not deſire to ſee it, and all his warlike preparations: now when he return'd from viewing all this, <hi>Croeſus</hi> ask'd him if ever he had ſeen an happier Man than he was? and when <hi>Solon</hi> anſwered he knew one <hi>Tellus</hi> a Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen of his, and told him that this <hi>Tellus</hi> was an honeſt man, had good Children, a competent Eſtate, and dy'd bravely for his Country; <hi>Croeſus</hi> took him for an ill bred fellow, and a fool, for not meaſuring hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs by the abundance of Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and preferring the life and death of a private and mean Man, before ſo much power and ſuch an Empire: he ask'd him again if beſides <hi>Tellus,</hi> he knew any other Man more happy? and <hi>Solon</hi> replying yes, <hi>Cleobis</hi> and <hi>Bito,</hi> who were Brothers, were very loving and extreme dutifull to their Mother; for when the Oxen went but ſlow, they put themſelves into the Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, and drew their Mother to <hi>Juno</hi>'s Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who was extremely pleas'd with their action, and call'd happy by her neighbours; and then ſacrificing, and feaſting, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver roſe again, but died without pains or convulſions immediately after they had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:47090:242"/>
ſo great credit and reputation. What, ſays <hi>Croeſus</hi> angry, and doſt not thou rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon us amongſt the happy men? and <hi>Solon,</hi> unwilling either to flatter, or exaſperate him more, reply'd; The Gods, O King, in other things have given the Greeks no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing great and excellent, ſo our wiſedom is bold, and mean, and low, not noble and Kingly; and this obſerving the numerous misfortunes that attend all conditions, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids us to grow inſolent upon our preſent enjoyments, or to admire any man's happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that may change, for what variety will happen is unknown; but to whom God hath continued happineſs unto the end, that Man we call happy; but his happineſs that is yet alive, is like the glory and crown of a Wreſtler that is ſtill within the ring, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteady, and uncertain: after this he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs'd, having griev'd, but not inſtructed <hi>Croeſus.</hi> But <hi>Aeſop,</hi> he that writ the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, <note place="margin">Solon<hi>'s diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with</hi> Aeſop.</note> (being then at <hi>Sardis,</hi> upon <hi>Croeſus</hi> his invitation, and very much eſteem'd) was concern'd that <hi>Solon</hi> was ſo meanly treated, and gave him this advice: <hi>Solon,</hi> let your viſits to Kings be as ſeldom, or as pleaſant as you can: and <hi>Solon</hi> reply'd, No faith, but let them be as ſeldom, or as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable as you can. Then indeed <hi>Croeſus</hi> deſpis'd <hi>Solon,</hi> but when he was overcome by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> had loſt his City, was taken alive,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:47090:243"/>
condemn'd to be burnt, and laid bound up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Pile before all the Perſians and <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> himſelf; he cry'd out as loud as poſſibly he could three times, O <hi>Solon,</hi> and <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſurpris'd, and ſending ſome to enquire, what Man, or God this <hi>Solon</hi> was, that he onely invok'd in this unavoidable misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune? <hi>Croeſus</hi> told him the whole ſtory, ſaying he was one of the wiſe men of <hi>Greece,</hi> whom I ſent for, not to be inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or to learn any thing that I wanted, but that he ſhould ſee, and be a witneſs of my happineſs: the loſs of which is now a greater evil, than the enjoyment was a good; for when I had them they were goods onely in Opinion, but now the loſs of them hath brought upon me intolerable and real evils; and that man conjecturing theſe preſent calamities would happen, bad me look to the end of my life, and not rely and grow proud upon uncertainties. When this was told <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who was a wiſer man than <hi>Croeſus,</hi> and ſeeing in the preſent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample that <hi>Solon</hi>'s ſaying was confirm'd: he not onely freed <hi>Croeſus</hi> from puniſhment, but honour'd him as long as he lived; and <hi>Solon</hi> had the glory by the ſame ſaying to inſtruct one King, and ſave another.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Solon</hi> was gone, the Citizens began to quarrel; <hi>Lycurgus</hi> headed the lower quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Megacles</hi> the Son of <hi>Alcmaeon</hi> thoſe that
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:47090:243"/>
liv'd towards the Sea, and <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> the upper quarter, in which were the meaneſt people (the <hi>Thetes)</hi> and greateſt enemies to the rich: inſomuch that though the City yet us'd their Laws, yet all look'd for, and deſir'd a change of Government, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the change would be better for them, and put them above the contrary Faction. Affairs ſtanding thus, <hi>Solon</hi> return'd and <note place="margin">Solon <hi>returns to Athens.</hi>
               </note> was reverenced by all and honoured: but his old age would not permit him to be as active, and ſpeak in the publick, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; but privately diſcourſing with the heads of the Factions, he endeavoured to compoſe the differences: <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> ſtill appearing the moſt tractable; for he was a ſweet and taking man in his diſcourſe, a friend to the poor, and very little given to enmity or paſſion, and what his nature had not given, cuſtom and imitation taught; therefore he was truſted more than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, being accounted a prudent moderate Man, one that lov'd equality, and would be an enemy to him that ſtrove againſt the preſent ſettlement, rather than undermine it himſelf; for which his fair carriage he deceiv'd the people. But <hi>Solon</hi> preſently diſcovered him, and found out his deſign, yet did not hate him upon this, but endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to humble him, and bring him off from his ambition, and often told him, and
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:47090:244"/>
others, that if any one would take away his aſpiring thoughts, and deſire of Empire, none would make a more vertuous Man, or a more excellent Citizen. <hi>Theſpis</hi> at this <note place="margin">Tragedies begun.</note> time beginning to act Tragedies, and the thing, becauſe 'twas new, taking very much with the multitude; for 'twas not yet a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſtrife and contention; <hi>Solon,</hi> being by nature a lover of learning, and now in his old age living idle, ſporting and cheering himſelf with Muſick and a glaſs of Wine, went to ſee <hi>Theſpis</hi> himſelf (as the ancient cuſtom was) act; and after the Play was done, he diſcours'd him, and ask'd him if he was not aſham'd to tell ſo many lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch a company; and <hi>Theſpis</hi> replying, 'Tis no harm to ſay or doe ſo in jeſt and merriment; <hi>Solon</hi> vehemently ſtriking his ſtaff againſt the ground, Ay, ſays he, if we honour and commend ſuch Merriment as this, we ſhall find it will creep into our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious affairs. Now when <hi>Piſiſtratus,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <note place="margin">Piſiſtratus <hi>gets the Government.</hi>
               </note> wounded himſelf, was brought into the Market-place in a Chariot, and ſtirred up the People, as if he had been thus dealt with for his affection to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a great many were enraged, and cry'd out: <hi>Solon,</hi> coming cloſe to him, ſaid, <hi>Piſiſtratus,</hi> you do not imitate <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> well; for you cut your ſelf to bring your Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens into a tumult, but he to deceive his
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:47090:244"/>
enemies: Then preſently the People would defend <hi>Piſiſtratus,</hi> and gathered into an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly; where one <hi>Ariſton</hi> making a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they ſhould allow <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> fifty Club-men for a Guard to his perſon, <hi>Solon</hi> oppos'd it, and talk'd a great deal ſuch as he hath left us in his Poems,
<q>You doat upon his words and taking phraſe.</q>
And again,
<q>
                  <l>True, each Man ſingle is a crafty Soul,</l>
                  <l>But all together ye make one giddy Fool:</l>
               </q>
But obſerving the poor men an-end to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie <hi>Piſiſtratus,</hi> and tumultuous; and the rich fearfull, and getting out of harms way, he departed; ſaying he was wiſer than ſome, and ſtouter than others: wiſer than thoſe that did not underſtand the deſign, ſtouter than thoſe that, though they underſtood it, were afraid to oppoſe the Tyranny. Now the People having paſt the Law, were not exact with <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> about the number of his Club-men, but took no notice of it, though he liſted and kept as many as he would, till he ſeiz'd the Caſtle: when that was done, and the City in an uproar, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacles</hi> with all of his Family ſtreight fled: but <hi>Solon,</hi> though he was now very old,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:47090:245"/>
and had none to back him; yet came into the Market-place, and made a ſpeech to his Citizens, ſometimes blaming their inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency and meanneſs of ſpirit, ſometimes paſſionately exhorting them, not thus tame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to loſe their Liberty; and likewiſe then ſpoke that memorable ſaying, that before 'twas an eaſier task to have ſtop'd the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Tyranny, but now the greater and more glorious action to deſtroy it, when it was begun already, and had gathered ſtrength. But all being afraid to ſide with him, he return'd home, and taking his Arms he brought them out, and laid them in the Porch before his Door, with theſe words: To the utmoſt of my power I have ſtriven for my Country and my Laws, and then he buſied himſelf no more: His Friends adviſing him to fly, he refus'd, but writ a Poem, and thus rattled the Athenians,
<q>
                  <l>If now you ſmart, blame not the heavenly powers,</l>
                  <l>For they are good, the fault is onely ours;</l>
                  <l>We gave him all our Forts, we took the Chain,</l>
                  <l>And now he makes us Slaves, yet we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain.</l>
               </q>
               <pb n="321" facs="tcp:47090:245"/>
And many telling him that the Tyrant would have his Head for this, and asking to what he truſted that he ventur'd to ſpeak ſo boldly, he reply'd, my old Age. But <hi>Piſiſtratus,</hi> having gotten the command, ſo honoured <hi>Solon,</hi> obliged and kindly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained him, that <hi>Solon</hi> gave him his advice, and approv'd many of his actions: for he kept many of <hi>Solon</hi>'s Laws, obſerved them himſelf, and compelled his Friends to obey. And he himſelf, though then in power, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accus'd of Murther before the <hi>Areopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> came quietly to clear himſelf, but his accuſer let fall the Indictment. And he added other Laws, one of which is, that the maim'd in the Wars ſhould be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd at the publick charge; this <hi>Heracli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des Ponticus</hi> delivers, and that <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> followed <hi>Solon</hi>'s example in this, who had before determin'd it in the caſe of one <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſippus</hi> that was maim'd: and <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> aſſerts, that 'twas <hi>Piſiſtratus,</hi> not <hi>Solon</hi> that made that Law againſt Lazineſs, which was the reaſon that the Country was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter manur'd, and the City not ſo clogg'd with Inhabitants. Now <hi>Solon</hi> having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun <note place="margin">The Atlantick Iſlands.</note> a great Work in Verſe, the relation or Fable of the Atlantick Iſlands, which he had learn'd from the wiſe Men in <hi>Sais,</hi> and was convenient for the Athenians to know, grew weary of it; not (as <hi>Plato</hi>
               <pb n="322" facs="tcp:47090:246"/>
ſays) by reaſon of his multitude of buſineſs, but his age, and being diſcourag'd at the greatneſs of the task; for theſe Verſes te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie that he had leiſure enough,
<q>Now I grow old, yet ſtill I learn,</q>
And again,
<q>
                  <l>I mind a Song, a Miſs and glaſs of Wine;</l>
                  <l>Theſe are moſt mens delights, and theſe are mine:</l>
               </q>
But <hi>Plato</hi> willing to improve the ſtory of the Iſlands, as if 'twere a fair Eſtate that wanted an Heir, and deſcended to him; makes them ſtately Entrances, noble En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures, large Courts, ſuch as no Eſſay, no Fable, no Fiction ever had before; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning it late, he ended his Life before his Work; and ſo the Readers trouble for the unfiniſh'd part is the greater, as the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction he takes in that which is compleat is extraordinary: for as the City of <hi>Athens</hi> left onely the Temple of <hi>Jupiter Olympius,</hi> unfiniſh'd, ſo <hi>Plato,</hi> amongſt all his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Works, left this onely Piece about the Atlantick Iſlands imperfect: <hi>Solon</hi> liv'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> ſeiz'd the Government (as <hi>Heraclides Ponticus</hi> aſſerts) a long time;

As to the managery of publick affairs, <hi>Solon</hi> in a mimical way, and by a counterfeit ſhew of madneſs ſolicited the enterpriſe of <hi>Salamis;</hi> whereas <hi>Poplicola</hi> in the very beginning, nothing daunted at the greateſt enterpriſes, oppos'd <hi>Tarquin,</hi> detected the Conſpiracy; and being principally concern'd both in preventing the eſcape, and afterwards pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the Traitours; he not onely exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Tyrants from the City, but fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated likewiſe all their expectations from thence: who, as in matters of conflict, tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult or oppoſition he behaved himſelf with courage and reſolution; ſo in peaceable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates where perſwaſion and condeſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were requiſite he was more to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended; <hi>Porſenna</hi> a terrible and invincible Enemy by his means being reconciled and made a Friend.

the times in which they were perform'd: The conduct of a wiſe Politician is ever ſuted to the preſent poſture of affairs, who often by forgoing a part ſaves the whole, and by yielding in a ſmall matter ſecures a greater; as <hi>Poplicola</hi> who by reſtoring what the Romans had lately uſurped, ſaved their undoubted patrimony, and moreover pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the Stores of the enemy for them, who were very much ſtraitned to ſecure their City: For permitting the deciſion of the Controverſie to his Adverſary, he not onely got the victory, but what likewiſe he would willingly have given to have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; <hi>Porſenna</hi> putting an end to the War, and leaving them all the proviſion of his Camp, through a perſwaſion of the vertue and gallant diſpoſition of the Romans, which the Conſul had impreſs'd upon him.</p>

<pb n="369" facs="tcp:47090:269"/>
and beautified it with Pictures and other Ornaments, after it had been burnt by the Perſians.</p>
            <p>It is confeſs'd by all that from his youth he was of an impetuous nature, full of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, apprehenſive, and of a good underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, ever reſolving to undertaking great actions and manage publick affairs. The vacations and times of recreations from his ſtudies, he ſpent not in play or in idleneſs, as other youths, but would be always inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or putting in order ſome Oration or Declamation, the ſubject of which was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the excuſing or accuſing his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſo that his Maſter would often ſay to him, Boy, thou canſt never be any thing mean or indifferent, but muſt at ſome time or other prove either a moſt heroick glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious bleſſing, or a moſt deſtructive plague and ruine to thy Country. He received very ſlowly and negligently ſuch inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as were given him to improve his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and behaviour, or to make him skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in any pleaſure, or to teach him a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile or gracefull deportment; but whatever was delivered to him to improve him in prudence, or in the management of publick affairs, he would apprehend it immediately, and underſtand it beyond one of his years, for in ſuch things he confided in his own natural parts: and therefore afterwards in
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:47090:270"/>
diſcourſes of Humanity, the liberal Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and gentile Education, being derided by thoſe who thought themſelves well skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led therein, he was forced to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſomewhat arrogantly, ſaying, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not how to touch a Lute or play up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Harp, but if a ſmall, mean, obſcure City were committed to my charge, I know well how to make it conſiderable, great and glorious. Yet notwithſtanding this, <hi>Steſimbrotus</hi> ſays, that <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> was a hearer of <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> and that he ſtudied natural Philoſophy under <hi>Meliſſus;</hi> but he muſt needs err in the time, for <hi>Meliſſus</hi> was Commander of the Samians, when <hi>Pericles</hi> made War againſt <hi>Samos,</hi> but <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> was much elder than <hi>Pericles,</hi> whereas <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naxagoras</hi> was very converſant with him. They are therefore rather to be credited, who report, that <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> was an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt follower of <hi>Mneſiphilas,</hi> the Phrearian, who was neither Oratour nor natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, but a Profeſſour of that which was then called Wiſedom, or a prudence exerciſed in ordering publick concerns, and an accurate underſtanding and judgment in affairs of State; which profeſſion being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun by <hi>Solon</hi> was preſerved ſucceſſively as a Sect of Philoſophy; but thoſe who came afterwards, and mixed it with pleadings and diſputes in Law, and transferred the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:47090:270"/>
part of it to a mere art of ſpeaking, and an exerciſe of words and terms, were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally call'd Sophiſters. However <hi>Themiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> when he entred upon affairs of State, applied himſelf to <hi>Mneſiphilas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt motions of his youth he was not regular nor well poiſed, drawing the lines of his affairs according to his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural fancy, without reaſon or inſtruction; and made great alterations in his deſigns on the one hand and on the other; and very often determined for the worſt, as he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards confeſſed, ſaying, Ragged Colts make the beſt Horſes, when it comes to paſs that they are well taught and managed. But thoſe who upon this account do erroneouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raiſe reports of his being diſinherited by his Father, and that his Mother died for grief of her Son's lewdneſs, do certainly moſt falſely calumniate him; and there are divers who relate to the contrary, how that to deterr him from dealing in the publick, and to let him ſee how the vulgar behave themſelves towards their Leaders when they have at laſt no further uſe of them, his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhewed him the old Galleys as they lay neglected and forſaken upon the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore without any care taken of them: yet it is evident, that early, even in his youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger years, <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> did moſt violently and with great eagerneſs apply himſelf to
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:47090:271"/>
underſtand how to govern and to win glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and honour, in which being earneſt to be the firſt, from the very beginning he by this raſhneſs preſently created to himſelf the hatred of the moſt powerfull and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the City, but more eſpecially of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtides</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ariſtides <hi>oppoſes</hi> The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtocles.</note> the Son of <hi>Lyſimachus,</hi> who always oppoſed him; and yet all this great enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty between them ſeem'd to have but a light beginning, for they both were in love with the fair <hi>Steſilaus</hi> of <hi>Teios,</hi> as <hi>Ariſton</hi> the Philoſopher relates: and from that time they perpetually contended with their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Factions in the Commonwealth, not but that the diſagreeableneſs of their lives and manners may ſeem to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the difference; for <hi>Ariſtides</hi> was of a mild nature, good and fair conditioned, and governing all things for the beſt with juſtice and ſecurity, not for glory, or the favour of the people, he was often forced to oppoſe <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> and to ſtand up againſt the encreaſe of his authority who ſtirred up the people to many attempts and brought in great innovations; for it is ſaid that <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> was ſo tranſported with the thoughts of glory, and ſo inflamed with the deſire of performing great actions, that although he were but young when the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel of <hi>Marathon</hi> was fought againſt the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, and the warlike conduct of their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:47090:271"/>
               <hi>Miltiades</hi> was every where noiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, he was taken notice of to be thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and to go meditating many things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone by himſelf, to paſs the nights without ſleep and to refuſe his accuſtomed meetings and recreations, and to thoſe who wondred at this change in his manner of living, and demanded the reaſon of it, he gave this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that the Trophies of <hi>Miltiades</hi> would not let him ſleep; and when others were of opinion that the Battel of <hi>Marathon</hi> would put an end to the War, <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> thought that it was but the beginning of far greater Conflicts, for which he prepared himſelf continually, for the good of all <hi>Greece,</hi> and exerciſed the City as one foreſeeing at a great diſtance what was likely to come to paſs. And firſt of all, the Athenians being accuſtomed to diſtribute the revenue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <note place="margin">Themiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles <hi>adviſes that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of the Silver Mine at</hi> Laurion <hi>ſhould be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Ships.</hi>
               </note> from the Silver Mine at <hi>Laurion;</hi> he was the onely man that durſt propoſe to the people, that this diſtribution ſhould ceaſe, and that with the Money Ships ſhould be built to make War againſt the <hi>Aeginetes,</hi> who were the moſt flouriſhing people in all <hi>Greece,</hi> and by the number of their Ships held the Sovereignty of the Sea: and to this <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> did eaſily perſuade them, not by ſtirring them up againſt <hi>Xerxes</hi> or the Perſians, who were at a great diſtance, and their coming was very uncertain, and at
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:47090:272"/>
that time not much to be feared; but by ſeaſonably making uſe of the emulation, hatred and anger of the Athenians againſt the <hi>Aeginetes,</hi> he induced them to theſe preparations. So that with this Money an hundred Ships were built, with which they afterwards fought againſt <hi>Xerxes;</hi> and in <note place="margin">He cauſes the City to be built towards the Sea.</note> a ſhort time he cauſed them to deſcend, and drew the City toward the Sea, with this advantage, that thoſe who on Land were not a fit match for their neighbours, with their Ships might be able to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Perſians, and become rulers of <hi>Greece.</hi> So that, as <hi>Plato</hi> ſays, inſtead of making them a ſtanding <hi>Militia,</hi> and ſtout Souldiers that would not give way in fight, he turned them into Mariners and Sea-men toſſed about the Sea, and gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for this reproach againſt him, that he took away from the Athenians the Spear and the Shield, and bound them to the Bank and the Oar. Theſe things he performed getting the better of <hi>Miltiades,</hi> who oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, as <hi>Steſimbrotus</hi> relates: but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no he hereby injured the purity and exact rule of Government, let thoſe who are more judicious determine. But that the deliverance of <hi>Greece</hi> came at that time from the Sea, and that thoſe Galleys eſtabliſhed the City of <hi>Athens</hi> again after it was deſtroyed, to omit others, <hi>Xerxes</hi> himſelf is a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:47090:272"/>
witneſs, who though his Land Forces were ſtill entire, after he had been worſted at Sea, fled away; and thought himſelf no ways able to encounter them. And it ſeems to me, that he left <hi>Mardonius</hi> behind him, not out of any hopes he could have to bring them into ſubjection, but to hinder the Greeks from purſuing him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> is ſaid to be very intent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on heaping up riches, that he might be the more liberal; (for loving to ſacrifice often, and to be ſplendid in his entertainment of Strangers, he ſtood in need of a plentifull revenue) yet he is accuſed by others to be parſimonious and ſordid to that degree, that he would ſell the proviſion which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him. He deſired <hi>Philides,</hi> who was a breeder of Horſes, to give him a Colt, and when he refuſed it, he threatned him that in a ſhort time he would turn his Houſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Horſe of Wood, like the Trojan Horſe, intimating thereby that he would ſtir up ſtrife and conteſts between him and thoſe of his own Family and Relations.</p>
            <p>He went beyond all men in ambition and deſire of honour, and when he was but young and not known in the world, he deſired <hi>Epicles</hi> of <hi>Hermiona</hi> who had a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good hand at the Lute, and was much eſteemed by the Athenians, to come and practiſe at his Houſe, being ambitious and
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:47090:273"/>
coveting to be popular, and deſirous that many ſhould enquire after him and frequent his company. When he came to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympian Games, and was ſo ſplendid in his Equipage and Entertainments, in his rich Tents and Furniture, that he ſtrove to out-doe <hi>Cimon,</hi> he diſpleaſed the Greeks, who thought that ſuch magnificence might be allow'd of in one who was a young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of a great Family; but a great piece of inſolence in him to carry himſelf thus high who was an upſtart and of no conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Fortune. He ſet out a Tragedy at his own expenſe, and wan the Prize with his Tragedians, in thoſe times when they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued thoſe Sports with great eagerneſs and ambition, and ſet up a Table of his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with this inſcription; <q>
                  <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> the <note place="margin">He affects popularity.</note> Phrearian was at the charge of it, <hi>Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus</hi> made it, <hi>Adymantus</hi> had the chief Part.</q> He was well beloved by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, and he would ſalute every particular Citizen by his own name, and always ſhew himſelf a juſt Judge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies between private men; and he ſaid to <hi>Simonides,</hi> a Poet of <hi>Chios,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired ſomething of him, when he was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the Army, that was not reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, <hi>Simonides,</hi> you would be no good Poet if you ſhould go contrary to the due Meaſures and Rules of Poetry, nor ſhould I
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:47090:273"/>
be a good Magiſtrate, if for favour or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection I ſhould go contrary to the Law. And at another time laughing at <hi>Simonides</hi> he told him, that he was a man of little judgment to ſpeak againſt the Corinthians who were inhabitants of a great and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſull City, and to have his own Picture drawn ſo often, having ſuch an ill Face.</p>
            <p>When he came to be great and had won <note place="margin">

When the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> was coming down into <hi>Greece,</hi> and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians were in conſultation who ſhould be their General, and many withdrew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of their own accord, being terrified with the greatneſs of the danger; there was one <hi>Epicydes</hi> an Oratour, Son to <hi>Euphemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> a Man who was powerfull in ſpeech and of an eloquent Tongue, but of a faint Heart and a narrow Soul, a mere ſlave to Riches; this Man was deſirous of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and was look'd upon to be in a fair way to carry it by the number of Votes; but <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> fearing that, if the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould fall into ſuch a man's hands, all would be loſt, he bought out <hi>Epicydes;</hi> and for a good ſum of Money cauſed him to deſiſt from his pretenſions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="378" facs="tcp:47090:274"/>
When the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> ſent Meſſengers into <hi>Greece,</hi> with a Greek Interpreter, to demand Water and Earth as an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of their ſubjection and obedience to him, <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> by the conſent of the people ſeis'd upon the Interpreter and put him to death, for preſuming to publiſh the Orders and Decrees of the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> in the Grecian Language; and for this he was highly honoured by the Greeks, as alſo for what he did to <hi>Arthmius</hi> of <hi>Zelea,</hi> who for bringing Gold from the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> to corrupt the Grecians, was by an Order from <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> degraded from all honour, and regiſtred in the Book of infamy, he, and his Children, and his Poſterity: but that which moſt of all redounded to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, was that he put an end to all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Wars of <hi>Greece,</hi> compos'd their differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and perſuaded them to lay aſide all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity during the War with the Perſians; and in this great Work <hi>Chileus</hi> the Arcadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an was very aſſiſting to him.</p>
            <p>Having taken upon himſelf the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Athenian Forces, he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately endeavoured to perſuade the Citizens to leave the City, and to embark them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon their Galleys, and to meet with the Perſians at a great diſtance from <hi>Greece:</hi> but many being againſt this, he led a great <note place="margin">

               <hi>Tempe;</hi> that in ſo narrow a Valley, boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on each ſide with high Rocks, he might the more eaſily defend the Theſſalians, who had not as yet declar'd for the King: but when they return'd without performing any thing, and that it was known that not onely the Theſſalians, but all as far as <hi>Bae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otia</hi> had yielded to <hi>Xerxes;</hi> then the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians more willingly hearkned to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> to fight by Sea, and ſent him with a Fleet to guard the Straits of <hi>Artemiſium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Grecian Fleets were joined, the Greeks would have the Lacedemonians to command, and <hi>Eurybiades</hi> to be their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral; but the Athenians, who ſurpaſſed all the reſt in number of Veſſels, would not condeſcend to come after any other, till <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> perceiving the danger of this conteſt, yielded the command to <hi>Eurybia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> and got the Athenians to ſubmit, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuating the loſs, by perſuading them, that if in this War they behaved themſelves like men, the Grecians for the future of their own accord would reſtore to them the chief command: and by this moderation of his it is evident, that he was the great Authour of the ſafety of <hi>Greece;</hi> and carried on the Athenians to that height of glory, that they ſurpaſſed their enemies in valour, and their friends and confederates in kindneſs and civility.</p>

As ſoon as the Perſian Armada arrived <note place="margin">The great Perſian Fleet comes in ſight.</note> at <hi>Aphetae, Eurybiades</hi> was aſtoniſhed to ſee ſuch a vaſt number of Veſſels before him, and being informed that two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred more ſail'd about behind the Iſland of <hi>Sciathus,</hi> he immediately determined to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire further into <hi>Greece,</hi> and to ſail back into ſome part of <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> where their Land Army and their Fleet might join, for he looked upon the Perſian Forces to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together invincible by Sea. But the Eube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, fearing that the Greeks would forſake them, and leave them to the mercy of the enemy, they ſent <hi>Pelagon</hi> to diſcourſe private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> and with him a good ſum of Money, which he accepted, and gave it to <hi>Eurybiades,</hi> as <hi>Herodotus</hi> reports. In this affair none oppoſed him ſo much as <hi>Architeles</hi> Captain of a Galley called the <hi>Powerfull;</hi> who having not money to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his Sea-men made haſte to ſet ſail, but <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> ſo incenſed the Athenians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, that they ſet upon him and left him not ſo much as his Supper; at which <hi>Architeles</hi> was much ſurpris'd, and took it very ill, but <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> immediately ſent him in a Cheſt a ſervice of all proviſions, and at the bottom of it a Talent of Silver, deſiring him to ſup for the preſent, and to provide for his Sea-men and Souldiers for the future, if not, he would report it amongſt

            <p>Though the Fights between the Grecians and the Perſians in the Straits of <hi>Euboea</hi> were not ſo great in the whole as to make a final deciſion or determination of the War; yet the experience which the Greeks learnt hereby was of great advantage: for thus they effectually underſtood, that neither the number of Ships, their riches and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor their boaſting ſhouts, nor bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Songs of Victory, were any ways terrible to men that dare fight, and were reſolved to come hand to hand with their enemies, theſe things they were to deſpiſe, and to come up cloſe and grapple with their foes.

There is a place ſtill to be ſeen upon this Shoar, where in the middle of a great heap of Sand, they take out from the bottom a dark powder like Aſhes, or ſomething that hath paſſed the Fire; and here they think the Shipwrecks and Bodies of the dead were burnt.

            <p>As <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> ſail'd along the coaſt he took notice of the Harbours and fit places

            <p>Now though <hi>Xerxes</hi> had already paſſed through <hi>Doris,</hi> and invaded the Country of <hi>Phocis,</hi> and had burnt and deſtroyed the Cities of the Phocians, yet the Greeks ſent them no relief; and though the Athenians earneſtly deſired them to oppoſe the Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in <hi>Boeotia,</hi> before they could come into <hi>Attica,</hi> as they themſelves had given aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence to the Greeks by Sea at <hi>Artemiſium,</hi> yet the Grecians gave no ear to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, being wholly intent upon <hi>Peloponne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> and reſolved to gather all their Forces together within the <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> and to build a Wall from Sea to Sea in that ſtrait neck of

Land, which parts the Saronick Bay from the Gulf of <hi>Corinth;</hi> ſo that the Athenians were enraged to ſee themſelves thus betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and at the ſame time afflicted and dejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at their being forſaken by the Greeks: to fight alone againſt ſuch a numerous Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was to no purpoſe, and this onely expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient was left them for the preſent, to leave their City, and betake themſelves to their Ships; which the people were very unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to hearken to, imagining that it would ſignifie little to regard their own ſafety, or to deſire victory, when they had once for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken the Temples of their Gods, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Tombs and Monuments of their Anceſtours to the fury of their Enemies. <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> being at a loſs, and not able to draw the people over to his opinion by any humane reaſon, he ſet his machines on work, as in a Play, and brought in his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelations, wonderfull Signs, Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, Oracles, and myſtical anſwers of the Gods.

towards the Sea. He often repeated to them the Oracle which bad them truſt to Walls of Wood, ſhewing them that Walls of Wood could ſignifie nothing elſe but Ships, and that the Iſland of <hi>Salamine</hi> was not to be termed miſerable or unhappy, but <hi>Apollo</hi> had given it the name of Divine, for that it ſhould be one day very fortunate to the Greeks: at length his opinion prevail'd, and he obtain'd a Decree, that the City ſhould be recommended to the protection of <hi>Minerva</hi> the Tutelary Goddeſs of the Athenians, that they who were of age to bear Arms ſhould embark, and that all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible care ſhould be taken to ſave the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the Women, and the Slaves.

               </note> the return of <hi>Ariſtides</hi> was not the leaſt; for before the War he was oppreſſed by a Faction ſtirred up by <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Baniſhment, but now perceiving that the people regretted the abſence of this great Man; and fearing that he might go over to the Perſians to revenge himſelf, and thereby ruine the affairs of <hi>Greece; Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocles</hi> propoſed a Decree, that thoſe who were baniſhed for a time, might return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to give what aſſiſtence they could to the Grecians, both by their counſel and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, with the reſt of the Athenians.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eurybiades</hi> by reaſon of the greatneſs of <hi>Sparta</hi> was Admiral of the Grecian Fleet, but yet was faint-hearted in time of danger, and willing to weigh Anchor and ſet Sail for the Gulf of <hi>Corinth,</hi> near which the Land Army lay encamped, but <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> violently oppoſed him, upon which happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned many remarkable paſſages, and when <hi>Eurybiades</hi> to blame his impatience told

but a great lover of <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> and Tutour to his Children: upon this occaſion <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> ſent him privately to <hi>Xerxes,</hi> commanding him to tell the King that the Admiral of the Athenians having eſpouſed his intereſt, had ſent early to inform him, that the Greeks were ready to make their eſcape, and that he counſelled him to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their flight, to ſet upon them while they were in this confuſion and at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from their Land Army; and hereby he might deſtroy all their Forces by Sea. <hi>Xerxes</hi> was very joyfull at this meſſage, and received it as from one who wiſhed all things proſperous to him; and therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately iſſued out inſtructions to the Commanders of his Ships, that they ſhould preſently ſet out two hundred Sail, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs all the Iſlands, and encloſe all the Straits and Paſſages, that none of the Greeks might eſcape; and to follow with the reſt of their Fleet at better leiſure. This being done, <hi>Ariſtides</hi> the Son of <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> was the firſt man that perceived it, and went to <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> into his Cabbin; not out of any peculiar Friendſhip, for he had been formerly baniſhed by his means, as hath been related, but to inform him how they were encompaſſed by their enemies. <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtocles</hi> knowing the generoſity of <hi>Ariſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> and being much taken with his Viſit
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:47090:280"/>
at that time, imparted to him all that he had tranſacted by <hi>Sicinus,</hi> and intreated him that having great authority among the Greeks, he would now make uſe of it in joyning with him to induce them to ſtay, and fight their enemies in thoſe narrow Seas. <hi>Ariſtides</hi> applauded <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> and went to the other Commanders and Captains of the Galleys, and encouraged them to engage; yet they did not perfectly aſſent to him, till a Galley of <hi>Tenedos</hi> which revolted from the Perſians, whereof <hi>Panae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> was Commander, came into their Fleet, and confirmed the news that all the Straits and Paſſages were beſet, and then their rage and fury as well as their neceſſity provoked them all to fight.</p>

This is reported by <hi>Phanias</hi> the Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian a great Philoſopher and Hiſtorian. As to the number of the enemies Ships, the Poet <hi>Aeſchylus</hi> writes in a Tragedy called the Perſians, <hi>That to his own knowledge</hi> Xerxes <hi>had a thouſand Ships, of which two</hi>

            <p>As <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> had poſſeſſed the moſt advantageous place, ſo with no leſs conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration he choſe the beſt time of fighting; for he would not ſet the Stemms of his Galleys againſt the Perſians, nor begin the Fight till the time of day was come, when there conſtantly riſes a bluſtring wind from without the Bay, which brings in with it a great Sea, and makes rough Water in the Chanel; this was no inconvenience to the Grecian Ships, which were low built and ſtrong, but ſo far hurtfull to the Perſians, which had high Sterns and lofty Decks, were heavy, and could not eaſily tack, nor feel the Rudder, that it overſet them, or laid their ſides bare to the Grecians, who fiercely aſſaulted them, ſtrictly obeying the orders of <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> who well underſtood what was moſt for their advantage: and when <hi>Ariamenes</hi> Admiral to <hi>Xerxes,</hi> a good <note place="margin">Ariamenes <hi>Admiral to</hi> Xerxes.</note> man, and by far the braveſt and worthieſt of the King's Brothers, made towards <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtocles,</hi> and having a great Ship, threw Darts, and ſhot forth Arrows, as from the Walls of a Caſtle; <hi>Amenias</hi> the Decelian, and <hi>Soſicles</hi> the Pedian, who ſailed in the

ſame Veſſel bore in and attacked him, and both Ships meeting Stemme to Stemme and ſtriking together, their ſharp Stemmes ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with Braſs, pierced through one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Ships, ſo that they were faſtned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; when <hi>Ariamenes</hi> attempting to board them, <hi>Amenias</hi> and <hi>Soſicles</hi> ran at him with their Pikes and thruſt him into the Sea, his Body as it floated amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Shipwrecks was known by <hi>Artemiſia</hi> and carried to <hi>Xerxes.</hi> It is reported that <note place="margin">A Flame in the Air and ſtrange Sounds and Voices heard during the Fight.</note> in the middle of the Fight a great Flame ſhined bright in the Air above the City of <hi>Eleuſis,</hi> and that Sounds and Voices were heard through all the plain of <hi>Thriaſia</hi> as far as the Sea, ſounding like a number of men that were going to celebrate the Myſteries of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and that a miſt ſeemed to riſe from the place from whence this ſound came, and paſſing forward fell upon the Galleys. Others affirmed that they ſaw Apparitions and Spirits in the ſhape of armed Men which reached out their hands from the Iſland of <hi>Aegina</hi> towards the Grecian Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys and were like the <hi>Aeacides,</hi> whoſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence they had implored in their prayers before the Fight. The firſt man that took a Ship was <hi>Lycomedes</hi> the Athenian, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of a Galley, who cut down the enſigns of honour, and dedicated them to <hi>Apollo</hi> crowned with Laurel. And as the Perſians
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:47090:282"/>
fought in a narrow Arm of the Sea, and could bring but part of their Fleet to fight, they fell foul of one another, and the Greeks hereby equalled them in ſtrength, fought with them till the evening, forced them <note place="margin">The Greeks overcome the Medes.</note> back, and obtained ſo clear and celebrated a Victory, as <hi>Simonides</hi> obſerves, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Greek nor any other Nation, ever by Sea performed ſuch glorious ſervice.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> being deſirous to know the opinion of <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> told him, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſet Sail for the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> to break the Bridge of Ships, whereby he might hinder the retreat of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> and keep <hi>Aſia</hi> within <hi>Europe;</hi> but <hi>Ariſtides</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing troubled at his deſign, gave this reply, We have hitherto fought with an enemy who hath regarded little elſe but his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and luxury, but if we ſhut him up within <hi>Greece,</hi> and drive him to neceſſity, he that is Lord of ſuch great Forces, will no longer ſit quietly with an Umbrella of <note place="margin">or Canopy of State.</note> Gold over his Head, looking upon the Fight for his pleaſure, but in ſuch a ſtrait will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt all things; he will be reſolute and

appear himſelf in perſon upon all occaſions, he will ſoon correct his errours, and ſupply what he has formerly omitted through re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſneſs; and will be better adviſed in all things. Therefore it is no ways our inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to take away the Bridge that is already made, but rather to build another if it were poſſible, that he might make his retreat with the more expedition. To which <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtocles</hi> anſwered, if this be requiſite, we muſt immediately uſe all diligence, art and induſtry, to rid our ſelves of him as ſoon as may be: and to this purpoſe he found out among the Captives one of the King of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia's Eunuchs named <hi>Arnaces;</hi> whom he ſent to the King, to inform him, that the Greeks being now victorious by Sea, had decreed to ſail to the Helleſpont, where the Ships were faſtned together, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Bridge; but that <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſionately concerned for the King, revealed this to him, that he might haſten towards the Aſiatick Seas, and paſs over into his own Dominions: and in the the mean he would cauſe delays, and hinder the Confederates from purſuing him. <hi>Xerxes</hi> no ſooner heard this, but being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much terrified, retreated out of <hi>Greece</hi>

which ſo delighted him, that he confeſſed to his Friends, that he then reaped the fruit of all his labours for the Greeks; he was in his own nature a great lover of honour, as is evident from thoſe things which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded of him. When he was choſen Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral by the Athenians, he ended no buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs fully, publick, nor private, but defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all till the day they were to ſet ſail, that diſpatching much buſineſs together, and having to doe with all ſorts of men, he might appear great and able to perform all things. Viewing the dead Bodies caſt up by the Sea, he perceived Collars and Chains of Gold about them, yet paſſed on, onely ſhewing them to a Friend that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, ſaying, Take you theſe things, for you are not <hi>Themiſtocles.</hi> He ſaid to <hi>Antiphates</hi> a young Nobleman who had formerly behaved himſelf haughtily towards him, but now in his glory obſequiouſly waited upon him; young man, we are in the right, and now we doe both as we ſhould doe. He ſaid that the Athenians did not honour him, or admire him, but when they were in danger they ſheltred themſelves under him, as they do in ſtormy foul weather under a Plane-tree; and when they have fair weather again they pull off its Leaves and Fruit, and cut down its fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Branches. A Seriphian telling him that
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:47090:284"/>
he had not obtained this honour by himſelf but by the greatneſs and ſplendour of his City, he replied, You ſpeak truth, for I ſhould never have been eſteemed if I had been of <hi>Seriphus:</hi> nor would you have come to any thing though you had been of <hi>Athens.</hi> A Commander of the Army who thought he had performed conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſervice for the Athenians, boaſting and comparing his actions with thoſe of <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> he told him that the day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Feſtival reproached the Feſtival, that upon her day thoſe who were laborious and induſtrious refreſhed themſelves, but upon the Feſtival the ſluggard and luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enjoyed all things, to which the Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val replyed, it is true, yet if I had not been before you, you had not been at all; ſo if <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> had not been before you where had you been now? Laughing at his own Son, who was ſomewhat too bold through the indulgence and fondneſs of his Mother, he told him that he had the moſt power of any one in <hi>Greece;</hi> for the Athenians com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the reſt of <hi>Greece,</hi> I command the Athenians, your Mother commands me, and you command your Mother. Loving to be ſingular in all things, when he had Land to ſell, he ordered the Cryer to give notice that there were good neighbours near it. Of two who made love to his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:47090:285"/>
he preferred the Vertuous before the Rich, ſaying, he deſired a Man without Riches rather than Riches without a Man, with many ſuch expreſſions.</p>
            <p>After theſe things he began to build and <note place="margin">

                  <hi>He fortifies the Haven of</hi> Piraea.</note> of good Ports, he fortified the Haven of <hi>Piraea,</hi> and joyned the whole City to the Sea, ordering the publick affairs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the judgment of the old Kings of <hi>Athens;</hi> who endeavouring to withdraw their Subjects from the Sea and ſailing about,

and to accuſtom them to live by planting and tilling the Earth, publiſhed the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe between <hi>Minerva</hi> and <hi>Neptune,</hi> and how they contended for the patronage of the Athenians, when <hi>Minerva</hi> by ſhewing to the Judges an Olive Tree, was declared to be their tutelary Goddeſs; but <hi>Themiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> did not onely joyn the Haven of <hi>Piraea</hi> to the City, as the Poet <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, but he joyned the City to the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the Land to the Sea, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the power of the People againſt the Nobility; the Authority coming into the hands of Watermen, Mariners and Maſters of Ships: and ordered that the Pulpit built in the Market-place for publick Orations, ſhould be placed towards the Sea, which the thirty Tyrants afterwards turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Land; ſuppoſing that great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by Sea would give life and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a popular Government; but that Labourers and Husbandmen would be leſs offended at the greatneſs of the Nobility: but <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> had a higher opinion of Sea forces.</p>
            <p>After the departure of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> when the Grecian Fleet was arrived at <hi>Pagaſa,</hi> where they wintered, <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> in a publick Oration to the people of <hi>Athens,</hi> telling them that he had a deſign to perform ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that would be very beneficial and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:47090:286"/>
to the Athenians, but that it was of ſuch a nature, that it could not be made publick or communicated to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in general: The Athenians ordered him to impart it to <hi>Ariſtides</hi> onely; and if he approv'd of it to put it in practice, and when <note place="margin">

               <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> had diſcovered to him that his deſign was to burn the Grecian Fleet in the Haven of <hi>Pagaſa; Ariſtides</hi> coming out to the people, gave this report of the ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geme contrived by <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> that there was nothing more advantageous, nor could any thing conduce more to the proſperity and grandeur of <hi>Athens</hi> than this, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all that it would be the moſt unjuſt action in the world, at which the Athenians com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> to deſiſt from his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and to think no further of it.</p>
            <p>When the Lacedemonians propoſed at the general Council of the Amphictyoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that the Repreſentatives of thoſe Cities which were not in the League, nor had fought together againſt the Perſians, ſhould be excluded out of that Aſſembly; <hi>Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocles</hi> fearing that the Theſſalians with thoſe of <hi>Thebes, Argos</hi> and others, being thrown out of the Council, the Lacedemonians would become wholly maſters of the Votes, and act what they pleaſed; he applied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Deputies of the Cities, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with the Members then ſitting to
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:47090:286"/>
alter their opinions in this point, remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating to them that there were but one and thirty Cities which did partake of the War, and that moſt of theſe alſo were very ſmall, and how intolerable it would be, if the reſt of <hi>Greece</hi> ſhould be excluded; and that the General Council ſhould come to be ruled by two or three great Cities. By this he chiefly incurred the high diſpleaſure and hatred of the Lacedemonians, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards promoted <hi>Cimon</hi> to all honours, and placed him as an emulatour and adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> in all affairs of State.</p>
            <p>He was alſo burthenſome to the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, ſailing about the Iſlands and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting money from them. <hi>Herodotus</hi> ſays, that requiring money of thoſe of the Iſland of <hi>Andros,</hi> he told them, that he had brought with him two Goddeſſes, Perſuaſion and Force; and they anſwered him that they had alſo two great Goddeſſes which prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited them from giving him any money; Poverty and Impoſſibility. <hi>Timocreon</hi> the Rhodian Poet reprehends him ſomewhat bitterly for being wrought upon by money to let thoſe who were baniſhed return, and for betraying one who was his Gueſt and Friend.

For the Exoſtraciſm was inſtituted not ſo much to puniſh the Offender, as to mitigate and pacifie the fury of the envious, who deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to depreſs thoſe who were tranſcendent in eminence and glory, and by fixing this diſgrace upon them, they exhaled part of the venomous rancour of their minds.</p>

            <p>When <hi>Pauſanias</hi> went about this treaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable deſign, he concealed it at firſt from <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> though he were his intimate Friend, but when he ſaw him expelled out of the Commonwealth, and how impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently he took his baniſhment, he ventured to communicate it to him, and deſired his aſſiſtence, ſhewing him the King of <hi>Perſia</hi>'s

However <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> immediately rejected the propoſals of <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> and wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to be a party in the enterpriſe, though he never revealed thoſe diſcourſes nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the Conſpiracy to any man, either expecting that it would be diſcovered by other means, or hoping that <hi>Pauſanias</hi> would deſiſt from his intentions, ſeeing that he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted without due conſideration things that were abſurd, dangerous, and that could not be put in practice.</p>
            <p>After that <hi>Pauſanias</hi> was put to death, Letters and Writings being found concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this matter which rendred <hi>Themiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> ſuſpected, the Lacedemonians were cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous againſt him, and the envious Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians accuſed him, when being abſent from <hi>Athens,</hi> he made his defenſe by Letters, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially againſt the chief accuſations, and wrote to the Athenians in anſwer to the malicious detractions of his enemies, urging that he who was always ambitious to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, was never born to ſerve, and ſhould be very unwilling to become a Slave, would never ſell himſelf and his Country to the Perſians the mortal enemies of the Greeks.</p>

For holding the young Prince (who was
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:47090:289"/>
then a Child) in his Armes, he proſtrated himſelf before the King's Houſhold Gods; this being the moſt ſacred and onely man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſupplication among the Moloſſians, which was not to be refuſed, and ſome ſay that Queen <hi>Phthia</hi> informed <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> of this way of petitioning, and placed her young Son near to him before the Figures of their domeſtical Deities: others ſay that King <hi>Admetus,</hi> that he might be under a religious obligation not to deliver him up to thoſe who perſecuted him, helped him to act that part, and inſtructed him in this ſolemn Rite.

The barbarous Nations, and amongſt them the Perſians eſpecially, are naturally jealous, clowniſh and moroſe towards their Women, not onely to their Wives, but alſo to their Slaves and Concubines, which they keep ſo ſtrictly that never any one ſees them abroad, even at their Meals they are ſhut up within Doors; and when they take a journey, they are carried in cloſe Coaches, or put under a little Tent or Covering ſhut cloſe on all ſides, and ſet upon a Waggon; ſuch a travelling Carriage being prepared for <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> they overwhelmed him, and hid him in it, and carried him on his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and told thoſe whom they met or diſcourſed with upon the Road, that they carried a young Grecian Lady out of <hi>Ionia</hi> to a Noble-man at Court.</p>

Commander of a thouſand men, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, that he was a Grecian and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſpeak with the King about important affairs, concerning which the King was extremely ſolicitous; <hi>Artabanus</hi> anſwered him, Stranger, the Laws of men are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and ſome eſteem one thing honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and ſome another, but it is honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for all men to obſerve and commend the Laws of their own Country; it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable for you Grecians to admire liberty and equality, but amongſt our many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Laws, we account this the moſt glorious, to honour the King, and to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him, as the Image of that great Deity that preſerves and protects the Univerſe; and if you can accuſtom your ſelf to our Laws, and fall down before the King and worſhip him, you may both ſee him and ſpeak to him; but if your mind be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, you muſt make uſe of others to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede for you; for it is not the national cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom here for the King to give audience to any one that doth not fall down before him: <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> hearing this, replied, <hi>Artabanus,</hi> I that come hither to encreaſe the power and glory of the King, will not onely ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my ſelf to his Laws, ſince it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God to raiſe the Perſian Empire to this greatneſs; but will alſo cauſe many more to be worſhippers and adorers of the King,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:47090:292"/>
Let not this therefore be an impediment, why I ſhould not communicate to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty what I have to impart, <hi>Artabanus</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him who muſt we tell him that you are? for you ſeem to be no ordinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> anſwered, no man muſt be informed of this before the King himſelf.

earth; ſince which all things having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired to augment my preſent calamities, ſutable to ſuch a condition, I come hither, hoping to receive mercy from a gracious reconciled Sovereign, who hath laid aſide his anger, and is no longer mindfull of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer evils; humbly imploring you, that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Greeks for witneſſes of the ſervices I have done for <hi>Perſia,</hi> you will make uſe of this occaſion to ſhew the world the nobleneſs of your vertue, rather than to fulfill your wrath, or ſatisfie your indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hereby you will preſerve an humble ſuppliant; if otherwiſe, you deſtroy a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the Perſians, and a publick enemy of the Greeks. Beſides this, he related the manner of the Viſion, which he ſaw at <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogenes</hi>'s Houſe, and what was directed him by the Oracle of <hi>Dodona,</hi> where <hi>Jupiter</hi> commanded him to go to him that had a name like his, by which he underſtood, that he was ſent from <hi>Jupiter</hi> to <hi>Xerxes,</hi> ſeeing that they had both the name of mighty Kings; and he knew no other great ſacred powers but <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and the Perſian Emperour.</p>
            <p>The King heard him attentively, and though he admired his underſtanding and courage, gave him no anſwer at that time, but when he was with his intimate Friends, he rejoyced in his great good fortune, and
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:47090:293"/>
eſteemed himſelf very happy in this, and prayed to his God <hi>Arimanius,</hi> that all his enemies might be ever of the ſame mind with the Greeks, to provoke, abuſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell the braveſt men amongſt them. Then he ſacrificed to the Gods, and preſently fell to drinking, and was ſo well pleaſed that in the night in the middle of his ſleep, he cried out for joy three times, I have <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtocles</hi> the Athenian.</p>
            <p>In the morning, <hi>Xerxes</hi> calling together the chief of his Court, had <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> brought before him, who expected no good would come of it, eſpecially when he ſaw the Guards were fiercely ſet againſt him as ſoon as they knew his name, and gave him ill language; and as he came forward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the King, who was ſet down and the reſt kept ſilence, paſſing by <hi>Roxanes</hi> a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of a thouſand men, he heard him ſigh and whiſper ſoftly to him without ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out of his place, You ſubtile Greek Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, the Kings good Genius hath brought thee hither; yet when he came into the preſence, and fell down, the King ſaluted him, and ſpake to him kindly, telling him, he was now indebted to him two hundred Talents; for it was juſt and reaſonable, that he ſhould receive the reward which was propoſed to whoſoever ſhould bring <hi>Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocles;</hi> and promiſing much more, and
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:47090:293"/>
encouraging him, he commanded him to ſpeak freely what he would concerning the affairs of <hi>Greece, Themiſtocles</hi> replied, that a man's Diſcourſe was like to a rich Perſian Carpet variouſly wrought and figured, the beautifull Images and proper Figures of which are beſt repreſented when they are clearly and fairly opened; but when they are contracted and folded up, they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured and loſt, and therefore he deſired <note place="margin">He learns the Perſian Language.</note> time to learn the language perfectly, in which he was to expreſs his mind, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold his ſecret ſervices. The King being pleaſed with the compariſon, and bidding him take what time he would, he deſired a year, in which time having learnt the Perſian Language ſufficiently he ſpake with the King by himſelf without the help of an Interpreter: and thoſe who were at a diſtance thought that he diſcourſed onely about the affairs of <hi>Greece;</hi> but there happening at the ſame time great alterations at Court, and removals of the King's Favourites, he drew upon himſelf the envy of the great ones; who imagined, that he who had this great liberty might take the boldneſs to ſpeak many things concerning them: for the favours ſhewn to other Strangers were nothing in compariſon of the honours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on him; the King inviting him to partake of his own paſtimes and recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:47090:294"/>
both at home and abroad, carrying him with him a-hunting; and made him his intimate ſo far, that he permitted him not onely to come into the preſence of the Queen Mother, but alſo to wait upon her often, and converſe familiarly with her. And beſides this, he heard the Diſcourſes of the Magicians, by the King's eſpecial command; and was inſtructed in the ſecret Philoſophy and Magick of the Perſians.</p>

<pb n="419" facs="tcp:47090:294"/>
was a greater communication between the Greeks and Perſians than formerly, when they invited any conſiderable Grecian into their ſervice, to encourage him they would ſignifie to him by Letters, that he ſhould be as great with them as <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> was with <hi>Xerxes.</hi> They relate alſo how <hi>Themiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> when he was in great proſperity, and courted by many, ſeeing himſelf ſplendidly ſerved at his Table, he turned to his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and ſaid, Children, we had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done if we had not been undone.

afterwards carried himſelf more reſervedly and circumſpectly, fearing the envy of the Perſians; and gave over travelling about <hi>Aſia,</hi> and lived quietly in his own Houſe in <hi>Magneſia,</hi> where for a long time he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his days in great ſecurity, as <hi>Theopom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> writes, being courted by all, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented with rich Gifts, and honoured equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the greateſt perſons in the Perſian Empire; the King at that time not minding his concerns with <hi>Greece,</hi> being inceſſantly buſied about the affairs of the upper Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.</p>

            <byline>Engliſhed from the Greek, By <hi>Mich. Payne, Trin.</hi> Coll. <hi>Cant.</hi> Soc.</byline>
            <p>AMong the many remarkable things that are related of <hi>Furius Camillus,</hi> this above all ſeems moſt ſingular and ſtrange, that he who for the moſt part was in the higheſt commands, and had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the greateſt Actions, was five times choſen Dictatour, triumphed four times, and was ſtyled a <hi>Second Founder</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was ſo much as once Conſul. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whereof was the ſtate and temper of the
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:47090:299"/>
then Commonwealth; for the People being at diſſention with the Senate ſtifly refuſed to return Conſuls, but in their ſtead elected other Magiſtrates called <hi>Military Tribunes,</hi> who though they acted every thing with full Conſular Power and Authority, yet their Government was leſs grievous to the People, by reaſon they were more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: for to have the management of affairs entruſted in the hands of ſix perſons rather than two, was ſome eaſe and ſatisfaction to thoſe who could not endure the Dominion of a <hi>few.</hi> This was the condition of the times when <hi>Camillus</hi> flouriſhed in the height of his actions and glory, and although the Government in the mean time had often proceeded to Conſular Elections, yet he could never perſwade himſelf to be Conſul, againſt the good-will and inclination of the People. In all other his adminiſtrations which were many and various, he ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved himſelf, that when he was alone in Authority, his power was exerciſed as in common, but the honour of all actions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounded intirely to himſelf, even when in joint Commiſſion with others; the reaſon of the former was his moderation, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding without pride or inſolence; of the latter, his great judgment and wiſedom, wherein without queſtion he excelled all others. And whereas the Houſe of the
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:47090:299"/>
               <hi>Furii</hi> was not at that time of any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable quality, he was the firſt that raiſed himſelf to honour, ſerving under <hi>Poſthumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Tubertus,</hi> Dictatour, in the great Battel againſt the <hi>Aeques</hi> and <hi>Volſces;</hi> for riding out from the reſt of the Army, and in the charge receiving a wound in his Thigh, he for all that gave not over the fight, but plucking out the Dart that ſtuck cloſe in the wound, and engaging with the braveſt of the enemy, he put them to flight, for which action, among other rewards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on him, he was created Cenſor, an <note place="margin">Camillus <hi>made Cenſor.</hi>
               </note> Office in thoſe days of great eſteem and authority. During his Cenſorſhip one ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good act of his is recorded, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Wars had made many Widows, he obliged ſuch as had no Wives, ſome by fair perſwaſion, others by threatning to ſet Fines on their heads, to take them in marriage. Another neceſſary one, in cauſing Orphans to be rated, who before were exempted from Taxes, the frequent and chargeable Wars requiring more than ordinary expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to maintain them. But that which pinched them moſt was the Siege of <hi>Veii</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Siege of</hi> Veii.</note> (ſome call them <hi>Venetani.)</hi> This was the head City of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> not inferiour to <hi>Rome,</hi> either in number of Arms or multitude of Souldiers, inſomuch that preſuming on her wealth and magnificence, and priding her
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:47090:300"/>
ſelf in the variety of pleaſures ſhe enjoyed, ſhe had fought many a fair Battel with the Romans, contending for Glory and Empire. But now they had quitted their former am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition having been weakned and brought low in many notable encounters, ſo that having fortified themſelves with high and ſtrong Walls, and furniſhed the City with all ſorts of Weapons offenſive and defenſive, as likewiſe with Corn and all manner of Proviſions, they cheerfully endured the Siege, which though tedious to them, was no leſs troubleſome and vexatious to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers. For the Romans having never been accuſtomed to lie long abroad in the heat of Summer, and conſtantly to winter at home, they were then firſt compelled by the Tribunes, to build Forts and Garriſons in the Enemies Country, and raiſing ſtrong Works about their Camp to joyn Winter and Summer together. And now the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth year of the War drawing to an end, the Commanders began to be ſuſpected as too ſlow and remiſs in driving on the Siege, infomuch that they were diſcharged and others choſen for the War, among whom was <hi>Camillus</hi> then ſecond time Tribune. But at preſent he had no hand in the Siege, his lot being to make War upon the <hi>Fali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſces</hi> and <hi>Capenates,</hi> who taking advantage of the Romans being buſied on all hands,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:47090:300"/>
had much ſpoiled their Country, and through all the Tuſcan War given them ſore diverſions, but were now reduced by <hi>Camillus,</hi> and with great loſſes ſhut up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their Walls.</p>
            <p>And now in the very heat of the War an <note place="margin">The ſtrange accident of the Alban Lake.</note> accident happened to the Alban Lake no leſs wonderfull than the moſt incredible things that are reported, and by reaſon no viſible cauſe could be aſſigned, or any natural be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning whereto to aſcribe it, it became matter of great amazement. It was the beginning of Autumn, and the Summer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had neither been very rainy, nor in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance over troubled with Southern winds, and of the many Lakes, Brooks and Springs of all ſorts wherein <hi>Italy</hi> abounds, ſome were wholly dried up, others drew very little Water with them. But all the Rivers, as they conſtantly uſed in Summer, ran in a very low and hollow Chanel. But the Alban Lake that is fed by no other waters but its own, being compaſſed about with fruitfull Mountains, without any cauſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it were Divine, began viſibly to riſe and ſwell, increaſing to the feet of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and by degrees reaching to the very tops of them, and all this without any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent toſſing, or agitation of its Waves. At firſt it was the wonder of Shepherds and Herdmen, but when the Earth which like
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:47090:301"/>
a great Dam held up the Lake from falling into the lower grounds, through the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity and weight of Water was broken down; and that in a violent ſtream it ran through the plow'd Fields and Plantations, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it ſelf in the Sea; it did not onely ſtrike terrour in the Romans, but was thought by all the inhabitants of <hi>Italy</hi> to portend ſome extraordinary events. But the greateſt talk of it was in the Camp that beſieged <hi>Veii,</hi> when once this accident of the Lake came to be known among them, and as in long Sieges it is uſual for parties of both ſides to meet and converſe with one another; it happened that a Roman had <note place="margin">A ſubtile fetch of a Roman Souldier.</note> gained much confidence and familiarity with one of the beſieged, a man well verſed in ancient learning, and had the reputation of more than ordinary skill in divination. The Roman obſerving him to be overjoy'd at the ſtory of the Lake, and to mock at the Siege, told him that this was not the onely prodigy that of late had happened to the Romans, but that others more wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full than this had befallen them, which he was willing to communicate to him, that he might the better provide for his private affairs in theſe publick diſtempers. The man greedily embraced the motion, expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to hear ſome wonderfull ſecrets, but when by little and little he had drill'd him
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:47090:301"/>
on in diſcourſe, and inſenſibly drawn him a good way from the Gates of the City, he ſnatched him up by the middle, being ſtronger than he, and by the aſſiſtence of others that came running from the Camp, ſeized and delivered him to the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. The man reduced to this neceſſity, and knowing that deſtiny is not to be avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, diſcover'd to them the ſecret counſels of his Country. That it was not poſſible the City ſhould be taken, untill the Alban Lake, which now broke forth and had found out new paſſages, was drawn back from that courſe, and ſo diverted, that it could not mingle with the Sea. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ambaſſadours ſent to</hi> Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos.</note> having heard and deliberated of the matter, decreed to ſend to <hi>Delphos</hi> to ask counſel of that God; the Meſſengers were perſons of the greateſt quality, <hi>Coſſus Lici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, Valerius Potitus</hi> and <hi>Fabius Ambuſtus;</hi> who having made their voiage by Sea, and conſulted the God, returned with other anſwers, particularly that there had been a neglect of ſome of their Country Rites re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the Latine Feaſts. As for the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban Water, the Oracle commanded, that if it was poſſible, they ſhould draw it from the Sea, and ſhut it up in its ancient bounds; but if that was not to be done, then they ſhould bring it down into Ditches and Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches into the lower grounds, and ſo dry it
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:47090:302"/>
up; which meſſage being delivered, the Prieſts performed what related to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, and the People went to work, and turned the Water.</p>
            <p>And now the Senate in the tenth year of the War taking away all other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands created <hi>Camillus Dictatour,</hi> who choſe <hi>Cornelius Scipio</hi> for his General of Horſe; and in the firſt place he made Vows unto the Gods, that if they would grant a happy concluſion of that War, he would celebrate to their Honour the <hi>great Sports,</hi> and dedicate a Temple to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs whom the Romans call <hi>Matuta the Mother,</hi> but from the Ceremonies which are uſed, one would verily think ſhe was <hi>Leucothea,</hi> for leading a Servant-maid into the ſecret part of the Temple they there buffet her, and then drive her out again; and they embrace their Brothers Children, more than their own; and in the matter of Sacrifices uſe the ſame ceremonies as to <hi>Bacchus</hi> his Nurſes, and what is cuſtomary in the ſad caſe of <hi>Ino</hi> in remembrance of the Concubine. <hi>Camillus</hi> having made theſe Vows, marched into the Country of the <hi>Faliſces,</hi> and in a great Battel overthrew them and the <hi>Capenates</hi> their Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates; afterwards he turned to the Siege of <hi>Veii,</hi> and finding that to take it by aſſault <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Siege of</hi> Veii.</note> would prove a difficult and hazardous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:47090:302"/>
he cut Mines under ground, the Earth about the City being eaſy to break up, and allowing as much depth as would carry on the Works without being diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Enemy. This deſign going on in a hopefull way, he without, gave aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults to the Enemy to divert them about the Walls, whilſt they that worked under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground in the Mines were inſenſibly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being perceived, got within the Caſtle, under the Temple of <hi>Juno,</hi> which was the greateſt and moſt celebrated in all the City. It is reported that the Prince of the Tuſcans was at that very time at his Devotions, and that the Prieſt after he had looked into the Entrails of the Beaſt, ſhould cry out with a loud voice, That the Gods would give the victory to thoſe that ſhould finiſh thoſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices: and that the Romans who were in the mines hearing the words, immediately pull'd down the Floor, and aſcending with noiſe and claſhing of Weapons, frighted away the Enemy, and ſnatching up the Entrails carried them to <hi>Camillus.</hi> But this may look like a Fable. The City being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by ſtorm, and the Souldiers buſied in pillaging and gathering an infinite quantity of Riches and Spoil, <hi>Camillus</hi> from the high Tower viewing what was done, at firſt wept for pity; and when they that were by, congratulated his good ſucceſs,
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:47090:303"/>
he lift up his hands to Heaven, and broke out into this Prayer. <hi>O moſt mighty Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ye Gods that are Judges of good and evil actions, Ye know that not without juſt cauſe, but conſtrained by neceſſity we have been forced to revenge our ſelves on the City of our unrighteous and implacable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. But if in the viciſſitude of things, there be any calamity due, to countervail this great felicity, I beg that it may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from the City and Army of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, and with as little hurt as may be, fall upon my own Head.</hi> Having ſaid theſe words, and juſt turning about (as the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of the Romans is to turn to the right when they worſhip or pray) he fell flat to the ground, to the aſtoniſhment of all that were preſent. But recovering himſelf pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently from the fall, he told them, that it had ſucceeded to his wiſh, a ſmall miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance in recompence of the greateſt good fortune.</p>
            <p>Having ſacked the City, he reſolved ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he had vowed to carry <hi>Juno</hi>'s Image unto <hi>Rome;</hi> and the Workmen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready for that purpoſe, he ſacrificed to the Goddeſs, and made his ſupplications, that ſhe would be pleaſed to accept of their devotion toward her, and graciouſly vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to accept of a place among the Gods that precided at <hi>Rome:</hi> They ſay, that the
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:47090:303"/>
Statue anſwered in a low voice, <hi>that ſhe was ready and willing to go. Livy</hi> writes that in praying, <hi>Camillus</hi> touched the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs, and invited her, and that ſome of the ſtanders by cryed out, <hi>that ſhe was willing.</hi> They who ſtickle moſt for this Miracle, and endeavour to defend it, have the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull fortune of that City on their ſides, which from a ſmall and contemptible be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning attained to that greatneſs and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which it could never have done, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thoſe many and great manifeſtations of God upon all occaſions appearing for it. Beſides, they produce other Wonders of the like nature, as the often ſweating of Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and that they have ſometimes been heard to groan, as likewiſe the turning aſide of ſome, and nodding and approving of others, as many of the Ancients have reported; and we our ſelves could relate divers wonderfull things which we have heard from men of our own time, which are not lightly to be rejected: but to give too eaſy credit to ſuch things, or wholly to disbelieve them, is equally dangerous, by reaſon of humane infirmity, which hath no bounds or command of it ſelf, but is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times carried to ſuperſtition and dotage, otherwhile to the contempt and neglect of all Religion. But moderation is the beſt, and to doe nothing too much. But <hi>Camil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
               <pb n="438" facs="tcp:47090:304"/>
whether puffed up with the greatneſs <note place="margin">Camillus<hi>'s deportment upon the ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of</hi> Veii <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſtfull to the Romans.</hi>
               </note> of the action to have won a City that was competitour with <hi>Rome,</hi> and had held out a ten years ſiege, or exalted with the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of thoſe that were about him, aſſumed to himſelf more than became a civil and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Magiſtrate. Among other things was the pride and haughtineſs of his Triumph, dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving through <hi>Rome</hi> in a Charriot drawn with four White Horſes, no General either before or ſince having done the like; for the Romans eſteem that carriage to be ſacred and peculiar onely to the King and Father of the Gods. This alienated the hearts of the Citizens from him who were not accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to ſuch pomp and bravery.</p>
            <p>The ſecond pique they had againſt him, was his oppoſing the Law by which the City was to be divided; for the Tribunes of the People preferred a Law, that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Senate ſhould be divided into two parts, one of which ſhould remain at home, the other as the lot ſhould give it remove to the new-taken City. By which means they ſhould not onely have much more Room, but by the advantage of two great and fair Cities be better able to maintain their Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, and the reſt of their plentifull For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. The People therefore who were now grown rich and numerous, greedily embraced it, and in great crouds, began
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:47090:304"/>
to tumult in the publick Courts, deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to have it put to the Vote. But the Senate and ableſt Citizens judging the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Tribunes to tend rather to the deſtruction than diviſion of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet unable to bear up againſt it themſelves, flew to <hi>Camillus</hi> for aſſiſtence, who fearing to come to the open encounter, yet by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual flinging in new occaſions to buſy and employ their heads, made a ſhift to ſtave off the Law. For theſe things he was diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht by the People. But the greateſt and moſt apparent cauſe of their hatred againſt him, aroſe from the tenths of the Spoil, the multitude having herein, if not ſo juſt, yet a plauſible pretence againſt him. For it ſeems, as he went to the ſiege of <hi>Veii,</hi> he had vowed to <hi>Apollo,</hi> that if he took the City, he would dedicate to him the tenth of the Spoil. The City being taken <note place="margin">Camillus <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindfull of his Vow.</hi>

Some time afterwards, when his Authority was laid down, he brought the matter before the Senate, and the Prieſts at the ſame time reported out of the Sacrifices, that the anger of the Gods was portended, and that they were not to be appeaſed without expiation and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings.

The Senate decreed the obligation to be in force.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing it was difficult for every one to produce the ſame very things they had taken to be divided anew, they ordained that every one upon oath ſhould bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Publick the tenth part of his gains. This ſeemed very ſevere and grievous to the Souldiers, who ceaſed not to murmur, that poor men, and ſuch as had endured ſo much labour and travail in the War, ſhould be forced, out of what they had gained and ſpent, to bring in ſo great a proportion; <hi>Camillus</hi> being aſſaulted by their clamour and tumults, for want of a better excuſe, betook himſelf to the meaneſt of defences, by confeſſing he had forgotten his Vow; but they complained that he that then vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the tenth of the Enemy, now levied it out of the tenths of the Citizens. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, every one having brought in his due proportion, it was decreed that out of it a Bowl of maſſy Gold ſhould be made and ſent unto <hi>Delphos.</hi> But there was great <note place="margin">

<pb n="441" facs="tcp:47090:305"/>
of Gold. The Senate, to give them the honour they had deſerved, ordained that funeral Orations ſhould be uſed at the obſequies of Women, as well as Men, it having never before been a cuſtom that any Woman after death was publickly praiſed. Chuſing out therefore three of the chief of the Nobility for Ambaſſadours, they ſent them in a fair Veſſel, well man'd, and ſumptuouſly adorned. It was winter, and the Sea was calm, however, it is remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that being brought almoſt to the very brink of deſtruction, beyond all expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they eſcaped the danger. For hard by the Iſles of <hi>Aeolus,</hi> the Winds ſlacking, the Gallies of the Liparians came upon them, taking them for Pirates. But when they held up their hands in ſupplicant man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the Liparians forbore violence, onely faſtned their Ship and towed her into the Harbour, where they expoſed to ſale their Goods and Perſons, adjudging them to be lawfull prize. But by the vertue and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of one man <hi>Timeſithius</hi> by name, who was Governour of that place, and uſed his utmoſt perſuaſion, they were with much adoe diſmiſſed. Beſides, he himſelf joined ſome of his own Veſſels with them, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them in their voyage, and aſſiſt them at the dedication: for which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived honours at <hi>Rome</hi> according as he had
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:47090:306"/>
deſerved. And now the Tribunes of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">
                  <hi>War againſt the</hi> Faliſces.</note> again reſuming the Law about the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the City, the War againſt the <hi>Faliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> luckily broke out, giving liberty to the Nobility to chuſe what Magiſtrates they pleaſed, who thereupon choſe <hi>Camillus mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Tribune,</hi> with five other Aſſociates; Affairs then requiring a Commander of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and reputation, and one well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd in War; when the People had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified the Election, <hi>Camillus</hi> marched with his Forces into the Territories of the <hi>Faliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and beſieged <hi>Falerii</hi> a well-fenced City and plentifully ſtored with all neceſſaries of War: And although he perceived it would be no ſmall work to take it, nor little time ſpent about it, yet he was willing to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the Citizens, and keep them doing abroad, that they might have no leaſure, idleing at home, to follow the Tribunes into faction and ſedition. Which remedy the Romans conſtantly uſed, like good Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, to diſperſe abroad thoſe violent Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours that diſturb the Commonwealth. The Falerians, truſting in the ſtrength of their City, which was well fortified on all ſides, made ſo little account of the Siege, that beſide thoſe that garded the Walls, the reſt as in times of peace walked the Streets in their common Habits. The Boys went to School, and were led by their Maſter to
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:47090:306"/>
play and exerciſe about the Town-walls; For the Falerians, like the Grecians, uſed one publick School, to the end, their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren being brought up together, might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times learn to converſe and be familiar with one another.</p>
            <p>This School-maſter deſigning to betray <note place="margin">The treachery of the Fale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter.</note> the Falerians by their Children, led them out every day under the Town-wall, at firſt but a little way, and when they had exerciſed brought them home again. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by degrees he drew them farther and farther, till at laſt by practice he had made them bold and fearleſs, as if no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was about them; at laſt, having got them all together, he brought them to the Out-guard of the Romans and delivered them up, demanding to be led to <hi>Camillus.</hi> Where being come, and ſtanding in the middle, he ſaid, <hi>That he was the Maſter and Teacher of thoſe Children, but prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his favour before all other obligations, he was come to deliver up his Charge to him, and in that the whole City.</hi> When <hi>Camil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> had heard him out, he was ſtruck with the horrour of ſo treacherous an Act, and turning to the Standers by, he ſaid, <hi>What a ſad thing is War, which is begun and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with much unjuſtice and violence! But to good men there are certain Laws even in War it ſelf, and victory is not ſo greedily to</hi>

By this time the <hi>Falerii</hi> had underſtood the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery of the School-maſter; and the City, as in ſuch a general Calamity it muſt needs be, was full of lamentations and crys, the honourable Men and Women running in diſtraction about the Walls and Gates, when behold the Boys came whipping their Maſter on, naked and bound, calling <hi>Camillus,</hi> their Saviour, their God, their Father; Inſomuch, that it ſtruck not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the Parents, but the reſt of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens that ſaw what was done, ſuch an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and love of <hi>Camillus</hi> his Juſtice, that immediately running into Counſel, they ſent Ambaſſadours to him, to reſign whatever they had to his diſpoſal. <hi>Camillus</hi> ſent them to <hi>Rome,</hi> where being brought into the Senate, they ſpoke to this purpoſe, <hi>That the Romans preferring Juſtice before Victory, had taught them rather to embrace ſubmiſſion than liberty; that they could not confeſs themſelves to be ſo much inferiour in</hi>

               <hi>ſtrength, as they muſt acknowledge them to be ſuperiour in vertue.</hi> The Senate remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the whole matter to <hi>Camillus,</hi> to judge and order as he thought fit. Who taking a ſum of Money of the Falerians, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Peace with the whole Nation of the <hi>Faliſces,</hi> returned home: But the Souldiers, who expected to have had the Pillage of the City, when they came to <hi>Rome</hi> empty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handed, railed againſt <hi>Camillus</hi> among their Fellow-citizens, as a hater of the People, and one that maliciouſly oppoſed the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the Poor. Afterwards, when the Tribunes of the People again propoſed the Law for dividing the City, <hi>Camillus</hi> of all others moſt openly appear'd againſt it, ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring no pains, but inveying with all bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt the Promoters of it; ſo that forcing and conſtraining the multitude, they diſmiſſed the Law, though contrary to their inclinations. But againſt <hi>Camillus</hi> they had an implacable hatred. Inſomuch, <note place="margin">Camillus <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bours under two ſad diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</hi>
               </note> that though a great misfortune befell him in his Family (one of his Sons dying of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe) yet the commiſeration of his caſe could not in the leaſt make them abate of their malice. And indeed he took this loſs with immoderate ſorrow, being a man na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally of a mild and tender diſpoſition; even that day, when the accuſation was preferred againſt him, he kept houſe, and
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:47090:308"/>
was ſhut up a cloſe Mourner with the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. His Accuſer was <hi>Lucius Apuleius.</hi> The Crime, Fraud in the Tuſcan Spoils; and accordingly it was given out, that there were found with him certain braſs Gates part of thoſe Spoils. The People were exaſperated againſt him, and it was plain they would take hold of the leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and occaſion to condemn him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gathering together his Friends and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Souldiers, and ſuch as had bore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand with him, a conſiderable number in all, he beſought them that they would not ſuffer him to be unjuſtly cruſht under falſe accuſations, and left the mock and ſcorn of his Enemies. His Friends having advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and conſulted among themſelves made anſwer, that as to the Sentence they did not ſee how they could help him, but that they would contribute to whatſoever fine ſhould be ſet upon him: Not able to endure ſo great an indignity, he reſolved in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, to leave the City, and go into Exile. Wherefore having taken leave of his Wife, <note place="margin">His voluntary baniſhment,</note> and his Son, he went ſilently to the Gate of the City, where making a ſtand, and turning himſelf about, he ſtretched out his Hands to the Capitol, and prayed to the Gods, <hi>That if without any fault of his own, but merely through the malice and violence of the people, he was driven out into baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
               <pb n="447" facs="tcp:47090:308"/>
               <hi>that the Romans might quickly have cauſe to repent of it; and that all mankind might viſibly perceive, that they needed his aſſiſtence, and longed for his return.</hi> Thus, like <hi>Achilles,</hi> having left his imprecations on the Citizens, he went into baniſhment; ſo that neither appearing, or making de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, he was condemned in the ſum of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand Aſſes, which reduced to Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver makes a thouſand five hundred Drach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's; for an Aſſe was a little piece of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, ten of which in Braſs made a Penny. There is not a Roman but does believe that <note place="margin">and its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities.</note> immediately upon the Prayers of <hi>Camillus,</hi> a ſudden Judgment followed at the heels, and that he received a ſufficient revenge for the injuſtice done unto him; which though we cannot think was pleaſant, but rather grievous and bitter to him, yet it was very remarkable, and noiſed over the whole World: For ſuch vengeance fell upon the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſuch diſmal times ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, as drew along with them all manner of dangers and deaths, accompanied with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and infamy: Whether or no it fell out by chance or fortune, or it be the office of ſome God not to ſee injured Vertue go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revenged. The firſt token that ſeemed to threaten ſome miſchief to enſue, was the death of the Cenſor in the Month of <hi>July,</hi> for the Romans have a religious reverence
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:47090:309"/>
for the office of a Cenſor, and eſteem it a ſacred thing. The ſecond was, That juſt before <hi>Camillus</hi> went into exile, <hi>Marcus Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicius,</hi> a perſon of no great quality or of the rank of Senatours, but eſteemed a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and creditable man, reported to the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Tribunes</hi> a thing worthy their conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. That going along the Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in that Street which is called the new Way, and being called by ſome body in a huge voice, he turned about but could ſee no body, but heard a voice bigger than a Man's, which ſaid theſe words, <hi>Go,</hi> Marcus Cedicius, <hi>and early in the morning tell the Military Tribunes, that ſuddenly they are to expect the Gauls.</hi> But the Tribunes made a mock and ſport with the ſtory, and a little after <hi>Camillus</hi> his buſineſs fell out.</p>
            <p>The Gauls are deſcended originally of the <hi>Celtae,</hi> and are reported by reaſon of <note place="margin">The Gauls, their original and progreſs.</note> their vaſt numbers to have left their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try not able to ſuſtain them all, and to have gon in ſearch of other places to inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit. And being many thouſands of them young Men and able to bear Arms, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying with them a greater number of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and young Children, ſome of them paſſing the Riphaean Mountains, fell upon the Northern Ocean, and poſſeſſed the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt bounds of <hi>Europe;</hi> others ſeating
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:47090:309"/>
themſelves between the Pyrenaean Mountain and the <hi>Alpes,</hi> for a long time lived near to the <hi>Sennones</hi> and <hi>Celtorii.</hi> But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards taſting of the Wine which was then firſt brought them out of <hi>Italy,</hi> they were all ſo much taken with the Liquor, and tranſported with the unuſual delight, that ſnatching up their Arms, and taking their Parents along with them, they marched di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the <hi>Alpes</hi> to find out that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try which yielded ſuch Fruit, eſteeming all others barren and unpleaſant. He that firſt brought Wine among them, and was the chief inſtigatour to draw them into <hi>Italy,</hi> is ſaid to be one <hi>Arron</hi> a Tuſcan, a man of <note place="margin">Arron <hi>inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in bringing the Gauls into</hi> Italy.</note> noble extraction, by nature not evil, but happened to be in theſe untoward circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances: he was Guardian to an Orphan, one of the richeſt of that Country, and much admired for his beauty, his name <hi>Lucumo;</hi> From his Childhood he had been bred up with <hi>Arron</hi> in his Family, and now grown up, he left not the Houſe, pretending to take great delight in his converſation, thus for a great while together he ſecretly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Arron</hi>'s Wife, corrupting and being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by her. But when they were both ſo far gone on in their paſſions, that they could neither refrain their luſt or conceal it, the young Man ſeiſed the Woman and openly carried her away. The Husband going to
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:47090:310"/>
Law, and overpower'd in multitude of Friends and Money, left his own Country, and hearing of the ſtate of the Gauls, went to them, and was Conductour of that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition into <hi>Italy.</hi> At firſt coming they preſently poſſeſſed themſelves of all that Country which anciently the Tuſcans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited, reaching from the <hi>Alpes</hi> to both the Seas, as the names themſelves witneſs; for the North Sea <hi>Adria</hi> is ſo called from the Tuſcan City <hi>Adria,</hi> and that which lies on the other ſide to the South is called the Tuſcan Sea. All the Country is well planted with Trees, has pleaſant and rich Paſture, and well watered with Rivers. It had eighteen fair and ſtately Cities, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ſeated for induſtry and Trade, and plentifully provided for all pleaſures and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights. The Gauls caſting out the Tuſcans ſeated themſelves in them: but theſe things were done long before.</p>
            <p>But the Gauls at this time were beſieging <hi>Cluſium</hi> a Tuſcan City. The Cluſians ſent to the Romans for ſuccour, deſiring them to interpoſe with the Barbarians by their Letters and Ambaſſadours. There were ſent three of the Family of the <hi>Fabii</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the greateſt quality, and moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable in the City. The Gauls received them courteouſly in reſpect to the name of <hi>Rome,</hi> and giving over the aſſault which
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:47090:310"/>
was then making upon the Walls came to conference with them, where the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours asking what injury they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the Cluſians that they thus invaded their City, <hi>Brennus</hi> King of the Gauls ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling made anſwer, <hi>The Cluſians doe us inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Brennus<hi>'s ſatyrical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours at the Siege of</hi> Cluſium.</note> 
               <hi>in that not able to till a ſmall parcel of ground, they muſt needs poſſeſs a great Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory, and will not communicate any part to us, who are ſtrangers, many in number and poor. In the ſame nature, O Romans, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly the</hi> Albanes, Fidenates <hi>and</hi> Ardeates, <hi>and now lately the</hi> Veiens <hi>and</hi> Capenates <hi>and many of the</hi> Faliſces <hi>and</hi> Volſces <hi>did you injury; upon whom ye make War if they do not yield you part of what they poſſeſs, ye make Slaves of them, ye waſte and ſpoil their Country and ruin their Cities, neither in ſo doing are ye cruel or unjuſt, but follow that moſt ancient of all Laws, which gives the things of the feeble to the ſtrong, beginning from God and ending in the Beaſts, for all theſe by nature ſeek, the ſtronger to have advantage over the weaker: Leave off there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to pity the Cluſians whom we beſiege, leſt ye teach the Gauls to be good and compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to thoſe that are oppreſſed by you.</hi> By this anſwer the Romans perceived that <hi>Brennus</hi> was not to be treated with, ſo they went into <hi>Cluſium</hi> and encouraged and ſtirr'd up the inhabitants to make a ſally
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:47090:311"/>
with them upon the Barbarians, which they did either to try the ſtrength of the Cluſians, or to ſhew their own. The ſally being made, and the fight growing hot about the Walls, one of the <hi>Fabii, Quintus Ambuſtus,</hi> being well mounted, and ſetting Spurs to his Horſe, made full againſt a Gaul, a man of huge bulk and ſtature, whom he ſaw was rode out a great diſtance from the reſt. At the firſt he was not perceived through the ſharpneſs of the encounter, and the glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of his Armour that hindred the ſight of him; but when he had overthrown the Gaul, and was going to gather the Spoils, <hi>Brennus</hi> knew him, and invoking the Gods <note place="margin">Brennus <hi>by what incens'd to make War with</hi> Rome.</note> to be witneſſes, that contrary to the known and common Law of Nations, which is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily obſerved by all mankind, that he who came an Ambaſſadour ſhould act hoſtility againſt him, he drew off his men, and bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Cluſians farewell, led his Army directly to <hi>Rome.</hi> But not willing it ſhould look as if they took advantage of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, and were ready to embrace any ſlight occaſion and pretence of quarrel, he ſent a Herald to demand the man in puniſhment, and in the mean time marched leaſurely on. The Senate being met at <hi>Rome,</hi> among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others that ſpoke againſt the <hi>Fabii,</hi> the Prieſts called <hi>Feciales</hi> were the moſt violent proſecutours, who laying Religion before
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:47090:311"/>
the Senate, adviſed them that they would lay the whole guilt and expiation of the fact upon him that committed it, and ſo acquit the reſt. Theſe <hi>Feciales Numa Pompilius,</hi> the mildeſt and juſteſt of Kings, conſtituted the Conſervatours of Peace, and the Judges and Determiners of all Cauſes by which War may juſtifiably be made. The Senate referring the whole matter to the People, and the Prieſts there as well as in the Senate pleading againſt <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi> the multitude did ſo little regard their authority that in ſcorn and contempt of it they choſe <hi>Fabius</hi> and the reſt of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren <note place="margin">Fabius <hi>choſen Tribune in the expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt the Gauls.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Military Tribunes.</hi> The Gauls hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this, in great rage would no longer delay their march, but haſtned on with all the ſpeed they could make. The places through which they marched, terrified with their numbers and ſuch dreadfull prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of War, and conſidering the violence and fierceneſs of their natures, began to give their Countries for loſt, not doubting but their Cities would quickly follow; but contrary to expectation they did no injury as they paſſed, or drove any thing from the Fields, and when they went by any City they cried out, <hi>That they were going to</hi> Rome; that the <hi>Romans onely were their Enemies,</hi> and that they took all others for their Friends. Thus whilſt the Barbarians
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:47090:312"/>
were haſtening with all ſpeed, the <hi>Military Tribunes</hi> brought the Romans into the Field to be ready to engage them, being not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to the Gauls in number (for they were no leſs than forty thouſand Foot) but moſt of them raw Souldiers and ſuch as had never handled a Weapon before; beſides <note place="margin">Neglect of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and multiplicity of Officers extremely prejudicial to the Roman affairs.</note> they had neglected to conſult the Gods, as they ought and uſed to do upon all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, eſpecially War, but ran on without ſtaying for Prieſt or Sacrifice. No leſs did the multitude of Commanders diſtract and confound their proceedings; for before up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on leſs occaſions they choſe a ſingle perſon called <hi>Dictatour,</hi> being ſenſible of what great importance it is in times of danger, to have the Souldiers united under one Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, who had abſolute and unaccountable power in his hands. Add to all that the remembrance of <hi>Camillus</hi> his caſe was no ſmall hinderance to their affairs, it being grown a dangerous thing to command with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out humouring and courting the Souldiers. In this condition they left the City, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped by the River <hi>Allia</hi> about eleven miles from <hi>Rome,</hi> and not far from the place where it falleth into the <hi>Tyber,</hi> where the Gauls coming upon them, and they ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully engaging without Order or Diſcipline, were miſerably defeated. The left Wing was immediately driven into the River and
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:47090:312"/>
there utterly deſtroyed: the Right had leſs damage, by declining the ſhock, and from the low grounds getting to the tops of Hills, from whence many of them afterwards drop'd into the City; the reſt as many as eſcaped (the Enemy being weary of the ſlaughter) ſtole by night to <hi>Veii</hi> giving <hi>Rome</hi> for gone, and all that was in it for loſt. This Battel was fought about the Summer Solſtice, the Moon being at full, the very ſame day in which formerly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that ſad misfortune to the <hi>Fabii,</hi> when three hundred of that name and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily were at one time cut off by the Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans. But from this ſecond loſs and defeat, the day got the name of <hi>Allienſis,</hi> from the River <hi>Allia,</hi> and ſtill retaineth it. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <note place="margin">Remarkable occurrences relating to the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar days.</note> unlucky days whether we ſhould eſteem any ſuch or no, or whether <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clitus</hi> did well in upbraiding <hi>Heſiod</hi> for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing them into fortunate and unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, as one ignorant that the nature of every day is the ſame, I have diſcourſed in another place; but upon occaſion of this preſent ſubject I think it will not be amiſs, to annex a few examples relating to this matter. On the fifth of <hi>June</hi> the Boeotians happened to get two ſignal Victories, the one about <hi>Leuctra,</hi> the other at <hi>Geraſtus,</hi> about three hundred years before, when they overcame <hi>Lattamyas</hi> and the Theſſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,

and aſſerted the liberty of <hi>Greece.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain on the ſixth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the Perſians were worſted by the Grecians, at <hi>Mara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon,</hi> on the third at <hi>Plataeae</hi> as alſo at <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cale;</hi> on the twenty fifth at <hi>Arbeli.</hi> The Athenians about the full Moon in <hi>Auguſt</hi> got a Sea Victory about <hi>Naxus</hi> under the Conduct of <hi>Chabrias;</hi> about the twentieth at <hi>Salamin,</hi> as we have ſhewn in our Book of Days. <hi>April</hi> was very unfortunate to the Barbarians, for in that Month <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> overcame <hi>Darius</hi> his General at <hi>Grani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum;</hi> and the Carthaginians on the twenty ſeventh were beaten by <hi>Timoleon</hi> about <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily,</hi> on which ſame Day and Month <hi>Troy</hi> ſeems to have been taken, as <hi>Ephorus, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſthenes, Damaſtes</hi> and <hi>Phylarchus</hi> have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated. On the other hand the Month <hi>July</hi> was not very lucky to the Grecians; for on the ſeventh day of the ſame they were defeated by <hi>Antipater,</hi> at the Battel in <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> and utterly ruin'd; and before that in <hi>Chaeronea</hi> they were defeated by <hi>Philip,</hi> and on the very ſame Day, ſame Month and ſame Year, they that went with <hi>Archidamus</hi> into <hi>Italy</hi> were there cut off by the Barbarians. The Carthaginians alſo obſerve the twenty ſeventh of the ſame Month, as bringing with it the moſt and greateſt of their loſſes. I am not ignorant that about the <hi>Feaſt of Myſteries Thebes</hi> was deſtroyed by <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander;</hi>
               <pb n="457" facs="tcp:47090:313"/>
and after that upon the ſame twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> on which day they cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Myſteries of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans received a Garriſon of the Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; on the ſelf ſame day the Romans loſt their Camp under <hi>Scipio,</hi> by the Cimbri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and under the conduct of <hi>Lucullus</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Armenians and <hi>Tigranes.</hi> King <hi>Attalus</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> died both on their birth days. I could reckon up ſeveral that have had variety of fortune on the ſame day. This day called <hi>Allienſis</hi> is one of the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate ones to the Romans, and for its ſake other two in every Month, Fear and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition as the cuſtom of it is more and more encreaſing. But I have diſcourſed this more accurately in my Book of <hi>Roman Cauſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now after the Battel, had the Gauls <note place="margin">The Gauls imprudent managers of their Victory.</note> immediately purſued thoſe that fled, there had been no remedy but <hi>Rome</hi> muſt have wholly been ruined, and all thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in it utterly deſtroyed, ſuch was the terrour that thoſe who eſcaped the Battel had ſtruck into the City at their return, and ſo great afterwards was the diſtraction and confuſion. But the Gauls not imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their Victory to be ſo conſiderable, and overtaken with the preſent joy, fell to feaſting and dividing the Spoil, by which means, they gave leiſure to thoſe who were
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:47090:314"/>
for leaving the City, to make their eſcape, and to thoſe that remained to provide and prepare for their coming. For they who reſolved to ſtay at <hi>Rome,</hi> quitting the reſt of the City, betook themſelves to the <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol,</hi> which they fortified with ſtrong Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piers and Mounds, and all ſort of Slings and Darts, in order to hold out a Siege. But their firſt and principal care was of their Holy Things, moſt of which they convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Capitol. But as for the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated <note place="margin">The holy Fire preſerv'd by the Veſtals.</note> Fire, the <hi>Veſtal Virgins</hi> took it up and fled away with it, as likewiſe with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Holy Relicks. Some write that they preſerved nothing but that <hi>ever-living</hi> Fire which <hi>Numa</hi> had ordained to be worſhipped as the Principle of all things; for Fire is the moſt active thing in nature, and all genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is motion or at leaſt with motion, all other parts of matter without warmth lie ſluggiſh and dead, and crave the influence of heat as their Soul, which when it comes upon them they preſently fall to doing or ſuffering ſomething: wherefore <hi>Numa,</hi> a <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Why inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by</hi> Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</note> man very curious in ſuch things, and for his wiſedom thought to converſe with the Muſes, did conſecrate Fire, and ordained it to be kept ever burning, in reſemblance of that eternal Power which preſerveth and acteth all things. Others ſay that that Fire was the ſame they burned before the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:47090:314"/>
and was no other than what the Greeks call <hi>Purifying Fire,</hi> but that there were other things hid in the moſt ſecret part of the Temple, which were kept from the view of all except thoſe Virgins which they call Veſtals. The moſt common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was that the Image of <hi>Pallas,</hi> brought into <hi>Italy</hi> by <hi>Aeneas,</hi> was laid up there; others ſay that the <hi>Samothracian Gods</hi> lay there, telling a ſtory, How that <hi>Dardanus</hi> carried them to <hi>Troy,</hi> and when he had built that City, dedicated them there; that after <hi>Troy</hi> was taken, <hi>Aeneas</hi> ſtole them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and kept them till his coming into <hi>Italy.</hi> But they who pretend to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand more of theſe things, affirm, that there are two Barrels, not of any great ſize, one of which ſtands open and has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it, the other full and ſealed up. But that neither of them is to be ſeen but by the moſt Holy Virgins: others think that they who ſay this are deceived, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Virgins put moſt of their holy things into two Barrels, and hid them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ground in the Temple of <hi>Quirinus,</hi> and that from hence that place to this day bears the ſirname of <hi>Barrels.</hi> However it be, taking the choiceſt and moſt venerable things they had, they fled away with them ſhaping their courſe along the River ſide, where <hi>Lucius Albinus,</hi> a ſimple Citizen of
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:47090:315"/>
               <hi>Rome,</hi> who among others was making his eſcape, overtook them, having his Wife, Children and Goods in a Cart, who ſeeing the Virgins lugging along in their armes the Holy Relicks of the Gods in a helpleſs and weary condition, he cauſed his Wife and Children to deſcend, and taking out his Goods, put the Virgins in the Cart, that they might make their eſcape to ſome of the Grecian Cities. This extraordinary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion of <hi>Albinus,</hi> and reſpect to the Gods in ſuch an exigence of time, and extremity of his own affairs is ſo remarkable, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves not to be paſſed over in ſilence. But the Prieſts that belonged to other Gods, and the moſt ancient of the Senatours, ſuch as had run through many Conſulſhips and Triumphs, could not endure to think of leaving the City; but putting on their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Veſtures and Robes of State, and <hi>Fabius</hi> the High Prieſt performing the Office, they made their Prayers to the Gods, and devoting themſelves as it were for their Country, ſate themſelves down in Ivory Chairs in the Market-place, and in that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture expected the uttermoſt of what ſhould follow. On the third day after the Battel, <hi>Brennus</hi> appeared with his Army at the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and finding the Gates to ſtand wide o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and no Guards upon the Walls, he firſt began to ſuſpect it was ſome deſign or ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageme,
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:47090:315"/>
never dreaming that the Romans were in ſo low and forſaken a condition. But when he found it to be ſo indeed, he <note place="margin">Brennus <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> Rome.</note> entered at the <hi>Colline</hi> Gate, and took <hi>Rome</hi> in the three hundred and ſixtieth year or a little more after it was built, if it be likely that an exact account of thoſe times has been preſerved, when there is ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and diſpute in things of a later date. The report of the City's being taken pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently flew into <hi>Greece,</hi> though in different and uncertain rumours, for <hi>Heraclides</hi> of <hi>Pontus</hi> who lived not long after theſe times, in his Book <hi>of the Soul,</hi> relates that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain report came from the Weſt, that an Army proceeding from the Hyperboreans, had taken a Greek City called <hi>Rome,</hi> ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſomewhere upon the great Ocean. But I do not wonder that ſuch a fabulous and bumbaſt Authour as <hi>Heraclides</hi> ſhould foiſt into the truth of the ſtory ſuch high-flown words as <hi>Hyperborean</hi> and <hi>Ocean. Ariſtotle</hi> the Philoſopher appears to have heard an exact account of the taking of the City by the Gauls, but he calls him that recovered it <hi>Lucius,</hi> but <hi>Camillus</hi> his ſirname was not <hi>Lucius</hi> but <hi>Marcus,</hi> but this is ſpoken by way of conjecture. <hi>Brennus</hi> having taken poſſeſſion of the City, ſet a ſtrong Guard about the Capitol, and going himſelf to view the City, when he came into the
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:47090:316"/>
Market-place, he was ſtruck with an amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the ſight of ſo many men ſitting in that order and ſilence, obſerving that they neither roſe at his coming, or ſo much as changed colour or countenance, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear or concern leaned upon their Staves, and in that fullen majeſty ſate looking one upon the other. The Gauls for a great while ſtood wondring at the object, being ſurpriſed with the ſtrangeneſs of it, not daring ſo much as to approach or touch them, taking them for an Aſſembly of the Gods. But when one, bolder than the reſt, drew near to <hi>M. Papirius,</hi> and putting forth his hand, gently touched his Chin, and ſtroked his long Beard, <hi>Papirius</hi> with his Staff ſtruck him on the Head and broke it, <note place="margin">The Roman Senatours barbarouſly murthered by the Gauls.</note> at which the Barbarian enraged, drew out his Sword and ſlew him; this was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction to the ſlaughter, for the reſt of his fellows following his example, ſet upon them all and killed them, and continuing their rage diſpatched all that came in their way; in this fury they went on to the ſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and pillaging the Houſes, for many days together lugging and carrying away. Afterwards they burnt them down to the ground, and demoliſh'd them, being incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at thoſe who kept the Capitol, becauſe they would not yield to ſummons, or hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to a ſurrender, but on the contrary
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:47090:316"/>
from their Walls and Rampiers galled the Beſiegers with their Slings and Darts. This provoked them to deſtroy the whole City, and put to the Sword all that came to their hands young and old, Men, Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And now the Siege of the Capitol ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving laſted a good while, the Gauls began to be in want of Proviſion, wherefore dividing their Forces, part of them ſtay'd with the King at the Siege, the reſt went to forage the Country, deſtroying the Towns and Villages where they came; but not all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a Body, but in different Squadrons and Parties, and to ſuch a confidence had ſucceſs raiſed them, that they careleſly ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled about without the leaſt fear or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of danger. But the greateſt and beſt ordered Body of their Forces went to the City of <hi>Ardea</hi> where <hi>Camillus</hi> then ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed, having ever ſince his leaving <hi>Rome</hi> ſequeſtred himſelf from all buſineſs, and taken to a private life: but now he began <note place="margin">Camillus <hi>ſtudious of ſupporting the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſtate of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</hi>
               </note> to rouſe up himſelf and caſt about, not how to avoid or eſcape the Enemy, but to find out an opportunity how to be revenged of them. And perceiving that the Ardeans wanted not men, but rather heart and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, through the unskilfull management of their Officers. At firſt he began to deal with the young men, flinging out words among them, <hi>That they ought not to aſcribe</hi>
               <pb n="464" facs="tcp:47090:317"/>
               <hi>the misfortune of the Romans to the courage of their Enemy, or attribute the loſſes they ſuſtained by raſh counſel, to the conduct of thoſe who brought nothing with them to conquer, but were onely an evidence of the power of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; That it was a brave thing even with danger to repell a foreign and barbarous War, whoſe end in conquering was like Fire to lay waſte and deſtroy. But if they would be cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous and reſolute he was ready to put an opportunity in their hands to gain a Victory without hazard at all.</hi> When he found the young men embraced the thing, he went to the chief Officers and Governours of the City, and having perſwaded them alſo, he muſtered all that could bear Arms, and drew them up within the Walls, that they might not be perceived by the Enemy who was near; who having ſcoured the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and returned heavy laden with booty, lay encamped in the Plains in a careleſs and negligent poſture, ſo that the night coming upon them who had been diſordered with Wine, there was a great ſilence through all the Camp. Which when <hi>Camillus</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by his Spies, he drew out the Arde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and in the dead of the night paſſing in ſilence thoſe grounds that lay between, he made himſelf maſter of their Works, and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>His Victory over the Gauls at</hi> Ardea.</note> then commanding his Trumpets to ſound, and his Men to ſhout and hollow, he ſtruck
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:47090:317"/>
ſuch terrour into them, that even they who took the alarum could hardly recover their Senſes: Some were ſo overcharged with Wine, that all the noiſe of the Aſſaylants could not awaken them: A few, whom fear made ſober, getting into ſome order, for a while reſiſted; and ſo died with their Weapons in their hands. But the greateſt part of them, buried in Wine and Sleep, were ſurprized without their Arms and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched: But as many of them, as by the advantage of the night, got out of the Camp, were the next day found ſcattered abroad and wandring in the Fields, and were pick't up by the Horſe that purſued them. The fame of this Action preſently flew through the neighbouring Cities, and ſtirred up the Youth of all Parts to come and join themſelves with him. But none were ſo much concerned as thoſe Romans who eſcaped in the Battel of <hi>Allia,</hi> and were now at <hi>Veii</hi> thus lamenting with themſelves; <hi>O heavens, what a Commander has Providence bereaved</hi> Rome <hi>of, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> Ardea <hi>with his Actions! And that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which brought forth and nurſed ſo great a man, is loſt and gone; and we deſtitute of a Leader, and living within ſtrange Walls ſit idle, and ſee</hi> Italy <hi>ruin'd before our eyes. Come, let us ſend to the Ardeans to have back our General, or elſe, with Weapons in our</hi>
               <pb n="466" facs="tcp:47090:318"/>
               <hi>hands, let us go thither to him; for he is no longer a baniſht man, nor we Citizens, having no Country, but what is in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Enemy.</hi> They all agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the matter, and ſent to <hi>Camillus,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him to take the Command; but he anſwered, that he would not, untill they that were in the Capitol, ſhould legally chuſe him; for he eſteemed them, as long as they were in being, to be his Country: that if they ſhould command him, he would readily obey; but againſt their conſents, he would intermeddle with nothing. When this anſwer was returned, they admired the modeſty and temper of <hi>Camillus,</hi> but they could not tell how to find a Meſſenger to carry theſe things to the Capitol; and what was more; it ſeemed altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for any one to get to them, whilſt the Enemy was in full poſſeſſion of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But among the young men, there was one <hi>Pontius Cominius,</hi> of indifferent birth, <note place="margin">Cominius<hi>'s hazardous attempt.</hi>
               </note> but ambitious of honour; this man proffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelf to run the hazard, but he took no Letters with him to thoſe in the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol, leſt that being intercepted, the Enemy might learn the intentions of <hi>Camillus.</hi> But putting on a poor garment, and carrying Corks under it; the greateſt part of the way he boldly travelled by day, and came to the City when it was dark: The Bridge
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:47090:318"/>
he could not paſs, by reaſon it was guarded by the Barbarians; ſo that taking his Cloaths, which were neither many nor heavy, and binding them about his head, he laid his body upon the Corks, and ſwimming on them, got over to the City. And avoiding thoſe Quarters where he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Enemy was awake, which he gueſſed at by the lights and noiſe; he went to the <hi>Carmentale</hi> Gate, where there was greateſt ſilence, and where the hill of the Capitol is ſteepeſt, and riſes with craggy and broken ſtones. By this way he got up, though with much difficulty, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the abruptneſs of the paſſage, and preſented himſelf to the Guards, ſaluting them, and telling them his name; he was taken in, and carried to the Commanders. And a Senate being immediately called, he related to them in order the victory of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus,</hi> which they had not heard of before, and told them the proceedings of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, adviſing them to confirm the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to <hi>Camillus,</hi> as in whoſe conduct alone, the whole Army abroad relied. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard and conſulted of the matter, the Senate declared <hi>Camillus</hi> Dictatour, and <note place="margin">Camillus <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour.</hi>
               </note> ſent back <hi>Pontius</hi> the ſame way that he came; who, with the ſame ſucceſs that he came, got through the Enemy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being diſcovered and delivered to the
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:47090:319"/>
Romans, the Election of the Senate, who received it with great acclamations of joy; and <hi>Camillus</hi> coming to them, found twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand of them ready in arms; with which forces, and thoſe Confederates he brought along with him, which were more in number; he prepared to ſet upon the Enemy.</p>
            <p>But at <hi>Rome</hi> ſome of the Barbarians paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by chance that way by which <hi>Pontius</hi> by night had got into the Capitol, ſpied in ſeveral places the print of his feet and hands, as he caught and clammered, and the Moſs that grew to the Rock tore off and broken, and reported it to the King, who coming in perſon and viewing it, for the preſent ſaid nothing. But in the Evening, picking out ſuch of the Gauls as were nimbleſt of body, and by living in the Mountains were accuſtomed to climb, He thus ſpake unto them. <hi>The Enemy themſelves have ſhown us a way how to come at them, which we knew not of before; and have taught us, that it is not ſo difficult and impoſſible, but that men may overcome it. It would be a great ſhame for us who command, having begun well, to fail in the end; and to give over a place as impregnable, when the Enemy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf chalks us out the way by which it may be taken; for in the ſame place where it was eaſy for one man to get up, it will not be</hi>
               <pb n="469" facs="tcp:47090:319"/>
               <hi>hard for many, one after another; nay, when many ſhall undertake it, their mutual aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of one another will be a great addition of ſtrength and firmneſs. Rewards and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours ſhall be beſtowed on every man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as he ſhall acquit himſelf in the action.</hi> When the King had thus ſpoken, the Gauls chearfully undertook to perform it, and in the dead of night, a good party of them together, with great ſilence began to climb the Rock, catching hold of the craggy Stones, and drawing their Bodies into the broken places, which though hard and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward in it ſelf, yet upon trial prov'd not half ſo difficult as they had expected it. So that the foremoſt of them having gained the top of all, and put themſelves into or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they were not far from ſurprizing the Out-works, and maſtering the Watch, who were faſt aſleep, for neither Man nor Dog perceived their coming. But there were ſacred Geeſe kept near the Temple of <note place="margin">The Gauls diſcovered by the ſacred Geeſe in their attempts upon the Capitol.</note> 
               <hi>Juno,</hi> which at other times were plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fed, but at this time, by reaſon that Corn and all other proviſions were grown ſtrait, their allowance was ſhortned, and they themſelves in a poor and lean condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This Creature is by nature of quick ſenſe, and apprehenſive of the leaſt noiſe; ſo that being beſides watchfull through hunger, and reſtleſs, they immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:47090:320"/>
the coming of the Gauls; ſo that running up and down, with their noiſe and cackling they raiſed the whole Camp. The Barbarians on the other ſide perceiving themſelves diſcovered, no longer endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to conceal their attempt, but with great ſhouting and violence ſet themſelves to the aſſault. The Romans every one in haſte ſnatching up the next Weapon that came to hand, did what they could on this ſudden occaſion. <hi>Manlius,</hi> a man of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſular <note place="margin">
                  <hi>They are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter'd by</hi> Manlius.</note> dignity, of ſtrong body and ſtout heart, was the firſt that made head againſt them, and engaging with two of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my at once, with his Sword cut off the right Arme of one juſt as he was lifting up his Poleaxe to ſtrike, and running his Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get full in the face of the other, tumbled him headlong down the ſteep Rock; then mounting the Rampier, and there ſtanding with others that came running to his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, he drove down the reſt of them, there having not many got up; and thoſe that had, doing nothing brave or gallant. The Romans having thus eſcaped this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, early in the morning took the Capt. of the Watch and flung him down the Rock up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the head of their Enemies; and to <hi>Manlius</hi> for his victory they voted a reward which carried more honour than advantage with it, which was, that they contributed to him
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:47090:320"/>
as much as every man had for his daily al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, which was half a pound of Bread, and about half a pint of Wine. Hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward, the affairs of the Gauls were daily in a worſe and worſe condition; they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Proviſions, being kept in from forra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging through fear of <hi>Camillus;</hi> beſides, that ſickneſs came upon them, occaſioned by the number of Carcaſſes that lay unbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in heaps. Moreover, being lodged <note place="margin">A contagious infection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gauls.</note> among the Ruines, the Aſhes, which were very deep, blown about with the wind, and mingled with the ſoultry heat, cauſed a dry and peſtilent Air, which drawn in, infected their Bodies. But the chief cauſe was the change of their natural Climate, coming out of ſhady and hilly Countrys, which afforded pleaſant retirements and ſhelter from the heat, to lodge in low and champion Grounds, naturally unhealthfull in the Autumn Seaſon. Another thing which broke their Spirits, was the length and tediouſneſs of the Siege (for they had now ſate ſeven months before the Capitol) inſomuch, that there was vaſt deſolation among them; and the number of the dead grown ſo great, that the living ſcarce ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to bury them. Neither were things any thing better with the Beſieged, for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine encreaſed upon them; and not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what <hi>Camillus</hi> did, they remained in
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:47090:321"/>
a languiſhing and deſponding condition; for it was impoſſible to ſend any to him, the City was ſo narrowly guarded by the Barbarians. Things being in this ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition on both ſides, it came to paſs that a <note place="margin">Through the equal neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on both ſides, a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is agreed to.</note> motion of treaty was made by ſome of the Fore-guards as they happened to diſcourſe with one another, which being embraced by the better ſort, <hi>Sulpicius,</hi> Tribune of the Romans, came to parle with <hi>Brennus;</hi> where it was agreed, that the Romans lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down a thouſand weight of Gold, the Gauls upon the receipt of it ſhould immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately quit the City and Territories. The agreement being confirmed by oath on both ſides, and the Gold brought forth, the Gauls uſed falſe dealing in the weights, firſt privily, afterwards openly, pulling back the balance and violently turning it; at which the Romans being moved, and complaining, <hi>Brennus</hi> in a ſcoffing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting manner pull'd off his Sword and Belt, and threw them both into the Scales; and when <hi>Sulpicius</hi> asked, what that meant, What ſhould it mean (ſays he) but <hi>woe to the conquered?</hi> which afterwards became a proverbial Saying. As for the Romans, ſome were ſo incenſed, that they were for taking their Gold back again and returning, and with reſolution to endure the uttermoſt extremities of the Siege. Others were for
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:47090:321"/>
paſſing by and diſſembling a petty injury, and not to account that the indignity of the thing, lay in paying more than was due, but the paying any thing at all; which ſtood not with their honour to have done, had not the neceſſity of the times made them yield unto it. Whilſt this difference was amongſt themſelves, and with the <note place="margin">Camillus <hi>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes the City.</hi>
               </note> Gauls <hi>Camillus</hi> was at the Gates, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving learned what had paſſed, he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the body of his Forces to follow ſlowly after him in good order, and himſelf, with the choiceſt of his men haſtning on, went preſently to the Romans. Where all gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving way to him, and receiving him as their ſole Magiſtrate, with profound ſilence and order, he took the Gold out of the Scales, and delivered it to his Officers, and commanded the Gauls to take their Weights and Scales and depart. Saying, that <hi>it was cuſtomary with the Romans to deliver their Country with Iron, not with Gold.</hi> And when <hi>Brennus</hi> began to rage and ſay, that he had injury done him in breaking the Contract; <hi>Camillus</hi> anſwered, that it was never legally made, and the agreements of no force or obligation at all; for that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf being declared Dictatour, and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other Magiſtrate by Law; that he had contracted with thoſe who had no power to doe it: But now they might uſe
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:47090:322"/>
their own diſcretions, for he was come as abſolute Lord by law, to grant pardon to ſuch as ſhould ask it, or inflict puniſhment on thoſe who had been authours of theſe diſturbances, if they did not repent. At this <hi>Brennus</hi> flew out into rage, and it came to a preſent quarrel; both ſides draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Swords, and vigorouſly aſſaulting each other, being mixed in confuſion toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as could not otherwiſe be amongſt the ruines of Houſes and narrow Lanes, and ſuch places where it was impoſſible to draw up in any order. But <hi>Brennus</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently recollecting himſelf, called off his Men, and with the loſs of a few onely, brought them to their Camp; and riſing in the night with all his Forces, left the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <note place="margin">Brennus <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eretly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws from</hi> Rome. <hi>Is utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated by</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus.</note> and going on about eight mile encam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped upon the Gabinian way. As ſoon as day appeared <hi>Camillus</hi> came up with him, excellently provided, and his Souldiers full of courage and confidence, and there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging with him in a ſharp Fight, and which laſted a long while, he overthrew his Army with great ſlaughter, and took their Camp. Of thoſe that fled, ſome were preſently cut off by the Purſuers; others, of whom was the greateſt number, being ſcattered here and there, the people of the Villages and neighbouring Cities came run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out and diſpatched them. Thus <hi>Rome</hi>
               <pb n="475" facs="tcp:47090:322"/>
was ſtrangely taken, and more ſtrangely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; having been ſeven whole months in the poſſeſſion of the Barbarians, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered her about the fifteenth day of <hi>July,</hi> and were driven out about the fourteenth of <hi>February</hi> following. <hi>Camillus</hi> trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed, as he deferved, having ſaved his Country that was loſt; and brought the City back again to it ſelf. For they that had lived abroad, together with their Wives and Children, accompanied him in his triumph, and they who had been ſhut up in the Capitol, and were reduced almoſt to the point of periſhing with hunger, went out to meet him, imbracing each other, and weeping for joy; and through the exceſs of the preſent pleaſure, ſcarce believing the truth of their deliverance. But when the Prieſts and Miniſters of the Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, bearing thoſe ſacred Relicks, which in their flight they had either hid there, or conveyed away with them, and now open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewed that they were preſerved, it yielded a moſt joyfull and deſireable ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle to the Citizens who took it, as if with them the Gods themſelves were again returned unto <hi>Rome.</hi> After <hi>Camillus</hi> had <note place="margin">Camillus <hi>by what induced to found a new Temple.</hi>
               </note> ſacrificed to the Gods, and purged the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Prieſts leading the Proceſſion, and performing the cuſtomary Ceremonies, he reſtored the preſent Temples, and erected
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:47090:323"/>
a new one to the God, called the <hi>Speaker</hi> or <hi>Caller,</hi> chuſing the very ſame place in which that voice from Heaven came by night to <hi>Marcus Cedicius,</hi> foretelling the coming of the Barbarian Army. It was a buſineſs of great difficulty, and an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hard task, amidſt ſo much Rubbiſh, to diſcover and ſet out the conſecrated Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; but by the unwearied diligence of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus,</hi> and the inceſſant labour of the Prieſts, it was at laſt accompliſhed. But when the buſineſs came to the rebuilding the City, which was wholly demoliſhed, an heartleſs deſpondency ſeiſed the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and a backwardneſs to the work, as thoſe who wanted all neceſſary materials, and had more need of ſome refreſhment and reſt from their labours, than to toil and wear out themſelves already broken both in body and fortunes. Thus by lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure they turned their thoughts again to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Veii,</hi> a City ready built, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently provided of all things; which gave occaſion to many who ſought to be popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, by following and nouriſhing the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, to raiſe new tumults, and many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious words were flung out againſt <hi>Camil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">He is malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and why.</note> that out of ambition and ſelf-glory he withheld them from a City fit to receive them, forcing them to live in the midſt of Ruines, and to raiſe ſuch a pile of Rubbiſh,
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:47090:323"/>
that he might be eſteemed not the chief Magiſtrate onely and General of <hi>Rome,</hi> but (ſetting <hi>Romulus</hi> aſide) the Founder alſo. The Senate therefore, fearing a ſedition, would not ſuffer <hi>Camillus,</hi> though deſirous, to lay down his authority within the year, though no other Dictatour had ever held it above ſix months.</p>
            <p>Beſides, they endeavoured by kind per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions and familiar addreſſes to appeaſe <note place="margin">The perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Senatours un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsfull to the re-buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the City.</note> and ſweeten their minds and chear up their ſpirits. Sometimes they would lead them to the Monuments and Tombs of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtours, often calling to their remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance the ſacred Oratories and holy Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Numa,</hi> or any other of their Kings had conſecrated and left unto them; but amongſt the chief of their holy Relicks, they ſet before them that freſh and raw Head, which was found in laying the foundation of the Capitol, as a place de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin'd by fate to be the head of all <hi>Italy.</hi> What a ſhame would it be to them, by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking the City, to loſe and extinguiſh that holy Fire, which ſince the War was re-kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled by the Veſtal Virgins, to ſee the City it ſelf either inhabited by Foreigners and Strangers, or left a wild Paſture for Cattel to graze on? Such reaſons as theſe, mixt with complaints and intreaties, they uſed with the People; ſometimes in private, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:47090:324"/>
them ſingly one by one; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in their publick Aſſemblies. But ſtill they were afreſh aſſaulted by the outcries of the multitude, proteſting and bewailing their preſent wants and inability; beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, that ſeeing they were juſt met together, as from a ſhipwreck, naked and deſtitute, they would not conſtrain them to patch up the pieces of a ruin'd and ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered City, when they had another at hand ready built and prepared. <hi>Camillus</hi> thought good to refer it to the Senate; and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf diſcourſed largely and earneſtly in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of his Country, as likewiſe did many others. At laſt, calling to <hi>Lucius Lucretius,</hi> whoſe place was firſt to ſpeak, he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to give his ſentence, and the reſt as they followed in order.

of affection, every one heartning and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging his Neighbour, and ſetting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf chearfully to the work; proceeding not in any regular lines or proportions, but every one pitching upon that plot of ground which came next to hand, or beſt pleaſed his fancy; by which haſte and hurry in <note place="margin">Rome <hi>confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly re-bui<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </note> building, they raiſed the City with nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and intricate Lanes, and Houſes hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled together one upon the back of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: For it is ſaid, that within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of the year, the whole City was raiſed up anew, both in its publick Walls, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Buildings. But the perſons appointed by <hi>Camillus</hi> to recover and ſet out the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated places in that great confuſion of all things, ſearching about the <hi>Palatium,</hi> and coming to that place which is called <hi>Mars</hi>'s <hi>Cloſe,</hi> it happened, that whilſt they were clearing the place, and carrying away the rubbiſh, they lit upon <hi>Romulus</hi> his <hi>magick Staff</hi> buried under great and deep heaps of Aſhes. This Staff is crooked at one end, and is called <hi>Lituus.</hi> They make uſe of this <hi>Lituus</hi> in quartering out the regions of the Heavens, when they are upon that ſort of divination which is made by the flight of Birds; which <hi>Romulus</hi> himſelf alſo made uſe of, being moſt excellently skilled in Augury.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="480" facs="tcp:47090:325"/>
But when he diſappeared from among men, the Prieſts took the Staff, and kept it as other holy things, not to be touched or defiled. Now when they found that whereas all other things were conſumed, this Staff was not in the leaſt periſhed by the flames, they began to conceive joyfull hopes concerning <hi>Rome,</hi> that this token did portend the everlaſting ſafety and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of it.</p>
            <p>And now they had ſcarce got a breathing time from their troubles, but a new War <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Romans at the ſame time invaded by the</hi> Aequi, Volſci, <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins and Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans.</hi>
               </note> comes upon them, the <hi>Aequi, Volſci</hi> and Latins all at once invade their Territories, and the Tuſcans beſiege <hi>Sutrium</hi> a confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate City of the Romans. The Military Tribunes, who commanded the Army, and were encamped about the Hill <hi>Martius,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cloſely beſieged by the Latins, and the Camp in danger to be loſt, ſend to <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Camillus</hi> is third time choſen Dictatour. About this War there are two different re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; I ſhall begin with the fabulous: They ſay that the Latins (whether out of pretence, or real deſign to re-unite the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient bloud of both Nations) ſhould ſend to deſire of the Romans ſome of their free Maids in Marriage. That the Romans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a loſs what to determine, (for on one hand they dreaded a War, having ſcarce ſettled and recovered themſelves, on the
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:47090:325"/>
other ſide they ſuſpected that this asking of Wives was in plain terms nothing elſe but to gain Hoſtages, though they covered <note place="margin">Tutula<hi>'s ſtratageme againſt the Latins.</hi>
               </note> it over with the ſpecious name of marriage and alliance) a certain Handmaid by name <hi>Tutula,</hi> or as ſome call her <hi>Philotis</hi> ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the Magiſtrates to ſend with her ſome of the moſt youthfull and beautiful Damoſels in the garb and dreſs of noble Virgins, and leave the reſt to her care and management; that the Magiſtrates conſenting ſhould chuſe out as many as ſhe thought neceſſary for her purpoſe, and adorning them with Gold and rich Clothes, deliver them to the Latins, who encamped nigh the City: That at night the reſt ſhould ſteal away the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Swords, but <hi>Tutula</hi> or <hi>Philotis</hi> (which you pleaſe) getting to the top of a wild Fig-tree, and ſpreading out a thick Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment behind her ſhould hold out a Torch towards <hi>Rome,</hi> which was the ſignal agreed on between her and the Commanders, none other of the Citizens perceiving it, which was the reaſon that the iſſuing out of the Soldiers was tumultuous, the Officers puſhing their men on, and they calling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one anothers names, and ſcarce able to bring themſelves into any order. That ſetting upon the Enemies Works, who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were aſleep or expected no ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they ſhould take the Camp and deſtroy
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:47090:326"/>
moſt of them; and that this was done in the Nones of <hi>July,</hi> which was then called <hi>Quintilis,</hi> and that the Feaſt that is then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, is in remembrance of this action; for firſt running out of the City in great crouds, they pronounce aloud the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar and uſual names, as <hi>Caius, Marcus, Lucius,</hi> and the like, imitating thereby that calling to one another when they iſſued out in ſuch haſte. In the next place the Maid-ſervants richly adorned, run about playing and jeſting upon all they meet, and amongſt themſelves uſe a kind of skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhing, to ſhew they helped in the conflict againſt the Latins. In the time of their feaſting they ſit ſhaded over with Boughs of wild Fig-tree, and the day they call <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae Capratinae,</hi> as ſome think from that wild Fig-tree on which the Maiden held out her Torch; for the Romans call a wild Fig-tree <hi>Caprificus.</hi> Others refer moſt of what is ſaid or done at this Feaſt, to that accident of <hi>Romulus;</hi> for on this day without the Gate he vaniſhed out of ſight, a ſudden darkneſs, together with tempeſt overclou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him (ſome think it an eclipſe of the Sun) and for this reaſon the day was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Nonae Capratinae,</hi> for they call a Goat <note place="margin">Nonae Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pratinae, <hi>whence ſo ſtyled.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Capra;</hi> and <hi>Romulus</hi> diſappeared at a place called <hi>Palus Caprae,</hi> or <hi>Goat Marſh,</hi> whilſt he was holding there an aſſembly, as in his
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:47090:326"/>
Life it is written. But the general ſtream of Writers prefer the other account of this War, which they thus relate. <hi>Camillus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the third time choſen Dictatour, and learning that the Army under the Tribunes was beſieged by the Latins and <hi>Volſces,</hi> he was conſtrained to arm, not onely the youth, but even ſuch as age exempted from ſervice; and taking a large compaſs round the Mountain <hi>Martius,</hi> undiſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Enemy, he lodged his Army on their back, and then by many fires gave notice of his arrival. The beſieged encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged herewith, prepared to fall on and join battel; but the Latins and <hi>Volſces,</hi> fearing their Enemy on both ſides, drew themſelves within their Works, which they fortified with many Trees laid croſs-wiſe, and drove into the ground, and ſo round their Camp drew a wall of Wood; reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to wait for more ſupplies from home, and expect the aſſiſtence of the Tuſcans their confederates: <hi>Camillus</hi> perceiving <note place="margin">
                  <hi>An eminent example of a prudent mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary conduct in</hi> Camillus.</note> their drift, and fearing to be reduced to the ſame ſtraits he had brought them to, namely, to be beſieged himſelf, reſolved to loſe no time; and finding their Rampier was all of Timber, and obſerving that a ſtrong wind conſtantly at Sun-riſing blew off from the Mountains, after having prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red much combuſtable ſtuff, about break
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:47090:327"/>
of day he drew forth his Forces; ſome of which he commanded to take their Darts, and with noiſe and ſhouting aſſault the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy on the other quarter, whilſt he with thoſe that were to fling in the fire went to that ſide of the Enemies Camp on which the wind lay directly, and there waited his opportunity. When the skirmiſh was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and the Sun riſen, and a violent wind fell down from the Mountains, he gave the ſignal of onſet; and pouring in an infinite quantity of fiery matter, he filled all their Rampier with it, ſo that the flame being fed in the cloſe Timber and wooden Palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſados it went on and diſperſed it ſelf into all Quarters. The Latins having nothing ready to keep it off or extinguiſh it, the Camp being almoſt full of fire, were redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to a very ſmall compaſs, and at laſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by neceſſity to fall into their Enemies hand, who ſtood before the Works ready armed and prepared to receive them; of theſe a very few eſcaped, but thoſe that ſtayed in the Camp were all conſumed by the fire, untill ſuch time the Romans, to gain the pillage, extinguiſhed it. Theſe things performed, <hi>Camillus,</hi> leaving his Son <hi>Lucius</hi> in the Camp to guard the Priſoners and ſecure the Booty, paſſed into his Enemies Country, where having <note place="margin">
                  <hi>He reduces the</hi> Aeques <hi>and</hi> Volſces.</note> taken the City of the <hi>Aeques,</hi> and reduced
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:47090:327"/>
the <hi>Volſces</hi> to obedience, he immediately led his Army to <hi>Sutrium</hi> (having not heard what had befallen the Sutrians) making haſte to aſſiſt them, as if they were ſtill in danger, and beſieged by the Tuſcans. But they had already ſurrendred their City to their Enemies; and being deſtitute of all things, with their Garments onely about them, they met <hi>Camillus</hi> on the way, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their Wives and Children, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing their misfortune. <hi>Camillus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was ſtruck with the object, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Romans to weep, and grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſent their caſe, (the Sutrians hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on them) reſolved not to defer revenge, but that very day to lead his Army to <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trium.</hi> Conjecturing that the enemy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving juſt taken a rich and plentifull City, and not left an Enemy within it, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting any from without, he ſhould find them wallowing in all riot and luxury, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and unguarded. Neither did his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Sutrium <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus.</note> fail him, for he not onely paſs'd through their Country without diſcovery, but came up to their very Gates, and poſſeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the Walls, there was not a man left to guard them, but every one was ſcattered about from houſe to houſe, drinking and making merry; nay, when at laſt they did perceive that the Enemy had ſeiſed the City, they were ſo overcharged with Meat
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:47090:328"/>
and Wine, that few were able ſo much as to endeavour an eſcape; but in the moſt ſhamefull poſture either waited for their death within doors, or if they were able to carry themſelves, ſubmitted to the will of the Conquerour. Thus the City of the Sutrians was twice taken in one day; and it came to paſs, that they who were in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion loſt it, and they who had loſt their poſſeſſion gained it again by the means of <hi>Camillus;</hi> for all which actions he received a triumph, which brought him no leſs ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reputation than both the former; for thoſe very Citizens, who before moſt envied and detracted from him, aſcribing the reſt of his ſucceſſes to a certain hit of fortune rather than ſteddy virtue, were compelled by theſe laſt acts of his, to allow the whole honour to the great abilities and <hi>induſtry</hi> of the man. <note place="margin">

Here his accuſer went on with his charge, and the Judges being now at liberty to conſider of his late practices, he received a juſt recompenſe and reward of his wicked actions; for being carried to the Capitol he was flung headlong from the Rock, having the ſame place witneſs of his greateſt glory, and monument of his moſt unfortunate end. The Romans beſides raſed his Houſe, and built there a Temple to the Goddeſs they call <hi>Moneta;</hi> ordaining for the future that none of the Patrician Order ſhould ever dwell in the Capitol Mount.</p>
            <p>And now <hi>Camillus</hi> being called to the <note place="margin">Camillus, <hi>though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing, cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the ſixth time Tribune.</hi>

But the moſt apparent pretence was the weakneſs of his Body, for he happened at that time to be ſick, but the people would admit of no excuſes, but crying that they wanted not his ſtrength
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:47090:329"/>
for Horſe or for Foot ſervice, but onely his counſel and conduct, they conſtrained him to undertake the command, and with one of his fellow Tribunes to lead the Army immediately againſt the Enemy. Theſe were the <hi>Praeneſtines</hi> and <hi>Volſces,</hi> who with great Forces waſted the Countries of the Roman Confederates. Having march'd out his Army, he ſate down and encamped near the Enemy, meaning himſelf to draw out the War in length, or if there ſhould be neceſſity or occaſion of fighting, in the mean time to ſtrengthen his Body for it. But <hi>Lucius</hi> his Collegue, carried away with the deſire of glory, was not to be held in, but impatient to give Battel, inflamed with the ſame eagerneſs the Captains and Colonels of the Army; ſo that <hi>Camillus</hi> fearing he might ſeem out of envy to rob the young men of the glory of a notable exploit, gave way, though unwillingly, that he ſhould draw out the Forces, whilſt himſelf, by reaſon of weakneſs, ſtaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind with a few in the Camp. <hi>Lucius</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging <note place="margin">Lucius<hi>'s in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate engagement retrieved by</hi> Camillus.</note> raſhly and headily was ſoon diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited, when <hi>Camillus</hi> perceiving the Romans to give ground and fly, he could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain himſelf, but leaping from his Bed, with thoſe Servants and retinue he had about him, ran to meet them at the Gates of the Camp; and making his way through them that
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:47090:330"/>
fled, he drove furiouſly to oppoſe the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuers; inſomuch that thoſe who were got within the Camp preſently turned back and followed him, and thoſe that came fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from without, made head again and gathered about him, exhorting one another not to forſake their General. Thus the Enemy for that time was ſtop'd in his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit. But the next day <hi>Camillus</hi> drawing out his Forces and joining Battel with them overthrew them by main force, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cloſe upon them that fled, he entred pell mell with them into their Camp, and took it, ſlaying the greateſt part of them. Afterwards having heard that the City <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trium</hi> was taken by the Tuſcans, and the inhabitants all Romans, put to the Sword, the main Body of his Forces and heavieſt arm'd, he ſent home to <hi>Rome,</hi> and taking with him the lighteſt and beſt appointed Soldiers, he ſet ſuddenly upon the Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans who were in the poſſeſſion of the City, and having maſter'd them, ſome he drove out, others he ſlew, and ſo retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to <hi>Rome</hi> with great ſpoils, he gave a ſignal evidence, that in point of wiſedom they were chiefly to be preferred, who not <note place="margin">Prudence in a Commander preferable to raſh valour.</note> miſtruſting the weakneſs and age of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander endued with courage and conduct, had rather choſen him who was ſickly and deſirous to be excuſed, than younger men
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:47090:330"/>
who were forward and ambitious to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Wherefore when the revolt of the Tuſculanes was reported, they gave <hi>Camil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> the charge of reducing them, chuſing one of his five Collegues to go with him. And now when every one of them put in earneſtly for the place, contrary to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of all, he paſt by the reſt and choſe <hi>Lucius Furius,</hi> the very ſame man, who againſt the judgment of <hi>Camillus,</hi> by raſhly hazarding a Battel, had brought things to a dangerous and almoſt deſperate condition; willing, as it ſhould ſeem, to hide and diſſemble that miſcarriage, and divert the ſhame. The Tuſculanes hearing of <hi>Camillus</hi> his coming againſt them, ſought <note place="margin">The Tuſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanes their politick diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation.</note> cunningly to turn off the ſuſpicion of their revolt. Their Fields, as in times of higheſt peace, were full of Plowmen and Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds; their Gates ſtood wide open, and their Children went publickly to School; as for the people, ſuch as were Trades-men, he found them in their Shops, buſied about their ſeveral employments; and the better ſort of Citizens walking in the publick pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in their uſual Gowns and Formalities: The Magiſtrates very diligent and officious in running about and providing Quarters for the Romans, as if they ſtood in fear of no danger, and as though they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted no fault at all. Which Arts, though
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:47090:331"/>
they could not drive out of <hi>Camillus</hi> the certain opinion he had of their Treaſon, yet wrought in him a certain compaſſion for their repentance, ſo that he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to go to the Senate and attone their anger, and himſelf became interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour in their behalf, inſomuch that their City was acquitted of all offences, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the freedom and privileges of <hi>Rome.</hi> Theſe were the moſt memorable actions of his ſixth Tribuneſhip.</p>
            <p>After theſe things, <hi>Licinnius Stolo</hi> raiſed <note place="margin">
                  <hi>A dangerous Faction at</hi> Rome <hi>head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by</hi> Licin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Stolo.</note> a great Sedition in the City, by which the people fell to diſſention with the Senate, earneſtly contending that of two Conſuls one ſhould be choſen out of the Commons, and not both out of the Nobility. <hi>Tribunes of the people</hi> were choſen, but the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude violently oppoſed the election of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls; things through this diſſention run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into greater diſorder, <hi>Camillus</hi> was the fourth time created Dictatour by the Senate, ſore againſt the will of the People; neither was he himſelf very forward to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it, as being unwilling to oppoſe his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority againſt thoſe, who in many and great conflicts, had repoſed ſingular truſt and confidence in him, and with whom he had done more things in military Affairs, than ever he had tranſacted with the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in civil: that now he was pitch'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:47090:331"/>
out of envy, that prevailing he might ſuppreſs the people; or failing, be ſuppreſt himſelf. However, to provide as good a remedy as he could for the preſent; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the day on which the <hi>Tribunes of the people</hi> intended to prefer the Law, at the ſame time he proclaimed a general muſter, and called the people from the Market-place into the Field, threatning to ſet hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy fines upon ſuch as ſhould not readily o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey. On the other ſide, the <hi>Tribunes of the people</hi> oppoſed themſelves to his threats, ſolemnly proteſting to fine him in 50000 Drachmas of Silver, if he perſiſted to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the people in giving their ſuffrages for the Law. Wherefore, either that he feared another baniſhment or condemnation, as not agreeable to his age, and misbecoming thoſe great actions he had performed, or finding himſelf not able to ſtem the current of the Multitude, which ran with a ſtrong <note place="margin">Camillus <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der bad cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances reſigns the Dictatourſhip.</hi>
               </note> and irreſiſtible force, for the preſent he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took himſelf to his Houſe, and afterwards for ſome days together pretending indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of body, laid down his Dictatourſhip, and the Senate created another Dictatour; who chuſing <hi>Stolo,</hi> leader of this Sedition, to be <hi>General of horſe,</hi> ſuffered that Law to take place, which was moſt grievous to the Nobility, namely, that no perſon whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhould poſſeſs above 500 Acres of Land.
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:47090:332"/>
               <hi>Stolo</hi> exceedingly triumphed in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt he had gained, till not long after, he was found himſelf to poſſeſs more than he allowed unto others, and ſo ſuffered the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties of his own Law. And now the contention about election of Conſuls com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on (which of all other diſſentions was the ſharpeſt, and from its firſt beginning had adminiſtred moſt matter of diviſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Senate and the People) certain <note place="margin">The ſecond invaſion of the Gauls.</note> intelligence arrives, that the Gauls again proceeding from the Adriatick Sea, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched directly towards <hi>Rome,</hi> and upon the very heels of the report manifeſt acts of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtility are related; that the Country through which they marched was all waſted, and ſuch as by flight could not make their eſcape to <hi>Rome,</hi> were diſperſed and ſcattered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Mountains. The terrour of this War quieted the Sedition, ſo that the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility conferring with the Commons, and both joyning Councils, unanimouſly choſe <hi>Camillus</hi> the fifth time Dictatour. Who, though very ancient, as not wanting much of fourſcore years, yet conſidering the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and neceſſity of his Country, did not as before pretend ſickneſs or other excuſe, but readily undertook the charge, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted his Soldiers. And knowing that the force of the Barbarians lay chiefly in their Swords with which they laid about them
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:47090:332"/>
in a rude and unskilfull manner hacking and hewing the Head and Shoulders; he <note place="margin">Camillus<hi>'s extraordinary proviſions for the War.</hi>
               </note> cauſed iron Murrions to be made for moſt of his Men, ſmoothing and poliſhing the outſide, that the Enemies Swords lighting upon them might either ſlide off, or be broken; and round about their Shields he drew a little rim of braſs, the wood it ſelf being not ſufficient to bear off the blows. Beſides, he taught his Soldiers in cloſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging, to uſe long Javelins or punchion Staves, which holding under their Enemies Swords would receive the force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of them. When the Gauls drew nigh about the River <hi>Anien,</hi> dragging a heavy Camp after them, and loaden with infinite Spoil, <hi>Camillus</hi> drew forth his Forces, and planted himſelf upon a Hill of eaſy aſcent, and which had many hollow places in it, to the end that the greateſt part of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my might lie concealed, and thoſe few which appeared might be thought through fear to have betaken themſelves to thoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per grounds. And the more to encreaſe this opinion in them, he ſuffered them without any diſturbance to ſpoil and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage even to his very Trenches, keeping himſelf quiet within his Works, which were well fortified on all ſides: At laſt, perceiving that part of the Enemy were ſcattered about the Country a-forraging,
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:47090:333"/>
and having advice that thoſe that were in the Camp did nothing day and night but drink and revell, in the night-time he drew forth his lighteſt-armed men and ſent them before, to obſerve and watch the Enemy, and to be ready to hinder them from draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into order, and to vex and diſcompoſe them when they ſhould firſt iſſue out of their Trenches; and early in the morning he brought down his main Body, and ſet them in battel-array in the lower grounds, being a numerous and courageous Army; whereas the Barbarians had taken them for an inconſiderable and fearfull party. The firſt thing that abated the pride and courage of the <note place="margin">The Gauls upon two ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartned.</note> Gauls, was, that they were to fight when they leaſt expected it, and that their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies had the honour of being aggreſſours. In the next place, the light-armed men fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon them before they could get into their uſual order, or range themſelves in their proper ſquadrons, did ſo force and preſs upon them, that they were obliged to fight confuſedly and at random without any diſcipline at all. But at laſt, when <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus</hi> brought on his heavy-armed Legions, the Barbarians with their Swords drawn went vigorouſly to engage them; but the Romans oppoſing with their Javelins, and receiving the force of their blows on that part of their Shield which was well guarded
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:47090:333"/>
with ſteel, they turned the edge of their Weapons, being made of a ſoft and ill-tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered metal, inſomuch that their Swords immediately bent in their hands, and ſtood crooked to the Hilts; as for their Bucklers, they were pierced through and through, and grown ſo heavy with the Javelins that ſtuck upon them, that forced to quit their own Weapons, they endeavoured to make advantage of thoſe of their Enemies; ſo that gathering up the Javelins in their hands, they began to return them upon the Romans. But the Romans perceiving <note place="margin">They are van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed by the Romans.</note> them naked and unarm'd, preſently betook themſelves to their Swords, which they ſo well uſed, that in a little time great ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was made in the foremoſt ranks, and the reſt of them fled, diſperſing themſelves all over the Champain Country; for as for the Hills and upper Grounds, <hi>Camillus</hi> had poſſeſſed himſelf beforehand of them, and they knew it would not be difficult for the Enemy to take their Camp, ſeeing through confidence of victory they had left it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded. They ſay this Fight was thirteen years after the ſacking of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that from henceforward the Romans took cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and laid aſide thoſe diſmal appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions they had conceived of the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians; thinking now that their firſt defeat, was rather the effect of ſickneſs, and the
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:47090:334"/>
ſtrange concurrence of evil chances than the ſteddy courage or true force of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. And indeed this fear had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſo great, that they made a Law, <hi>That Prieſts ſhould be excuſed from war-like ſervice, unleſs in an invaſion from the Gauls.</hi> This was the laſt military Action that ever <hi>Camillus</hi> performed; for as for the City of the <hi>Velitrani,</hi> it was but a by acceſſion to this victory, it being ſurrendred unto him without any reſiſtance. But the greateſt contention in civil Affairs, and the hardeſt to be managed againſt the People, was ſtill remaining; for they returning home full of victory and ſucceſs, violently inſiſted, contrary to the ancient cuſtom, to have one of the Conſuls choſen out of their own body. The Senate ſtrongly oppoſed it, and would not ſuffer <hi>Camillus</hi> to lay down his Dictatourſhip, thinking that under the ſhelter of his great name and authority they ſhould be better able to contend for the power of the Nobility. When <hi>Camillus</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Tribunes their rude deportment toward</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus.</note> was ſitting upon the Tribunal, diſpatching publick affairs, an Officer ſent by the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes of the people</hi> commanded him to riſe and follow him, laying his hand upon him as ready to ſeiſe and carry him away; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which ſuch a noiſe and tumult followed in the Aſſembly, the like was never heard of before; ſome that were about <hi>Camillus,</hi>
               <pb n="499" facs="tcp:47090:334"/>
thruſting the people from the Bench, and the multitude below calling out to pull him down: Being at a loſs what to doe in this exigent of affairs, yet he laid not down his authority, but taking the Senatours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him, he went to the Senate-houſe; but before he entred, he beſought the Gods that they would bring theſe Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to a happy concluſion, ſolemnly vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when the Tumult was ended, to build a Temple to <hi>Concord.</hi> A great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ariſing in the Senate, by reaſon of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinions, at laſt the moſt moderate and agreeable to the people prevailed, which yielded, that of two Conſuls, one of them ſhould be choſen of the Commonalty. When the Dictatour had proclaimed this determination of the Senate to the People, they were immediately (as it could not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe be) pleaſed and reconcil'd with the Senate; and for <hi>Camillus,</hi> they accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied him home, with all the expreſſions and acclamations of joy; and the next day being aſſembled together, they voted a Temple of <hi>Concord</hi> to be built according to <note place="margin">

Garlands on their heads. In the election of Conſuls held by <hi>Camillus, M.

and laviſh that affection and kindneſs, which Nature hath implanted in us, upon brute Beaſts, which is due and owing to humane Creatures, thoſe of our own kind. Now inaſmuch as even the Whelps and Cubs of Dogs and Apes have a kind of inclination to learning and knowledge, and love to look about them and to take notice of things, the Soul of Man hath by Nature a higher principle of Reaſon, ſo as to find fault with thoſe who make ill uſe of that inclination and deſire upon idle diſcourſes and ſights that deſerve no regard, while in the mean time they careleſly paſs by good and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table things of that ſort.</p>
            <p>For indeed as to the outward <hi>Senſe,</hi> that <note place="margin">The advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding above Senſe.</note> being paſſive in receiving the impreſſion of thoſe objects that come in its way and ſtrike upon it, it is peradventure neceſſary for it <hi>(the Senſe)</hi> to entertain and take notice of every thing that appears to it, be it what it will, uſefull or unuſefull: but every man, if he will make uſe of his <hi>

So that a man ought to purſue and make after the beſt and choiceſt of every thing, that he may not onely imploy his contemplation, but may alſo be nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and improved by it. For as that Colour

is moſt gratefull and agreeable to the <hi>Eye,</hi> whoſe lively freſhneſs together with its plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and delightfulneſs revives and cheriſhes the ſight; ſo a man ought to apply his mind and reaſoning to ſuch objects and notices, as with delight are apt to call it forth and allure it to its own proper good and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar advantage.</p>

Foraſmuch as in other things of another nature there doth not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately follow upon the admiration and liking of the thing done any ſtrong deſire of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the like. Nay many times on the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">Which doth not happen in things of Art or Skill.</note> contrary when we are pleaſed with the Work, we ſlight and ſet little by the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or Artiſt himſelf: as for inſtance, in Perfumes and Purple-dyes, we are taken with the things themſelves well enough, but we look but meanly upon Dyers and Perfumers, as a ſort of pitifull Tradeſmen and ſorry Mechanicks. Whereupon it was not amiſs ſaid by <hi>Antiſthenes,</hi> when people told him that one <hi>Iſmenias</hi> was an excellent
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:47090:338"/>
Fidler or Piper; <hi>It may be ſo,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>but he is but a wretched paltry Fellow for all that: for otherwiſe he would not have been ſo excellent a Fidler;</hi> meaning that he would have found ſome better buſineſs to have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd himſelf about than fidling and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. And King <hi>Philip</hi> to the ſame purpoſe told his Son <hi>Alexander,</hi> who once at a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meeting had ſung with great pleaſure and skill; <hi>Are not you aſhamed, Son, to ſing ſo well? For it is enough for a King or Prince to find leiſure ſometime to hear others ſing; and he does the Muſes no ſmall honour, when he pleaſes to be but preſent at ſuch exerciſes and trials of skill.</hi> Now he who buſies himſelf in mean employs, doth but bring that pains he takes about things of little or no uſe, as an evidence againſt himſelf of his negligence and ſlothfull indiſpoſition to vertuous and uſefull practices. Nor would any generous and ingenuous young man, who ſhould behold the Statue of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> which ſtands in the City <hi>Piſa,</hi> deſire to be a <hi>Phidias,</hi> or that of <hi>Juno</hi> in the City <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos,</hi> to be a <hi>Polyclete,</hi> (the Workmen of thoſe Statues;) or to be as good a Poet as <hi>Anacreon</hi> or <hi>Philemon</hi> or <hi>Archilochus,</hi> who had been delighted in reading of their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems. For it doth not neceſſarily follow, that if a piece of Work pleaſe for its grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, therefore he that wrought it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:47090:338"/>
our regard or envy. Whence it is that neither do ſuch things profit or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage the beholders, upon the ſight whereof there doth not ariſe a zeal which may put them upon imitation, nor an impulſe or inclination, which may move a deſire and raiſe an endeavour of doing the like. But in ſooth it is <hi>Vertue,</hi> which doth preſently by the bare propoſal of its actions ſo diſpoſe men, that they do at once both admire the things done and deſire to imitate the doers of them.

the <hi>Clazomenian:</hi> whom the men of thoſe times called by the name of <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>This man <hi>Pericles</hi> did extraordinarily <note place="margin">His accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments.</note> eſteem and admire, and being fill'd up to the brim with that they call lofty way of ſpeaking and diſcourſing as it were on tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toe, he not onely was, as we may judge, maſter of brave and bold reſentments, and of ſuch a ſtrain of harangue as was high in it ſelf and free from the taint of plebeian prate and lewd knaviſh buffoonry: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo beſide that, the very air of his Face and compoſure of his Countenance grave and not any way moved to laughter, and the gentleneſs and ſlowneſs of his pace and gate, and the decent ordering of his Apparel, ſo that no accident could diſcompoſe him in
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:47090:342"/>
the delivery of himſelf, and the even undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed faſhioning and tuning of his voice, and whatever other the like advantages he had, did make wonderfull impreſſions even to aſtoniſhment in all perſons that either ſaw or heard him.</p>
            <p>See but his patience and greatneſs of <note place="margin">An inſtance of his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> mind! One time being reviled and ill ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of all day long in his own hearing by a villainous and ill-tongu'd Raſcal that cared not what he ſaid, he bore it patiently all along without returning him one word; all this in the open Court or the Aſſembly of the people, where he was at the ſame time ingaged in the proſecution and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch of ſome weighty urgent affair. In the evening he went home in very good order, as one unconcerned, this Fellow dogging him at the heels, and pelting him all the way he went with all the hard words and Billinſgate language he could rake up. As he was ready to go into his Houſe, it being by this time dark, he ordered one of his Servants to take a light and to go along with the man and ſee him ſafe home: which was all the notice he took of him.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Ion</hi> the Poet ſaith that <hi>Pericles</hi> his <note place="margin">

               </note> converſe and carriage in company was haughty and ſurly, ſuperb and full of huff, and that he had a great deal of ſlightingneſs and ſcorn of others intermixt with his ſtate
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:47090:342"/>
and high thoughts of himſelf; and on the other hand he commends <hi>Cimon</hi>'s exact ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility and eaſy compliance and gentile well-faſhioned behaviour at every turn in all his converſations. Well! but let us leave <hi>Ion</hi> to himſelf, who ſeems to take it for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that Vertue hath by all means ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the Satyrical part in it, as Tragedy hath: but as for thoſe who miſcalled <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> his gravity by the name of an affected oſtentation and grandeur of ſtate, <hi>Zeno</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed ſuch perſons, that they alſo would try to affect the like garb of greatneſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as the very counterfeiting and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of good qualities doth in time by ſtealth procure and beget a kind of emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for thoſe things and a familiarity with them.</p>
            <p>Nor were theſe the onely advantages <note place="margin">Another ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of his education.</note> which <hi>Pericles</hi> had of <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance and keeping him company: but he ſeemed alſo to be advanced by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions far above all that ſuperſtition, whatever it is, which as to Meteors and the like ſtrange Appearances doth with frightfull apprehenſions poſſeſs the minds of people, who are ignorant of the true cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, by which ſuch effects are naturally produced, and are mad as if the Devil were in them, and in great agony and diſorder upon occaſion of theſe divine Prodigies by
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:47090:343"/>
reaſon of their ignorance and want of skill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them: which ignorance natural reaſon diſcharging and freeing men from, inſtead of a dreadfull and unquiet troubleſome ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, works in them a free and generous devotion, together with good hopes and kindly aſſurances.</p>
            <p>There is a ſtory that on a time <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricles</hi> 
               <note place="margin">A prodigy of a Ram with one Horn.</note> had brought him from a Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farm of his a Ram's Head with one Horn, and that <hi>Lampon</hi> a Diviner or Fortune-tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, upon ſeeing the Horn grow ſtrong and firm out of the midſt of the Fore-head, gave <note place="margin">The meaning of it.</note> this for his judgment, that there being at that time two potent Factions, Parties or Intereſts, in the City, the one of <hi>Thucydi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> and the other of <hi>Pericles,</hi> the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would come about to that one of them, in whoſe Ground or Eſtate this to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or indication of fate had happened: But that <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> when he had cleft the <note place="margin">The reaſon of it.</note> Skull in ſunder, ſhew'd to the ſtanders by that the brain had not fill'd up its pan or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural place, but being ſharp, of an oval fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, had roll'd it ſelf together, from all parts of the veſſel which contain'd it, in a point to that place, from whence the root of the Horn took its riſe; which was the reaſon it grew ſingle. And that for that time <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> was much admired, for
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:47090:343"/>
the account he gave, by thoſe that were preſent at the operation; and <hi>Lampon</hi> no leſs a little while after, when <hi>Thucydides</hi> being outed and laid aſide all affairs of the State and Government came intirely into <hi>Pericles</hi> his hands and menage.</p>
            <p>And yet in my opinion it is no abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <note place="margin">The cauſe and end of Prodigies ought both to be heeded.</note> to ſay that they were both in the right, the natural Philoſopher and the Fortune-tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, the one ſo luckily hitting upon the cauſe of this event, by which it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; the other upon the end, for which it was deſigned. For it was the buſineſs of the <hi>one</hi> to find out and give account, out of what it was made and in what manner and by what means it grew as it did; and of the <hi>other</hi> to foretell to what end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it was ſo made and what it might mean or portend. Now as to thoſe who ſay that to find out the cauſe of ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious events is in effect to deſtroy any ſignification they may be ſuppoſed to have; theſe men do not take notice, that at the ſame time together with divine Prodigies (the tokens of God's pleaſure or diſpleaſure) they defeat and render of no uſe thoſe ſigns and marks which are contrived by art; ſuch as are for inſtance, the claſhings and clatterings of Quoits or Trenchers, and the lights of Watch-towers along the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and the ſhadows of the Pins of Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials;
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:47090:344"/>
every of which things is made by ſome cauſe and contrivance to be a ſign of ſome other thing. But theſe are ſubjects that peradventure would better befit ſome other conſideration than what we are now upon.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Pericles,</hi> being yet but a young man ſtood in great awe of the people and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>His reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of</hi> Piſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratus.</note> was mightily afraid of giving them any occaſion of offence: foraſmuch as he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in ſhape and feature to be very like the Tyrant <hi>Piſiſtratus,</hi> and the grave Seni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours of the Town, who remember'd that man, when they took notice of the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this man's voice and the volubility and readineſs of his tongue in diſcourſing, were ſtruck into amazement at the mere reſemblance of this to the other. But he conſidering that he had a very fair Eſtate, and was deſcended of a noble Family as any, and had ſtore of Friends who bore the greateſt ſway, was ſo far from truſting to theſe advantages, that he apprehended they might procure him to be baniſhed as a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous perſon; and for this reaſon he med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not at all with State-affairs, but in the ſervices of War he ſhew'd himſelf a brave man and one who with undaunted courage would expoſe himſelf upon all occaſions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="517" facs="tcp:47090:344"/>
But as ſoon as <hi>Ariſtides</hi> was dead, and <note place="margin">His firſt riſe in the State.</note> 
               <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> turn'd out of the Saddle, and ſeeing that <hi>Cimon</hi> was for the moſt part kept abroad by thoſe expeditions he made in foreign Parts out of <hi>Greece,</hi> then did <hi>Pericles</hi> ſeeing things in this poſture apply himſelf to the State, inſtead of the rich and the few great Dons, making choice of ſuch matters and cauſes wherein the common people and poorer ſort were concern'd, and ſided with them; which was a thing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what beſide his natural temper, for he was not of himſelf given to popularity or mean compliances. But, as it is very likely, fearing he might by reaſon of thoſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages we mention'd fall under a ſuſpicion and jealouſy of ſetting up for Kingſhip or arbitrary Power, and ſeeing how <hi>Cimon</hi> courted the Ariſtocracy or chief men of the Government and was mightily beloved by all honeſt men and people of faſhion, he took another way to the wood and ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd himſelf among the croud and herd of the common people: by which means he did at once both ſecure himſelf and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure an intereſt to ſerve him, when time ſhould be, againſt <hi>Cimon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And beſides preſently upon his applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">His reſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> to State-affairs he took a quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent courſe from what others and himſelf had uſed as to his order of life and manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:47090:345"/>
of himſelf. For he was never ſeen to walk in any ſtreet or way at <hi>Athens,</hi> but onely that which led to the Court or Town-hall, where the people aſſembled, and to the Senate or Parliament Houſe, where the Lords ſate in Council; and he avoided and left off the invitations of Friends to ſupper and all ſuch kind of friendly treatment and neighbourly acquaintance: ſo that in all the time he had to doe with the publick, which was not a little, he was never known to have gone to any of his Friends to a ſupper; onely once and that was at a Wedding, when his near Kinſman <hi>Euryptolemus,</hi> his Siſter's Son, married, he ſtaid till the ceremony of the Drink-offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and then immediately roſe from Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and went his way. For theſe friendly Meetings and Treats are ſhrewd things to get the upper-hand of an affected greatneſs, and are apt to diſcompoſe a ſtarcht gravity and put it out of countenance; nor can the ſolemnity of a man's reputation be well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd and maintain'd by ordinary converſe and familiarity. And yet in that which is <note place="margin">Vertue free and open.</note> true and genuine vertue, thoſe things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the faireſt, which are moſt apparent and leaſt reſerv'd; and there is not of good and brave men any thing ſo fit to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by ſtrangers, as their daily life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is by thoſe of their family and

And that it was good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that the City being ſufficiently provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and ſtored with thoſe things that are neceſſary for the War, they ſhould convert the overplus of its Wealth to ſuch under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings and deſigns, as would hereafter, when they were finiſhed, eternize their fame, and for the preſent, while they are a doing, will readily ſupply all the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants with plenty; there appearing ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of all kind of workmanſhip and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſorts of occaſions for ſervice, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they do ſummon all Arts and Trades and require all hands to be imployed about them, they do actually put the whole City in a manner into State-pay; ſo that at the ſame time ſhe is beautified and maintained by her ſelf at her own coſt and charge. For as thoſe who are of age and ſtrength for War are provided for and maintained in the Armies abroad by their pay out of the

publick Stock; ſo it being his deſire and deſign that the rude multitude that ſtaid at home and were verſt in Handi-crafts ſhould not go without their ſhare of publick Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and yet that they ſhould not have them given them for ſitting ſtill and doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, to that end he thought fit to bring in among them, with the approbation of the State, thoſe vaſt projects of Buildings, and deſigns of Works, that would be of ſome continuance e'er they be finiſhed, which will imploy ſundry Arts and Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations. That ſo that part of the people, that ſtaid in the City and kept home, might, no leſs than thoſe that were at Sea or in Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon or under Arms, have a fair pretence and juſt occaſion of receiving the benefit and having their ſhare of the publick Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys.</p>
            <p>For here in this caſe the Materials or <note place="margin">The advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of thoſe publick Works to the people of the Town.</note> ſtuff were <hi>Stone, Braſs, Ivory, Gold, Ebony, Cypreſs;</hi> and the Arts or Trades that wrought and faſhioned them were <hi>Smiths</hi> and <hi>Carpenters,</hi> Image-makers and <hi>Plaiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, Founders</hi> and <hi>Braſiers, Stone-cutters</hi> or Carvers and <hi>Maſons, Dyers</hi> and Stainers, <hi>Gold-ſmiths, Ivory-</hi>cutters, <hi>Painters</hi> or Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-drawers, <hi>Embroiderers, Turners:</hi> now thoſe that imported theſe things and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed them up to Town for uſe, were <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,</hi> and <hi>Mariners,</hi> and <hi>Maſters of Ships</hi>
               <pb n="535" facs="tcp:47090:353"/>
by Sea; and thoſe who brought and help'd to bring them by Land were <hi>Waggoners</hi> and <hi>Cartwrights, Carriers</hi> and thoſe that let Horſes to hire, <hi>Carters</hi> and <hi>Muletiers, Rope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers,</hi> Workers in Stone, <hi>Shoe-makers</hi> and Leather-dreſſers, <hi>Surveyours</hi> and Menders of High-ways, <hi>Pioneers</hi> and Diggers in Mines. Now every Trade and Myſtery, in the ſame nature, as a Commander or Captain in an Army hath his particular Company of Souldiers under him, had its own hired and peculiar Company of Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-men and Labourers belonging to it banded and pack'd together as in array, to be as it were the inſtrument and body for the performance of the ſervice. To ſay all in a word, the occaſions and uſes they had for men to theſe publick Works did diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute and ſcatter the plentifull advantage and benefit of them among the people of the Town through all ages and conditions; of whatſoever Trade and Occupation they might be.</p>
            <p>As the Works then grew up being as <note place="margin">The admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpeed they made in theſe Works.</note> ſtately and extraordinary for bulk and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſo inimitable for beauty and graceful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Work-men ſtriving to out-vy the matter and grandeur of the Work with the neat contrivance and artificial beauty of it; the thing that was moſt to be admired was the haſte and ſpeed they made. For of
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:47090:354"/>
thoſe things, which every one of them ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly they did imagin could hardly be fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and brought to an end in ſeveral ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions of Governours and ages of Men, all of them had their complement and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the height and prime of one man's Government. Although they ſay too, that about the ſame time <hi>Zeuxis</hi> having heard <hi>Agatharchus</hi> the Picture-drawer boaſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for diſpatching his Work with ſpeed and eaſe, replied, <hi>But I am a long time about mine.</hi> For the eaſineſs and haſtineſs in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a thing doth not put upon the Work a laſting ſolidity or exactneſs of beauty: but time being allow'd to a man's pains a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand for the production of a thing doth by way of intereſt return a vital force for the preſervation of the thing after it is once produced. For which reaſon <hi>Pericles</hi> his Works are the more admired, having been done ſo well in a little time as to hold good for a long time. For every ſeveral Piece <note place="margin">Yet the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtingneſs and freſhneſs of them.</note> of his Work was immediately even at that time for its beauty and elegance Antique, as if it had been performed by ſome anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Maſter; and yet for its vigour and freſhneſs it looks to this day as if it were ſpick and ſpan, and newly wrought: There is ſuch a kind of flouriſhing gloſs upon thoſe Works of his, which continually preſerves the ſight of them from being ſullied by
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:47090:354"/>
time, as if they had an ay-green ſpirit and a never-fading ſoul mingled in the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of them.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Phidias</hi> was he who had the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight <note place="margin">An account of the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and of ſeveral of the Buildings.</note> of all the Works and was his Survey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our-general, though in the ſeveral Deſigns and Pieces there were great Maſters and rare Artiſts imployed. For <hi>Callicrates</hi> and <hi>Ictinus</hi> built the <hi>Parthenon</hi> (that is, the Temple of the Virgin <hi>Pallas)</hi> which was in meaſure an hundred Foot every way; and the Chapel at <hi>Eleuſin</hi> (where the ſacred Rites of the Goddeſs <hi>Ceres</hi> were celebrated) was begun by <hi>Coroebus,</hi> who alſo placed the Pillars that ſtand upon the Floor or Pavement and join'd them with Architraves: but after his death <hi>Metagenes</hi> the <hi>Xypetian</hi> rais'd the Girth or Waſte of it, and ſet up the Pillars that are above, and <hi>Xenocles</hi> the <hi>Cholargian</hi> roofed or arched the Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn or Loover on the top of the Temple of <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux.</hi>

            <p>Then <hi>Pericles</hi> out of an ambition to doe <note place="margin">Muſick Games in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted.</note> ſomething to be talk'd of, did firſt enact or make a Decree, that a Prize ſhould be plaid in the Science of <hi>Muſick</hi> every year at the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Feaſts of <hi>Minerva,</hi> which laſted five
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:47090:355"/>
days together, called <hi>Panathenaea,</hi> whither all the people of City and Country were uſed to reſort, and he himſelf being choſen Judge of the Prizes and Beſtower of the Rewards gave order, after what manner thoſe who were to play the Prizes were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſing with the Voice, or to play up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Flute or upon the Cittern or Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarr. And both at that time (to wit, at the Feaſt) and at other times alſo they were wont to ſit in this Muſick-room and ſee and hear thoſe Prizes and trials of Skill.</p>
            <p>Further the Foregate and entrance of the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The</hi> Acropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis <hi>or Citta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del.</hi>
               </note> Cittadel or Caſtle were finiſhed in five years time, <hi>Mneſicles</hi> being the chief undertaker of that Work. Now there was a ſtrange <note place="margin">A <hi>ſtrange accident.</hi>
               </note> accident happened in building of the Citta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, which ſhewed that the Goddeſs was ſo far from diſliking the Work or being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to it, that ſhe help'd to carry it on and to bring it to perfection. For one of the Artificers, who was the quickeſt and the handieſt Work-man among them all, with a ſlip of his Foot fell down from a great height and lay ill of it in ſo miſerable a condition, that the Phyſicians and Chirurgeons gave him over, having no hopes of his recovery. <hi>Pericles</hi> being at a loſs and not knowing what to doe, <hi>Minerva</hi> appeared to him at night in a Dream and order'd a Medicine, which <hi>Pericles</hi> applying to the Man did in
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:47090:356"/>
a ſhort time and with great eaſe cure him. And upon this occaſion it was that he ſet up a braſs Statue of <hi>Minerva,</hi> called hence the Statue of <hi>Health,</hi> in the Cittadel near <note place="margin">Minerva<hi>'s Statue.</hi>
               </note> an Altar, which as they ſay was there before. But it was <hi>Phidias,</hi> who wrought the Goddeſſes Image in Gold, and hath his name inſcribed on the Pedeſtal as the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man thereof. And indeed the whole Work in a manner was under his charge, and he had (as we have ſaid already) the overſight over all the Artiſts and Workmen, becauſe <hi>Pericles</hi> had a kindneſs for him.</p>
            <p>And this made the poor man to be much envied, and his Patron to be very ill ſpoken <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Several ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes put upon</hi> Pericles.</note> of and horribly abuſed with ſtories, as if <hi>Phidias</hi> had been his Pimp and took up La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Gentlewomen that came to ſee the Works, for <hi>Pericles</hi> his uſe. The Comick Wits of the Town, when they had got this ſtory by the end, made much of it and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſh'd him with all the ribaldry they could invent, as if he had been the arranteſt Whoremaſter that ever liv'd; charging him falſely with the Wife of <hi>Menippus</hi> one who was his Friend and had been a Lieutenant General under him in the Wars; and with the Volaries or Bird-cages of <hi>Pyrilampes,</hi> who being an acquaintance of <hi>Pericles,</hi> they pretended, and made as if he were
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:47090:356"/>
wont to preſent Peacocks and ſuch fine Birds to <hi>Pericles</hi> his Miſſes, the Women whom he gallanted and kept company with. And why ſhould one wonder at what ſuch Fellows ſay, who play the <hi>Satyriſts</hi> upon other mens Lives, and daily upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions with their reproaches and evil ſpeeches ſacrifice the reputations of their Superiours, the <hi>Great</hi> and the <hi>Good,</hi> to the envy and ſpite of the Rabble, as to ſome evil <hi>Genius</hi> or wicked Spirit; when as <hi>Steſimbrotus</hi> the <hi>Thaſian</hi> hath dared to broach a diſmal and incredible Villany againſt <hi>Pericles,</hi> as if he had committed Inceſt with his own Son's Wife.</p>
            <p>By this means it comes about, that it is a <note place="margin">Why hard to find out Truth in Hiſtory.</note> very difficult matter to trace and find out the Truth of any thing by <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> when on one hand thoſe who undertake to write it, living ſo long after the things were done, cannot arrive at the certain knowledge of ſuch tranſactions as paſt in the times before them; and on the other hand that Hiſtory which is contemporary and of the ſame ſtanding with thoſe Actions and Lives, which it reporteth, doth partly through envy and ill-will, partly through favour and flattery, diſguiſe and pervert the truth.</p>
            <p>Now when the Oratours, who ſided with <hi>Thucydides</hi> and were of his party, were at one time bawling (as their cuſtom was)
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:47090:357"/>
againſt <hi>Pericles,</hi> as one who ſquander'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the publick Stock in idle expences, and made havock of the State-revenues, he ſtarting up in the open Aſſembly put the queſtion to the People, Whether they thought that what he had laid out was too much; and they ſaying, <hi>Too too much of all conſcience. Well then!</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ſince 'tis ſo,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pericles <hi>his brave reply when accuſed for waſting publick Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>let not the coſt and charge go upon your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, but upon mine: and accordingly I will make the Inſcription upon the Temples and other publick Buildings in mine own name.</hi> When therefore they heard him ſay thus, whether it were out of a ſurpriſe to ſee the greatneſs of his Spirit, or out of emulation that they envied him the glory of the Works and reſolv'd to go ſhares with him, they cried aloud bidding him to ſpend on and lay out o' God's name what he thought fit out of the publick Purſe, and to ſpare no coſt, till all were finiſhed.</p>
            <p>At length being brought to puſh of pike with <hi>Thucydides,</hi> upon a trial of skill whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">
                  <hi>He foils</hi> Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydides,</note> ſhould ſhell the other out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and having not without ſome hazard got the better, he threw his Antagoniſt out and ſent him packing for ten years, and then routed and broke to pieces all the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite party, which had ſtood againſt him. So that now the difference and quarrel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:47090:357"/>
wholly reſolved and at an end, and the City being as it were levelled into an even temper and made of one piece, he in a trice <note place="margin">and rules all alone.</note> brought about all <hi>Athens</hi> to his own devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and got the diſpoſal of all affairs that belong'd to the <hi>Athenians</hi> into his own hands, their Cuſtoms, and their Armies, and their Gallies, and their Iſlands, and the Sea, and that great power and ſtrength, which accrued to them partly by means of the other <hi>Grecians,</hi> and partly alſo upon the account of the <hi>Barbarians;</hi> in a word ſuch a ſeigniory and dominion, as was mounded and fortified with ſeveral Nations that were ſubject to it, and with the friendſhips and amities of ſeveral Kings, and with the alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of confederate Potentates and great Lords.</p>
            <p>After this he was now no longer the ſame <note place="margin">He alters his Policy.</note> Man he had been before, nor at the ſame rate, as formerly, tame and gentle and familiar with the populace, ſo as readily to yield himſelf up to their pleaſure and to comply with the deſires of the Rabble, as a Steerſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man tacks about with the winds through all the points of the Compaſs. But on the other hand from that looſe remiſs and in ſome caſes deboſh'd way of wheedling the people, he wound and skrew'd them up to an Ariſtocratical and Regal form of State and Government, and ſhewing himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:47090:358"/>
and unblameable in his noble and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere aim at the beſt things, he did by theſe means generally lead the people along with their own wills and conſents, by perſwading and ſhewing them what was to be done; and ſometimes too ruffling them and forcing them full ſore againſt their will, he made them whether they would or no to cloſe with what he propoſed for the publick advantage.</p>
            <p>Wherein, to ſay the truth, he did but <note place="margin">He plays the State-phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian.</note> like a skilfull Phyſician, who in a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and chronical Diſeaſe, as he ſees oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, one while allows his Patient the moderate uſe of ſuch things as pleaſe him, another while he applies corroſives and ſharp things that put him to pain, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſters ſuch medicines as may work the cure. For there ariſing and growing up, as is likely, all manner of diſtempers among a people which had ſo vaſt a command and dominion, he alone, as a great Maſter, knowing how with care to handle and deal with them all ſeverally, and in an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner making that uſe of <hi>Hopes</hi> and <hi>Fears</hi> as his two chief Rudders, as with the one to check and ſtop the career of their high-flown confidence at any time, ſo with the other to raiſe them up and comfort them, when they lay under any diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement; he plainly ſhewed by this that <note place="margin">The force of Rhetorick.</note> 
               <hi>Rhetorick</hi> or the Art of ſpeaking is, in <hi>Plato</hi>'s
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:47090:358"/>
ſenſe and language, the Government of the Souls of men, the wire-drawing of the Soul, and that her chiefeſt buſineſs and deſign is her method and artifice of managing the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and paſſions, which are as it were the pegs, the ſtops and keys of the Soul, which require a very skilfull and carefull touch and ſtroke to be plaid upon as they ſhould be.</p>
            <p>Now the reaſon of this that made <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> 
               <note place="margin">His reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity.</note> ſo prevailing, was not altogether bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the power and force of his expreſſion and language, but as <hi>Thucydides</hi> aſſures us, the high opinion which the people had of the man, and the reputation and integrity of his life, he being one who was clearly free from all corruption or bribery, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all conſiderations of money. Who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that he had made the City <hi>Athens,</hi> which was great of it ſelf, as great and rich as can be imagined, and though he were himſelf alſo grown in power and intereſt to be more than equal to many Kings and abſolute Lords, who ſome of them alſo bequeſted by Will their Eſtates to their Children, he for his part did not improve the patrimony his Father left him, or make it more than it was by one Groat or Dram.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="546" facs="tcp:47090:359"/>
How beit <hi>Thucydides</hi> doth indeed give a <note place="margin">Some Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his great power.</note> plain narrative of that great power and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of his, and the <hi>Comick Poets</hi> do ſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully enough as their manner is, more than hint at it, by covert expreſſions, calling his Companions and Friends about him by the name of <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> his new Courtiers, and demanding of him to abjure the ſetting up for a ſingle perſon or exerciſing an arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry power, as one whoſe grandeur and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence were unproportionable to and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with a <hi>Democracy</hi> or popular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and grown to be a grievance not to be indured in a free State. Further <hi>Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clides</hi> ſaith that the <hi>Athenians</hi> had betray'd and ſurrender'd up to him both the Cuſtoms and Impoſts of their ſubject Cities and the Cities themſelves, ſo as to bind up ſome and to let looſe others; and Stone Walls, to build up what he pleas'd and again to throw them down; Leagues of Alliance, the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and ſtrength of the Nation, their peace, and their wealth and good fortune.</p>
            <p>Nor was all this the buſineſs of a lucky <note place="margin">The long time of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> hit by ſome emergent occaſion, nor was it the vigorous height and propitious favour of a State-management that flouriſh'd for a ſeaſon; but having for forty years together bore the bell away among ſuch brave Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as <hi>Ephialtes</hi> and <hi>Leocrates</hi> and <hi>Myro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides</hi>
               <pb n="547" facs="tcp:47090:359"/>
and <hi>Cimon</hi> and <hi>Tolmides</hi> and <hi>Thucydi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> were, he after the overthrow and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of <hi>Thucydides</hi> kept up his head ſtill for no leſs than fifteen years longer, and having gotten a place of command and power, which was but one among the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Magiſtracies (or Offices and places of Truſt, to which there was a new Election every year) he preſerv'd himſelf free and unprevail'd upon as to money or bribes.</p>
            <p>Though otherwiſe he was not altogether <note place="margin">His thrifty management of his own Eſtate.</note> idle or careleſs in looking after his own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, but as to his paternal and perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Eſtate, which of right belonged to him, he ſo order'd it, that it might neither through negligence be waſted or leſſen'd, nor yet, he being ſo full of buſineſs as he was, give him any great trouble or coſt him much time with taking care of it, and put it into ſuch a way of management as he thought to be the moſt eaſie for himſelf, and the moſt exact for thrift. For all his yearly products and profits he ſold together in a lump, and afterward buying every thing that he or his Family had or might have need of out of the Market, he by this means ſupplied the concerns of his Houſe as to ſuſtenance and proviſion.</p>

            <p>Now that he did well and wiſely in this <note place="margin">New troubles ariſe.</note> that he kept the force and power of the <hi>Athenians</hi> within the compaſs of <hi>Greece,</hi> the things and paſſages themſelves, that happen'd afterward, did bear ſufficient wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.

               </note> to ſee to, and having a gracefull car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and a ſhrewd wit into the bargain, kept company with a great many of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and wrought all thoſe who had to doe with her over to the <hi>Perſian</hi> King's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and by their means, being men of the greateſt power and quality, ſhe ſowed the ſeeds of the <hi>Median</hi> Faction up and down in ſeveral Cities.</p>
            <p>And for this <hi>Aſpaſia</hi> they ſay that ſhe <note place="margin">A ſhrewd Woman and much fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented.</note> was courted and careſſed by <hi>Pericles</hi> upon the account of her wiſedom and knowledge in State affairs. For <hi>Socrates</hi> himſelf would ſometimes go to viſit her and fome of his acquaintance with him, and thoſe who uſed her company would carry their Wives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with them to her, as it were to Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:47090:367"/>
to hear her diſcourſe, though by the way the Houſe ſhe kept was little other than a Vaulting School, ſhe being a <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nante</hi> of no modeſt or creditable imploy, but keeping a parcel of young Wenches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her who were no better than they ſhould be. Now, <hi>Aeſchines</hi> ſaith alſo that there was one <hi>Lyſicles</hi> a Graſier or Mutton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger, who of a great Clown and a piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Sneaksby, as naturally he was, did by keeping <hi>Aſpaſia</hi> company after <hi>Pericles</hi> his death, come to be a chief man among the people of <hi>Athens.</hi> And in a Book of <hi>Plato</hi>'s intitled <hi>Menexenus,</hi> though the firſt part of it is written with ſome pleaſantry and ſport, yet there is ſo much of Hiſtory in it, that ſhe was a Woman, with whom many of the <hi>Athenians</hi> convers'd and often reſorted to, as the common opinion was, upon the account of her Rhetorick and her abilities of Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>But I muſt needs ſay for <hi>Pericles</hi> his ſhare, that the inclination and fancy he had for her appears rather to have proceeded from the paſſion of love. For he had a Wife that <note place="margin">Pericles <hi>his former Wife.</hi>
               </note> was near of kin to him, who had been mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried formerly to <hi>Hipponicus,</hi> by whom ſhe had a Son <hi>Callias</hi> by name, ſirnamed the Rich; as alſo ſhe brought <hi>Pericles,</hi> while ſhe liv'd with him, two Sons, <hi>Xanthippus</hi> and <hi>Paralus.</hi> Afterwards when they could
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:47090:367"/>
not well agree nor like to live together, he parted with her, being willing and conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to it, to another man, and himſelf <note place="margin">

               </note> was that he propoſed to the Aſſembly the War againſt the <hi>Samians,</hi> and had it enac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted mainly in favour of the <hi>Mileſians</hi> upon the requeſt and intreaty of <hi>Aſpaſia.</hi> For

theſe two States waged a War for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery <note place="margin">The ground of it.</note> of <hi>Priene,</hi> and the <hi>Samians</hi> getting the better on't refuſed to lay down their Arms and to have the Controverſie betwixt them debated and decided before the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> as they ordered they ſhould, and to ſtand to their award.</p>
            <p>Wherefore <hi>Pericles</hi> furniſhing out a Fleet <note place="margin">Pericles <hi>changes their Government.</hi>
               </note> went and broke up the <hi>Oligarchy</hi> which was at <hi>Samos,</hi> (that is, the Government ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by ſome few of the Great ones) and <note place="margin">He takes Hoſtages of them.</note> taking fifty Hoſtages of the principal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Town and as many of their Children, he ſent them to the Iſle of <hi>Lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos,</hi> there to be kept.</p>
            <p>Though there are ſome do ſay that every <note place="margin">They proffer money.</note> one of thoſe Hoſtages did ſeverally proffer him a Talent a Head by way of ranſome, and that thoſe who had no mind to have a <hi>Democracy</hi> or popular Government in the City tendred him many other preſents. Moreover <hi>Piſſuthnes</hi> the <hi>Perſian,</hi> one of the King's Lord-Lieutenants, bearing ſome good will to the <hi>Samians,</hi> ſent him ten thouſand Piſtoles or pieces of Gold to excuſe the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Howbeit <hi>Pericles</hi> would receive none <note place="margin">He refuſeth it.</note> of all this, but after he had taken that courſe with the <hi>Samians,</hi> as he thought fit, and ſet up a Democracy among them, he ſail'd back to <hi>Athens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="566" facs="tcp:47090:369"/>
But they immediately revolted, <hi>Piſſuth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> 
               <note place="margin">They revolt.</note> having privily convey'd away their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtages for them, and provided themſelves with all things neceſſary for the War. Whereupon <hi>Pericles</hi> came out with a Fleet a ſecond time againſt them, whom he found not idle with their hands in their pockets, nor in a ſneaking poſture as if they were daunted at his coming, but altogether man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully reſolved to try for the dominion of the Sea.</p>
            <p>The iſſue of it all was, that after a brisk <note place="margin">They are bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in a Fight at Sea.</note> and ſharp Sea-fight about the Iſland called <hi>Tragia,</hi> (that is, the Iſle of Goats) <hi>Pericles</hi> obtain'd a gallant Victory, having with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and four Sail, took, routed and ſunk, threeſcore and ten of the Enemies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of twenty were Men of War.</p>
            <p>And together with his Victory and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit <note place="margin">They are block'd up in Town.</note> having made himſelf maſter of the Port or Harbour he laid Siege to the <hi>Samians,</hi> and block'd them up, who yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding for all that were ſo hardy and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous as to make ſallies out and fight un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the City-walls. But after that another greater Fleet, ſent as a freſh ſupply from <hi>Athens,</hi> was arrived, and that the <hi>Samians</hi> were now ſhut up with a cloſe Leaguer on every ſide, <hi>Pericles</hi> taking with him three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore <note place="margin">Pericles <hi>goes off with</hi> 60 <hi>Gallies.</hi>

            <p>But inaſmuch as it was a hard matter to keep in or hold back the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who were vexed at the delay, and were eagerly bent to fight, he dividing the whole mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude into eight parts or bodies of men, ordered the buſineſs by lot ſo, that that <note place="margin">He orders a Lottery by a white Bean.</note> part which had the <hi>white Bean</hi> ſhould have leave to feaſt and take their eaſe, while the other ſeven were buſie a fighting.

               </note> what it might be, is not ſo eaſie to find out. But that that Decree, we mentioned, was not repeal'd and annulled, all do alike charge
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:47090:375"/>
               <hi>Pericles</hi> with being the cauſe of that. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there are ſome who ſay that he did out of a great ſenſe and height of ſpirit ſtand it out ſtiffly with a reſolution for the beſt; accounting that the Precept and Order of thoſe Embaſſies was deſigned for a trial of their compliance and yieldingneſs, and that a conceſſion would be taken for a confeſſion of weakneſs, as if they durſt not doe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.

                  <hi>The likelieſt reaſon why</hi> Pericles <hi>hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred it.</hi>
               </note> charge of all, and which is confirmed by moſt witneſſes, we have in a manner ſuch an account as this given of it. <hi>Phidias</hi> the Plaſterer or Image-maker had, as hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore been ſaid, undertaken to make the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of <hi>Minerva.</hi> Now he being familiarly acquainted with <hi>Pericles,</hi> and a great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite of his, had many enemies upon his account, who envied and maligned him: who alſo, to make trial in a caſe of his, what kind of Judges the Commons would prove, ſhould there be occaſion to bring <note place="margin">Phidias <hi>a favourite of</hi> Pericles <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed by</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</note> 
               <hi>Pericles</hi> himſelf before them, having tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with <hi>Menon</hi> one who had wrought with <hi>Phidias,</hi> they place him in the Court
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:47090:375"/>
with a Petition, deſiring publick ſecurity upon his diſcovery and impeachment of <hi>Phidias</hi> for things done by him againſt the State. The people admitting of the man to tell his ſtory, and the proſecution being agreed upon in the Aſſembly, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of theft or cheat charged againſt him. For <hi>Phidias</hi> had immediately from the very firſt beginning ſo wrought and wrapt the Gold, that was uſed in the work, about the Statue, and that by the advice of <hi>Pericles,</hi> that they might take it all off and make out the juſt weight of it; which <hi>Pericles</hi> alſo at that time bade the accuſers to doe.</p>
            <p>But the glory and reputation of his <note place="margin">His main crime, the rarity of his Work.</note> Works was that which burthen'd <hi>Phidias</hi> and cruſh'd him with envy; eſpecially this, that where he repreſents the Fight of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazons</hi> upon the Goddeſſes Shield, he had expreſs'd a kind of Figure or reſemblance of himſelf like a bald old man holding aloft a great Stone with both hands; and had put in a very fine Picture of <hi>Pericles</hi> fighting with an <hi>Amazon.</hi> And the faſhion and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of the Hand which held out the Spear, over againſt <hi>Pericles</hi> his Face, was with that curious art contrived, as if it meant to hide the likeneſs, which by the by ſhew'd it ſelf on either ſide.</p>
            <p>Well! poor <hi>Phidias</hi> was carried away to <note place="margin">He is ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to Priſon and there dies.</note> Priſon, and there died of a Diſeaſe or ſome
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:47090:376"/>
other Sickneſs; but, as ſome ſay, of Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to raiſe a ſlander or a ſuſpicion at leaſt upon <hi>Pericles,</hi> though it were by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement and preparation of his enemies.</p>
            <p>As to the Informer <hi>Menon,</hi> upon <hi>Glycon</hi>'s <note place="margin">Menon<hi>'s reward.</hi>
               </note> propoſal, the people made him free from payment of Taxes and Cuſtoms, and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Commanders to take care of the man's ſafety, that no body might doe him any harm.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Aſpaſia</hi> was indited of <note place="margin">Aſpaſia <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached.</hi>
               </note> Impiety or Irreligion, upon the complaint of <hi>Hermippus</hi> a writer of Comedies, who alſo laid further to her charge, that ſhe was Bawd to <hi>Pericles</hi> and entertained Citizens Wives and Daughters for his uſe. And <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pithes</hi> propoſed a Decree, that information ſhould be given in againſt ſuch perſons as deny a Deity, and thoſe who teach or make Diſcourſes concerning Meteors and other appearances in the Sky; by theſe laſt words reaching <hi>Pericles</hi> a box on the ear over <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naxagoras</hi> his ſhoulder.</p>
            <p>The people receiving and admitting all <note place="margin">Pericles <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to bring in his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.</hi>
               </note> accuſations and complaints, as they came, at length by this means they came to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act a Decree, at the motion of <hi>Dracontides,</hi> that <hi>Pericles</hi> ſhould bring in the accounts of the Moneys he had expended, and lodge them with the <hi>Prytanes,</hi> the Magiſtrates and Judges of the Treaſury; and that the
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:47090:376"/>
Judges carrying their ſuffrage from the Altar ſhould examine and determine the buſineſs in the City. This indeed <hi>Agnon</hi> 
               <note place="margin">This order put into ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral terms.</note> took out of the Decree, but moved that cauſes ſhould be tried before the 1500 Judges, whether one would name it an action of robbery, or of bribery, or of any whatever injuſtice.</p>
            <p>As to <hi>Aſpaſia, Pericles</hi> made ſhift to beg <note place="margin">Aſpaſia <hi>begg'd off by</hi> Pericles.</note> her off, having ſhed abundance of tears at the Trial, as <hi>Aeſchines</hi> makes the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and beſought the Judges in her behalf. But fearing how it might go with <hi>Anaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>He ſends a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> Anaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras.</note> he ſent him away and brought him onward on his way out of the City. And whereas he had in <hi>Phidias</hi> his caſe miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried and found the people awkward and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, being afraid of a Court of Judges, <note place="margin">He promotes the War.</note> he ſet fire to the War, which hitherto had lingered and ſmothered, and blew it up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a flame; hoping by that means to ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thoſe miſts of impeachments which they were raiſing againſt him, and to lower that envy which hung over him; the City uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally throwing her ſelf upon him alone and truſting to his ſole conduct, upon the ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of great affairs and publick dangers, by reaſon of his authority and the ſway he bore.</p>
            <p>And theſe are given out to have been the cauſes, for which <hi>Pericles</hi> would not ſuffer
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:47090:377"/>
the people of <hi>Athens</hi> to comply with the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> or yield to their propoſals. However the truth of it, whether it were ſo or no, cannot be well known.</p>

But the buſineſs prov'd quite contrary to what thoſe who ſent this meſſage expected. For inſtead of bringing <hi>Pericles</hi> under a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion <note place="margin">It doth not ſucceed.</note> and a reproach, they brought him into a far greater credit and eſteem with his Citizens, as a man whom their Enemies did moſt mightily hate and fear.

having been one anothers Gueſts at ſome time or other) or out of purpoſe to give his enemies an occaſion of traducing and ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king evil of him, that then he did freely beſtow upon the State all that his Land and Houſes in the Country to be imploy'd in the publick uſe and ſervice.</p>
            <p>Well, the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> together with <note place="margin">

However <hi>Pericles</hi> was not at all moved by any of theſe practices of theirs, but took all patiently, and in ſilence underwent the diſgrace they threw upon him and the ill will they bore him. And ſending out a <note place="margin">Pericles <hi>ſends out a Fleet to the Enemies Country.</hi>
               </note> Fleet of a hundred Sail to <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> he did not go along with it in perſon, but ſtaid behind, that he might look after home and keep the City in order, till the <hi>Peloponneſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ſhould break up Camp and be gone. Yet to court and careſs the common people, who were jaded and in diſorder about the War, he reliev'd and refreſh'd them with <note place="margin">He divides Moneys and Lands among the people.</note> diſtributions of publick moneys, and made a Law for the diviſion of Lands by lot and
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:47090:379"/>
the plantation of Colonies. For having turn'd out all the people of <hi>Aegina,</hi> he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Iſland among the <hi>Athenians,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as their lot fell.</p>
            <p>And it was ſome comfort to them and <note place="margin">The Enemies ſufferings equal to theirs.</note> eaſe in their miſeries, even from what things their enemies endured. For they in the Fleet ſailing round the <hi>Peloponneſe,</hi> ravaged a great deal of the Country, and pillaged and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the Towns and ſmaller Cities. And by Land he himſelf went with an Army into the <hi>Megarian</hi> Country, and made ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock of it all. By which means it appears, that the <hi>Peloponneſians,</hi> though they did the <hi>Athenians</hi> a world of miſchief by Land, yet ſuffering as much themſelves from them by Sea, would not have drawn out the War to ſuch a length, but would quickly have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it over, as <hi>Pericles</hi> at firſt foretold they would, had not ſome divine power croſt humane purpoſes.</p>
            <p>Now in the firſt place there was a peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential <note place="margin">A great Plague breaks out.</note> Diſeaſe or Murrain, that ſeiz'd upon the City and ate up all the flower and prime of their youth and ſtrength. Upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of which Diſtemper, the people, being afflicted in their Souls as well as in their Bodies, were utterly inraged like Madmen againſt <hi>Pericles,</hi> and in the ſame nature as Patients being grown delirious in a high
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:47090:379"/>
Fever uſe to behave themſelves toward their Phyſician or be it their Father, were ready to fall foul upon him and doe him a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. For it had been buzz'd in their ears <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The cauſe of it imputed to</hi> Pericles.</note> by his enemies, as if he were in the fault, perſwading them that the occaſion of the Plague was the crowding of ſo many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try people together into Town; in that they were forced now in the Summer time in the heat of the weather to dwell a many of them together higgledy piggledy in piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full little Tenements and ſultry Hovels, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſtifle them; and to be tied to a lazy courſe of life within doors, when as before they lived in a pure, open and free air. The cauſe and authour of all this, ſaid they, is he, who upon the account of the War hath poured a multitude of people from the Country in upon us within the Walls, and puts ſo many men as he has here upon no imploy or ſervice, but keeps them pent up like Cattel in a pound, and lets them be overrun with infection from one another, affording them neither ſhift of quarters nor any refreſhment.</p>
            <p>He deſigning to remedy theſe things, <note place="margin">He goes out with a great Fleet.</note> and withall to doe the enemy ſome incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, got a hundred and fifty ſail of Ships ready and fill'd them with men, and having imbarked a many ſtout Souldiers both Foot and Horſe was about to weigh
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:47090:380"/>
Anchor, giving great incouragement of hope to his Citizens and no leſs an alarm of fear to his Enemies, upon the ſight of ſo great a force. And now the Veſſels having their complement of men, and <hi>Pericles</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gone aboard the Admiral his own Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, it happened that the Sun was in an <note place="margin">An Eclipſe of the Sun happens.</note> Eclipſe and it grew dark on a ſudden, to the extreme affrightment of them all, looking upon it as a diſmal token and an unlucky ill-boding <hi>Omen.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Pericles</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving <note place="margin">His device to cure the Pilot of his fear.</note> the Pilot or Steerſman ſeis'd with a great fear and at a ſtand what to doe, he took his Cloak and put it before the man's Face, and muffling him up in it that he could not ſee, he ask'd him whether he did imagine there was any dreadfull thing or great hurt in this that he had done to him, or whether he thought it was the ſign of any hurt; he anſwering, No; <hi>Why?</hi> ſaid he, <hi>and what does that there differ from this, onely that that which hath cauſed that dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs there, is ſomething greater than a Cloak?</hi> But theſe are things fit to be diſcourſed in the Schools of Philoſophy.</p>
            <p>Well, <hi>Pericles,</hi> after he had put out to Sea, as he ſeems not to have done any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exploit befitting ſuch an apparade and equipage; ſo when he had beſieged the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">
                  <hi>He beſiegeth</hi> Epidaurus, <hi>but miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi>
               </note> City <hi>Epidaurus,</hi> which gave him ſome hope as if it would or might be taken, he
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:47090:380"/>
miſcarried in his deſign by reaſon of the Sickneſs. For it did not onely ſeiſe upon the <hi>Athenians</hi> and deſtroy them, but alſo without any difference any others that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any occaſion mix'd with them or had ought to doe in the Army it carried them off too for company.</p>
            <p>After this finding that the <hi>Athenians</hi> were <note place="margin">He cajoles the people in vain.</note> very ill affected towards and highly diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with him, he tried and indeavoured what he could to appeaſe them by giving them good words and to reincourage their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in him. But he could not pacifie or allay their anger, nor perſwade them to any thing or prevail with them any way, till they freely paſt their Votes upon him, and taking the ſtaff into their own hands <note place="margin">He is turn'd out of Office and fined.</note> they took away his command from him and fined him in a round ſum of money; which by their account that ſay leaſt was fifteen Talents, and they which reckon moſt name fifty. Now he who was ſet down at his Trial to be his Accuſer, was <hi>Cleon,</hi> as <hi>Idomeneus</hi> tells us; but <hi>Simmias,</hi> according to <hi>Theophraſtus;</hi> and <hi>Heraclides Ponticus</hi> has named <hi>Lacratidas</hi> for the man.</p>
            <p>After this the publick heats and affairs too might quickly come to a repoſe and be at quiet, the Commonalty having diſcharged <note place="margin">His domeſtick misfortunes.</note> their ſpleen and paſſion upon him (as Waſps
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:47090:381"/>
do their ſting) together with the mortal wound they gave him. But his private domeſtick concerns were in a wretched un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward condition, he having loſt not a few of his Friends and acquaintance in the plague time, and thoſe of his Family having long ſince been in diſorder and in a kind of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny againſt him. For the eldeſt of his law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <note place="margin">His eldeſt Son's quarrel to him.</note> begotten Sons, <hi>Xanthippus</hi> by name, being both by nature given to expenſe, and marrying a young and coſtly Dame, the Daughter of <hi>Iſander</hi> (who was the Son of <hi>Epilycus)</hi> was highly offended at his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's niggardly thrift, making him but a ſcanty bare allowance, and giving it him by little and little at a time. Wherefore he ſent to a Friend one day and borrow'd ſome money of him, in his Father <hi>Pericles</hi> name, pretending it was by his order. But the man coming afterward to demand the debt, <hi>Pericles</hi> was ſo far from yielding to pay it, that he arreſted the man and entred an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt him. Upon which the young man <hi>Xanthippus</hi> thought himſelf ſo hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly uſed and highly diſobliged, that he openly reviled his Father.</p>
            <p>And firſt by way of droll and raillery <note place="margin">He abuſeth his Father with ſtories.</note> he ridicul'd him by telling ſtories, what his carriages and converſations were at home, and what kind of diſcourſes he had with the Sophiſters and Scholars that came to his
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:47090:381"/>
Houſe. As for inſtance, how, <hi>Epitimius</hi> 
               <note place="margin">A Law caſe about the death of a Horſe.</note> the <hi>Pharſalian</hi> (one who was a practiſer of all the five Games of Skill) having with a Dart or Javelin unawares againſt his will ſtruck and kill'd a Horſe that ſtood in the way, his Father ſpent a whole day with <hi>Protagoras</hi> in a ſerious and learned diſpute, whether the Javelin or the Man that threw it or the Maſters of the Game, who appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted theſe Sports, were according to the ſtricteſt and beſt reaſon to be accounted the cauſe of this miſchance or Horſe-ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: whereas, and make the worſt of it, it was but chance-medley. Further, beſide this, <hi>Steſimbrotus</hi> tells us, that it was <hi>Xan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thippus</hi> ſelf, who ſpread abroad among the people that infamous ſtory concerning his own Wife, how his Father ſhould make him Cuckold: and that this untoward grudge of the young man's againſt his Father, and unnatural breach betwixt them, which was never to be healed or made up, continued with him till his very dying day. For <hi>Xanthippus</hi> died in the Plague-time of the Sickneſs.</p>
            <p>At which time <hi>Pericles</hi> alſo loſt his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <note place="margin">Pericles <hi>his loſs of friends by death.</hi>
               </note> and the greateſt part of his Kinsfolks and Friends, and thoſe who had been moſt uſefull and ſerviceable to him in managing the affairs of State. However he did not ſhrink or give out upon theſe occaſions, nor <note place="margin">His unconcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedneſs.</note>
               <pb n="592" facs="tcp:47090:382"/>
did he betray or lower his high ſpirit and the greatneſs of his mind under all his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes and thoſe calamities which befell him. Nay, ſo unconcern'd and ſo great a maſter of his paſſions he was or at leaſt ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be, that he was never known to weep or to mourn and pay the Funeral Rites to any of his dead Friends, nor was ſo much as ſeen at the Burial of any of his Relations, till at laſt he loſt the onely Son which was left of thoſe who were lawfully begotten, his Son <hi>Paralus.</hi> This touch'd <note place="margin">His younger Son's death troubles him.</note> him home and made him bow and relent; and yet he ſtriv'd what he could to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his principle of gravity and to preſerve and keep up the greatneſs of his Soul: but all would not doe; for when he came to perform the ceremony of putting a Garland or Chaplet of Flowers upon the Head of the Corps, he was vanquiſhed by his paſſion at the ſight, ſo that he burſt out a crying and pour'd forth abundance of tears, having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver done any ſuch thing in all the reſt of his life before.</p>
            <p>After all, the City having made trial of <note place="margin">He is invited again to the Government.</note> other Generals for the conduct of War and Oratours for buſineſs of State, when they found there was no one who was of weight enough to counterballance ſuch a charge, or of authority ſufficient to be truſted with
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:47090:382"/>
ſo great a Command; then they hankerd after their old Friend and Servant <hi>Pericles,</hi> and ſolemnly invited him to the Tribunal or pleading place, and deſired him to accept of the Office of General or Commander in chief again. He was then in a very penſive condition, and kept in at home, as a cloſe Mourner; but was perſwaded by <hi>Alcibia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> and others of his Friends to come abroad and ſhew himſelf to the people: who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving upon his appearance made their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments and apologized for their ingratitude and untowardly uſage of him, he undertook the publick affairs once more, <note place="margin">He under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes it.</note> and being choſen <hi>Praetor</hi> or chief Governour, he brought in a Bill that the Statute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Baſtard-iſſue, which he himſelf had formerly cauſed to be made, might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed: that ſo the name and race or off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of his Family might not, for want of a lawfull Heir to ſucceed, be wholly and utterly loſt and extinguiſhed.</p>
            <p>Now the buſineſs of that Statute or Law <note place="margin">The Law of Baſtardy.</note> ſtood thus. <hi>Pericles</hi> when long ago he flouriſhed in the State and had (as hath been ſaid) Children lawfully begotten, propoſed a Law that thoſe onely ſhould be reputed true Citizens of <hi>Athens,</hi> who were born of ſuch Parents as were both <hi>Athenians.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">An Inſtance of its incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience.</note> this the King of <hi>Egypt</hi> having ſent to the Commons, by way of preſent, forty
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:47090:383"/>
thouſand Buſhels of Wheat, which were to be diſtributed and ſhared out among the Citizens, there ſprung up a great many Actions and Suits againſt Baſtards, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that Edict, which till that time had not been known, nor taken notice of; and ſeveral perſons beſides were trepann'd and inſnar'd by falſe accuſations. There were little leſs than five thouſand, who were caught in this State-trap, and having loſt the freedom of the City were ſold for Slaves; and thoſe who induring the teſt remained in the Government and paſt muſter for right <hi>Athenians,</hi> were found upon the Poll to be fourteen thouſand and forty perſons in number.</p>
            <p>Now though it look'd ſomewhat odd and ſtrange, <note place="margin">Pericles <hi>his propoſal to repeal it.</hi>
               </note> that a Law, which had been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on ſo far againſt ſo many people, ſhould be broken and cancell'd again by the ſame man that made it; yet the preſent ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity and diſtreſs, which <hi>Pericles</hi> labour'd under as to his Family, broke through all objections and prevail'd with the <hi>Athenians</hi> to pity him, as one who by thoſe loſſes and misfortunes had ſufficiently been puniſhed for his former arrogance and haughtineſs. And therefore being of opinion, that he had been ſhrewdly handled by divine venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of which he had run ſo ſevere a Gant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop, and that his requeſt was ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:47090:383"/>
a man to ask and men to grant; they yielded that he ſhould inroll his Baſtard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <note place="margin">His Baſtard Son legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated.</note> in the regiſter of his own Ward by his paternal name. This very Son of his after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, when he had defeated the <hi>Pelopon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſians</hi> in a Sea-fight near the Iſlands called <hi>Arginuſae,</hi> was put to death by the people together with his fellow-Captains, his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues in that Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>About that time, when his Son was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll'd, <note place="margin">Pericles <hi>is ſick of the Plague.</hi>
               </note> it ſhould ſeem, the Plague ſeis'd <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricles,</hi> not with ſharp and violent fits, as it did others that had it, but with a dull and lingring Diſtemper, through various changes and alterations, leiſurely by little and little waſting the ſtrength of his Body, and undermining the noble faculties of his Soul. So that <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> in his Morals, having made a moot-point, Whether mens Manners change with their Fortunes, and their Souls being jogg'd and diſturb'd by the ailings of their Bodies do ſtart aſide from the rules of Vertue; hath left it upon record, that <hi>Pericles,</hi> when he was ſick, ſhew'd one of his Friends that came to viſit him an Amulet or Charm, that the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men <note place="margin">Wears an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulet about his Neck.</note> had hung about his Neck; as much as to ſay, that he was very ſick indeed, when he would admit of or indure ſuch a foolery as that was.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="596" facs="tcp:47090:384"/>
When he was drawing on and near his time, the beſt of the Citizens and thoſe of his Friends, who were left alive, ſitting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, were diſcourſing of his Vertue <note place="margin">As his Friends were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing of him,</note> and Authority, how great it was, and were reckoning up his famous Actions and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements and the number of his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; for there were no leſs than nine Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies, which he as their chief Commander and Conquerer of their Enemies had ſet up for the honour of the City and State. Theſe things they talk'd of together among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as though he did not underſtand or mind what they ſaid, but had been utterly bereft of his ſenſes. But he had liſtned all <note place="margin">He overhears them and makes a worthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</note> the while and given good heed to all the paſſages of their diſcourſe, and ſpeaking out among them ſaid, that he wondred they ſhould commend and take notice of thoſe things in him, which were as much owing to Fortune as to any thing elſe, and had happen'd to many other Captains in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times as well as to him; and that at the ſame time they ſhould not ſpeak or make mention of that which was the moſt excellent and greateſt thing of all. <hi>For,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>there was never any of all my Fellow-Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens that ever wore Black or put on Mourning upon my account or long of me:</hi> meaning that he had not in all his Government been the cauſe of any ones death, either by ordering or procuring it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="597" facs="tcp:47090:384"/>
A brave Man, a wonderfull great Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, <note place="margin">An Encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um of him.</note> without all peradventure! not onely upon the account of his gentle behaviour and mild temper, which all along in the many affairs of his life and thoſe ſhrewd animoſities which lay upon him he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly kept up and maintain'd, but alſo of his generous great ſpirit and high ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he eſteem'd that to be the beſt of all his good qualities, that having been in ſuch an abſolute uncontrollable power, as he had had, he never had gratified his envy or his paſſion in any thing to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man's hurt, nor ever had treated any enemy of his, as if he were incurable, that is, unreconcileable and one who in time might not become a friend. And to me it <note place="margin">
                  <hi>His good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities made him deſerve the title of</hi> Olympius.</note> appears that this one thing of him did make that otherwiſe childiſh and arrogant Title they gave him in Nicknaming him <hi>Olympi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> (that is, the Heavenly or Godlike) to be without envy and truly becoming him; I mean his kind and courteous carriage and a pure and untainted unblemiſh'd converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the height of power and place: Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thoſe apprehenſions and reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we have of the Gods themſelves in their kind; whom, upon this account that they are naturally the authours of all good things and are not the authours of any evil, we do think worthy to rule and govern the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="598" facs="tcp:47090:385"/>
Not as the Poets rudely fancy, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding us with their fooliſh unmannerly <note place="margin">The Poets miſtake who aſcribe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to the Gods.</note> conceits and opinions, are taken tardy in their own Poems and fictious Stories, when they call the place indeed wherein they ſay the Gods make their abode, a ſecure and quiet ſeat, free from all hazards and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, not troubled with Winds, nor darkned with Clouds; but at all times alike ſhining round about with a ſoft ſerenity and a pure light, inaſmuch as ſuch a temper'd ſtation is moſt agreeable and ſutable for a bleſſed and immortal nature to live in: and yet in the mean while do affirm that the Gods themſelves are full of trouble and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and anger and other paſſions, which no way become or belong to even Men that have any underſtanding. But this will perhaps ſeem a ſubject fitter for ſome other conſideration, and that ought to be treated of in ſome other place.</p>
            <p>Well! the ſucceſs of publick affairs after <note place="margin">Pericles <hi>is miſt after his death.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Pericles</hi> his death did beget a quick and ſpeedy ſenſe of his loſs, and a want and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of ſuch a conduct as his had been.

nature ſuch a diſpoſition as his was, either more moderate and reaſonable in the height of that ſtate he took upon him, or more grave and ſolemn in the methods of that mildneſs which he uſed. And that invidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <note place="margin">His ſeeming Arbitrarineſs excuſed and commended.</note> pretended arbitrary power, about which they made ſuch a ſplutter and formerly gave it the name of Monarchy and Tyranny, did then appear to have been the chief ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part and bulwark of ſafety, which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Commonwealth had. So great a corruption and murrain and ſuch abundance of wicked ill humours had got into publick affairs, which he by kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them weak and low did cover and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe from being much taken notice of, and by ſnubbing of them did hinder them from growing incurable through a licentious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity.</p>

               <abbr>Eſq</abbr>

            <p>HAving related the memorable acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Pericles,</hi> let us now proceed to the Life of <hi>Fabius.</hi> It is ſaid, that the firſt of the name was a Son of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi> and of a Nymph, or ſome Woman of that Country, who brought him forth on the banks of <hi>Tyber,</hi> and that he was a Perſon famous and powerfull in <hi>Rome:</hi> Others will have it, that they were firſt called <hi>Fodians,</hi> becauſe the Race of them
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:47090:388"/>
delighted in digging pit-falls for wild Beaſts, and that in proceſs of time, and by corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of language, they grew to be called <hi>Fabians.</hi> But theſe things be they true or falſe, certain it is, that this Family hath for a long time yielded great ſtore of eminent Perſons; Our <hi>Fabius,</hi> who was fourth in deſcent from that <hi>Fabius Rutilianus,</hi> who firſt brought the honourable ſirname of <hi>Maximus</hi> into his Family, was alſo by way of nick-name called <hi>Verrucoſus</hi> from a Wart on his upper Lip, and in his Childhood they in like manner named him <hi>Ovicula,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his extreme mildneſs of Nature. His ſlowneſs in ſpeaking, his long labour and pains in learning, his little concern in the ſports and divertiſements of his equals, his eaſie ſubmiſſion to every body, as if he had no will of his own, made thoſe who judged ſuperficially of him (the number of which ſort of Judges is always the greateſt) eſteem him inſenſible and ſtupid; And few were they, who could penetrate into the firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Courage, and greatneſs of his Mind. But as ſoon as he came into Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, his Vertues exerted and ſhewed themſelves; his reputed Dulneſs did then appear to be the ſteddineſs, and intrepid bravery of his Soul; his ſlowneſs in words, and actions, to be the effect of a conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Prudence, which always laid them by,
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:47090:388"/>
till they were thoroughly ripe; and his ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie compliance to the bent of others, to be a noble pride of his heart, thinking it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath him to contend about trifles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fabius,</hi> conſidering that the grandieur <note place="margin">Fabius <hi>by generous pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes aſpires to renown.</hi>
               </note> of <hi>Rome</hi> proceeded from Military Vertue, and was by the ſame means to be preſerved, did therefore inure his Body to labour and exerciſe, wiſely judging, that natural ſtrength was the beſt Armour: He alſo trained him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Art of Speaking and Perſwading; For words and diſcourſes are the Engines, by which Minds are moved; And he attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſuch a kind of Eloquence, that his manner of ſpeaking, and of acting was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly the ſame; for although it had not much of Ornament, nor Artifice, yet there was in it great weight of Senſe; it was ſtrong and ſententious; much after the way of <hi>Thucydides.</hi> We have yet extant his Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Oration upon the death of his Son, who died Conſul, which he recited before the People.</p>
            <p>He was five times Conſul, and in his firſt Conſulſhip he had the honour of a Triumph for the Victory he gained upon the Liguri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, whom he defeated in a ſet Battel, and drove them to take ſhelter in the <hi>Alpes,</hi> from whence they never after made any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>road, nor depredation upon their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. After this <hi>Hannibal</hi> came into <hi>Italy,</hi>
               <pb n="604" facs="tcp:47090:389"/>
who at his firſt entrance having gained a great Battel near the River <hi>Trebia,</hi> travers'd <note place="margin">Hannibal<hi>'s firſt prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous march into</hi> Italy.</note> all Tuſcany with his victorious Army, and deſolating the Country round about, fill'd <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf with aſtoniſhment and terrour. Beſides unuſual Thunder and Lightning then happening, the report of ſeveral ill-boding Portents did much increaſe this popular conſternation. For it was ſaid, that ſome Targets did ſweat Bloud; that at <hi>Antium,</hi> when they reap'd their Corn, many of the Ears were fill'd with Bloud; that it had rained Fire; that the Phalerians had ſeen the Heavens open and ſeveral Scrolls in form of Lots falling down, in one of which it was plainly writ, <hi>Now</hi> Mars <hi>himſelf does brandiſh his Arms.</hi> But theſe Prodigies had no effect upon the impetuous and fiery temper of the Conſul <hi>Flaminius,</hi> whoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural promptneſs had been much heightned by his late Victory over the Gauls, though he fought them contrary to the order of the Senate and the advice of his Collegue: ſo that nothing would ſatisfie him but a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel with <hi>Hannibal. Fabius</hi> on the other ſide thought it not ſeaſonable to engage with the Enemy; not that he much regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thoſe talk'd of Prodigies, which he took to be either fictitious or caſual; but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Carthaginian Army was in a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting condition, without a poſſibility of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits,
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:47090:389"/>
without Magazines, the Souldier un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid; ſo that their onely hope and ſafety was in a Battel: But if let alone, watch'd and obſerved, the neighbouring Garriſons in the mean time being well ſecur'd and the Roman Allies defended, their vigour would ſoon expire, like a Flame for want of Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Theſe weighty reaſons prevail'd not with <hi>Flaminius,</hi> who proteſted, he would <note place="margin">Fabius<hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual to move</hi> Flaminius.</note> never ſuffer that the Enemy ſhould advance one ſtep farther, and that he would not be reduc'd, like <hi>Camillus</hi> in former time, to fight for <hi>Rome</hi> within the Walls of <hi>Rome.</hi> Accordingly he ordered the Tribunes to draw out the Army into the Field; and as he would not be diſſwaded by the reaſons of his Collegue from this precipitous reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, ſo neither was he deterr'd by an ill preſaging accident which befell him at his ſetting forth; for he no ſooner got on Horſeback, but the Beaſt fell into ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a fit of trembling and bounding that he caſt his Rider headlong on the ground. This notwithſtanding, away he marcheth up to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who was poſted near the Lake <hi>Traſimena</hi> in Tuſcany. And it is to be obſerv'd, that during the ingagement, there hapned ſo great an Earthquake, that it deſtroyed ſeveral Towns, altered the courſe of Rivers, tore off the tops of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, yet ſuch was the eagerneſs of the
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:47090:390"/>
Combatants, that they were ſenſible of no other concuſſion or agitation, but what themſelves made.</p>
            <p>In this Battel <hi>Flaminius</hi> fell, having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <note place="margin">He dies cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageouſly.</note> many proofs of his ſtrength and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and round about him lay all the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt of the Army: In the whole fifteen thouſand were killed, and as many made priſoners. <hi>Hannibal,</hi> deſirous to beſtow Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Honours upon the Body of <hi>Flaminius,</hi> made diligent ſearch after it, but could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver find what became of it. Though the loſs was ſo conſiderable, yet there was no art uſed to diſſemble it at <hi>Rome;</hi> as there had been, upon the former Ingagement near <hi>Trebia;</hi> for then, neither the General who writ, nor the Expreſs who told the news, related it otherwiſe than as a drawn Battel, with equal loſs on either ſide: But now, as ſoon as <hi>Pomponius</hi> the Pretor had the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, he cauſed the People to aſſemble, and without diſguiſing the matter, told them plainly, <hi>We are beaten (O Romans) our Army is defeated, the Conſul</hi> Flaminius <hi>is kill'd; think therefore, what is to be done for your ſafety.</hi> The ſame commotion, which a furious Wind doth cauſe in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean, did theſe words of the Pretor raiſe in the minds of ſo vaſt a Multitude: But the rage of their grief being a little over, the danger at hand did at laſt awaken their
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:47090:390"/>
judgments into a reſolution to chuſe a Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatour, who by the Sovereign authority of his Office, and by his perſonal capacity of wiſedom and courage might be able to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the publick affairs, become almoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate, and to ſit at Helm in ſo great a Storm. Their choice unanimouſly fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Fabius <hi>by general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent choſen Dictatour.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Fabius,</hi> in whom was joyned a vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable gravity of manners with a ſpirit not to be daunted with any difficulty or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; whoſe Age was ſo far advanced as to give him Experience, without taking from him the vigour of Action; ſo that his Body could execute what his Soul deſigned; and in him was the happy mixture of Caution and Boldneſs. <hi>Fabius</hi> being thus inſtalled in the Office of Dictatour, in the firſt place he gave the Command of the Horſe to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius Minutius;</hi> and next he asked leave of the Senate for himſelf, that in time of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel he might ſerve on Horſeback, which by an ancient Law amongſt the Romans was forbid to their Generals; whether it were, that placing their greateſt ſtrength in their Foot, they would have their Commanders in chief poſted amongſt them, or elſe to let them know, that how great ſoever their authority were, the People and Senate were ſtill their Maſters, of whom they muſt ask leave. But then again, to make the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his Charge more awfull, and to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:47090:391"/>
the People more ſubmiſs and obedient to him, he cauſed himſelf to be accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with four and twenty Lictours; and when the Conſul came to viſit him, he ſent him word, that at his audience he ſhould diſmiſs his Lictours with their Faſces (the enſigns of authority) and appear before him onely as a private perſon.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſolemn action of his Dictature <note place="margin">His zeal for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious duties.</note> was to order publick Prayers to be made to the Gods, and to admoniſh the People, that their late overthrow did not befall them through want of courage in their Souldiers, but through the neglect of Divine Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in the General. He therefore exhorted them not to fear the Enemy, but by extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary honour to appeaſe the Gods. This he did, not to fill their minds with ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, but onely to raiſe their courage, and leſſen in them the fear of the Enemy, by making them believe, that Heaven was on their ſide. In order hereunto the Siby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Books were conſulted, in which they conceived, the ſecrets of deſtiny and future events were to be learnt; but whoever look'd into them, was under a tye of ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy not to reveal what they found. After this he aſſembled the People, and made a Vow before them to offer in Sacrifice the whole product of the next Seaſon all <hi>Italy</hi> over, of the Cows, Goats, Swine, Sheep,
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:47090:391"/>
both in the Mountains and the Plains; and the more to ſolemnize this great Vow, he commanded the preciſe ſum of 333 Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterces, and 333 Pence, and one third of a Peny to be expended upon feſtival Games in honour of the Gods. What his myſtery might be in that number is not eaſie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, unleſs it were in regard of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the number of three, as being the firſt of odd numbers, the firſt that contains in it ſelf multiplication, with all the other properties belonging to any whatſoever Number beſides.</p>
            <p>In this manner <hi>Fabius</hi> having raiſed the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>He prudently manages the War with</hi> Hannibal.</note> hearts of the People, by making them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the Gods took their part, and by the ſame means having made them ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and pliant to his will, he, for his own part, placed his whole confidence in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, believing that the Gods beſtowed vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and good fortune onely upon the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and the prudent. Thus prepar'd, he ſet forth to oppoſe <hi>Hannibal,</hi> not with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to fight him, but to wait upon him, to ſtraiten his Quarters, to cut off his Proviſions, and by ſo doing to make his victorious Army molder away, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume with penury and want. With this deſign he always incamp'd on the higheſt grounds, where their Horſe could have no acceſs to him. He ſtill kept pace with
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:47090:392"/>
them; when they marched he followed them; when they incamped he did the ſame, but at ſuch a diſtance as not to be compell'd to an Ingagement, and always keeping upon the Hills, free from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults of their Horſe; by which means he gave them no reſt, but kept them in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Alarm.</p>
            <p>But this his dilatory fencing way gave occaſion both at <hi>Rome,</hi> and even in his own Camp, to ſuſpect his want of Courage; and this opinion prevail'd alſo in <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Army, who was himſelf the onely man who was not deceived, and who clearly ſaw his own Ruine in his Enemy's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. Wherefore he reſolved with all the <note place="margin">Hannibal <hi>politickly provokes the Romans to engage.</hi>
               </note> arts and ſubtilties of War to break his Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and to bring <hi>Fabius</hi> to an Ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; like a cunning Wreſtler, who wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth every opportunity to get good hold and cloſe with his Adverſary. Sometimes he draws up his men to the very intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Enemy, reproaching the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans with their Cowardiſe, ſo to exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and incenſe them againſt their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; then again he makes a retreat to a good diſtance, that ſo he might draw them out to fall upon his Rere. At other times in ſight of the Roman Camp he waſtes and burns the Countries round, to increaſe the clamour of the People againſt <hi>Fabius.</hi> All
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:47090:392"/>
this artifice though it had no effect upon the firmneſs and conſtancy of the Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, yet upon the common Souldier, and even upon the General of the Horſe himſelf it had too great an operation: For this <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius,</hi> began to have a contempt of the General and his way of proceeding, which he miſconſtrued to be a timorous cuncta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo that in his harangues he humou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Souldiery in their mad fondneſs of coming to a Battel, and in their ſcorn and reproaches which they caſt upon <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi> calling him the Pedagogue of <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal;</hi> ſince he did nothing elſe but follow him up and down, and look and wait upon him. At the ſame time they cried up <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius</hi> for the onely Captain, worthy to command the Romans, whoſe vanity and preſumption did thereupon ſwell to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that he inſolently rallied <hi>Fabius</hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campments upon the Mountains, ſaying, that he lodged them there, as on a Theatre, to behold the flames and deſolation of their Country. And in his vain fit he would ſometimes ask the very Friends and Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks of the General, Whether it were not his meaning by ſo leading them from Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to Mountain, to carry them at laſt (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no hopes on Earth) up into Heaven, and hide them in the Clouds from <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>'s Army? When his Friends related theſe
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:47090:393"/>
things to the Dictatour, perſwading him that, to avoid the general obloquy, and the danger that might thereupon enſue, he would ingage the Enemy; his anſwer was, <hi>I ſhould be more faint-hearted than they make me, if through fear of idle reproaches, I ſhould abandon my own reaſon. It is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious thing to have fear for the ſafety of our Country. That man is not fit to rule others, who ſhall be ſtartled and give ground upon the noiſe of rumours and calumnies; for in ſo doing he ſubjects himſelf and his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the fancy of thoſe whom he ought to command.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But an overſight of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> at this time <note place="margin">Through un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfulneſs in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage he commits a great errour.</note> committed, did happily allay theſe diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in the Roman Camp: For he, deſirous to refreſh his Horſe in ſome good Paſture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounds, drew off his Army, and ordered his Guides to conduct him to <hi>Caſinum,</hi> they miſtaking him, by reaſon of his ill-pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Latin Tongue, led him and his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the Town of <hi>Caſilinum,</hi> near <hi>Campa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> which the River <hi>Vulturnus</hi> divides in two: The Country about it is a Valley circled round with Mountains, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largeth it ſelf towards the Sea, near which that River overflowing, cauſeth a great deal of Mariſh ground, and at laſt diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging it ſelf into the Sea, makes a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe Coaſt, without any Harbour. As ſoon
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:47090:393"/>
as <hi>Hannibal</hi> was entred into this Valley, <hi>Fabius</hi> diſpatch'd four thouſand choice men to ſeiſe the entrance into it, and ſtop him up; and lodged the reſt of his Army upon the neighbouring Hills in the moſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous places; but at the ſame time he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked a commanded Party of his lighteſt armed Men to fall upon <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Rere; which they did with ſuch ſucceſs, that they cut off eight hundred of them, and put the whole Army in diſorder. <hi>Hannibal,</hi> finding the errour and the danger he was fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, immediately caus'd the poor Guides to be hang'd, which ſatisfy'd his revenge but did not leſſen his danger: For his Enemies were ſo advantageouſly poſted, that there was no hopes of breaking thorough them, and his Souldiers began to deſpair of ever coming out of thoſe Straits.</p>
            <p>Thus reduc'd, <hi>Hannibal</hi> had recourſe to <note place="margin">His Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geme to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the Paſſes.</note> this Stratageme; he cauſed two thouſand head of Oxen, which he had in his Camp, to have Torches and dry Bavens well faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to their Horns, and lighting them in the beginning of the night, he ordred the Beaſts to be fair and foftly drove on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the paſſages out of the Valley; when this was done, he made his Army with great ſilence march after them. The Oxen at firſt kept a ſlow, orderly pace, and with their lighted Heads reſembled an Army
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:47090:394"/>
marching by night, frighting onely the Shepherds and Herdſmen of the Hills a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. But when the fire had burnt down the Horns of the Beaſts to the quick, they no longer obſerved their ſober pace, but unruly with their pain, they ran diſpers'd about, toſſing their Heads, and ſcattering the fire round about them. This became a ſurpriſing ſpectacle to the Romans, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to thoſe, who guarded the Paſſages, who being at ſome diſtance from their main Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and ſeeing the fire on the ſudden diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſing it ſelf on every ſide, as if the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had deſign'd to ſurround them, in great fright and amazement, quitted their Poſt, and precipitouſly retir'd to their Camp on the Hills. They were no ſooner gone, but a light Body of <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s men, according to his order, immediately ſeis'd the Paſſages, and ſoon after the whole Army, with all the Bagage, came up and ſafely marched through the Paſſes. <hi>Fabius,</hi> before the night was over, quickly found out the trick; for ſome of the Beaſts with their flaming heads fell into the hands of his Men; but for fear of an Ambuſh in the dark, he kept his men all night to their Arms in the Camp: And as ſoon as it was day, he charged the Enemy in the Rere, where many fell, and by reaſon of the Straits, and unevenneſs of the Paſſages, the
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:47090:394"/>
diſorder had like to have been general over the whole Punick Army, but that <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſpeedily detached from his Van a Body of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who of themſelves active and nimble, were accuſtomed to the climbing of Mountains; Theſe briskly attacked the Roman Troops, who were in heavy Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and routing the foremoſt, gave ſuch a check to <hi>Fabius,</hi> that he was no longer in condition of following the Enemy. This <note place="margin">Fabius <hi>upon divers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts evil ſpoken of.</hi>
               </note> action brought a ſtrange obloquy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon the Dictatour; They ſaid, it was now manifeſt, that he was not onely inferiour to his Adverſary (what they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways thought) in Courage, but even in Conduct.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Hannibal</hi> (maliciouſly) to improve their hatred againſt him, marched with his Army cloſe to the Lands and Poſſeſſions of <hi>Fabius,</hi> and then giving order to his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to burn and deſtroy all the Country about, he forbad them upon pein of death to doe the leaſt damage in the Territories of the Roman General, and placed Guards for their ſecurity. Theſe matters reported at <hi>Rome,</hi> had that effect with the People, which <hi>Hannibal</hi> deſired. Their Tribunes raiſed a thouſand ſtories againſt him, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the inſtigation of <hi>Metellus,</hi> who not ſo much out of hatred to him as out of friendſhip to <hi>Minutius,</hi> whoſe Kinſman he
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:47090:395"/>
was, thought by depreſſing <hi>Fabius</hi> to raiſe his Friend. The Senate on their part was alſo offended with him, for the bargain he had made with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> about the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of Priſoners, of which the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were, that after the exchange made of Man for Man, if any on either ſide remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, they ſhould be redeemed at the price of two hundred and fifty Drachms a Head; and upon the whole account there remained two hundred and forty Romans unexchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. They not onely refuſed to allow money for the Randſomes, but alſo reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched <hi>Fabius</hi> for making a Contract ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the honour and intereſt of the Commonwealth, in redeeming thoſe men at ſo dear a rate, who had cowardly ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themſelves to be taken by the Enemy. <hi>Fabius</hi> heard and endur'd all this with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible patience; but having no money by him, and on the other ſide being reſolved to keep his word with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd his Son to <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſell Land, and to bring with him the price, ſufficient to diſcharge the Randſomes; which was punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually performed by his Son, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly the Priſoners were delivered to him; amongſt whom many that were able, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered when they were releaſed, to repay the money of their Randſome, but <hi>Fabius</hi> would not permit them to doe it.</p>

About this time <hi>Fabius</hi> was called to <hi>Rome</hi> by the Prieſts, to aſſiſt (according to the duty of his Office) at ſome of their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Sacrifices; whereby he was forced to leave the command of the Army with <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius;</hi> but before he parted, he charged him, and intreated him, in his abſence, not to come to a Battel with <hi>Hannibal:</hi> His commands, his intreaties, and his advice <note place="margin">Minutius <hi>in</hi> Fabius<hi>'s ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence attacks the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians.</hi>
               </note> were loſt upon <hi>Minutius;</hi> for his back was no ſooner turn'd but the new General im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſought all occaſions to fight the Enemy. And notice being brought him, that <hi>Hannibal</hi> had ſent out a great part of his Army to forage, he fell upon a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Party of them, doing great executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and driving them to their very Camp, with no little terrour to the reſt, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended their breaking in upon them: but in the mean time <hi>Hannibal</hi> had drawn his men up into a Body, and <hi>Minutius</hi> without any loſs made his retreat. This ſucceſs did much increaſe the boldneſs and preſumption of <hi>Minutius,</hi> and fill'd the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers minds with a contempt of the Enemy, and with a longing deſire of a Battel. The news was ſuddenly ſpread about <hi>Rome,</hi> and then was <hi>Fabius</hi> heard to ſay thoſe memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable words, <hi>That he dreaded nothing more, for the ſafety of</hi> Rome, <hi>than the ſucceſs of Minutius.</hi> But the People were mad with
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:47090:396"/>
joy, and <hi>Metellus,</hi> who was then their Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune, made an Oration to them, in which he infinitely extolled the valour of <hi>Minuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and fell bitterly upon <hi>Fabius,</hi> accuſing him not onely for want of Courage, but even of Loyalty; and not onely him, but alſo many others of the moſt eminent and conſiderable perſons in <hi>Rome;</hi> that by their means the Carthaginians had brought the War into <hi>Italy,</hi> deſigning thereby to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and deſtroy the Liberty of the People; for which end they had put the ſupreme Authority into the hands of a ſingle perſon, who by his ſlowneſs and delays might give leiſure to <hi>Hannibal</hi> to eſtabliſh himſelf in <hi>Italy,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Carthage</hi> time and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to ſupply him with freſh ſuccours in order to a total Conqueſt. At this, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> ſtep'd forth, but diſdain'd to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reply to his accuſations; he onely ſaid, <hi>That they ſhould expedite the Sacrifices, that ſo he might ſpeedily return to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, to puniſh</hi> Minutius, <hi>who had preſumed to fight contrary to his orders.</hi> He had no ſooner pronounced theſe words, but the People were immediately poſſeſs'd with the belief, that <hi>Minutius</hi> ſtood in danger of his life: For it was in the power of the Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour to impriſon, and to put to death; and they feared, that <hi>Fabius,</hi> though of a mild temper to outward appearance, would be
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:47090:396"/>
as hard to be appeaſed when irritated, as he was ſlow to be provoked. And yet no <note place="margin">Fabius <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by the Tribune</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellus.</note> body dar'd to contradict the orders of the Dictatour, but <hi>Metellus,</hi> whoſe Office of Tribune gave him ſecurity and liberty to ſay what he pleaſed; for in the time of a Dictature that Magiſtrate onely conſerves his Authority. He therefore boldly apply'd himſelf to the People, in the behalf of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius,</hi> that they ſhould not ſuffer him to be made a ſacrifice to the enmity of <hi>Fabius,</hi> nor permit him to be deſtroyed, like the Son of <hi>Manlius Torquatus,</hi> who was behea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by his Father for a Battel fought and won againſt order: Then he exhorted them to take away from <hi>Fabius</hi> that abſolute power of a Dictatour, and to put it into more worthy hands, which might better manage it for their ſafety and publick good. Theſe impreſſions very much prevail'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the People, though not ſo far, as whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to diſpoſſeſs <hi>Fabius</hi> of the Dictature: But they decreed, that <hi>Minutius</hi> ſhould have an equal authority with the Dictatour in the Army; which was a thing then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Precedent, though, not long after, it was alſo practiſed upon the overthrow at <hi>Cannes,</hi> when, the Dictatour <hi>Marcus Juni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> being with the Army, they choſe at <hi>Rome Fabius Buteo</hi> Dictatour, that he might create new Senatours, to ſupply the places
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:47090:397"/>
of thoſe who were kill'd, which could be performed by no other Magiſtrate. But as ſoon as, being entred into the Senate, he had fill'd thoſe vacant places with a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent number, he immediately diſmiſſed his <hi>Lictors</hi> with their <hi>Faſces</hi> and all his Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and mingling himſelf like a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon perſon with the reſt of the People, he quietly went about his own affairs. The Enemies of <hi>Fabius</hi> thought they had ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently affronted and dejected him, by rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Minutius</hi> to be his equal in authority; but they miſtook the temper of the man, who look'd upon their madneſs as more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to the Commonwealth than to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; in imitation of <hi>Diogenes,</hi> who being told, that ſome perſons derided him, made anſwer, <hi>But I am not derided,</hi> meaning in a Philoſophical ſenſe, that a good and a wiſe Man was not capable of being affronted, or diſgraced, becauſe ſuch injuries made no impreſſion upon him. Thus <hi>Fabius,</hi> with great lenity and unconcernedneſs, ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this mad Vote of the People; but, leſt the raſhneſs of <hi>Minutius</hi> ſhould be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by inabled to run headlong upon ſome dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous enterpriſe, with all privacy and ſpeed he return'd back to the Army; where he found <hi>Minutius</hi> ſo big and elevated with his new dignity, that a joint-authority not contenting him, he required by turns to
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:47090:397"/>
have the Command of the Army, every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day. This <hi>Fabius</hi> rejected, as of too <note place="margin">
                  <hi>He divides the Army with</hi> Minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</note> dangerous conſequence, but was contented (to comply with his imperious humour) that the Army ſhould be divided, and each General ſhould command his part. The firſt and fourth Legion he took for his own diviſion, the ſecond and third he delivered to <hi>Minutius;</hi> ſo alſo of the Auxiliary Forces each had an equal ſhare.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Minutius</hi> thus exalted, could not contain himſelf from boaſting, even in the preſence of <hi>Fabius,</hi> that now he had humbled the mighty man, who ſo lately trampled on their Lives and Fortunes: To whom the Dictatour mildly replyed, <hi>Minutius, you miſtake your Enemy; 'tis</hi> Hannibal, <hi>and not</hi> Fabius <hi>whom you are to combat; but if you muſt needs contend with your Collegue, let it be in diligence and care for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of</hi> Rome; <hi>that it may not be ſaid, a man ſo favour'd by the People, ſerv'd them worſe than he who had been ill treated and diſgrac'd by them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our young General deſpiſing theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, as the dotage of ſupercilious Age, immediately remov'd with the body of his Army, and incamped by himſelf. <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who was not ignorant of all theſe paſſages, lay watching his advantage from them; It happen'd, that between his Army
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:47090:398"/>
and that of <hi>Minutius</hi> there was a certain eminence which ſeem'd a very advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Poſt to incamp upon, it had the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of a large Plain about it, and the Fields appear'd to be all level and even; and yet there were a great many Ditches and hollowneſſes in them, not diſcernible to the eye at a diſtance. <hi>Hannibal</hi> had he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, could eaſily have poſſeſs'd himſelf of this ground; but he reſerved it for a bait or train, in a proper ſeaſon, to draw the Romans to an Ingagement. Now that <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius</hi> and <hi>Fabius</hi> were divided, he thought <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of</hi> Minutius<hi>'s raſh ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from</hi> Fabius.</note> the opportunity fair for his purpoſe; and therefore, having in the night-time lodged a convenient number of his men in thoſe Dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and hollow places, early in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he ſent forth a ſmall detachment, who in the ſight of <hi>Minutius</hi> poſſeſſed themſelves of that riſing ground. According to his expectation, <hi>Minutius</hi> ſwallowed the bait, and firſt ſends out a Party of Dragoons, and after them ſome Horſe, to diſlodge the Enemy. And at laſt, when he ſaw <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> in perſon advancing to the aſſiſtance of his men, he marched with his whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my drawn up, reſolving to make himſelf Maſter of that Poſt. The combat for ſome time was equal between the foremoſt Troops; but as ſoon as <hi>Hannibal</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the whole Army of the Romans
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:47090:398"/>
was now ſufficiently advanced within the toils he had ſet for them, ſo that their Backs and Flanks were open to his men, whom he had poſted in thoſe low places; he inſtantly gave the ſignal, whereupon they ruſhed forth, and furiouſly attacked <hi>Minutius</hi> in the Rere. The ſurpriſe and the ſlaughter was ſo great, that it ſtruck an univerſal terrour through the whole Army. The braveſt amongſt them, and <hi>Minutius</hi> himſelf were in ſuch aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they were as uncapable of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving orders as the Souldiery of obeying them. Thoſe who ſought to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by flight, were intercepted and cut in pieces by the Numidian Horſemen, who for that purpoſe had diſpers'd themſelves about the adjacent Plains.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fabius</hi> was not ignorant of this danger of his Country-men; He well foreſaw what would happen from the raſhneſs of <hi>Minutius,</hi> and the cunning of <hi>Hannibal;</hi> for which reaſon he kept his Men to their Arms, in a readineſs to wait the event; nor would he truſt to the reports of others, but he himſelf upon an eminence in his Camp, viewed all that paſſed. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaw the Army of <hi>Minutius</hi> incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd by the Enemy, and that by their countenance and ſhifting their ground, they were more diſpoſed to flight than to reſiſt;
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:47090:399"/>
with a great ſigh, ſtriking his hand upon his Thigh, he ſaid to thoſe about him, <hi>O</hi> Hercules! <hi>how much ſooner than I expected, and yet how much later than he would have done, hath</hi> Minutius <hi>deſtroy'd himſelf!</hi> He then commanded the Enſigns to march, and the Army to follow him, telling them; <hi>we muſt make haſte to reſcue</hi> Minutius, <hi>who is a valiant man, and a lover of his Country; and if he hath been too forward to ingage the Enemy, at another time we will tell him of it.</hi> Thus in the head of his men <hi>Fabius</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched <note place="margin">Fabius <hi>ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius.</note> up to the Enemy; and in the firſt place he cleared the Plains of thoſe Numidians, and next he fell upon thoſe who were char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Romans in the Rere, running down all that made oppoſition, and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the reſt to ſave themſelves by a haſty retreat, leſt themſelves ſhould be environed as the Romans had been. <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſeeing ſo ſudden a change of affairs, and the great execution done by <hi>Fabius</hi> beyond the force of his age, opening his way thorough the Ranks that he might joyn <hi>Minutius,</hi> wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commanded a Retreat, and drew off his men into their Camp: The Romans on their part were no leſs contented to retire in ſafety. It is reported that upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſaid to his Friends; <hi>Did not I tell you, that this Cloud which always hover'd upon the Mountains, would at ſome</hi>

               <hi>time or other come down with a Storm upon us? Fabius,</hi> after his men had pick'd up the Spoils of the Field, retired to his own Camp, without ſaying any harſh or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfull thing to his Collegue; who alſo on his part gathering his Army together, in this manner delivered himſelf to them. <hi>Never to commit a fault is above the force of humane Nature; but to learn and improve by the faults we have committed, is that which becomes a good and a prudent man. Some reaſons I may have to accuſe Fortune, but I have many more to thank her; for in a few hours ſhe hath cured a long miſtake, and taught me, that I am not the man who ſhould command others, but have need of another to command me; and that we are not to contend for a victory over thoſe to whom it is our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to yield. Therefore for the future the Dictatour muſt be your Commander; but in gratitude towards him I will ſtill be your Leader, and always be the firſt to obey his orders.</hi> Having ſaid this, he commanded <note place="margin">Minutius <hi>ſenſible of his errour ſubmits to</hi> Fabius.</note> the Roman Eagles to march forward, and all his men to follow him in their orders in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Camp of <hi>Fabius.</hi> The Fabians ſtood amazed at the novelty of the ſight, and were anxious and doubtfull what the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning might be. When he came near the Dictatour's Tent, <hi>Fabius</hi> went forth to meet him, and he preſently laid his Colours
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:47090:400"/>
at his Feet, calling him with a loud voice his Father, and the Army commanded by him, the Patrons of his Liberty; and after ſeveral civilities and congratulations, he thus addreſſed himſelf to the Dictatour; <hi>You have this day</hi> (Fabius) <hi>obtain'd a double Victory; one by your Valour and Conduct up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Enemies, and another by your Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and Compaſſion upon your Colleque: you have at once preſerved us and inſtructed us; and when we were ſhamefully beaten by</hi> Hannibal <hi>you reſtor'd us to our honour and our ſafety; and inſtead of him,</hi> Fabius <hi>more honourably is now our Victor. Wherefore I can call you by no other name but that of a Father, ſince you have not onely at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent given life to me, but (as a common Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent) to all theſe who are under me.</hi> After this, he threw himſelf with great tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſubmiſſion into the Armes of the Dictatour; and in the ſame manner the Souldiers of each Army embraced one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with an exceſs of gladneſs and tears of joy.</p>
            <p>Not long after, <hi>Fabius</hi> laid down the Dictature, and new Conſuls were created. Thoſe, who immediately ſucceeded, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd the ſame method in managing the War, and avoided all occaſions of fighting <hi>Hannibal</hi> in a pitch'd Battel; they onely ſuccour'd their Allies and preſerv'd the

               </note> afterwards, when <hi>Terentius Varro</hi> (a man of obſcure Birth, but very popular and bold) had obtain'd the Conſulſhip, he ſoon made it appear, that by his raſhneſs and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, he would expoſe the Commonwealth to the laſt hazard: For it was his cuſtom, to declaim in all Aſſemblies, that as long as the Counſels of <hi>Fabius</hi> prevail'd in <hi>Rome,</hi> there never would be an end of the War; and he made his brags, that when ever he ſhould get ſight of the Enemy, he would free <hi>Italy</hi> from the Arms of Strangers. With theſe promiſes he ſo prevail'd with the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous multitude, that he rais'd a greater Army than had ever yet been ſent out of <hi>Rome.</hi> There were liſted fourſcore thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand fighting men; but that which gave confidence to the populace, did at the ſame time very much terrifie and deject the wife and experienced, and none more than <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius;</hi> For if ſo great a Body, and the flower of the Roman Youth ſhould be cut off, they could not ſee any reſource for the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Rome.</hi> Wherefore they addreſs'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the other Conſul, <hi>Paulus Aemilius,</hi> a man of great experience in War, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the common People; who formerly upon ſome diſpleaſure had ſet a Mulct upon him. This other Conſul they incourage to withſtand the temerity of his Collegue,
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:47090:401"/>
telling him, if he will profitably ſerve his Country, he muſt no leſs oppoſe <hi>Varro</hi> than <hi>Hannibal,</hi> ſince both conſpired to decide the fate of <hi>Rome</hi> by a Battel. <hi>It is more</hi>

This evidently appears, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that, notwithſtanding his Victories, none of the Countries or Towns of</hi> Italy <hi>come in to him, and that now his Army is not the third part of what it was at firſt.</hi> To this <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> is ſaid to have reply'd, <hi>Did I onely conſider my ſelf, I ſhould rather chuſe to be expoſed to the Weapons of</hi> Hannibal <hi>than to the Suffrages of my fellow Citizens, whoſe rancour I am ſure to increaſe againſt me if I avoid ingaging the Enemy; yet ſince the life of</hi> Rome <hi>is at ſtake, I will rather in my conduct pleaſe and obey</hi> Fabius <hi>than all the world beſides.</hi> But theſe good meaſures were broken by the ambitious importunity of <hi>Varro;</hi> for when they were both come to the Army, nothing would concent this Favourite of the People but a ſeparate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that each Conſul ſhould have his day; and when his turn came, he poſted his Army

This boldneſs of the Conſul, and the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merouſneſs of his Army (double to theirs) ſtartled the Carthaginians; but <hi>Hannibal</hi> commanded them to their Arms, and with a ſmall train he went forth to take a full proſpect of the Enemy, upon a riſing ground not far diſtant. One of his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, called <hi>Giſco</hi> (a Nobleman of <hi>Carthage)</hi> told him, that the number of the Enemy was very aſtoniſhing; to whom <hi>Hannibal</hi> reply'd, with a ſerious countenance; <hi>There is ſomething yet more aſtoniſhing, which you take no notice of; that in all that Army there is not one man whoſe name is</hi> Giſco. This jeſt of their General made all the company laugh, and as they return'd to the Camp, they told it to thoſe whom they met, which cauſed a general laughter amongſt them all. The Army, ſeeing <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s attendants come back from viewing the Enemy in ſuch a laughing condition, did verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that from the good poſture of their affairs, and from the contempt of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my this laughter had proceeded; which did not a little ſerve to raiſe the drooping ſpirits of the Souldiers. According to his uſual manner, <hi>Hannibal</hi> fail'd not by his
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:47090:402"/>
Stratagemes to advantage himſelf. In the firſt place, he ſo drew up his men, that the wind was on their backs, which was at that time very violent; and by reaſon of the great plains of ſand, carried before it a great cloud of duſt, which ſtriking upon the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Romans, did very much diſable them in the fight. In the next place, all his beſt men he put into his Wings; and in the Body, which was ſomewhat more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced than the Wings, he placed the worſt and the weakeſt of his Army. Then he commanded thoſe in the Wings, that when the Enemy had made a thorough charge upon that middle advanc'd Body, which he knew would recoile, as not being able to ſtand their ſhock; and that, when the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, in their purſuit, ſhould be far enough ingaged within the two Wings, they ſhould, both on the right and the left, charge them in the Flank, and endeavour to incompaſs them. This deſign had all the ſucceſs ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable; for the Romans preſſing upon <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Front, which gave ground, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the form of his Army into a perfect half Moon; and blinded with the duſt, they followed on ſo far, that they gave room for the Enemies Wings to join behind them, and ſo to incloſe and charge them both Flanks and Rere; which they did with an incredible flaughter of the Romans: To
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:47090:402"/>
whoſe Calamity, it is alſo ſaid, that a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual miſtake did very much contribute; For the Horſe of <hi>Aemilius</hi> receiving a hurt, <note place="margin">Aemilius <hi>the Conſul diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted.</hi>
               </note> and throwing his Maſter, thoſe about him immediately alighted to aid the Conſul; the Roman Troops ſeeing their Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders thus quitting their Horſes, took it for a ſign that they ſhould all diſmount and charge the Enemy on foot. At the ſight of this, <hi>Hannibal</hi> was heard to ſay, <hi>This pleaſeth me better than if they had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd to me bound hand and foot.</hi> For the particulars of this Ingagement, we refer our Reader to thoſe Authours who have writ at large upon the Subject.</p>
            <p>The Conſul <hi>Varro</hi> with a thin company fled to <hi>Venutia;</hi> and <hi>Paulus Aemilius,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able any longer to oppoſe the flight of his men, or the purſuit of the Enemy, his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy all covered with wounds, and his Soul no leſs wounded with grief, ſate himſelf down upon a Stone, expecting the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a diſpatching blow. His Face was ſo disfigured, and all his Armour ſo ſtained with Bloud, that his very Friends and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticks paſſing by knew him not. At laſt <hi>Cornelius Lentulus,</hi> of a Patrician Race, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving who he was, alighted from his Horſe, and tendring it to him, deſired him to get up, and ſave a life ſo neceſſary to the ſafety of the Commonwealth, which at this time

would dearly want ſo great a Captain. But nothing could prevail upon him to accept of the offer; with tears in his eyes he obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged young <hi>Lentulus</hi> to remount his Horſe; then ſtanding up, he gave him his hand, and commanded him to tell <hi>Fabius Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> that <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> had followed his directions to his very laſt, and had not in the leaſt deviated from thoſe meaſures which were agreed between them; but that it was his hard fate, to be overpower'd by <hi>Varro</hi> in the firſt place, and ſecondly by <hi>Hannibal.</hi> Having diſpatch'd <hi>Lentulus</hi> with this Commiſſion, he mark'd where the ſlaughter was greateſt, and there threw <note place="margin">He dies va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly.</note> himſelf upon the Swords of the Enemy. In this Battel it is reported, that fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Romans were ſlain, four thouſand Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners taken in the Field, and ten thouſand in the Camp of both Conſuls.</p>
            <p>The Friends of <hi>Hannibal</hi> earneſtly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him to follow his Victory, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the flying Romans into the very Gates of <hi>Rome;</hi> aſſuring him, that in five days march he might ſup in the Capitol: Nor is it eaſie to imagine, what hindred him from it. I am apt to believe, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of his good fortune, or ſome Tutelary God of the Romans blinded his reaſon, and made him loiter away his time; which made <hi>Barcas,</hi> a Carthaginian, tell him with
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:47090:403"/>
indignation; <hi>You know,</hi> Hannibal, <hi>how to get a Victory but not how to uſe it.</hi> Yet, though he failed in making the beſt advantage of ſo mighty a Victory, however it produced a ſtrange turn and improvement in his affairs; For he, who hitherto had not one Town, nor a Sea-port in his poſſeſſion, who had nothing for the ſubſiſtence of his men but what he pillaged from day to day; who had no place of Retreat, nor any reaſonable hopes to make the War continue, nor his Army to hold together, now became Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the beſt Provinces and Towns of <hi>Italy,</hi> and of <hi>Capua</hi> it ſelf (next to <hi>Rome</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Capua <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volts to</hi> Hannibal.</note> the moſt flouriſhing and opulent City) all which came over to him, and ſubmitted to his Authority.</p>
            <p>It is the ſaying of <hi>Euripides,</hi> that <hi>a man is in no good condition when he is obliged to try a Friend, nor a State when it ſtands in need of an able General.</hi> And ſo it was with the Romans; who (before the Battel) bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the counſels and actions of <hi>Fabius</hi> with the infamous note of cowardiſe and fear, but now in the other extreme, they admire and adore his prudence, as ſomething di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, that could ſee ſo far, and foretell what would happen ſo contrary to, and ſo much above the judgment of all others. In him therefore they place their onely hope; his wiſedom is the ſacred Anchor, which fix'd
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:47090:404"/>
them in ſo great a fluctuation, and his Counſels alone preſerve them from diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and deſerting their City; as in the time when the Gauls took poſſeſſion of <hi>Rome.</hi> He, whom they eſteemed fearfull <note place="margin">Fabius <hi>of an even temper in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>
               </note> and puſillanimous, when they were (as they thought) in a proſperous condition, is now the onely man in this general dejection, who ſhews no fear, but walking the Streets with an aſſured and ſerene countenance, comforts the afflicted, invigorates the weak, and incourageth all to a brave and reſolute defence of their Country. He cauſed the Senate to meet, he heartned the Magiſtrates, and was as the Soul of their Body giving them life and motion; He placed Guards at the Gates of the City, to ſtop the frighted Rabble from flying; He regulated and confin'd their Mournings for their ſlain Friends, both as to time and place; That each Family within its own Walls, and not in Publick, ſhould perform ſuch Obſequies; and that the ceremony of them ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue onely the ſpace of one Month, and then the whole City ſhould be <hi>luſtrated</hi> and purified. The Feaſt of <hi>Ceres</hi> happening to fall within this time, it was decreed, that the Solemnity ſhould be intermitted; leſt the fewneſs and the ſorrowfull countenance of thoſe who ſhould celebrate it, might too much expoſe to the People the greatneſs of
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:47090:404"/>
their loſs; Beſides, the worſhip moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the Gods, is that which comes from cheerfull hearts; But thoſe Rites which were proper and peculiar for appeaſing their anger, and procuring auſpicious ſigns and preſages, were by the direction of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurs carefully performed. Alſo <hi>Fabius Pictor</hi> (a near Kinſman to <hi>Maximus)</hi> was ſent to conſult the Oracle of <hi>Delphos;</hi> and about the ſame time, two Veſtals having been detected to have been violated, the one kill'd her ſelf, and the other according to cuſtom was buried alive.</p>
            <p>But now let us admire the moderation <note place="margin">An Inſtance of a generous diſpoſition in the Romans.</note> and generoſity of this Roman Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; that when the Conſul <hi>Varro</hi> came beaten and flying home, full of infamy and ſhame, after he had ſo foully and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſly managed their affairs, yet the whole Senate and People went forth to meet him at the Gates of the City, and received him with all the honour and reſpect due to their Conſul: And ſilence being commanded, the Magiſtrates and chief of the Senate, and principally <hi>Fabius,</hi> commended him before the People, for that he did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of the ſafety of the Commonwealth after ſo great a loſs, but was come to take the Government into his hands, to execute the Laws, and comfort his fellow-Citizens, by this means not yet abandon'd and forlorn.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="636" facs="tcp:47090:405"/>
When word was brought to <hi>Rome</hi> that <hi>Hannibal,</hi> after the Fight, had marched with his Army into the remoter parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> the hearts of the Romans began to recover again their ancient vigour and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; they ſent forth an Army under the command of <hi>Fabius Maximus,</hi> and <hi>Claudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Marcellus <hi>choſen joint-Commander with</hi> Fabius.</note> 
               <hi>Marcellus;</hi> both great Generals, equal in Fame, but very unlike and oppoſite in their ways. For <hi>Marcellus,</hi> as we have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet forth in his Life, was a man of action, bold, vigorous and enterpriſing, and (as <hi>Homer</hi> deſcribes his Warriours) <hi>fierce,</hi> and <hi>delighting</hi> in <hi>fights.</hi> So that having to doe with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> a man of his own temper, they never failed upon all occaſions to come to an Ingagement. But <hi>Fabius</hi> adher'd to his former principles, ſtill perſwaded, that by following cloſe and not fighting him, <hi>Hannibal</hi> and his Army would at laſt be ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out and conſumed; like an able Wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, who with too much exerciſe and toil grows languid and weak. Wherefore <hi>Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidonius</hi> tells us, that the Romans called <hi>Marcellus</hi> their <hi>Sword</hi> and <hi>Fabius</hi> their <hi>Buckler;</hi> and that the vigour of the one mixt with the ſteadineſs of the other, made a happy Compound, very ſalutiferous to <hi>Rome.</hi> So that <hi>Hannibal</hi> found by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that incountring the one, he met with a rapid impetuous River, which drove him
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:47090:405"/>
back and ſtill made ſome breach upon him; and by the other, though ſilently and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly paſſing by him, he was inſenſibly waſh'd away and conſumed: at laſt he was brought to this, that he dreaded <hi>Marcellus</hi> when he was in motion, and <hi>Fabius</hi> when he ſate ſtill. During the whole courſe of this War, he had ſtill to doe with one or both of theſe Generals; for each of them had been five times Conſul; and either as Praetor, or Proconſul, or Conſul, they had always a part in the government of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; till at laſt <hi>Marcellus</hi> fell into the trap <note place="margin">
                  <hi>He is circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented and ſlain by</hi> Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal.</note> which <hi>Hannibal</hi> had laid for him, and was kill'd in his fifth Conſulſhip. But his craft and ſubtilty was unſucceſsfull upon <hi>Fabius,</hi> who onely once was in ſome danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caught; For he had ſent counterfeit Letters to him from the principal Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Metapont,</hi> wherein they ingaged to deliver up their Town if he would come before it with his Army: This train had almoſt drawn him in, for he had reſolved to march to them with part of his Army, but was diverted onely by conſulting the flight of the Birds, which he found to be inauſpicious: And not long after he came to underſtand that thoſe Letters had been forged by <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who for his recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had laid an Ambuſh to entertain him. This perhaps we muſt rather attribute to
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:47090:406"/>
the favour of the Gods than to the prudence of <hi>Fabius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in preſerving the Towns and his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The winning behaviour of</hi> Fabius <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his fickle Allies.</hi>
               </note> from revolting, with fair and gentle u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and in not uſing rigour, or ſhewing a ſuſpicion upon every light ſuggeſtion, his conduct was very ſingular. It is reported of him, that being informed of a certain Marſian (an eminent Man for his courage and quality) who had dealt underhand with ſome of the Souldiers to make them deſert, <hi>Fabius</hi> was ſo far from uſing ſeverity againſt him, that he called for him, and told him, he was ſenſible of the wrong which had been done him, and that his merit and good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice had been neglected, which he ſaid was a great fault in the Commanders, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward more by favour than by deſert; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when ever you are agrieved (ſaid <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius)</hi> I ſhall take it ill at your hands, if you apply your ſelf to any but to me; when he had ſo ſpoken, he beſtowed an excellent Horſe and other good gifts upon him: And from that time forwards, there was not a faithfuller and more truſty man in the whole Army than this Marſian. With good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon our General did judge, that if thoſe who have the government of Horſes and Beaſts, endeavour by gentle uſage to make them tractable and fit for ſervice, rather than by cruelty and beating; much more
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:47090:406"/>
thoſe who have the command of Men, ſhould bring them to order and diſcipline by the mildeſt and faireſt means; not trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them worſe than Gardiners thoſe wild Plants, which by carefull looking to and good uſage, looſe the ſavageneſs of their nature, and bear excellent fruit.</p>
            <p>At another time, ſome of his Officers <note place="margin">A pleaſant fetch of his to reduce a common Souldier.</note> inform'd him, that one of their Men did very often depart from his Colours, and lie out at nights; he ask'd them what kind of man he was; they all anſwer'd, that the whole Army had not a better man; that he was a native of <hi>Lucania;</hi> and ſo they fell relating ſeveral actions which they had ſeen him perform. Immediately <hi>Fabius</hi> made a ſtrict inquiry to find what it was that led him ſo often out of the Camp: and at laſt he diſcover'd, that his frequent excurſions were to viſit a young Woman, with whom he was in love. Hereupon he gave private order to ſome of his men, to find out the Woman and ſecretly to convey her into his own Tent; and then ſent for the Lucanian, and calling him aſide, told him, that he very well knew how often he had lain at nights out of the Camp, which was a Capital tranſgreſſion againſt military Diſcipline and the Roman Laws; but he knew alſo how brave he was, and the good ſervices he had done, and therefore in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:47090:407"/>
of them he was willing to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him his fault; But to keep him in good order, he was reſolved to place one over him, to be his keeper, who ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for his good behaviour; having ſaid this, he produced the Woman, and told the Souldier, (terrified and amazed at the adventure) <hi>This is the perſon who muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for you;</hi> and by your future behaviour we ſhall ſee whether your night rambles were upon the account of love, or upon any other worſe deſign.</p>
            <p>Another paſſage there was, ſomething of <note place="margin">
                  <hi>His Policy in regaining</hi> Tarentum.</note> this nature, which alſo fell under the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of <hi>Fabius,</hi> and proved highly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to the Roman affairs, whereby he gain'd <hi>Tarentum.</hi> There was a young Tarentine in the Army, that had a Siſter in <hi>Tarentum</hi> (then in poſſeſſion of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my) who entirely loved her Brother and wholly depended of him; He being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, that a certain Brutian, whom <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> had made Governour of that Garriſon, was deeply in love with his Siſter, concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved hopes, that he might poſſibly turn it to account in behalf of the Romans. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving firſt communicated his deſign with <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi> he left the Army as a Deſerter (in ſhew) and went over to <hi>Tarentum.</hi> At his firſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, the Brutian abſtain'd from viſiting the Siſter; for neither of them knew that
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:47090:407"/>
the Brother had notice of the Amour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them: whereupon the young Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine took an occaſion to tell his Siſter, how he had heard, that a man of quality and great authority had made his addreſſes to her; Therefore he deſired her to tell him who it was; <hi>for</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>if he be a man that has bravery and reputation, it matters not what Country-man he is; ſince at this time the Sword mingles all Nations and makes them equal; and an alliance with ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in this Reign of</hi> Mars, <hi>is both honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and profitable.</hi> Hereupon the Woman ſends for her Gallant, and makes the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and him great Friends: and whereas ſhe henceforth ſhew'd more countenance to her Lover than formerly, by the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees that her kindneſs increaſed did his friendſhip alſo with the Brother advance. So that at laſt our Tarentine thought this Brutian Officer well enough prepar'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the offers he had to make him; and that it would be eaſie for a Mercenary Man, who was in love, to accept (upon the terms propoſed) of great Sums promiſed by <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi> and of a Miſtreſs whom he paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loved. In concluſion the bargain was ſtruck, and the promiſe made of delivering the Town. This is the common tradition, though ſome relate this ſtory otherwiſe, and ſay, that this Woman, by whom the Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:47090:408"/>
was inveigled to betray the Town, was not a native of <hi>Tarentum</hi> but a Brutian born, and that ſhe had been kept by <hi>Fabius</hi> as his Concubine; and being a Country-woman and an acquaintance of the Brutian Governour, he privately ſent her to him to corrupt him.</p>
            <p>Whilſt theſe matters were thus brewing, to draw off <hi>Hannibal</hi> from ſcenting the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, <hi>Fabius</hi> ſends orders to the Garriſon in <hi>Rhegium,</hi> that they ſhould waſte and ſpoil the Brutian Country, and ſhould alſo lay ſiege to <hi>Caulonia,</hi> and ſtorm the place with all poſſible vigour; Theſe were a Body of eight thouſand men, the worſt of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Army, who had moſt of them been run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aways, and had been branded by <hi>Marcellus</hi> with the ignominious note of Cowardiſe; ſo that the loſs of them would not be great, nor much lamented by the Romans. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> therefore threw out theſe men as a bait <note place="margin">Hannibal <hi>diverted by a ſubtilty of</hi> Fabius.</note> for <hi>Hannibal,</hi> to divert him from <hi>Tarentum;</hi> who inſtantly bit at it, and led his forces to <hi>Caulonia;</hi> and in the mean time <hi>Fabius</hi> lay down before <hi>Tarentum.</hi> The ſixth day of the Siege, his young Tarentine ſlips by night out of the Town, and having well obſerved the place where the Brutian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, according to agreement was to let in the Romans, he gives an account of the whole matter, as they had laid it to <hi>Fabius;</hi>
               <pb n="643" facs="tcp:47090:408"/>
who thought it not ſafe to rely wholly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the information given him, and the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain which was made, but went himſelf with great privacy to take a view of the Poſt and the avenue; and then gave order for a general aſſault to be made on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of the Town, both by Land and Sea. This being accordingly executed, when the Tarentines, and moſt of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon ran to defend the Town on that ſide where the attack was made, <hi>Fabius</hi> with the men reſerved for that purpoſe ſcales the Walls at the place deſign'd, and enters the Town without oppoſition.</p>
            <p>Here we muſt confeſs, that the Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The inhumane cruelty of</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius <hi>at the ſacking of</hi> Tarentum.</note> of <hi>Fabius</hi> was both cruel and unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; For to make it appear to the world, that he had taken <hi>Tarentum</hi> by force and his own proweſs, and not by treachery, he commanded his men to doe execution upon all the Brutians, and not to ſpare a man of them; many of the Tarentines were alſo kill'd, and thirty thouſand of them were ſold for Slaves. The Army had the plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Town, and there was brought into the Treaſury three thouſand Talents: whilſt they were thus ordering and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting the Spoils, the Officer who took the Inventory, ask'd what ſhould be done with their Gods, meaning the Statues and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in the Temples; to whom <hi>Fabius</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd,
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:47090:409"/>
               <hi>Let us leave their angry Gods to the Tarentines.</hi> And yet one Statue of <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> which was of extraordinary bigneſs, he caus'd to be ſet up in the Capitol, next to his own in Braſs, which ſtood there on Horſeback. The ſevere and ſanguinary proceeding on this occaſion, as it reflects on the memory of <hi>Fabius,</hi> ſo alſo it did ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much ſet off in the eyes of the world the clemency and humanity of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> as in his Life we have already ſhewn.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Hannibal</hi> had the news brought <note place="margin">Hannibal <hi>in vain at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it.</hi>
               </note> him that <hi>Tarentum</hi> was beſieged, he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with great diligence to relieve it; and being come within five miles, he was inform'd that the Town was taken; which made him ſay, <hi>that</hi> Rome <hi>had alſo got a</hi> Hannibal, <hi>and by the ſame Art</hi> Tarentum <hi>was loſt, by which he formerly had gain'd it:</hi> And being in private with ſome of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidents, he plainly told them, that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways thought it difficult, but now he held it impoſſible with the Forces he then had to maſter <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this ſucceſs, <hi>Fabius</hi> had a Triumph decreed him at <hi>Rome,</hi> much more ſplendid than the former; for they look'd upon him now as a Champion who had clearly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted his Antagoniſt, and been too hard for him in his own way and at his own Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon: And indeed the Army of <hi>Hannibal</hi>
               <pb n="645" facs="tcp:47090:409"/>
was at this time partly worn away with continual action, and partly become ſoft and diſſolute with great opulency and luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. When the Senate had before them the buſineſs of this Triumph, <hi>Marcus Livius</hi> (who was Governour of <hi>Tarentum</hi> when it was betrayed to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and then retired into the Caſtle, which he kept till the Town was re-taken) openly declared, that by his reſiſtance more than by any action of <hi>Fabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Tarentum</hi> had been recovered; to whom <hi>Fabius,</hi> laughing at his envy and ambition, reply'd; <hi>You ſay very true, for if</hi> Marcus <note place="margin">Fabius<hi>'s jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular reply to</hi> Marcus Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius.</note> Livius <hi>had not loſt</hi> Tarentum, Fabius Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus <hi>had never recover'd it.</hi> The People of <hi>Rome</hi> thought no honour too great for him; they gave his Son the Conſulſhip of the next year; who when he was entred upon his Office, there being ſome buſineſs then on foot about proviſions for the War, his Father, either by reaſon of Age and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or perhaps out of deſign to try his Son, came up to him on Horſeback. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the young Conſul preſently bid one of his Lictors command his Father to alight, and tell him that if he had any buſineſs with the Conſul he ſhould come on foot. This infinitely pleaſed the old man, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the ſtanders by ſeem'd offended at the imperiouſneſs of the Son towards a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo venerable for his age and his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:47090:410"/>
yet he inſtantly lighted from his <note place="margin">The tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent dignity of a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.</note> Horſe, and with open armes and great ſpeed, came up and imbraced his Son, telling him, <hi>Now thou art my Son indeed, ſince thou doſt underſtand thy ſelf in the Authority thou haſt received, and knoweſt whom thou art to command. This was the way by which we and our forefathers have advanced the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Commonwealth, in preferring that to our own Fathers and Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed it is reported, that the great Grandfather of our <hi>Fabius,</hi> who was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the greateſt man of <hi>Rome</hi> in his time, both in Reputation and Authority, who had been five times Conſul, and had been honour'd with ſeveral Triumphs for as many Victories obtained by him, took pleaſure in ſerving (as Legate) under his own Son, when he went Conſul into his Province: And when afterwards his Son had a Triumph beſtow'd upon him for his good ſervice, the old man followed on Horſeback his triumphant Chariot, as one of his Attendants; and made it his glory to be the greateſt man in <hi>Rome,</hi> and to have ſuch a Son, and yet to be ſubject to the Law and the Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>But the praiſes of our <hi>Fabius</hi> are not bounded here; his manly courage in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his loſſes, more eminently ſhew'd the greatneſs of his Soul than his proſperous
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:47090:410"/>
ſucceſſes. For looſing this Son of his in the flower of his age, and in the height of his promotion, with wonderfull moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he did the part of a pious Father and of a Heroe, whom nothing could daunt. For as it was the cuſtom amongſt the Romans, upon the death of any illuſtrious perſon, to have a Funeral Oration recited by ſome of the neareſt Relations, he himſelf took upon him that office, and delivered himſelf upon the ſubject to the great ſatisfaction and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe both of Senate and People.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Publius Cornelius Scipio,</hi> who was ſent Proconſul into <hi>Spain,</hi> had driven the Carthaginians (defeated by him in many Battels) out of that Province, and had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſeveral Towns and Nations under the obedience of <hi>Rome,</hi> he was received at his coming home with a general joy and acclamation of the People; who to ſhew their gratitude and high eſteem of him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd him Conſul for the year enſuing. Knowing what high expectation they had of him, he thought the deſign of onely dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Hannibal</hi> out of <hi>Italy,</hi> not great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to anſwer the hopes and the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they promiſed themſelves from his Conſulſhip. He therefore propos'd no leſs a task to himſelf than to make Carthage the ſeat of the War; and ſo to oblige <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal,</hi> inſtead of invading the Countries of

To this end he made uſe of all the credit and favour he had with the People; and aſſiduouſly courting them, left no popular art untry'd that he might gain them to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond his deſign. <hi>Fabius</hi> on the other ſide <note place="margin">Scipio <hi>thwarted in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns by</hi> Fabius.</note> oppos'd with all his might this undertaking of <hi>Scipio,</hi> telling the People, that nothing but the temerity of a hot young man could inſpire them with ſuch dangerous Counſels, which by drawing away their Forces to parts ſo remote, might expoſe <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf to be the conqueſt of <hi>Hannibal.</hi> His au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and perſwaſions prevail'd with the Senate to eſpouſe his Sentiments, but the common People thought that he envied the Fame of <hi>Scipio,</hi> and that he was afraid leſt this young Conquerour ſhould have the glory to drive <hi>Hannibal</hi> out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and to end the War, which had for ſo many years continued and been protracted under his Government.</p>
            <p>To ſay the truth, when <hi>Fabius</hi> firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd this project of <hi>Scipio,</hi> I believe he did it in conſideration onely of the publick ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and of the danger which the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth might incur by ſuch a way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding: but when he found <hi>Scipio</hi> every day increaſing in the eſteem of the People, envy then and ambition took hold of him, which made him ſo violent in his oppoſition.

<pb n="651" facs="tcp:47090:412"/>
and that <hi>Hannibal</hi> was a more dreadfull Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my under the Walls of <hi>Carthage</hi> than ever he had been in <hi>Italy;</hi> that it would be fatal to <hi>Rome</hi> when ever <hi>Scipio</hi> ſhould encounter his victorious Army, ſtill warm with the bloud of ſo many Roman Generals, Dictatours and Conſuls ſlain.

But <hi>Scipio</hi> afterwards fought <hi>Hannibal</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated him, and ſufficiently humbled the pride of <hi>Carthage;</hi> whereby he rais'd again the drooping ſpirits of the Romans, no more to be dejected; and firmly eſtabliſh'd their Empire, which the tempeſt of this Punick War had ſo long cauſed to fluctuate.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> lived not to ſee the proſperous end of this War, and the final o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> nor to rejoyce in the well eſtabliſh'd happineſs and ſecurity of the Commonwealth; for about the time that <hi>Hannibal</hi> left <hi>Italy,</hi> he fell ſick and died.

               <head>THE COMPARISON OF <hi>FABI<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> with <hi>PERICLES.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>YOU have here had the Lives of two perſons very illuſtrious for their Civil and Military Endowments; Let us firſt compare them in their warlike Capacity. <hi>Pericles</hi> preſided in his Commonwealth, when it was in a moſt flouriſhing and opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent condition, great in Power and happy in Succeſs; ſo that he ſeem'd to ſtand rather ſupported by, than ſupporting the Fortune of his Country. But the buſineſs of <hi>Fabius,</hi> who undertook the Government in the worſt and moſt difficult times, was not to conſerve and maintain a well eſtabliſh'd fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity of a proſperous State, but to raiſe and uphold a ſinking and ruinous Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. Beſides the Victories of <hi>Cimon,</hi> of <hi>Myronides</hi> and <hi>Leocrates,</hi> with thoſe many famous exploits of <hi>Tolmides,</hi> were made uſe of by <hi>Pericles</hi> onely to entertain the People at home, and to pleaſe their Fancy with Triumphs, Feaſts and Games of the <hi>Circus</hi>
                  <pb n="653" facs="tcp:47090:413"/>
and Theatre; not to inlarge their Empire by proſecuting the War: Whereas <hi>Fabius,</hi> when he took upon him the Government, had the frightfull object before his eyes of Roman Armies deſtroy'd, of their Generals and Conſuls ſlain, of all the Countries round ſtrew'd with the dead Bodies, and the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſtain'd with the Bloud of his fellow Citizens; and yet with his mature and ſolid Counſels, with the firmneſs of his Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he, as it were, put his Shoulders to the falling Commonwealth, and kept it up from foundring, through the failings and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of others. Perhaps it may be more eaſie to govern a City broken and tamed with calamities and adverſity, and compell'd to obey by danger and neceſſity, than to rule a People pamper'd and reſty with long Proſperity, as were the Athenians when <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricles</hi> held the reins of Government. But then again, not to be daunted nor diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd with the vaſt heap of Calamities under which the people of <hi>Rome</hi> did at that time grone and ſuccumb, argues the temper of <hi>Fabius</hi> to be invincible, and his courage more than humane.</p>
               <p>We may ſet <hi>Tarentum</hi> re-taken, againſt <hi>Samos</hi> won by <hi>Pericles,</hi> and the conqueſt of <hi>Euboea</hi> we may put in balance with the Towns of <hi>Campania;</hi> though <hi>Capua</hi> it ſelf was afterwards ſubdued by the Conſuls <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
                  <pb n="654" facs="tcp:47090:414"/>
and <hi>Appius.</hi> I do not find that <hi>Fabius</hi> won any ſet Battel, but that againſt the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurians, for which he had his Triumph; whereas <hi>Pericles</hi> erected nine Trophies for as many Victories obtain'd by Land and by Sea. But no action of <hi>Pericles</hi> can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd <note place="margin">Pericles<hi>'s numerous Victories eclipſed by one of</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius<hi>'s.</hi>
                  </note> to that memorable reſcue of <hi>Minutius,</hi> when <hi>Fabius</hi> redeem'd both him and his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my from utter deſtruction; an Action, which comprehends the height of Valour, of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and Humanity. On the other ſide, it does not appear, that <hi>Pericles</hi> was ever ſo over-reach'd as <hi>Fabius</hi> was by <hi>Hannibal</hi> with his flaming Oxen; never was there ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and ſo great an advantage loſt over an Enemy: For in the Valley of <hi>Caſilinum Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> was ſhut up without any poſſibility of forcing his way out, and yet by Stratageme in the night he frees himſelf out of thoſe Straits, and when day came, worſted the Enemy, who had him before at his mercy.</p>
               <p>It is the part of a good General, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to provide for, and judge well of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but alſo to have a clear foreſight of things to come. In this <hi>Pericles</hi> excell'd, for he admoniſh'd the Athenians, and told them beforehand, what ruine their laſt War would bring upon them, by graſping more than they were able to manage. But <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> was not ſo good a Prophet, when he denounced to the Romans, that the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:47090:414"/>
of <hi>Scipio</hi> would be the deſtruction of the Commonwealth. So that <hi>Pericles</hi> was a good Prophet of bad ſucceſs, and <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> was a bad Prophet of ſucceſs that was good. And indeed, to looſe an advantage through diffidence, is no leſs blameable in a General than to fall into danger for want of foreſight; For both theſe faults, though of a contrary nature, ſpring from the ſame root, which is want of judgment and experience.</p>
               <p>As for their Civil Policy; it is imputed to <hi>Pericles</hi> that he was a lover of War, and that no terms of Peace, offer'd by the Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians, would content him. It is true, that <hi>Fabius</hi> alſo was not for yielding any thing to the Carthaginians, but would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hazard all than leſſen the Empire of <hi>Rome;</hi> yet this difference there was between them, that <hi>Fabius</hi> made War onely to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and recover his own, and <hi>Pericles</hi> to gain what belong'd to others. But then, the mildneſs of <hi>Fabius</hi> towards his Collegue <hi>Minutius</hi> does, by way of compariſon, high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproach and condemn the eager proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Pericles,</hi> and his practices to baniſh <hi>Cimon</hi> and <hi>Thucydides,</hi> who held with the Nobility, and were true lovers of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Indeed the authority of <hi>Pericles</hi> in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> was much greater than that of <hi>Fabius</hi> in <hi>Rome;</hi> for which reaſon it was more eaſie for him to prevent miſcarriages commonly
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:47090:415"/>
ariſing from weakneſs and inſufficiency of Officers, ſince he had got the ſole nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and management of them; onely <hi>Tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mides</hi> broke looſe from him, and contrary to his orders, unadviſedly fought with the <hi>Boeotians,</hi> and was ſlain: whereas <hi>Fabius,</hi> for want of that general power and influence upon the Officers, had not the means to obviate their miſcarriages; but it had been happy for the Romans if his Authority had been greater; for ſo we may preſume, their diſaſters had been fewer.</p>
               <p>As to their liberality and publick ſpirit, <hi>Pericles</hi> was eminent in never taking any gifts, and <hi>Fabius</hi> for giving his own money to ranſome his Souldiers; though the ſum did not exceed ſix Talents. This right we muſt doe <hi>Pericles,</hi> that no man had ever greater opportunities to enrich himſelf (as having had preſents offer'd him from ſo many Kings and Princes, and States of his Alliance) yet no man was ever more free from corruption. And for the beauty and magnificence of Temples and publick Edifices, with which he adorn'd his Country, it muſt be confeſt, that all the Ornaments and Structures of <hi>Rome,</hi> to the time of the <hi>Caeſars,</hi> had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to compare, either in greatneſs of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign or of expence, with the luſtre of thoſe which <hi>Pericles</hi> onely erected at <hi>Athens.</hi>
