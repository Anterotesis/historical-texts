         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>a recorder, how prudent an observer, how sedulous
a practiser of holy discourses she was, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was, that what did slide thorow her ear, she
was desirous to place before her eye, that by those
windows they might enter in and dwell in her heart
But because by this truth I shall do advantage to the
following discourses, give me leave (my Lord) to
fancy, that this Book is derived upon your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
almost in the nature of a legacy from her, whose
every thing was dearer to your Lordship, then your
own eyes, and that what she was pleased to beleeve
apt to minister to her devotions, and the religions of
her pious and discerning soul, may also be allowed a
place in your closet, and a portion of your retirement,
and a lodging in your thoughts, that they may incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and instruct your practise and promote that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
which is and ought to be dearer to you then
all those blessings and separations with which God
hath remarked your family and person.</p>
            <p>My Lord, I confesse the publication of these
Sermons can so little serve the ends of my reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that I am therefore pleased the rather to do it,
because I cannot at all be tempted, in so doing, to
minister to any thing of vanity. Sermons may please
when they first strike the ear, and yet appear flat and
ignorant when they are offered to the eye, and to an
understanding that can consider at leisure. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that a young Gentleman of Athens being to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
for his life, hired an Orator to make his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and it pleased him well, at his first reading;
<pb facs="tcp:53465:2"/>
but when the young man by often reading it that he
might recite it publikely by heart, began to grow wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and dspleased with it, the Orator bade him consider
that the Judges and the people were to hear it but
once, and then it was likely, they at that first instant
might be as well pleased as he. This hath often repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to my mind the condition and fortune of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and that I now part with the advantage they
had in their delivery, but I have sufficiently answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
my self in that, and am at rest perfectly in my
thoughts as to that particular, if I can in any degree
serve the interest of souls, and (which is next to that)
obey the piety, and record the memory of that dear
Saint, whose name and whose soul is blessed: for in
both these ministeries, I doubt not but your Lordship
will be pleased, and account as if I had done also some
service to your self: your religion makes me sure of
the first, and your piety puts the latter past my fears.
However, I suppose in the whole account of this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair,
this publication may be esteemed but like preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to a numerous Auditory, which if I had done, it
would have been called either duty, or charity, and
therefore will not now so readily be censured for va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
if I make use of all the wayes I can to minister to
the good of souls: But because my intentions are fair
in themselves, and I hope are acceptable to God, and
will be fairly expounded by your Lordship, (whom
for so great reason I so much value) I shall not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
you or the world with an Apologie for this so free
publishing my weaknesses; I can better secure my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
<pb facs="tcp:53465:3"/>
by telling men how they ought to entertain
Sermons, for if they that read or hear, do their duty
aright, the Preacher shall soon be secured of his fame,
and untouched by censure.</p>
            <p>1. For it were well, if men would not inquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the learning of the sermon, or its deliciousnesse
to the ear or fancy, but observe its usefulnesse, not
what concerns the preacher, but what concerns them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
not what may make a vain reflexion upon
him, but what may substantially serve their own
needs, that the attending to his discourses may not be
spent in vain talk concerning him, or his disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
but may be used as a duty and a part of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to minister to edification and instruction. When
S. John reckoned the principles of evil actions, he
told but of three, <hi>The lust of the flesh, the lust of
the eyes, and the pride of life.</hi> But there was then
also in the world (and now it is grown into age, and
strength, and faction) another lust, <hi>the lust of the
ear,</hi> and a fift also, <hi>the lust of the tongue.</hi> Some
people have an insatiable appetite in hearing, and
hear onely that they may hear, and talk and make a
party: They enter into their neighbours house to kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
their candle, and espying there, a glaring fire,
sit down upon the hearth and warm themselves all
day, and forget their errand, and in the mean time,
their own fires are not lighted, nor their families in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed,
or provided for, nor any need served, but
a lazie pleasure, which is uselesse and imprudent.
Hearing or reading sermons is, or ought to be in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="tcp:53465:3"/>
to practise, for so God intended it, that <hi>faith
should come by hearing,</hi> and that <hi>charity</hi> should
come by <hi>faith,</hi> and by both together we may be saved.
For a mans ears (as Plutarch cals them) are <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutum
ansae,</hi> by them we are to hold and apprehend
vertue, and unlesse we use them as men do vessels of
dishonour, filling them with things fit to be thrown
away, with any thing that is not necessary, we are by
them more neerly brought to God, then by all the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
beside. For although things placed before the
eye affect the minde more readily then the things we
usually hear, yet the reason of that is, because we hear
<hi>carelesly,</hi> and we hear <hi>variety;</hi> the same species
dwels upon the eye, and represents the same object in
union and single representment, but the objects of the
ear are broken into fragments of periods, and words,
and syllables, and must be attended with a carefull
understanding; and because every thing diverts the
sound, and every thing cals off the understanding,
and the spirit of a man is truantly, and trifling; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is that what men hear, does so little affect them,
and so weakly work toward the purposes of vertue, &amp;
yet nothing does so affect the minde of man as those
voices to which we cannot chuse but attend, and <hi>thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
and <hi>all loud voices</hi> from Heaven rend the most
stony heart, and makes the most obstinate pay to God
the homage of trembling, and fear, and the still
voice of God usually takes the tribute of love, and
choice, and obedience. Now since hearing is so ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
an instrument of conveying impresses and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb facs="tcp:53465:4"/>
of things, and exciting purposes, and fixing reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,
(unlesse we hear weakly and imperfectly)
it will be of the greater concernment that we be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to hear in order to such purposes, which are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
of the soul, and of the spirit, and not to dwell
in fancy and speculation, in pleasures and trifling ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests,
which continue the soul in its infancy and child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
never letting it go forth into the wisdom and
vertues of a man. I have read concerning Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius
of Sicily, that being delighted extremely with a
Ministrel that sung well, and struck his Harp
dexterously, he promised to give him a great reward,
and that raised the fancy of the Man, and made him
play better. But when the musick was done and the
man waited for his great hope, the King dismissed
him empty, telling him, that he should carry away as
much of the promised reward, as himself did of the
Musick, and that he had payed him sufficiently with
the pleasure of the promise for the pleasure of his
song: both their ears had been equally delighted and
the profit just none at all: So it is in many mens hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sermons, they admire the Preacher, and he
pleases their ears, and neither of them both bear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with them any good, and the hearer hath as little
good by the sermon, as the Preacher by the ayr of
the peoples breath, when they make a noise, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire,
and understand not. And that also is a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
caution I desire all men would take.</p>
            <p>2. That they may never trouble the affairs of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
and hearing respectively, with admiring the
<pb facs="tcp:53465:4"/>
person of any man. To admire a preacher is such a
reward of his pains or worth, as if you should crown
a Conqueror with a garland of roses, or a Bride with
Laurell; it is an undecency, it is no part of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
which could be intended for him. For though it
be a good natur'd folly, yet it hath in it much danger,
for by that means, the Preacher may lead his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
captive, and make them servants of a faction,
or of a lust; it makes them so much the lesse to be
servants of Christ, by how much they <hi>call any man
Master upon earth;</hi> it weakens the heart and
hands of others, it places themselves in a rank much
below their proper station, changing from hearing
<hi>the word of God,</hi> to admiration of <hi>the person and
faces of men,</hi> and it being a <hi>fault</hi> that falls upon
the more easie natures and softer understandings,
does more easily abuse a man; and though such a
person may have the good fortune to admire a good
man and a wise, yet it is an ill disposition, and makes
him liable to every mans abuse: <hi>Stupidum ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem
quâvis oratione percelli,</hi> said <hi>Heraclitus.</hi>
An undiscerning person is apt to be cozened by
every oration: And besides this, That Preacher
whom some do admire, others will most certainly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
and that also is to be provided against with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
and you must not admire too forwardly, <hi>for
your own sake,</hi> lest you fall into the hands of a
worse preacher, <hi>and for his sake,</hi> whom when you
admire you also love, for others will be apt to envy him.</p>
            <p>3. But that must by all men be avoided; for envy
<pb facs="tcp:53465:5"/>
is the worst counsellour in the world, and the worst
hearer of a wise discourse. I pity those men who live
upon flattery and wonder, and while they sit at the
foot of the Doctors chair, stare in his face, and cry
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>rarely spoken, admirably done,</hi>
they are like callow and unfeathered birds, gaping
perpetually to be fed from anothers mouth, and they
<hi>never come to the knowledge of the truth,</hi> such
a knowledge as is effective, and expressed in a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and holy life. But those men that envy the
preacher; besides that they are great enemies of the
Holy Ghost, and are spitefully evil <hi>because God is
good to him,</hi> they are also enemies to themselves.
He that envies the honours, or the riches of another,
envies for his own sake, and he would fain be rich
with that wealth which sweats in his neighbours cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,
but he that envies him that makes good sermons,
envies himself, and is angry because himself may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the benefit, and be <hi>improved,</hi> or <hi>delighted</hi>
or <hi>instructed</hi> by another. He that is apt fondly to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
any mans person must cure himself by conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
that the Preacher is Gods minister and servant,
that he speaks Gods word and does it by the Divine
assistance, that he hath nothing of his own but sin and
imperfection, that he does but his duty and that also
hardly enough, that he is highly answerable for his
talent, and stands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> deeply charged with the cure of
souls, and therefore that he is to <hi>be highly esteemed
for the work sake,</hi> not for the person; his industry
and his charity is to be beloved, his ability is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<pb facs="tcp:53465:5"/>
upon another stock, and <hi>for it,</hi> the preacher
and the hearer are both to give God thanks, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is due to the man <hi>for that,</hi> save onely, that it
is the rather to be imployed, because by it we may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be instructed, but if any other reflexion be made
upon his person, it is next to the sin and danger of
Herod and the people, when the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

pleased, and Herod was admired, and God was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
and an Angel was sent to strike him with death
and with dishonour. But the envy against a preacher
is to be cured by a contrary discourse, and we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that he is in the place of God, and hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the gift of God, and the aids of the holy Ghost,
that by his abilities God is glorified, and we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed,
and the interests of vertue, and holy religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
are promoted, that by this means God who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
that all souls should serve him for ever, is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to have a fairer harvest of glory and service, and
therefore that envie is against him: that if we envie
because we are not the instrument of this good to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
we must consider tha we desire the praise to
our selves not to God. <hi>Admiration</hi> of a man sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
him to be inferiour to the person so admired, but
then he is pleased so to be, but <hi>envie</hi> supposes him as
low, and he is displeased at it, and the envious man is
not onely lesse then the other mans vertue, but also
contrary: the former is a <hi>vanity,</hi> but this is a <hi>vice,
that wants wisdom,</hi> but <hi>this wants wisdom</hi> and
<hi>charity</hi> too, that supposes an absence of some good,
<pb facs="tcp:53465:6"/>
but this is a direct affliction and calamity.</p>
            <p>4. And after all this, if the preacher be not despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
he may proceed cheerfully in doing his duty, and
the hearer may have some advantages by every Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.
I remember that Homer sayes the woers of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelope
laught at Vlisses, because at his return he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
for a loaf, and did not, to shew his gallantry, call
for swords and spears; Vlysses was so wise as to call for
that he needed, and had it, and it did him more good
then a whole armory would in his case: so is the plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
part of an easie, and honest sermon, it is <hi>the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
milk of the word,</hi> and nourishes a mans soul,
though represented in its own naturall simplicity, and
there is hardly any Orator, but you may finde occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to praise something of him. When Plato misliked
the order and disposition of the Oration of Lysias, yet
he praised the good words, and the elocution of the
man. Euripides was commended for his fulness, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menides
for his composition. Phocilides for his easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
Archilochus for his argument, Sophocles for the
unequalnesse of his stile: So may men praise their
Preacher, he speaks pertinently, or he contrives wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily,
or he speaks comely, or the man is pious, or chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
or he hath a good text, or he speaks plainly, or he
is not tedious or if he be he is at least industrious, or he
is the messenger of God and that will not fail us, and
let us love him for that; and we know those that love
can easily commend any thing, because they like every
thing: and they say, fair men are like angels, and the
black are manly, and the pale look like honey and the
<pb facs="tcp:53465:6"/>
stars, and the cro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> nosed are like the sons of Kings,
and if they be flat they are gentle and easie, and if
they be deformed they are humble, and not to be despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
because they have upon them the impresses of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and they are the sons of God. He that despises
his Preacher, is a hearer of arts and learning, not of
the word of God, and though when the word of God is
set off with advantages and entertainments of the
better faculties of our humanity, it is more usefull and
of more effect, yet when the word of God is spoken tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
though but read in plain language, it will become the
disciple of Jesus to love that man whom God sends,
and the publik order, and the laws have imployed, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then to despise the weaknesse of him who deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
a <hi>mighty word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it is fit that men should be affected and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
when they hear and read sermons comming hither
<hi>not as into a theatre,</hi> where men observe the gestures
and noises of the people, the brow and eyes of the most
busie censurers, and make parties, and go aside with
them that dislike every thing, or else admire not the
things, but the persons: <hi>But as to a sacrifice,</hi> and as
<hi>unto a school,</hi> where vertue is taught and exercised,
and none come but such as put themselves under disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
and intend to grow wiser, and more vertuous,
to appease their passion, from violent to become
smooth and even, to have their faith established, and
their hope confirmed &amp; their charity enlarged. They
that are otherwise affected do not do their duty but if
they be so minded as they ought, I and all men of my
<pb facs="tcp:53465:7"/>
imployment shall be secured against the tongues and
faces of men who are <hi>ingeniosi in alieno libro,</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to abuse and undervalue another mans book: And
yet besides these spirituall arts already reckoned, I
have one security more, for (unlesse I deceive my
self) I intend the glory of God sincerely, and the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of Jesus in this publication, and therefore being
I <hi>do not seek my self,</hi> or my own reputation, I
shall not be troubled if they be <hi>lost</hi> in the voyces of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
people, so that I be accepted of God, and <hi>found
of him</hi> in the day of the Lords visitation.</p>
            <p>My Lord, It was your charity and noblenesse that gave
me opportunity to do this service (little or great) unto reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and whoever shall find any advantage to their soul, by
reading the following discourse, if they know how to blesse
God, and to blesse all them that are Gods instruments in doing
them benefit, will (I hope) help to procure blessings to your
Person and Family, and say a holy prayer, and name your
Lordship in their Letanies, and remember, that at your own
charges you have digged a well, and placed cisterns in the high
wayes, that they may drink and be refreshed, and their souls
may blesse you. My Lord, I hope this, even because I very
much desire it, and because you exceedingly deserve it, and
above all, because <hi>God is good and gracious,</hi> and loves to
reward such a charity, and such a religion as is yours, by which
you have imployed me in the service of God, and in ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
to your Family. My Lord, I am most heartily, and for

it contains in it such glorious mysteries which were revealed by
the immediate inspirations of the Spirit, not onely in the matter
it self, but also in the manner and powers to apprehend them. For
what power of humane understanding could have found out,
the incarnation of a God; that two natures [a finite, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite]
could have been concentred into one hypostasis (or person):
that a virgin should be a Mother, that dead men should live again,
that the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, the ashes of dissolved bones should become
bright as the Sun, blessed as Angels, swift in motion as thought,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
clear as the purest Noone: that God should so love us, as to be
willing to be reconcil'd to us, and yet that himself must dye
that he might pardon us: that Gods most Holy Son should
give us his body to eat, and his bloud to crown our chalices, and
his Spirit to sanctifie our souls, to turn our bodies into temperance,
our <hi>souls</hi> into <hi>mindes,</hi> our mindes into <hi>Spirit,</hi> our Spirit into
<hi>glory:</hi> that he who can give us all things, who is Lord of Men
and Angels, and King of all the Creatures should pray to God for
us without intermission: that he who reigns over all the world,
should at the day of judgement give up the Kingdom to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
and yet after this resignation, himself and we with him, should
for ever reign the more gloriously: that we should be justified by
Faith in Christ; and that charity should be a part of faith; and that
both should work as acts of duty, and as acts of relation: that God
should Crown the imperfect endeavours of his Saints with glory,
and that a humane act should be rewarded with an eternal inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
that the wicked for the transient pleasure of a few minutes
should be tormented with an absolute eternity of pains: that the
waters of baptisme when they are hallowed by the Spirit shall
purge the soul from sin: and that the Spirit of a man shall be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
with the consecrated and mysterious elements: and that any
such nourishment should bring a man up to heaven: and after all
this, that all Christian People, all that will be saved must be <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of the Divine nature;</hi> of the Nature, the infinite nature of
God, and, must dwell in Christ and Christ must dwell in them, and
they must be in the Spirit, and the Spirit must be for ever in them;
these are articles of so mysterious a Philosophy, that we could have
inferred them from no premises, discours'd them upon the stock of
no naturall, or scientificall principles; nothing but God, and Gods
spirit could have taught them to us: and therefore the Gospel is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

            <p>He that shall discourse Euclids elements to a swine, or preach
(as Venerable Bede's story reports of him) to a rock, or talk
Metaphysicks to a Bore, will as much prevail upon his assembly
as S. Peter, and S. Paul could do upon <hi>uncircumcised hearts and
ears,</hi> upon the indisposed Greeks, and prejudicate Jews. An
Ox will relish the tender flesh of Kids with as much gust and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> appetite, as an unspirituall, and unsanctified man, will do the
discourses of Angels, or of an Apostle, if he should come to
preach the secrets of the Gospel. And we finde it true by a sad
experience. How many times doth God speak to us by his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
the Prophets, by his Son, by his Apostles, by sermons,
by spirituall books, by thousands of homilies, and arts of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
and insinuation; and we sit as unconcerned as the pillars of a
Church, and hear the sermons as the Athenians did a story, or as
we read a gazet: and if ever it come to passe that we tremble as
Felix did, when we hear a sad story of death, of <hi>righteousnesse,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               <hi>and judgement to come,</hi> then we put it off to another time, or we
forget it, and think we had nothing to do but to give the good
man a hearing, and (as Anacharsis said of the Greeks, they used
money for nothing but to cast account withall; so) our hearers
make use of sermons and discourses Evangelical, but to fill up
void spaces of our time; to help to tell an hour with, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
tediousnesse: The reason of this is a sad condemnation to
such persons; they have not yet entertained the Spirit of God,
they are in darknesse: they were washed in water, but never
baptized with the Spirit; <hi>for these things are spiritually discerned.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> They would think the Preacher rude, if he should say they are not
Christians, they are not within the Covenant of the Gospel: but
it is certain that <hi>the spirit of Manifestation</hi> is not yet upon them;
and that is the first effect of the Spirit, whereby we can be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
sons of God, or relatives of Christ. If we do not apprehend,
and greedily suck in the precepts of this holy Discipline as aptly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53465:10"/>
as Merchants do discourse of gain, or Farmers of fair har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vests,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
we have nothing but the Name of Christians; but we are
no more such really, then Mandrakes are men, or spunges are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
creatures.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. The Gospel is called <hi>Spirit,</hi> because it consists of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Promises, and Spiritual precepts, and makes all men that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
it, truly to be Spiritual men: and therefore <hi>S.</hi> Paul addes
an Epithete beyond this,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 6.</note> calling it <hi>a quickening Spirit,</hi> that is, it puts
life into our Spirits, which the law could not. The law bound us
to punishment, but did not help us to obedience, because it gave
not the promise of Eternal life to its Disciples. <hi>The Spirit,</hi> that is, <hi>the</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
               <hi>Gospel</hi> onely does this: and this alone is it which comforts affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
mindes, which puts activenesse into wearyed Spirits, which
inflames our cold desires, and does <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> blows up sparks into
live coles, and coles up to flames, and flames to perpetual burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:
and it is impossible that any man who believes, and
considers the great, the infinite, the unspeakable, the unimagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
the never ceasing joyes, that are prepared for all the sons
and daughters of the Gospel should not desire them; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
he be a fool, he cannot but use means to obtain them, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective,
hearty pursuances. For it is not directly in the nature <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
of a man to neglect so great a good; there must be something in
his manners, some obliquity in his will, or madnesse in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuals,
or incapacity in his naturals that must make him
sleep such a reward away, or change it for the pleasure of a
drunken feaver, or the vanity of a Mistresse, or the rage of a
passion, or the unreasonablenesse of any sin. However; this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
is the life of all our actions, and the Spirit that first taught it is
the life of our soules.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. But beyond this, is the reason which is the consummation
of all the faithful. The <hi>Gospel</hi> is called the <hi>Spirit,</hi> because by,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
and in the Gospel, God hath given to us not onely <hi>the Spirit of
manifestation,</hi> that is, of instruction and of Catechisme, of faith and
confident assent; but <hi>the Spirit of Confirmation</hi> or <hi>obsignation</hi> to all
them that believe and obey the Gospel of Christ; that is, the power
of God is come upon our hearts, by which in an admirable manner
we are made sure of a glorious inheritance; made sure (I say) in
the nature of the thing; and our own persuasions also are confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with an excellent, a comfortable, a discerning and a reasonable
hope: in the strength of which, and by whose ayde, as we do not
doubt of the performance of the promise: so we vigorously pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
all the parts of the condition, and are inabled to work all the
work of God, so as not to be affrighted with fear, or seduced by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
or oppressed by lust, or drawn off by evil example, or abused
by riches, or imprison'd by ambition and secular designes: This
the Spirit of God does work in all his Servants; and is called
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53465:10"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
               <hi>the spirit of obsignation,</hi> or <hi>the confirming spirit,</hi> because it confirms
our hope, and assures our title to life eternall; and by means of it,
and other its collateral assistances, it also confirms us in our duty,
that we may not onely professe in word, but live lives according
to the Gospel. And this is the sense of [the Spirit] mention<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d in

Gospel, or of the <hi>spirit of manifestation,</hi> if ye be truly intitled to
God, and have received the promise of the Father, then are ye
not carnal men; ye are <hi>spirituall,</hi> ye are <hi>in the Spirit:</hi> if ye have
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the Spirit in one sense to any purpose, ye have it also in another:

other pretences are vain, <hi>ye are still in the flesh,</hi> which shall never <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit
the kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Spirit] that is, in the power of the spirit; so the Greeks
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> call him <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> who is possessed by a spirit, whom God hath filled
with a coelestial immission; he is said to be <hi>in God,</hi> when God is <hi>in
him:</hi> and it is a similitude taken from persons encompassed with
guards; they are <hi>in custodiâ,</hi> that is, in their power, under their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
moved at their dispose, they rest in their time, and receive
laws from their authority, and admit visiters whom they appoint,
and must be employed as they shall suffer; so are men who are in
the Spirit, that is, they beleeve as he teaches, they work as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables,
they choose what he calls good, they are friends of his
friends, and they hate with his hatred; with this onely difference,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that persons in custody, are forced to do what their keepers please,
and nothing is free but their wils; but they that are under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Spirit, do all things which the Spirit commands, but
they do them cheerfully; and their will is now the prisoner, but it
is <hi>in liberâ custodiâ,</hi> the will is where it ought to be, and where it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
to be, and it cannot easily choose any thing else, because it is
extreamly in love with this: as the Saints and Angels in their state
of Beatific vision, cannot choose but love God: and yet the liberty
of their choice is not lessen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, because the object fils all the capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the will, and the understanding. Indifferency to an object is
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the lowest degree of liberty, and supposes unworthinesse, or defect
in the object, or the apprehension; but the will is then the freest
and most perfect in its operation, when it intirely pursues a good
with so certain determination, and clear election that the contrary
evil cannot come into dispute or pretence: Such in our proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
is the liberty of the sons of God; it is an holy and amiable cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
to the Spirit; the will of man is in love with those chains,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53465:11"/>
which draws to God, and loves the fetters that confine us to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
pleasures and religion of the kingdom. And as no man will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
that his temples are restraind, and his head is prisoner when it
is encircled with a crown: So when the Son of God had made us
free, and hath onely subjected us to the service and dominion of the
Spirit, we are free as Princes within the circles of their Diadem,
and our chains are bracelets, and the law is a law of liberty, and
<hi>his service is perfect freedom;</hi> and the more we are subjects, the
more <hi>we shall reign as Kings;</hi> and the faster we run, the easier is our
burden, and Christs yoke is like feathers to a bird, not loads, but
helps to motion, without them the body fals: and we do not pity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
birds when in summer we wish them unfeathered and callow, or
bald as egges, that they might be cooler and lighter: such is the load
and captivity of the soul when we do the work of God and are
his servants, and under the Government of the spirit: They that
strive to be quit of this subjection, love the liberty of out-laws,
and the licentiousness of anarchy, and the freedom of sad widows
and distressed Orphans: For so Rebels and fools and children
long to be rid of their Princes, and their Guardians, and their Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
that they may be accursed without law, and be undone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
control and be ignorant and miserable without a teacher and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
without discipline. He that <hi>is in the Spirit</hi> is under Tutours and
Governours, untill the time appointed of the Father, just as all
great Heirs are; onely, the first seizure the Spirit makes, is
upon the will. He that loves the yoke of Christ, and the
discipline of the Gospel, he is <hi>in the Spirit,</hi> that is, in the spirits
power.</p>
            <p>Upon this foundation, the Apostle hath built these two propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions.
1. Whosoever hath not the Spirit of Christ, he is
none of his, he does not belong to Christ at all: he is not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker
of his Spirit, and therefore shall never be partaker of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
glory.</p>
            <p>2. Whosoever is in Christ, is dead to sin, and lives to
the Spirit of Christ, that is, lives a Spirituall, a holy and a san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifyed
life. These are to be considered distinctly.</p>
            <p>1. All that belong to Christ have the Spirit of Christ, Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
before the ascension, our blessed Saviour bid his Disciples <hi>tarry
in Jerusalem till they should receive the promise of the Father,</hi>
Whosoever stay at Jerusalem, and are in the actuall Communion
of the Church of God shall certainly receive this promise. <hi>For it
is made to you and to your children</hi> (saith S. Peter) <hi>and to as many</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
               <hi>as the Lord our God shall call,</hi> All shall receive the Spirit of Christ,
the promise of the Father, because this was the great instrument
of distinction between the Law and the Gospel, In the Law God
gave his Spirit, 1. to some; to them 2. extraregularly, 3. without
solennity, 4. in small proportions, like the dew upon Gideons
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53465:11"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> fleece; a little portion was wet sometime with the dew of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,

and that by secret whispers, and sometimes inarticulate by way of
enthusiasme, rather then of instruction, and God spake by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
transmitting the sound, as thorough an Organ pipe, things
which themselves oftentimes understood not. But in the Gospel,
the spirit is given without measure; first powred forth upon our
head Christ Jesus; then descending upon the beard of Aaron, the
Fathers of the Church, and thence falling like the tears of the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> balsam of Judea upon the foot of the plant, upon the lowest of the
people. And this is given regularly to all that ask it, to all that
can receive it, and by a solemn ceremony and conveyed by a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament:
and is now, not the Daughter of a voice, but the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of many voices, of divided tongues, and united hearts, of the
tongues of Prophets, and the duty of Saints, of the Sermons of
Apostles, and the wisdom of Governours; It is the Parent of bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and fortitude to Martyrs, the fountain of learning to Doctors,
an Ocean of all things excellent to all who are within the ship, and
bounds of the Catholike Church: so that Old men and young
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> men, maidens and boyes, the scribe and the unlearned, the Judge
and the Advocate, the Priest and the people are full of the Spirit,
if they belong to God: Moses's wish is fulfilled, and all the Lords
people are Prophets in some sense or other.</p>

               </gap>d with spiritual and heavenly
relishes. For when Gods Spirit hath entred into us and possessed us
as his Temple, or as his dwelling, instantly we begin to taste Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,
and to loath the diet of Egypt; we begin to consider concerning
heaven, and to prefer eternity before moments, and to love the
pleasures of the soul, above the sottish and beastly pleasures of the
body. Then we can consider that the pleasures of a drunken meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cannot make recompence for the pains of a surfet, and that
nights intemperance; much lesse for the torments of eternity: Then
we are quick to discern that the itch and scab of lustful appetites is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
not worth the charges of a Surgeon, much lesse can it pay for the
disgrace, the danger, the sicknesse, the death, and the hell of lustfull
persons; Then we wonder that any man should venture his head
to get a crown unjustly; or that for the hazard of a victory, he should
throw away all his hopes of heaven certainly.</p>
            <p>A man that hath tasted of Gods Spirit can instantly discern the
madnesse that is in rage, the folly and the disease that is in envy, the
anguish and tediousnesse that is in lust, the dishonor that is in break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our faith, and telling a lie; and understands things truly as they
are; that is, that charity is the greatest noblenesse in the world; that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
religion hath in it the greatest pleasures; that temperance is the best
security of health; that humility is the surest way to honour; and
all these relishes are nothing but antepasts of heaven, where the
quintessence of all these pleasures shall be swallowed for ever;
where the chast shall follow the Lamb, and the virgins sing there
where the Mother of God shall reign; and the zealous converters
of souls, and labourers in Gods vineyard shall worship eternally
where S. Peter and S. Paul do wear their <hi>crown of righteousnesse;</hi> and
the patient persons shall be rewarded with Job, and the meek per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
with Christ and Moses, and all with God; the very expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
of which proceeding from a hope begotten in us by <hi>the spirit of
manifestation,</hi> and bred up and strengthened by <hi>the spirit of obsignation</hi>
is so delicious an entertainment of all our reasonable appetites, that
a spirituall man can no more be removed, or intied from the love of
God, and of religion, then the Moon from her Orb, or a Mother
from loving the son of her joyes, and of her sorrows.</p>
            <p>This was observed by S. Peter,<note place="margin">1 Ep. 2. chap. ver. 5.</note>

            <p>And if it were given to any of us to see Paradise, or the third
heaven (as it was to S. Paul) could it be that ever we should love

as an anidote against sorrows, against impatience, against the evil
accidents of the world, and against the oppression and sinking of
our spirits under the crosse. There are in Scripture noted two
births besides the naturall; to which also by analogy we may adde
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> a third. The first is to be <hi>born of water and the Spirit.</hi> It is <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>upon the waters of Baptisme.</hi> The second is to be born of <hi>Spirit and
fire,</hi> for so Christ was promised to <hi>baptize us with the Holy Ghost and
with fire;</hi> that is, <hi>cum spiritu igneo,</hi> with a fiery spirit, the Spirit
as it descended in Pentecost in the shape of fiery tongues. And as
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53465:13"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the watry spirit washed away the sins of the Church, so the spirit

               </gap>
(sayes Plutarch) the Spirit is the same under both the titles,
and it enables the Church with gifts and graces: And from these <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
there is another operation of the new birth, but the same Spirit,
the spirit of rejoycing,<note place="margin">Rom. 15. 13.</note> or <hi>spiritus exultans, spiritus laetitiae. Now
the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in beleeving, that ye may
abound in hope through the power of the Holy Ghost.</hi> There is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
joy and spirituall rejoycing, that accompanies them in whom
the Holy Ghost doth dwell; a joy in the midst of sorrow; a joy

spirituall joyes, may very well dwell together; and if God did
not supply us out of his storehouses, the sorrows of this world
would be mere and unmixt, and the troubles of persecution would
be too great for naturall considences. For who shall make him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to suffer torments, in testimony of a proposition of naturall Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy?
And by what instruments shall we comfort a man who is

what it is to want the Spirit of God, <hi>the Spirit of comfort.</hi> Now
this Spirit of comfort is the hope and confidence, the certain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of partaking in the inheritance of Jesus. <hi>This is the faith
and patience of the Saints,</hi> this is the refreshment of all wearied
travellers, the cordiall of all languishing sinners, the support of the
scrupulous, the guide of the doubtfull, the anchor of timorous
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and fluctuating souls, the confidence and the staff of the penitent.
He that is deprived of his whole estate for a good conscience, by
the Spirit he meets this comfort, that he shall finde it again with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
in the day of restitution: and this comfort was so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
in the first dayes of Christianity, that it was no infrequent thing
to see holy persons court a Martyrdom with a fondnesse as great as
is our impatience, and timorousnesse in every persecution. Till the

to overflow the spirit of a man, and thereby loves to refresh
his sorrows; yet that is from a secret principle, not regularly given
not to be waitd for, not to be prayed for, and it may fail us if we
think upon it: but the hope of life eternall can never fail us, and
the joy of that is great enough to make us suffer any thing, or to
do any thing

as the spirit of rejoycing, not a sullen, melancholy spirit, not
the spirit of bondage or of a slave, but the Spirit of his Son,
consigning us by a holy conscience to <hi>joyes unspeakable and full of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
glory:</hi> And from hence you may also infer that those who sink

            <p>3. THe Spirit of God is given us, as an antidote against evil <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
concupiscences, and sinfull desires, and is then called the
spirit of prayer and supplication. For ever since the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of the outward man prevail<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d upon the ruins of the soul,
all our desires were sensuall, and therefore hurtfull: for ever after,
our body grew to be our enemy. In the loosnesses of nature, and
amongst the ignorance, or imperfection of Gentile Philosophy,
men used to pray with their hands full of rapine, and their mouths
of blood, and their hearts of malice; and they prayed according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for an opportunity to steal, for a fair body, for a prosperous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
revenge, for a prevailing malice, for the satisfaction of whatsoever
they could be tempted to by any object, by any lust, by any Devil
whatsoever.</p>
            <p>The Jews were better taught, for God was their teacher, and
he gave the spirit to them in single rayes. But as the <hi>spirit of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:53465:14"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> was given to them under a <hi>seal,</hi> and within a <hi>veile;</hi> so
the <hi>spirit of Manifestation</hi> or <hi>patefaction</hi> was like the gem of a
vine, or the bud of a rose, plain <hi>indices</hi> and significations
of life, and principles of juice and sweetnesse: but yet
scarce out of the doors of their causes; they had the infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of knowledge; and revelations to them were given as
Catechisme is taught to our children; which they read with
the eye of a bird, and speak with the tongue of a bee, and
understand with the heart of a childe, that is, weakly
and imperfectly: and they understood so little; that 1. They <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> thought God heard them not unlesse they spake their prayers,
at least efforming their words within their lips: and 2. Their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
forms of prayer were so few and seldome, that to teach a
forme of prayer, or to compose a collect was thought a worke
fit for a Prophet, or the founder of an institution. 3. Adde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
to this that as their promises were temporal, so were
their hopes: as were their hopes so were their desires; and
according to their desires so were their prayers. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Psalms of <hi>David</hi> was their Great office, and the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> treasury of devotion to their Nation (and very worthily)
yet it was full of wishes for temporals, invocations of
GOD the <hi>Avenger,</hi> on GOD <hi>the Lord of Hosts,</hi> on God
the Enemy of their Enemies; and they desired their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be prospered, and themselves blessed, and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
from all the world, by the effects of such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires.
This was the state of prayer in their Synagogue;
save onely that it had also this allay. 4. That their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
to GOD were crasse, material, typical and full of
shadows, and imagery, paterns of things to come, and so in
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> its very being and constitution was relative and imperfect.
But that we may see how <hi>great things the Lord hath done for
us,</hi> God hath <hi>powred his spirit into our hearts,</hi> the <hi>spirit of
prayer and supplication,</hi> and now. 1. Christians <hi>pray in their</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>spirit,</hi> with sighs and groans, and know that GOD who
dwells within them, can as clearly distinguish those secret
accents, and read their meaning in the Spirit as plainly
as he knows the voice of his own thunder, or could dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the letter of the law written in the tables of stone by
the finger of God. 2. <hi>likewise the spirit helpeth our infirmities,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
               <hi>for we know not what we should pray for as we ought.</hi> That
is, when God sends an affliction or persecution upon us,
we are indeed extreme apt to lay our hand upon the wound
and never take it off but when we lift it up in prayer to be
delivered from that sadnesse; and then we pray fervently to
be cured of a sicknesse, to be delivered from a Tyrant, to
be snatched from the grave, not to perish in the danger. But the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53465:15"/>
spirit of God hath from all sad accidents drawn the veil of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
and the cloud of intolerablenesse, and hath taught us that our
happinesse cannot consist in freedom, or deliverances from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions,
but in patience, resignation, and noble sufferance; and
that we are not then so blessed when God hath turn'd our scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
into ease and delicacy, as when we convert our very scorpions
into the exercise of vertues: so that now <hi>the spirit having helped
our infirmities,</hi> that is, comforted our weaknesses and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
our sorrows and impatience by this proposition, that <hi>[All
things work together for the good of them that fear God]</hi> he
hath taught us to pray for grace, for patience under <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
the crosse, for Charity to our persecutors, for rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
in tribulations, for perseverance and boldnesse in
the faith; and for whatsoever will bring us safely to
Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Whereas onely a <hi>Moses,</hi> or a <hi>Samuel,</hi> a <hi>David,</hi> or a <hi>Daniel,</hi>
a <hi>John</hi> the Baptist, or the Messias himself could describe
and indite formes of prayer and thanksgiving to the time
and accent of Heaven, now every wise and good Man is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
perfectly in the Scriptures (which are the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of the spirit) what things he may, and what things he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
must ask for.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. The Spirit of God hath made our services to be spiritual,
intellectual, holy, and effects of choice and religion, the
consequents of a spiritual sacrifice, and of a holy union with
God: The prayer of a Christian is with the effects of the
<hi>spirit of Sanctification;</hi> and then we <hi>pray with the Spirit</hi>
when we pray with Holinesse, which is the great fruit, the
principal gift of the spirit. And this is by Saint <hi>James</hi> called
[the prayer of faith] and is said to be certain that it shall
prevail. Such a praying with the spirit, when our prayers are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
the voices of our spirits, and our spirits are first taught, then
sanctified by Gods spirit, shall never fail of its effect; because
then it is, that <hi>the spirit himself maketh intercession for us:</hi> that
is, hath enabled us to do it upon his strengths, we speak his
sense, we live his life, we breath his accents, we desire in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to his purposes, and our persons are Gracious by his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and are accepted by his interpellation and intercession in
the act and offices of Christ. This is <hi>praying with the spirit.</hi> To
which by way of explication I adde these two annexes of holy
prayer, in respect of which also, every good man prayes with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
the spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. The spirit gives us great relish and appetite to our prayers
and this Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls [serving of God in his spirit
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that is,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 9.</note> with a willing minde; not as <hi>Jonas</hi> did
his errand, but as Christ did die for us, he was straitned till
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53465:15"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> he had accomplished it. And they that say their prayers out of
custome onely, or to comply with external circumstances, or
collateral advantages, or pray with trouble and unwillingnesse,
give a very great testimony that they have not the spirit of
Christ within them, that <hi>spirit</hi> which <hi>maketh intercession for the
Saints:</hi> but he that delighteth in his prayers, not by a sensible or
phantastic pleasure, but whose choice dwells in his prayers, and
whose conversation is with God in holy living, and praying accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
that man hath the spirit of Christ, and therfore belongs to
Christ; for by this spirit it is that Christ prayes in Heaven
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> for us: and if we do not pray on earth in the same manner
according to our measures; we had as good hold our
peace, our prayers are an abominable sacrifice, and send up
to God no better a perfume, then if wee burned <hi>assa
faetida,</hi> or the raw flesh of a murdered man upon the altar of
incense.</p>
            <p>6. The spirit of Christ and of prayer helps our infirmities,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
by giving us confidence and importunity. I put them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For as our faith is, and our trust in God, so is our hope,
and so is our prayer, weary or lasting, long or short, not in
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> words, but in works, and in desires For the words of prayer are
no part of the spirit of prayer: words may be the body of it, but
the spirit of prayer alwayes consists in holinesse, that is in
holy desires, and holy actions: words are not properly capable
of being holy; all words are in themselves se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vants of things, and
the holinesse of a prayer is not at all concerned in the manner of
its expression, but in the spirit of it, that is, in the violence
of its desires, and the innocence of its ends, and the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of its imployment: this is the verification of that great
Prophecie which Christ made; that <hi>[in all the world the true
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> worshippers should worship in spirit and in truth]</hi> that is, with
a pure minde, with holy desires, for spiritual things accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the minde of the spirit in imitation of Christs intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
with perseverance, with charity, or love. That is the
spirit of God, and these are the spiritualities of the Gospel,
and the formalities of prayer as they are Christian and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall.</p>
            <p>7. Some men have thought of a seventh way, and explicate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
our praying in the spirit, by a mere volubilty of language:
which indeed is a direct undervaluing the spirit of God and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of Christ, <hi>the spirit of manifestation</hi> and <hi>intercession;</hi> it is to
return to the materiality and imperfection of the law, it is to
worship God in outward forms, and to think that Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
consists in shels and rinds, in lips and voices, in sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
and images of things: it is to retire from Christ to <hi>Moses,</hi>
and at the best, it is a going from real graces to imaginary gifts: and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53465:16"/>
when praying with the spirit hath in it so many excellencies, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
consists of so many parts of holinesse, and sanctification and is an
act of the inner man, we shall be infinitely mistaken, if we let go
this substance, and catch at a shadow, and sit down and rest in
the imagination of an improbable, unnecessary, uselesse <hi>gift of
speaking</hi> to which the nature of many men, and the art of all learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men, and the very use and confidence of ignorant men is
too abundantly sufficient. Let us not so despise the spirit of
Christ as to make it no other then the breath of our lungs.
* For though it might be possible that at the first, and when
formes of prayer were few and seldome, the spirit of God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
might dictatethe very words to the Apostles, and first Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
yet it follows not that therfore he does so still to all
that pretend praying with the spirit. For if he did not then,
at the first, dictate words (as we know not whether he did or
no) why shall he be suppos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d to do so now? If he did then;
it follows that he does not now,; because his doing it then,
was sufficient for all men since: for so the formes taught
by the spirit were paternes for others to imitate in all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending
ages of the Church. There was once an occasion so great
that the spirit of God did think it a work <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it for him to teach a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
man to weave silke, or embroider gold, or woke in brasse, (as
it happened to <hi>Besaleel</hi> and <hi>Aholiab:)</hi> But then every weaver
or worker in brasse may by the same reason pretend that he
works by the spirit, as that he prayes by the spirit, if by <hi>prayer</hi>
he means forming the words. For although in the ease of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it was certain that the spirit did teach: in the ease of indit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or forming the words it is not certain whether he did or no;
yet because in both it was extraordinary (if it was at all) and
ever since, in both it is infinitely needlesse; to pretend the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in forms of every mans making (even though they be of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
contrary religions, and pray one against the other) it may serve
an end of a phantastic and hypochondriacal religion, or a
secret ambition, but not the ends of God, or the honour of the
Spirit.</p>
            <p>The Jews in their declensions to folly and idolatry did wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
the stone of imagination, that is, certain smooth ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in which by art magic pictures and little faces were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented,
<note place="margin">Levit. 26. 1.</note> declaring hidden things and stoln goods; and God
severely forbad this basenesse: but we also have taken up this
folly, and worship the stone of imagination: we beget imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
phantasmes and speculative images in our phansy,
and we fall down and worship them; never considering that
the spirit of God never appears through such spectres. Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is one of the noblest exercises of Christian religion; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it that duty in which all graces are concentred. Prayer is
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53465:16"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> charity, it is faith, it is a conformity to Gods will, a desiring ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the desires of Heaven, an imitation of Christs interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
and prayer must suppose all holinesse, or else it is nothing:
and therefore all that in which men need Gods Spirit, all that is in
order to prayer. Baptisme is but a prayer, and the holy Sacrament
of the Lords Supper is but a prayer; a prayer of sacrifice repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative,
and a prayer of oblation, and a prayer of intercession,
and a prayer of thanksgiving: and obedience is a prayer, and
begs and procures blessings: and if the Holy Ghost hath sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
the whole man, then he hath sanctified the prayer of the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> man, and not till then; and if ever there was, or could be any
other praying with the spirit, it was such a one as a wicked
man might have, and therefore it cannot be a note of distinction
between the good and bad, between the saints and men of the
world. But this onely (which I have described from the fountains
of Scripture) is that which a good man can have, and therefore
this is it in which we ought to rejoyce; <hi>that he that glories, may
glory in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have (as I could) described the effluxes of the Holy
Spirit upon us in his great chanels. But the great effect of them is
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> this; That as by the arts of the spirits of darknesse, and our own
malice our souls are turned into flesh, (not in the naturall sense,
but in the morall, and Theologicall) and <hi>animalis homo</hi> is the same
with <hi>carnalis,</hi> that is, his soul is a servant of the passions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
of the flesh, and is <hi>flesh</hi> in its operations and ends, in its
principles and actions: So on the other side, by the Grace of God,
and the promise of the Father, and the influences of the Holy
Ghost, our souls are not onely recovered from the state of flesh,
and reduced back to the intirenesse of animall operations, but they
are heightned into <hi>spirit,</hi> and transform<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it passed wholly for the new Prince: So it is in the kingdom of
Grace: As soon as the Tyrant sin is overcome, and a new heart is
put into us, or that we serve under a new head, instantly we have
a new Name given us, and we are esteemed a new Creation; and
not onely changed in manners, but we have a new nature within
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> us, even a third part of essentiall constitution. This may seem
strange; and indeed it is so: and it is one of the great mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesses
of the Gospel. Every man naturally consists of soul and
body: but every Christian man that belongs to Christ, hath more.
For he hath <hi>body,</hi> and <hi>soul,</hi> and <hi>spirit.</hi> My Text is plain for it.
<hi>If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his:</hi> and by
<hi>[Spirit]</hi> is not meant onely the graces of God, and his gifts en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53465:17"/>
us to do holy things: there is more belongs to a good man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
then so. But as when God made man, he made him after his own
image, and breath'd into him <hi>the spirit of life,</hi> and he was made
<hi>in animam viventem, into a living soul;</hi> then he was made a man:
So in the new creation, Christ <hi>by whom God made both the worlds,</hi>
intends to conform us to his image, and he hath given us <hi>the spirit
of adoption,</hi> by which we are made sons of God; and by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of a new life we are made <hi>new creatures,</hi> capable of a new
state, intitled to another manner of duration, enabled to do new
and greater actions in order to higher ends; we have new affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
new understandings, new wils: <hi>Vetera transierunt, &amp; ecce om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>

as much in nature beyond a soul, as a soul is beyond a body. This

God</hi> (saith the same Apostle) <hi>is sharper then a two-edged sword,
piercing even to the dividing asunder the soul and the spirit:</hi> and
that hath taught us to distinguish the principle of a new life, from
the principle of the old, the celestiall from the naturall; and
thus it is.</p>
            <p>This spirit (as I now discourse of it) is a principle infused in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us by God, when we become his children, whereby we live the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
life of Grace, and understand the secrets of the Kingdom, and
have passions and desires of things beyond, and contrary to our
naturall appetites, enabling us not onely to sobriety (which is the
duty of the body) not onely to justice, which is the rectitude of
the soul; but to such a sanctity as makes us like to God. * For
so saith the Spirit of God; <hi>Be ye holy as I am; be pure, be perfect,
as your heavenly Father is pure, as he is perfect:</hi> which because it
cannot be a perfection of degrees, it must be <hi>in similitudine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae,</hi>

            <p>I need not to apply this Discourse: The very mystery it self

            <p>
               <hi>Quisquis magna dedit voluit sibi magna rependi;</hi>
He that gives great things to us, ought to have great acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and Seneca said concerning wise men; That he that doth
benefit to others, hides those benefits as a man layes up great trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> in the earth, which he must never see with his eyes, unlesse a
great occasion forces him to dig the graves, and produce that which
he buried; but all the while, the man was hugely rich, and he had
the wealth of a great relation: so it is with God and us: For this
huge benefit of the Spirit, which God gives us, is for our good, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posited
in our souls, not made for forms and ostentation, not to be
looked upon, or serve little ends, but growing in the secret of our
souls, and swelling up to a treasure, making us in this world rich
by title and relation, but it shall be produced in the great necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of doomesday. In the mean time, if the fire be quenched, the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> fire of Gods Spirit, God will kindle another in his anger, that shall
never be quenched: but if we entertain Gods Spirit with our own
purities, and imploy it diligently, and serve it willingly, (for
Gods Spirit is a loving Spirit) then we shall really be turned into
spirits. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> had a proverbiall saying, <hi>Perfecti sunt qui tria sine
querelâ Deo exhibent;</hi> They that present three things right to God,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53465:18"/>
they are perfect; that is, <hi>a chast body, a righteous soul, and a holy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
spirit;</hi> and the event shall be this, which Maimonides expressed not
amisse, (though he did not at all understand the secret of this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery:)
The soul of a man in this life, is <hi>in potentiâ ad esse spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
it is designed to be a spirit, but in the world to come, it shall
be actually as very a spirit as an Angel is: and this state is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by the Apostle, calling it, <hi>[the earnest of the spirit]</hi> that
is, here it is begun, and given us as an antepast of glory, and
a principle of Grace; but then we shall have it <hi>in plenitudine</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>—regit idem spiritus artus</l>

                  </l>
               </q>
Here, and there, it is the same; but <hi>here</hi> we have the earnest, <hi>there</hi>
the riches and the inheritance.</p>
            <p>But then, if this be a new principle, and be given us in order
to the actions of a holy life, we must take care that we receive
not <hi>the Spirit of God in vain,</hi> but remember it is a new life; and
as no man can pretend, that a person is alive, that doth not alwayes
do the works of life; so it is certain, no man hath the Spirit of God,
but he that lives the life of grace, and doth the works of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that is, <hi>in all holinesse, and justice, and sobriety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Spiritus qui accedit animo, vel Dei est, vel Daemonis</hi> (said Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian.)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
Every man hath within him the Spirit of God, or the spirit
of the devil. The spirit of fornication is an unclean devil, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
contrary to the Spirit of God; and so is the spirit of malice
or uncharitablenesse; for the Spirit of God is the Spirit of love:
for as purities Gods Spirit sanctifies the body, so by love he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies
the soul, and makes the soul grow into a spirit, into a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
nature. But God knows, that even in Christian societies, we
see the devils walk up and down every day, and every hour; the
devil of uncleannesse, and the devil of drunkennesse, the devil of
malice, and the devil of rage, the spirit of filthy speaking, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
the spirit of detraction, a proud spirit, and the spirit of rebellion;
and yet all call <hi>[Christian.</hi> It is generally supposed, that unclean
spirits walk in the night; and so it used to be; <hi>for they that are
drunk, are drunk in the night,</hi> said the Apostle: but Suidas tels of
certain <hi>Empusae,</hi> that used to appear at Noon, at such time as the
Greeks did celebrate the Funerals of the Dead; and at this day
some of the Russians fear the <hi>Noon-day Devil,</hi> which appeareth
like a mourning widow to reapers of hay and corn, and uses to
break their arms and legs, unlesse they worship her. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
David speaketh of both kindes:<note place="margin">Psal. 91.</note> 
               <hi>Thou shalt not be afraid for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
the terrour by night, and a ruinâ &amp; daemonio meridiano, from the
Devil at noon thou shalt be free.</hi> It were happy if we were so; but
besides the solemn followers of the works of darknesse, in the
times and proper seasons of darknesse, there are very many who
act their Scenes of darknesse in the face of the Sun, in open defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53465:18"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of God, and all lawes, and all modesty. There is in such
men the spirit of impudence, as well as of impiety. And yet I
might have expressed it higher; for every habituall sin doth
not onely put us into the power of the devil, but turns us into
his very nature: just as the Holy Ghost transforms us into the
image of God.</p>
            <p>Here therefore I have a greater Argument to perswade you to
holy living, then Moses had to the sons of Israel. <hi>Behold, I have set
before you life and death, blessing and cursing:</hi> so said Moses; but
I adde, that I have upon the stock of this Scripture, set before
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> you, the good Spirit and the bad, God, and the devil: choose un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
whose nature you will be likened, and into whose inheritance
you will be adopted, and into whose possession you will enter.
If you commit sin, ye are of your father the Devil, ye are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
of his principles, and follow his pattern, and shall passe into
his portion, when ye are led captive by him at his will; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
what a sad thing it is to go into the portion of evil and
accursed spirits, the sad and eternall portion of Devils. But he
that hath the Spirit of God, doth acknowledge God for his Father,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and his Lord, he despises the world, and hath no violent appetites
for secular pleasures, and is dead to the desires of this life, and
his hopes are spirituall, and God is his joy, and Christ is his pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
and his support, and Religion is his imployment, and <hi>godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is his gain,</hi> and this man understands the things of God, and
is ready to die for Christ, and fears nothing but to sin against God,
and his will is filled with love, and it springs out in obedience to
God, and in charity to his brother: and of such a man we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make judgement by his fortune, or by his acquaintance, by
his circumstances, or by his adherencies, for they are the appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of a naturall man: but <hi>the spirituall is judged of no man:</hi>
that is, the rare excellencies that make him happy, do not yet
make him illustrious, unlesse we will reckon Vertue to be a great
fortune, and holinesse to be great Wisedom, and God to be the
best Friend, and Christ the best Relative, and the Spirit the hugest
advantage, and Heaven the greatest Reward. He that knows how
to value these things, may sit down and reckon the felicities of him
that hath the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>The purpose of this Discourse is this; That since the Spirit of
God is a new nature, and a new life put into us, we are thereby
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> taught, and enabled to serve God by a constant course of holy
living, without the frequent returns and intervening of such actions,
which men are pleased to call <hi>sins of infirmity.</hi> Whosoever hath the
Spirit of God, lives the life of grace; The Spirit of God rules in
him, and is strong according to its age and abode, and allows not
of those often sins which we think unavoidable, because we call
them, <hi>naturall infirmities.</hi>

               <hi>spirit is life because of righteousnesse.]</hi> The state of sin is a state of
death; the state of a man under the law, was a state of bondage,
and infirmity, (as S. Paul largely describes him in the seventh Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the Romanes) but he that hath the Spirit is made alive, and
free, and strong, and a conquerour over all the powers, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
of sin; such a man resists temptations, falls not under the
assault of sin, returns not to the sin which he last repented of, acts
no more that errour which brought him to shame and sorrow: but
he that falls under a crime, to which he still hath a strong, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
inclination, he that acts his sin, and then curses it, and then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
is tempted, and then sins again, and then weeps again, and calls
himself miserable, but still the inchantment hath confined him to
that circle, this man hath not the Spirit; <hi>for where the Spirit of God
is, there is liberty,</hi> there is no such bondage and a returning folly
to the commands of sin. But because men deceive themselves with
calling this bondage, <hi>a pitiable and excusable infirmity,</hi> it will not
be uselesse to consider the state of this question more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
lest men from the state of a <hi>pretended infirmity,</hi> fall into a
<hi>reall death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. No great sin is <hi>a sin of infirmity,</hi> or excusable upon that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
stock. But that I may be understood, we must know that every
sin is in some sense or other, <hi>a sin of infirmity.</hi> When a man is in
the state of spirituall sicknesse or death, he is in a state of infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
for he is a wounded man, a prisoner, a slave, a sick man,
weak in his judgement, and weak in his reasoning, impotent in
his passions, of childish resolutions, great inconstancy, and his
purposes untwist, as easily as the rude conjuncture of uncombining
cables, in the violence of a Northern tempest: and he that is thus
in infirmity, cannot be excused; for it is the aggravation of the
state of his sin; he is so infirm that he is in a state unable to do <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
his duty. Such a man is <hi>a servant of sin,</hi> a slave of the Devil, an
heir of corruption, absolutely under command; and every man is
so, who resolves for ever to avoid such a sin, and yet for ever
falls under it: for what can he be but a servant of sin, who fain
would avoid it but cannot; that is, he hath not the Spirit of God
within him; Christ dwels not in his soul, <hi>for where the Son is, there
is liberty:</hi> and all that are in the Spirit are sons of God, and servants
of righteousnesse, and therefore freed from sin. But then there are
also <hi>sins of infirmity,</hi> which are single actions, intervening seldom,
in litle instances, unavoidable, or through a faultlesse ignorance.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
Such as these are alwayes the allays of the life of the best men;
and for these Christ hath payd, and they are never to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to good men, save onely to make them more wary, and more
humble. Now concerning these, it is, that I say; No great sin is
a sin of excusable, or unavoidable infirmity. Because whosoever
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53465:19"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> hath received the Spirit of God, hath sufficient knowledge of his
duty, and sufficient strengths of grace, and sufficient advertency
of minde, to avoid such things as do great and apparent violence
to piety, and religion. No man can justly say, that it is a sin
of infirmity that he was drunk; For there are but three causes of
every sin (a fourth is not imaginable.) 1. If ignorance cause it,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
the sin is as full of excuse, as the ignorance was innocent. But
no Christian can pretend this to drunkennesse, to murder, to rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
to uncleannesse. For what Christian is so uninstructed but
that he knows Adultery is a sin? 2. Want of observation, is the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> cause of many indiscreet and foolish actions. Now at this gap ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
irregularities do enter and escape, because in the whole, it is
impossible for a man to be of so present a spirit, as to consider,
and reflect upon every word, and every thought: but it is in this
case in Gods laws otherwise then in mans: the great flies cannot
passe thorow without observation, little ones do; and a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be drunk, and never take notice of it; or tempt his neighbours
wife before he be aware; therefore the lesse the instance be, the
more likely it is to be a sin of infirmity: and yet if it be never
so little, if it be observed, then it ceases to be a sin of infirmity.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 3. But because great crimes, cannot pretend to passe undiscern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
it follows that they must come in at the door of <hi>malice,</hi>
that is, of want of Grace, in the absence of the Spirit; they
destroy where ever they come, and the man dies if they passe
upon him.</p>
            <p>It is true, there is <hi>flesh and blood</hi> in every regenerate man,
but they do not both rule: the flesh is left to tempt, but not to
prevail. And it were a strange condition, if both the godly and
the ungodly were captives to sin, and infallibly should fall into
temptation, and death, without all difference, saue onely, that the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> godly sins <hi>unwillingly,</hi> and the ungodly sins <hi>willingly.</hi> But if the
same things be done by both, and God in both be dishonoured,
and their duty prevaricated, the pretended unwillingnesse is
the signe of a greater, and a baser slavery, and of a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
lesse to be endured. For the servitude which is against me is
intollerable, but if I choose the state of a servant, I am free in
my minde,
<q>
                  <l>—Libertatis servaveris umbram</l>
                  <l>Si quicquid jubeare velis—</l>
               </q>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> certain it is, that such a person who fain would, but cannot choose
but commit adultery, or drunkennesse, is the veriest slave to sin
that can be imagined, and not at all freed by the Spirit, and by
the liberty of the sons of God;<note n="*" place="margin">—Tot rebus iniquis Parüimus vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti: veniaest haec sola pudoris, Degenerisque metus, nil jam potuisse negari. <hi>Lucan.</hi>
               </note> and there is no other difference,
but that the mistaken good man feels his slavery, and sees his
chains, and his fetters; but therefore it is certain that he is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he sees himself to be a slave. No man can be a servant of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53465:20"/>
sin, and a servant of righteousnesse at the same time, but every <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
man that hath the Spirit of God, is a servant of righteousnesse;
and therefore whosoever finde great sins to be unavoidable, are in
a state of death and reprobation, (as to the present) because they
willingly, or unwillingly (it matters not much, whether of the
two) are servants of sin.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Sins of infirmity as they are small in their instance, so
they put on their degree of excusablenesse, onely according to the
weaknesse, or infirmity of a mans understanding: So far as men
(without their own fault) understand not their duty, or are pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
with weaknesse of principles, or are destitute and void of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
discourse, or discerning powers, and acts, so far if a sin creeps
upon them, it is as naturall, and as free from a law, as is the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a childe; But if any thing else be mingled with it, if it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from any other principle, it is criminall and not excused by
our infirmity; because it is chosen: and a mans will hath no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity,
but when it wants the grace of God, or is mastered with
pass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ons, and sinfull appetites: and that infirmity is the state of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regeneration.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. The violence or strength of a temptation is not sufficient to
excuse an action, or to make it accountable upon the stock of a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
pitiable and innocent infirmity; if it leaves the understanding still
able to judge; because a temptation cannot have any proper
strengths but from our selves, and because we have in us a principle
of basenesse which this temptation meets, and onely perswades
me to act, because I love it. Joseph met with a temptation as
violent and as strong as any man: and it is certain there are not
many Christians but would fall under it, and call it, <hi>a sin of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity,</hi>
since they have been taught so to abuse themselves, by sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fig-leaves before their nakednesse: but because Joseph had a
strength of God within him, the strength of chastity, therefore it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
could not at all prevail upon him. Some men cannot by any art of
hell be tempted to be drunk; others can no more resist an invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to such a meeting, then they can refuse to die if a dagger
were drunk with their heart blood; because their evil habits made
them weak on that part: And some man that is fortified against
revenge it may be will certainly fall under a temptation to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse:
for every temptation is great or small, according as
the man is; and a good word will certainly lead some men to an
action of folly, while another will not think ten thousand pound
a considerable argument to make him tell one single lie, against his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
duty, or his conscience.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. No habituall sin, (that is) no sin that returns constantly,
or frequently, that is repented of, and committed again, and still
repented of, and then again committed, no such sin is excusable
with a pretence of infirmity: Because that sin is certainly noted,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53465:20"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and certainly condemned, and therefore returns, not because of
the weaknesse of nature, but the weaknesse of grace: the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of this, is an evil spirit, an habituall aversation from God, a
dominion and empire of sin: and as no man for his inclination,
and aptnesse to the sins of the flesh, is to be called carnall, if he
corrects his inclinations, and turns them into vertues: so no man
can be called spirituall for his good wishes, and apt inclinations
to goodnesse, if these inclinations passe not into acts, and these acts
into habits, and holy customs, and walkings, and conversation
with God. But as natural concupiscence corrected becomes the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of vertue: so these good inclinations, and condemnings of our
sin, if they be ineffective and end in sinfull actions, are the perfect
signes of a reprobate, and unregenerate estate.</p>
            <p>The sum is this. An animal man, a man under the law, a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
man (for as to this, they are all one) is sold under sin, he is
a servant of corruption, he falls frequently into the same sin to
which he is tempted, he commends the Law, he consents to it
that it is good, he does not commend sin, he does some little
things against it, but they are weak and imperfect, his lust is
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> stronger, his passions violent, and unmortified, his habits vitious,
his customs sinfull, and he lives in the regions of sin, and dies
and enters into its portion; But a spirituall man, a man that is in
the state of grace, who is born anew of the Spirit, that is regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
by the Spirit of Christ, <hi>he is led by the Spirit,</hi> he <hi>lives</hi> in the
Spirit, he does the works of God cheerfully, habitually, vigorous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
and although he sometimes slips, yet it is but seldom, it is in
small instances: his life is such as he cannot pretend to be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by works, and merit, but by mercy, and the faith of Jesus
Christ; yet he never sins great sins: If he does, he is for that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               <hi>falne from Gods favour;</hi> and though possibly he may reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
(and the smaller, or seldomer the sin is, the sooner may be
his restitution) yet for the present (I say) he is out of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.
But he that remains in the grace of God, sins not by any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate,
consultive, knowing act; he is incident to such a surprize
as may consist with the weaknesse, and judgement of a good
man: but whatsoever is, or must be considered, if it cannot passe
without consideration, it cannot passe without sin; and therefore
cannot enter upon him, while he remains in that state. For <hi>he
that is in Christ, in him, the body is dead by reason of sin;</hi> and the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Gospel did not differ from the Law, but that the Gospel gives
grace and strength to do whatsoever it commands, which the
Law did not; and the greatnesse of <hi>the promise of eternall life</hi> is
such an argument to them that consider it, that it must needs be
of force sufficient, to perswade a man to use all his faculties, and
all his strength, that he may obtain it: God exacted all upon this
stock; God knew this could do every thing: <hi>Nihil non in hoc prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumpsit
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53465:21"/>
Deus</hi> (said one.) This will make a satyr chast, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
Silenus to be sober, and Dives to be charitable, and Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus
himself to despise reputation, and Saul to turn from a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutor
to an Apostle. For since God hath given us reason to
choose, and a promise to exchange, for our temperance, and faith,
and charity, and justice, for these (I say) happinesse, exceeding
great happinesse; that we shall be Kings, that we shall reigne
with God, with Christ, with all the holy Angels for ever, in fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities
so great, that we have not now capacities to understand
it, our heart is not big enough to think it; there cannot in the
world be a greater inducement to engage us, a greater argument <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
to oblige us to do our duty. God hath not in heaven a bigger ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument;
it is not possible any thing in the world should be bigger:
which because the Spirit of God hath revealed to us, if by this
strength of his we walk in his wayes, and be ingrafted into his
stock, and bring forth his fruits, <hi>the fruits of the Spirit,</hi> then <hi>we
are in Christ,</hi> and <hi>Christ in us,</hi> then <hi>we walk in the spirit,</hi> and <hi>the
Spirit dwels in us,</hi> and our portion shall be there, where <hi>Christ by
the Spirit maketh intercession for us,</hi> that is, at the right hand of
his Father for ever, and ever. Amen.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

this evil; he hath set Angels with fiery swords to drive us
from it, he hath imployed Advocates to plead against it, he hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
made Laws and Decrees against it, he hath dispatched Prophets
to warn us of it, and hath established an Order of men, men of
his own family, and who are fed at his own charges, (I mean
the whole Order of the Clergy) whose office is like watchmen to
give an alarum at every approach of sin, with as much affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as if an enemy were neer, or the sea broke in upon the flat
Countrey; and all this, onely to perswade men not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
miserable, for nothing, for vanity, for a trouble, for a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease:
for some sins naturally are diseases, and all others are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
nothings, meer privations, or imperfections, contrary to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
goodnesse, to felicity, to God himself: And yet God hath hedged
sin round about with thorns, and sin of it self too, brings thorns:
and it abuses a man in all his capacities, and it places poison in all
those seats and receptions where he could possibly entertain hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse.
For if sin pretend to please the sense, it doth first abuse
it shamefully, and then humours it: it can onely feed an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postume;
no naturall, reasonable, and perfective appetite: and
besides its own essentiall appendages, and proprieties; things are
so ordered that a fire is kindled round about us; and every thing
within us, above, below us, and on every side of us, is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
against, and an enemy to sin; and for its single pretence,
that it comes to please one of the senses, one of those faculties
which are in us the same they are in a Cow, it hath an evil so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative,
that it doth not onely work like poison, to the disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of soul and body; but it is a sicknesse like the plague, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
all our houses, and corrupts the air, and the very breath of
heaven: for it moves God first to jealousie, (and that takes off his
friendship and kindnesse towards us) and then to anger; and that
makes him a resolved enemy; and it brings evil, not onely upon
our selves, but upon all our relatives; upon our selves, and our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
children, even the children of our Nephews, <hi>Ad natos natorum,

therefore if a man should despise the eye, or sword of man, if he
sins he is to contest with the jealousie of a provoked God: If he
doth not regard himself, let him pity his pretty children: If he

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> be angry and hates all that he sees, and is not solicitous for his
children, yet let him pitty the generations which are yet unborn;
let him not bring a curse upon his whole family, and suffer his
name to rot in curses and dishonours; let not his memory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
polluted with an eternal stain: if all this will not deter a
man from sin, there is no instrument left for thats mans vertue, no
hopes of his felicity, no recovery of his sorrows and sicknesses;
but he must sink under the stroaks of a jealous God into the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour

1. God is pleased to represent himself a person very
<hi>suspicious,</hi> both in respect of persons and things. For our persons
we give him cause enough: for we are sinners from our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
womb; we make solemn vows and break them instantly;
we cry for pardon and still renew the sin; we desire God to try
us once more, and we provoke him ten times further: we use the
means of grace to cure us, and we turn them into vices and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunites

we renounce them publickly, and yet send for them in
private and shew them kindnesse: we leave little offiences, but
our faith and our charity is not strong enough to Master great ones;
and sometimes we are sham'd out of great ones, but yet entertain
little ones; or if we disdain both, yet we love to remember them,
and delight in their past actions, and bring them home to us, at
least by fiction of imagination; and we love to be betrayed into
them; we would fain have things so ordered by chance or power
that it may seem necessary to sin, or that it may become excusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and dressed fitly for our own circumstances; and for ever we
long after the flesh pots of Egypt the garlick and the Onions; and
we so little do esteeme Manna, the food of Angels, we so loath
the bread of Heaven, that any temptation will make us return to
our fetters and our bondage; and if we do not tempt our selves,
yet we do not resist a temptation, or if we pray against it, we
desire not to be heard; and if we be assisted, yet we will not
work together with those assistances; so that unlesse we be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
nothing will be done; we are so willing to perish, and so
unwilling to be saved, that we minister to God reason enough to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> suspect us; and therefore it is no wonder that God is jealous of
us: We keep company with Harlots and polluted persons; we are
kind to all Gods Enemies, and love that which he hates; how can
it be otherwise but that we should be suspected? Let us make our
best of it, and see if we can recover the good opinion of God;
for as yet we are but <hi>suspected persons.</hi> 2. And therefore God is
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53465:23"/>
               <hi>inquisitive;</hi> he looks for that which he fain would never finde; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
God sets spies upon us; he looks upon us himself through the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of a cloud; and he sends Angels to espie us in all our wayes,
and permits the Devil to winnow us and to accuse us, and erects a
Tribunal and witnesses in our own consciences, and he cannot want
information concerning our smalest irregularities. Sometimes the
Devil accuses, but he also sometimes accuses us falsly, either malici<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ously,
or ignorantly, and we stand upright in that particular by inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence;
and sometimes by penitence, and all this while our Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
is our friend: Sometimes our conscience does accuse us unto
God; and then we stand convict by our own judgement.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
Sometimes, if our conscience acquit us, yet <hi>we are not thereby
justified:</hi> For, as <hi>Moses</hi> accused the Jews; so do Christ and
his Apostles accuse us, not in their personss, but by their
works; and by their words, by the thing it self, by confront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the laws of Christ, and our practises. Sometimes the Angels
who are the observers of all our works carry up sad tidings to
the Court of Heaven against us. Thus, two Angels were the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
against Sodom; but yet these were the last; for before that
time the cry of their iniquity had sounded loud and sadly in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
and all this is the direct and proper effect of his jealousie; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
which sets spies upon all the actions, and watches the circumstances,

publications, and retirements of every man, and will not suffer a
thought to wander but he uses means to correct it's errour, and to
reduce it to himself. For he that created us and daily feeds us,
he that intreats us to be happy, with an opportunity so pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate
as if (not we, but) himself were to receive the favour;
he that would part with his onely Son from his bosome, and
the embraces of eternity, and give him over to a shameful and
cursed death for us, Cannot but be supposed to love us with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
a great love, and to own us with an intire title, and therefore
that he would fain secure us to himself with an undivided
possession: and it cannot but be infinitely reasonable: for to
whom else should any of us belong, but to God? Did the
world create us? Or did lust ever do us any good: Did Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
ever suffer one stripe for our advantage? Does not he
study all the wayes to ruine us? Doe the Sun or the stars pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
us alive? Or do we get understanding from the Angels?
Did ever any joynt of our body knit, or our heart ever keep
one true minute of a pulse without God? Had not we been ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
nothing, or worse, that is, infinitely eternally miserable,
but that God made us capable, and then pursued us with arts

of any. But however, it will concern us with much caution
to observe our own wayes, since <hi>we are made a spectacle to God, to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
and to Men:</hi> God hath set so many spies upon us, the blessed
Angels and the accursed Devils, good men and bad men, the eye
of Heaven, and eye of that eye, God himself, all watching lest we
rob God of his Honour, and our selves of our hopes; For by his
prime intention he hath chosen so to get his own glory, as may best
consist with our felicity: His great designe is to be glorified in
our being saved. 3. Gods jealousie hath a sadder effect then all this.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> For all this is for mercy; but if we provoke this jealousie if he findes
us in our spiritual whoredoms, he is <hi>implacable,</hi> that is, he is angry
with us to eternity unlesse we returne in time: and if we do, it may
be he will not be appeased in all instances: and when he forgives us
he will make some reserves of his wrath; he will punish our persons,
or our estate; he will chastise us at home, or abroad, in our bodies,
or in our children; for he will visit our sins upon our children from
generation to generation: and if they be made miserable for our
sins, they are unhappy in such parents; but we bear the curse
and the anger of God, even while they bear his rod: <hi>God visits the

he strikes against sin, and is now to be considered.</p>
            <p>That God doth so is certain; because he saith he doth; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
that this is just in him so to do, is also as certain therefore because
he doth it. For as his lawes are our measures, so his actions, and
his own will are his own measures. He that hath right over all
things, and all persons, cannot do wrong to any thing. He that is
essentially just, (and there could be no such thing as justice, or
justice it self could not be good, if it did not derive from him)
it is impossible for him to be unjust. But since God is pleased to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> speak after the manner of men, it may well consist with our duty
to enquire into those manners of consideration, whereby we may
understand the equity of God in this proceeding, and to be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
also in our own danger, if we persevere in sin.</p>
            <p>1. No man is made <hi>a sinner</hi> by the fault of another man
without his own consent. For to every one God gives his choice,
and sets life and death before every of the sons of Adam: and
therefore this death is not a consequent to any sin, but our own.
In this sense it is true, that <hi>if the fathers eat sowre grapes, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> teeth shall not be set on edge:</hi> and therefore the sin of Adam
which was derived to all the world; did not bring the world to
any other death but temporall, by the intermediall stages of sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and temporal infelicities: And it is not said that <hi>sin passed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all men,</hi> but <hi>death,</hi> &amp; that also no otherwise but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>in
as much as al men have sinned;</hi> as they have followed the steps of their
father, so they are partakers of this death. And therefore it is very
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53465:24"/>
remarkable; that death brought in by sin, was nothing <hi>superindu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
to man; man onely was <hi>reduced</hi> to his own naturall conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
from which before Adams fall he stood exempted by super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
favour; and therefore although the taking away that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
grace, or priviledge was a punishment; yet the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
the naturall death, was directly none; but a condition of
his creation, naturall, and therefore not primarily evil; but if
not good, yet at least indifferent. And the truth and purpose of
this observation will extend it self, if we observe that before any
man died, Christ was promised, by whom death was to lose its
sting, by whom death did cease to be an evil, and was, or might <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
be, if we do belong to Christ, a state of advantage. So that we by
occasion of Adams sin, being returned to our naturall certainty of
dying, do still even in this very particular stand between the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
and the cursing. If we follow Christ, death is our friend; If
we imitate the praevarication of Adam, then death becomes an
evil; the condition of our nature, becomes the punishment of <hi>our
own sin;</hi> not of Adams: for although his sin brought death in,
yet it is onely our sin that makes death to be evil: And I desire
this to be observed, because it is of great use in vindicating the
Divine justice in the matter of this question. The materiall part <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
of the evil came from our father upon us, but the formality of it,
the sting and the curse is onely by our selves.</p>
            <p>2. For the fault of others many may become <hi>miserable,</hi> even
all or any of those, whose relation is such to the sinner, that he in
any sense may by such inflictions be punished, execrable, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.
Indeed it were strange, if when a plague were in Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia,
the Athenians should be infected: or if the house of Pericles
were visited, and Thucydides should die for it. For although
there are some evils which (as Plutarch saith) are <hi>ansis &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagationibus
praedita incredibili celeritate in longinquum penetran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
such which can dart evil influences, as Porcupines do their
quils; yet as at so great distances the knowledge of any confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
events must needs be uncertain: so it is also uselesse, because
we neither can joyne their causes, nor their circumstances, nor
their accidents into any neighbourhood of conjunction: Relations
are seldome noted at such distances; and if they were, it is certain,
so many accidents will intervene, that will out-weigh the efficacy
of such relations; that by any so far distant events, we cannot be
instructed in any duty, nor understand our selves reproved for any
fault. But when the relation is neerer, and is joyned under such a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
head, and common cause, that the influence is perceived, and the
parts of it do usually communicate in benefit, notices, or infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity
(especially if they relate to each other, as superiour and
inferiour) then it is certain, the sin is infectious (I mean) not
onely in example, but also in punishment.</p>

is so. 2. For what reasons it is so, and justly so. 3. In what
degree, and in what cases it is so. 4. What remedies there are
for this evil.</p>
            <p>1. It is so in kingdoms, in Churches, in families, in politicall,
artificiall, and even in accidentall societies.</p>
            <p>When David numbred the people, God was angry with him;
but he punished the people for the crime; seventy thousand men
died of the plague: and when God gave to David the choice of
three plagues, he chose that of the pestilence, in which the meanest
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of the people, and such which have the least society with the acts
and crimes of Kings are most commonly devoured, whilest the
powerfull and sinning persons by arts of physick, and flight, by
provisions of nature, and accidents are more commonly secured.
* But the story of the Kings of Israel hath furnished us with an
example fitted with all the stranger circumstances in this question.
Joshuah had sworn to the Gibeonites (who had craftily secured
their lives, by exchanging it for their liberties:) Almost 500.
yeers after, Saul in zeal to the men of Israel and Judah slew many
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of them. After this Saul dies, and no question was made of it.
But in the dayes of David there was a famine in the land three
yeers together;<note place="margin">2 Sam. 21. 14.</note> and God being inquired of, said it was because of
Saul his killing the Gibeonites. What had the people to do with
their Kings fault? or at least, the people of David with the fault of
Saul? That we shall see anon: But see the way that was appointed
to expiate the crime, and the calamity. David took seven of Sauls
sons and hanged them up against the Sun, and after that God was
intreated for the land. The story observes one circumstance more:
that for the kindnesse of Jonathan, David spared Mephibosheth.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Now this story doth not onely instance in Kingdoms, but in fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
too. The fathers fault is punished upon the sons of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily;
and the Kings fault upon the people of his land, even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the death of the King, after the death of the father. Thus
God visited the sin of Ahab, partly upon himself, partly upon
his sons.<note place="margin">1 King. 21. 29.</note> 
               <hi>I will not bring the evil in his dayes, but in his sons dayes
will I bring the evil upon his house.</hi> Thus did God slay the childe
of Bathsheba for the sin of his father David: and the whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
of Eli, all his kinred of the neerer lines were thrust from
the priesthood, and a curse made to descend upon his children
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> for many ages, <hi>that all the males should die young, and in the
flower of their youth.</hi> The boldnesse and impiety of Cham made
his posterity to be accursed, and brought slavery into the world.
Because Amalek fought with the sons of Israel at Rephidim, God
took up a quarrell against the nation for ever. And above all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
is that of the Jews, who put to death the Lord of life,
and made their nation to be an anathema for ever, untill the day
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53465:25"/>
of restitution. <hi>His blood be upon us, and upon our children.</hi> If we shed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
innocent blood, If we provoke God to wrath, If we oppresse the
poor, <hi>If we crucifie the Lord of life again and put him to an open shame,</hi>
the wrath of God will be upon us and upon our children, to make
us a cursed family, and who are the sinners, to be the stock and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
of the curse; the pedigree of the misery shall derive
from us.</p>
            <p>This last instance went further then the other of families and
kingdoms. For not onely the single families of the Jews were made
miserable for their Fathers murdering the Lord of life, nor also
was the Nation extinguished alone for the sins of their Rulers, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
the religion was removed; it ceased to be God peoples; the syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue
was rejected, and her vail rent, and her privacies dismant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and the Gentiles were made to be Gods people, when the Jews
inclosure was dispark<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d. I need not further to instance this proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the case of National Churches, though it is a sad calamity
that is fallen upon the al seven Churches of Asia (to whom the spirit
of God wrote seven Epistles by Saint <hi>John)</hi> and almost all the
Churches of Africa, where Christ was worshipped, and now <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi>
is thrust in substitution, and the people are servants, and the
religion is extinguished, or where it remains, it shines like the Moon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
in an Eclipse, or like the least spark of the pleiades, seen but seldom,
And that rather shining like a gloworm, then a taper enkindled with
a beam of the Sun of righteousnesse. I shall adde no more instances
to verifie the truth of this, save onely I shall observe to you, that
even there is danger in being in evil company, in suspected places,
in the civil societies and fellowships of wicked men.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Next I am to consider why this is so, and why it is justly so? To
this I answer. 1. Between Kings and their people, Parents and their
children there is so great a necessitude, propriety and entercourse
of nature, dominion, right and possession, that they are by God
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53465:25"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and the laws of Nations reckoned as their Goods, and their bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings.
<hi>The honour of a King is in the multitude of his people;</hi> and <hi>children
are a gift that cometh of the Lord;</hi> and <hi>happy is that man that hath his
quiver full of them:</hi> and <hi>Lo thus shall the man be blessed that feareth
the Lord; his wife shall be like the fruitful vine by the wals of his house,
his children like olive branches round about his Table.</hi> Now if chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
be a blessing, then to take them away in anger is a curse: and
if the losse of flocks and herds, the burning of houses, the blasting
of fields be a curse; how much greater is it to lose our children, and
to see God slay them before our eyes, in hatred to our persons, and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> detestation and loathing of our basenesse. When <hi>Jobs</hi> Messengers
told him the sad stories of fire from Heaven, the burning his sheep,
and that the Sabeans had driven his Oxen away, and the Chaldeans
had stolne his Camels; these were sad arrests to his troubled spirit:
but it was reserved as the last blow of that sad execution that the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines
of a house had crush'd his Sons and Daughters to their graves.
Sons &amp; daughters are greater blessings then sheep &amp; Oxen: they are
not servants of profit as sheep are, but they secure greater ends of bles<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ssing;
they preserve your Names; they are so many titles of provision
&amp; providence; every new childe is a new title to Gods care of that
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> family: They serve the ends of honour, of commonwealths, and
Kingdoms; they are images of our souls, and images of God, and
therefore are great blessings; and by consequence, they are great
riches, though they are not to be sold for mony: and surely he that
hath a cabinet of invaluable jewels will think himself rich though
he never sells them. <hi>Does God take care for Oxen?</hi> (said our blessed
Saviour) much more for you: yea all and every one of your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are of more value then many Oxen: when therefore God for
your sin strikes them with crookednesse, with deformity, with
foolishnesse, with impertinent and caytive spirits, with hasty or sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> deaths, it is a greater curse to us, then to lose whole herds
of cattel, of which (it is certain) most men would be very sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
They are our goods; they are our blessings from God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we are striken, when for our sakes they dye: Therefore
we may properly be punished by evils happening to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives.</p>
            <p>2. But as this is a <hi>punishment to us,</hi> so it is <hi>not un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ust as to them,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
though they be innocent. For all the calamities of this life are inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to the most Godly persons of the world; and since the King of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Heaven and earth was made a man of sorrows, it cannot be called
unjust or intolerable that innocent persons should be pressed with
temporal infelicities: onely in such cases we must distinguish the
misery from the punishment; for that all the world dyes is a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of <hi>Adams</hi> sin: but it is no evil to those single persons that
<hi>die in the Lord;</hi> for they are blessed in their death. <hi>Jonathan</hi> was
killed the same day with his Father the King; and this was a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53465:26"/>
to <hi>Saul</hi> indeed; but to <hi>Jonathan</hi> it was a blessing: for since <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
God had appointed the kingdom to his neighbour, it was more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
for him to die fighting the Lords battel, then to live and
see himself the lasting testimony of Gods curse upon his Father;
who lost the Kingdom from his family by his disobedience. That
death is a blessing which ends an Honorable, and prevents an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious
life. And our children (it may be) shall be sanctified by
a sorrow, and purified by the fire of affliction, and they shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the blessing of it; but it is to their Fathers a curse, who
shall wound their own hearts with sorrow, and cover their heads
with a robe of shame, for bringing so great evil upon their house.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. God hath many ends of providence to serve in this dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his judgements. * 1. He expresses the highest indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> sin; and makes his examples lasting, communicative, and of
great effect; it is a little image of hell; and we shall the lesse wonder
that God with the pains of eternity punishes the sins of time, when
with our eyes we see him punish a transient action with a lasting
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> judgement. * 2. It arrests the spirits of men, and surprises their
loosenesses, and restrains their gaiety, when we observe that the
judgements of God finde us out in all relations, and turns our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
into sadnesse, and makes our families the scene of sorrows,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
and we can escape him no where; and by sin are made obnoxious
not alone to personall judgements; but that we are made like the
fountains of the dead sea, springs of the lake of Sodom; in stead of
refreshing our families with blessings, we leave them brimstone
and drought, and poison, and an evil name, and the wrath of God,
and a treasure of wrath; and their Fathers sins for their portion and
inheritance. * Naturalists say that when the leading goats in the
Greek Islands have taken an Eryngus or sea holly into their mouths,
all the herd will stand still, till the herds man comes and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
it out, as apprehending the evil that will come to them all, if
any of them especially their Principals, tast an unwholesome plant:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
and indeed it is of a General concernment, that the Master
of a family, or the Prince of a people, from whom as from
a fountain many issues do derive upon their Relatives, should
be springs of health and sanctity and blessing. It is a great right
and propriety that a King hath in his people, or a Father in his
children tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> even their sins can do these a mischiefe, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by a direct violence, but by the execution of Gods wrath:
God hath made strange bands and vessels, or chanels of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
between them, when even the anger of God shal be convei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
by the conduits of such relations. That would be considered. It
binds them neerer then our new doctrine will endure: but it also
binds us to pray for them and for their Holinesse, and good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
as earnestly as we would be delivered from death, or sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
or poverty, or war, or the wrath of God in any instance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:53465:26"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 3. This also will satisfie the fearfulnesse of such persons who
think the evil prosperous, and <hi>call the proud happy.</hi> No man can <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
be called happy till he be dead; nor then neither, if he lived viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously:
Look how God handles him in his children, in his family,
in his grand-children; and as it tells that generation which sees
the judgement, that God was all the while angry with him; so
it supports the spirits of men in the intervall, and entertains them
with the expectation of a certain hope; for if I do not live to see
his sin punished, yet his posterity may finde themselves accursed,
and feel their fathers sins in their own calamity; and the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> or belief of that, may relieve my oppression, and ease
my sorrows, while I know that God will bear my injury in a
lasting record, and when I have forgot it, will bring it forth to
judgement. The Athenians were highly pleased when they saw
honours done to the posterity of Cimon [a good man, and a rare
citizen, but murde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed for being wise and vertuous] and when at
the same time they saw a decree of banishment passe against the
children of Lacharis, and Aristo, they laid their hands upon their
mouthes, and with silence did admire the justice of the Power
above.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> The sum of this is; That in sending evils upon the posterity
of evil men, God serves many ends of providence, some of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
some of mercy, some of justice, and contradicts none: For
the evil of the innocent son is the fathers punishment upon the stock
of his sin, and his relation; but the sad accident happens to the son
upon the score of nature, and many ends of providence, and mercy.
To which I adde, that if any, even the greatest temporall evil may
fall upon a man [as blindnesse did upon the blinde man in the
Gospel] when <hi>neither he nor his parents have sinned;</hi> much more
may it do so, when his parents have, though he have not. For
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> there is a neerer, or more visible commensuration of justice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the parents sin, and the sons sicknesse, then between the evil
of the son, and the innocence of father and son together. The
dispensation therefore is righteous and severe.</p>
            <p>3. I am now to consider in what degree, and in what cases,
this is usuall, or to be expected. It is in the Text instanced in the
matter of worshipping images. God is so jealous of his honour,
that he will not suffer an image of himself to be made, lest the
image dishonour the substance; nor any image of a creature to be
worshipped, though with a lesse honour, lest that lesse swell up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> a greater: and he that is thus jealous of his honour, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
so instances it, is also very curious of it in all other particulars;
and though to punish the sins of fathers upon the children, be more
solemnly threatned in this sin onely, yet we finde it inflicted indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
in any other great sin, as appears in the former precedents.</p>
            <p>This one thing I desire to be strictly observed: That it is with
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53465:27"/>
much errour, and great indiligence usually taught in this question,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
that the wrath of God descends from fathers to children onely in
case the children imitate, and write after their fathers copy; suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
these words [in them that hate me] to relate to the children.
But this is expressely against the words of the Text, and the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of the thing: God afflicts good children of evil parents, for
their fathers sins; and the words are plain and determinate: God
visits the sins of the fathers <hi>in tertiam &amp; quartam generationem
eorum qui oderunt me;</hi> to the third generation <hi>of them, of those fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
that hate me: that is, upon the great-grand-children of such
parents. So that if the great-grandfathers be haters of God, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
lovers of iniquity, it may intail a curse upon so many generations,
though the children be haters of their fathers hatred, and lovers
of God. * And this hath been observed even by wise men among
the Heathens whose stories tell, that <hi>Antigonus</hi> was punished for
the tyranny of his father <hi>Demetrius; Phyleus</hi> for his father <hi>Augeas;</hi>
pious and wise <hi>Nestor</hi> for his father <hi>Neleus:</hi> And it was so in the
case of <hi>Jonathan,</hi> who lost the Kingdom and his life upon the
stock of his fathers sins; and the innocent childe of David was
slain by the anger of God, not against the childe, who never had
deserved it, but the fathers adultery. I need not here repeat what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
I said in vindication of the Divine justice; but I observed this, to
represent the danger of a sinning father, or mother, when it shall
so infect the family with curses, that it shall ruine a wise and an
innocent son; and that vertue and innocence which shall by God
be accepted as sufficient through the Divine mercy to bring the
son to Heaven, yet it may be shall not be accepted to quit him
from feeling the curse of his fathers crime, in a load of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
infelicities: And who but a villain would ruine and undo a
wise, a vertuous, and his own son? But so it is in all the world.
A traytor is condemned to suffer death himself, and his posteri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
are made beggers, and dishonourable, his Escutcheon is rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
his arms of honour are extinguished, the noblesse of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestours
is forgotten, but his own sin is not, while men by the
characters of infamy are taught to call that family accursed which
had so base a father. <hi>Tiresias</hi> was esteemed unfortunate because
he could not see his friends and children: the poor man was blinde
with age: But <hi>Athamas</hi> and <hi>Agave</hi> were more miserable, who
did see their children, but took them for Lions, and Stags; The
parents were miserably frantick: But of all, they deplored the
misery of Hercules; who when he saw his children, took them for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
enemies, and endeavoured to destroy them. And this is the case
of all vitious parents. That <hi>a mans enemies were they of his own
house,</hi> was accounted a great calamity: but it is worse, when we
love them tenderly, and fondly, and yet do them all the despite we
wish to enemies; But so it is, that in many cases we do more mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53465:27"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to our children, then if we should strangle them when they
are newly taken from their mothers knees, or tear them in pieces
as <hi>Medea</hi> did her brother <hi>Absyrtus;</hi> For to leave them to inherit a
curse, to leave them an intaild calamity, a misery, a disease, the
wrath of God for an inheritance, that it may descend upon them,
and remark the family like their coat of arms, is to be the parent
of evil, the ruine of our family, the causes of mischief of them,
who ought to be dearer to us then our own eyes. And let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
this, when we are tempted to provoke the jealous God:
let us consider that his anger hath a progeny, and a descending
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> line, and it may break out in the dayes of our Nephews. A Greek
woman was accused of adultery, because she brought forth a Black-moor;
and could not acquit her self till she had proved that she
had descended in the fourth degree from an Ethiopian: Her great
Grand-father was a Moor. And if Naturalists say true, that Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews
are very often liker to their Grandfathers then to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
we see that the semblance of our souls, and the character of
the person, is conveyed by secret and undiscernable conveyances.
Naturall production conveyes originall sin; and therefore, by the
chanels of the body, it is not strange that men convey an heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> sin: And lustfull sons are usually born to Satyrs; and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of intemperance to the drunkards; and there are also here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary
diseases: which if in the fathers they were effects of their
sin, as it is in many cases, it is notorious that the fathers sin is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
and the punishment conveyed by naturall instruments: so
that it cannot be a wonder, but it ought to be a huge affrightment
from a state of sin; If a man can be capable of so much charity,
as to love himself in his own person, or in the images of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and heirs of his fortunes, and the supports of his family,
in the children that God hath given him. Consider therefore that
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> you do not onely act your own tragedies when you sin, but you
represent and effect the fortune of your children; you slay them
with your own barbarous and inhumane hands. Onely be pleased
to compare the variety of estates; of your own and your children.
If they on earth be miserable many times for their fathers sins, how
great a state of misery is that in hell which they suffer for their
own? And how vile a person is that father, or mother, who for a
little money, or to please a lust, will be a parricide, and imbrue
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> his hands in the blood of his own children?</p>

            <p>4. I Am to consider what remedies there are for sons to cut
off this intail of curses;
and whether, and by what means
it is possible for sons to prevent the being punished for
their fathers sins? And since this thing is so perplext and intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
hath so easie an objection, and so hard an answer, looks so
like a cruelty, and so unlike a justice, (though it be infinitely just,
and very severe, and a huge enemy to sin) it cannot be thought
but that there are not onely wayes left to reconcile Gods proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the strict rules of justice, but also the condition of man to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
the possibilities of Gods usuall mercies. One said of old, <hi>Ex tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
si Dij sontes praetereant, &amp; insontes plectant, justitiam suam
non sic rectè resarciunt.</hi> If God be so slow to punish the guilty,
that the punishment be deferred till the death of the guilty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
and that God shall be forced to punish the innocent, or to let
the sin quite escape unpunished<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it will be something hard to joyn
that justice with mercy, or to joyn that action with justice. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it will seem strange, but the reason of its justice, I have
already discoursed: If now we can finde how to reconcile this to
Gods mercy too, or can learn how it may be turned into a mercy,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
we need to take no other care, but that for our own particular we
take heed we never tempt Gods anger upon our families, and that
by competent and apt instruments, we indeavour to cancell the
decree, if it be gone out against our families; for then we make
use of that severity which God intended; and our selves shall be
refreshed in the shades, and by the cooling brooks of the Divine
mercy; even then when we see the wrath of God breaking out
upon the families round about us.</p>
            <p>1. The first means to cut off the intail of wrath and cursings
from a family, is for the sons to disavow those signall actions of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
impiety, in which their fathers were deeply guilty, and by which
they stained great parts of their life, or have done something of
very great unworthinesse and disreputation. <hi>Si quis paterni vitij
nascitur haeres, nascitur &amp; poenae:</hi> The heir of his fathers wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
is the heir of his fathers curse; and a son comes to inherite a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53465:28"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> wickednesse from his father three wayes. 1. By approving, or
any wayes consenting to his fathers Sin: As by speaking of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
regret, or shame; by pleasing himself in the story; or by
having an evil minde, apt to counsell or do the like, if the same cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
should occur. For a son may contract a sin, not onely
by derivation, and the contagion of example, but by approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
not onely by a corporall, but by a virtuall contact; not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by transcribing an evil copy, but by commending it: and a
man may have <hi>animum leprosum in cute mundâ,</hi> a leprous and a
polluted minde even for nothing, even for an empty and inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> lust. An evil minde may contract the curse of an evil acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and though the son of a covetous father prove a prodigall,
yet if he loves his fathers vice for ministring to his vanity, he is
disposed, not onely to a judgement for his own prodigality, but
also to the curse of his fathers avarice.</p>
            <p>2. The son may inherit his fathers wickednesse by imitation
and direct practise, and then the curse is like to come to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
a curse by accumulation, a treasure of wrath: and then the
children as they arrive to the height of wickednesse by a speedy
passage, as being t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rust forward by an active example, by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
by education, by a seldom restraint, by a remisse disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> so they ascertain a curse to the family, by being a perverse
generation, a family set up in opposition against God, by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
and increasing the provocation.</p>
            <p>3. Sons inherit their fathers crimes, by receiving, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
the purchases of their rapine, injustice, and oppression, by
rising upon the ruine of their fathers souls, by sitting warme in
the furres which their father stole, and walking in the grounds
which are water'd with the tears of oppressed orphanes, and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows.
Now in all these cases the rule holds. <hi>If the son inherits</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               <hi>the sin, he cannot call it unjust, if he inherits also his fathers pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</hi>
But to rescind the fatall chain and break in sunder the
line of Gods anger, a son is tied in all these cases to disavow his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
crime. But because the cases are severall, he must also in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
manners do it.</p>
            <p>1. Every man is bound not to glory in, or speak honour of
the powerfull and unjust actions of his Ancestors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But as all the
sons of Adam are bound to be ashamed of that originall stain
which they derive from the loins of their abused Father, they
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> must be humbled in it, they must deplore it as an evil Mother,
and a troublesome daughter: so must children account it amongst
the crosses of their family, and the stains of their honour, that
they passed thorow so impure chanels, that in the sense of mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
as well as nature, they can <hi>say to corruption, thou art my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and to rottennesse, thou art my mother.</hi> I do not say that sons
are bound to publish, or declaim against their father crimes, and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53465:29"/>
to speak of their shame in <hi>Piazza's</hi> and before <hi>Tribunals;</hi> that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
were a sure way to bring their fathers sins upon their own
heads, by their own faults. No: Like Sem, and Japhet they
must go backward, and cast a vail upon their nakednesse and
shame, lest they bring the curse of their fathers angry dishonour
upon their own impious and unrelenting heads. Noahs drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
fell upon Chams head, because he did not hide the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his fathers follies: he made his father ridiculous; but did
not endeavour either to amend the sin, or to wrap the dishonour
in a pious covering He that goes to disavow his fathers sin by
publishing his shame, hides an ill face with a more ugly vizor and en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deavours <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
by torches and phantastick lights, to quench the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of that house which his father set on fire: These fires are to
be smothered and so extinguished. I deny not but it may become
the piety of a childe to tell a sad story, to mourn, and represent
a reall grief for so great a misery, as is a wicked father or mother;
but this is to be done with a tendernesse, as nice as we would dresse
an eye withall; it must be onely with designes of charity, of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,
of ease, and with much prudence, and a sad spirit: These
things being secured, that which in this case remains is, that
with all entercourses between God and our selves, we disavow <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
the crime.</p>
            <p>Children are bound to pray to God, to sanctifie, to cure, to
forgive their parents: and even concerning the sins of our forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
the Church hath taught us in her Letanies, to pray that God
would be pleased to forgive them, so that neither we, nor they
may sink under the wrath of God for them. <hi>[Remember not Lord
our offences, nor the offences of our forefathers, neither take thou
vengeance of our sins: Ours]</hi> in common and conjunction: And Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid
confessed to God, and humbled himself for the sins of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors
and Decessors: <hi>Our fathers have done amisse, and dealt wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
neither kept they thy great goodnesse in remembrance, but
were disobedient at the sea, even at the red sea.</hi> So did good King
Josiah,<note place="margin">2 King 32. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Great is the wrath of the Lord which is kindled against us,
because our fathers have not hearkned unto the words of this book.</hi>
But this is to be done between God and our selves: or if in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
then to be done by generall accusation; that God onely may
read our particular sorrows in the single shame of our families
registred in our hearts, and represented to him with humiliation,
shame and a hearty prayer.</p>
            <p>2. Those curses which descend from the Fathers to the children <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
by imitation of the crimes of their progenitors, are to be cut off by
special and personal repentance, and prayer, as being a state di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
opposite to that which procured the curse: And if the sons be
pious, or return to an early and a severe course of Holy living, they
are to be remedied as other innocent and pious persons are, who
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53465:29"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> are sufferers under the burdens of their Relatives, whom I shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
by and by. Onely observe this; that no publick or imaginative
disavowings no ceremonial and pompous rescission of our Fathers
crimes can be sufficient to interrupt the succession of the curse, if
the children do secretly practise or approve what they in pretence
or ceremony disavow: and this is clearly proved (and it will help to
explicate that difficult saying of our B. Saviour,) <hi>Wo unto you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for ye
build the sepulchre of the Prophets and your Fathers killed them:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke. 11. 47.</note> 
               <hi>true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ye beare witnesse that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for they kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
them and ye build their sepulchres:</hi> that is, the Pharisees were
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> huge hypocrites, and adorned the monuments of the Martyr Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
and in words disclaim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d their Fathers sin, but in deeds and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
they approved it. 1. Because they secretly wish'd all such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
dead; <hi>colebant mortuos quos nollent Superstites:</hi> In charity to
themselves some men wish their enemies in Heaven, and would
be at charges for a monument for them, that their malice and their
power and their bones might rest in the same grave: and yet that
wish, and that expence is no testimony of their Charity but of their
anger. 2. These men were willing that the monuments of those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
should remain and be a visible affrightment to all such bold
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> persons and severe reprehenders as they were; and therefore they
builded their Sepulchres to be as beacons, and publications of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to al Honest Preachers. And this was the account Saint <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi>
gave of the place. 3. To which also the circumstances of
the place concur. For <hi>they onely said,</hi> if they had lived in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
dayes they would not have done as they did; but it is certain
they approved it, because they pursued the same courses: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our blessed Saviour calls them <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,<note place="margin">Mat. 23. 31.</note> Not onely the
children of them that did kill the Prophets, but <hi>a Killing generation;</hi>
the sin also descends upon you, for ye have the same killing minde,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and although you honour them that are dead, and cannot shame
you; yet you designe the same usages against them that are alive
even against the Lord of the Prophets, against Christ himself,
whom ye will kil: and as <hi>Dion</hi> said of <hi>Caracalla</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
The man was troublesome
to all good men when they were alive, but did them honour when
they were dead: And when <hi>Herod</hi> had killed <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> yet he made
him a most magnificent funeral; &amp; because the Pharisees were of the
same humor, therefore our blessed Saviour bids them to <hi>fil up the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of their Fathers iniquity;</hi> for they still continued the malice, onely
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> they painted it over with a pretence of piety, and of disavow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Fathers sin; which if they had done really, they being chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of persecutors, and much lesse could the <hi>adorning of the Prophets
sepulchres</hi> have been just cause of a wo from Christ; this being an
act of piety, and the other of nature, inevitable, and not chosen by
them; and therefore not chargable upon them. He therefore that
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53465:30"/>
will to reall purposes disavow his Fathers crimes; must do it hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
and humbly, and charitably, and throw off all affections to the
like actions. For he that findes fault with his Father for killing <hi>Isaiah,</hi>
or <hi>Jeremy,</hi> and himself shall ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l <hi>Aristobulus</hi> and <hi>John</hi> the Baptist;
he that is angry because the old Prophets were murdered, and
shall imprison, and begger and destroy the new ones; He that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avows
the persecution in the primitive times, and honours the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of the dead Martyrs, and yet every day makes new ones; He
that blames the oppression of the Country by any of his predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
and yet shall continue to oppresse his Tenants, and all that are
within his gripe, that man cannot hope to be eased from the curse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
of his Fathers sins: He goes on to imitate them, and therefore to
fill up their measure, and to reap a full treasure of wrath.</p>
            <p>3. But concerning the third; there is yet more difficulty. Those
sons that inherit their Fathers sins by possessing the price of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
souls, that is, by enjoying the goods gotten by their Fathers
rapine, may certainly quit the inheritance of the curse, if they quit
the purchase of the sin, that is, if they pay their Fathers debts; his
debts of contract, and his debts of justice; his debts of entercourse,
and his debts of oppression. I do not say that every man is bound
to restore all the land which his Ancestors have unjustly snatched:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
for when by law the possession is established, though the Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father
entred like a thief, yet the Grand-child is <hi>bonae fidei possessor,</hi>
and may enjoy it justly: and the reasons of this are great, and
necessary; for the avoiding eternal suites, and perpetual diseases
of rest and conscience: because there is no estate in the world that
could be enjoyed by any man honestly, if posterity were bound
to make restitution of all the wrongs done by their progenitors.
But although the children of the far removed lines, are not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to restitution, yet others are; and some for the same, some for
other reasons.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
            </p>
            <p>1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sons are tied to restore what their Fathers did usurpe, or
to make agreement, and an acceptable recompence for it, if the case
be visible, evident and notorious, and the oppressed party de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
it; because in this case the law hath not setled the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
in the new tenant: or if a judge hath, it is by injury; and
there is yet no collateral accidental title transferred by long pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,
as it is in other cases: and therefore if the son continues
to oppresse the same person, whom his Father first injured, he may
well expect to be the heire of his Fathers curse, as well as of his cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
purchase.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
            </p>
            <p>2. Whether by law and justice, or not, the person be obliged,
nay although by all the solemnities of law the unjust purchase be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished,
and that in conscience the Grand-children be not obliged
to restitution in their own particulars, but may continue to enjoy
it without a new sin; yet if we see a curse descending upon the family
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53465:30"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> for the old oppression done in the dayes of our Grandfathers; or
if we probably suspect that to be the cause; then if we make resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
we also most certainly remove the curse: because we take
away the matter upon which the curse is grounded: I do not say,
we sin, if we do not restore: but that, if we do not, we may still
be punished; The reason of this is clear and visible: For as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
our faults, in many cases we may enjoy those lands which our
forefathers got unjustly: so without our faults we may be punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for them. For as they have transmitted the benefit to us, it is
but reasonable we should suffer the appendant calamity. If we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> good, we must also venture the evil that comes along with it:
<hi>res transit cum suo onere.</hi> All lands and possessions passe with their
proper burdens. And if any of my Ancestors was a Tenant, and a
servant, and held his lands as a Villane to his Lord, his posterity
also must do so, though accidentally they become noble. The
case is the same If my Ancestors entred unjustly, there is a curse
and a plague that is due to that oppression and injustice; and that is
<hi>the burden of the land,</hi> and it descends all along with it: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I by the consent of laws am a just possessor, yet I am obliged
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to the burden that comes with the land: I am indeed another kinde
of person then my Grand-father; he was an usurper, but
I am a just possessor; but because in respect of the land
this was but an accidentall change, therefore I still am liable
to the burden, and the curse that descends with it: but
the way to take off the curse is to quit the title; and yet a man
may choose. It may be to loose the land would be the bigger curse:
but if it be not; the way is certain how you may be rid of it. * There
was a custome among the Greeks that the children of them that
dyed of consumptions or dropsies, all the while their Fathers bodies
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> were burning in their funeral piles did sit with their feet in cold
water, hoping that such a lustration, and ceremony would take off
the lineal and descending contagion from the children: I know not
what cure they found by their superstition; but we may be sure,
that if we wash (not our feet, but) our hands of all the unjust pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chases
which our Fathers have transmitted to us, their hydropick
thirst of wealth shall not transmit to us a consumption of estate, or
any other curse. But this remedy is onely in the matter of injury,
or oppression, not in the case of other sins: because other sins
were transient; and as the guilt did not passe upon the children, so
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> neither did the exteriour and permanent effect: and therefore in
other sins (in case they do derive a curse) it cannot be removed,
as in the matter of unjust possession, it may be; whose effect (we
may so order it) shall no more stick to us then the guilt of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
personal actions.</p>
            <p>The summe is this. As Kingdoms use to expiate the faults of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
by acts of justice: and as Churches use to remove the accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
thing from sticking to the communities of the faithful, and the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53465:31"/>
sins of Christians from being required of the whole Congregation,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
by excommunicating and censuring the delinquent persons: so the
Heires and sons of families, are to remove from their house the
curse descending from their Fathers loins, by 1. Acts of disavow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the sins of their Ancestors, 2. By praying for pardon, 3. by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
humbled for them, 4. By renouncing the example and, 5. Quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the affection to the crimes, 6. By not imitaing the actions in
Kinde, or in semblance and similitude; and lastly, 7. By refusing to
rejoyce in the ungodly purchases in which their Fathers did amisse
and dealt wickedly.</p>
            <p>Secondly, But after all this, many cases do occur, in which we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
finde that innocent sons are punished: The remedies I have already
discoursed of, are for such children who have in some manner or
other contracted and derived the sin upon themselves. But if we
inquire, how those sons who have no entercourse, or affinity with
their fathers sins; or whose fathers sins were so transient, that no
benefit or effect did passe upon their posterity, how they may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
or take off the curse that lyes upon the family, for their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
faults; this will have some distinct considerations.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. The pious children of evil Parents are to stand firme upon
the confidence of the Divine grace and mercy; and upon that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
to begin to work upon a new stock. For it is as certain that
he may derive a blessing upon his Posterity, as that his Parents
could transmit a curse: and if any man by piety shall procure Gods
favour to his Relatives and children, it is certain that he hath done
more, then to escape the punishment of his Fathers follies. If <hi>sin
doth abound,</hi> and evils by sin are derived from his Parents, <hi>much
more shall grace super abound,</hi> and mercy by grace. If he was in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
from the crimes of others, much rather shall he be secured by
his own piety: For if God punishes the sins of the fathers to four <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
generations, yet he rewards the piety of fathers to ten, to hundreds,
and to thousands. Many of the Ancestors of <hi>Abraham</hi> were persons
not noted for religion; but suffered in the publike impiety, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
universal idolatry of their ages; and yet all the evils that
could thence descend upon the family, were wiped off; and God
began to reckon with <hi>Abraham</hi> upon a new stock of blessings and
piety; and he was under God, the Original of so great a blessing,
that his family for 1500. years together had from him a title to
many favours; and what ever evils did chance to them in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending
ages, were but single evils, in respect of that treasure of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
mercies which the fathers piety had obtained to the whole nation.
And it is remarkable to observe; how blessings did stick to them
for their fathers sakes, even whether they would or no. For first,
his Grand-childe <hi>Esau</hi> proved a naughty man, and he lost the
great blessing which was intailed upon the family; but he got, not a
curse, but a lesse blessing: and yet because he lost the greater bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
God excluded him from being reckoned in the elder time;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53465:31"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> for God foreseeing the event, so ordered it that he should first
lose his birth-right, and then lose the blessing; for it was to be
certain, the family must be reckoned for prosperous in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
line; and yet God blessed <hi>Esau</hi> into a great Nation, and made
him the Father of many Princes. Now the line of blessing being
reckoned in <hi>Jacob,</hi> God blessed his family strangely, and by mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
for almost five generations; he brought them from Egypt by
mighty signes and wonders; and when for sin they all died in
their way to Canaan, two onely excepted, God so ordered it, that
they were all reckoned as single deaths, the Nation still descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> like a river whose waters were drunk up for the beauvrage of
an army, but still it keeps its name and current, and the waters are
supplied by showers, and springs, and providence. After this, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity
still increased, and then God struck deeper, and spread curses
upon whole families: he translated the Priesthood from line to
line, he removed the Kingome from one family to another; and still
they sinned worse; and then we read that God smote almost a whole
tribe; the tribe of Benjmin was almost extinguished about the matter
of the Levites Concubine: but <hi>still God remembred his promise</hi> which
he made with their forefathers, and that breach was made up Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> this we finde a greater rupture made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ten tribes fell into ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
and ten tribes were carried captives into Assyria and never
came again: But <hi>still God remembred his covenant with Abraham,</hi>
and left two Tribes; but they were restlesse in their provocation
of the God of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and they also were carried captive:
But still God was the God of their fathers and brought them back,
and placed them safe, and they grew again into a Kingdom and
should have remained for ever but that they killed one that was
greater then <hi>Abraham,</hi> even the Messias; and then they were rooted
out, and the old covenant cast off, and God delighted no more to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> be called <hi>the God of Abraham;</hi> but the <hi>Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ.</hi> As long as God kept that relation, so long <hi>for the fathers
sakes</hi> they had a title and an inheritance to a blessing: for so saith
Saint <hi>Paul [As touching the election they are beloved for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
sakes.]</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 28.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I did insist the longer upon this instance that I might remonstrate
how great and how sure, and how persevering mercies, a pious
Father of a family may derive upon his succeeding generations:
And if we do but <hi>tread in the footsteps of our Father Abraham,</hi> we
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> shall inherit as certain blessings. But then I pray, adde these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations.</p>
            <p>1. If a great impiety, and a clamorous wickednesse hath stain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the honour of a family, and discomposed its title to the Divine
mercies and protection, it is not an ordinary piety that can restore
this family. An ordinary, even course of life, full of sweetnesse,
and innocency will secure every single person in his own eternal
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53465:32"/>
interest: but that piety which must be a spring of blessings, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
communicative to others, that must plead against the sins of their
Ancestors, and begin a new bank of mercies for the Relatives; that,
must be a great, and excellent, a very religious state of life. A smal
pension will maintain a single person: but he that hath a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
family, and many to provide for, needs a greater providence
of God, and a bigger provision for their maintenance: and a small
revenue will not keep up the dignity of a great house; especially,
if it be charged with a great debt: And this is the very state of the
present question. That piety that must be instrumental to take off
the curse imminent upon a family; to blesse a numerous posterity,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
to secure a fair condition to many ages, and to pay the debts of
their Fathers sins, must be so large, as that all necessary expences,
and dutyes for his own soul being first discharged, it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable
in great expressions it may be exemplar to all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
it may be of universal efficacie, large in the extension of
parts, deep in the intension of degrees: and then, as the root of a
tree receives nourishment, not onely sufficient to preserve its own
life, but to transmit a plastick juice to the trunk of the tree, and
from thence to the utmost branch and smallest gem that knots in
the most distant part: So shall the great and exemplar piety <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
of the father of a family, not onely preserve to the interest of his
own soul the life of grace, and hopes of glory, but shall be a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
spirit, active and communicative of ablessing, not onely to the
trunk of the tree to the body and rightly descending line, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the collateral branches, to the most distant relatives, and
all that shall claim a kinred, shall have a title to a blessing. And
this was the way that was prescribed to the family of <hi>Eli,</hi> upon
whom a sad curse was intailed that there should not be an old man
of the family for ever, and that they should be beggers, and lose
the office of Priesthood: by the counsel of R. <hi>Johanan</hi> the son <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
of <hi>Zacheus</hi> all the family betook themselves to a great, a strict
and a severe religion; and God was intreated to revoke his decree,
to be reconciled to the family, to restore them to the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of men, from whence they stood separate by the displeasure
of God against the crime of <hi>Eli,</hi> and his Sons <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinehas.</hi>
This course is sure either to take off the judgement, or to change it
into a blessing; to take a way the rod, or the smart and evil of it;
to convert the punishment into a meer naturall, or humane chance,
and that chance to the opportunity of a vertue, and that vertue
to the occasion of a crown.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
            </p>
            <p>2. It is of great use for the securing of families, that every
Master of a family order his life so that his piety and vertue be as
communicative as is posible; that is, that he secure the religion
of his whole family, by a severe supravision and animadversion,
and by cutting off all those unprofitable and hurtful branches
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53465:32"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> which load the tree and hinder the growth, and stock &amp; disimprove
the fruit, &amp; revert evil juice to the very root it self. Calvisius Sabinus
laid out vast sums of mony upon his servants, to stock his house with
learned men; and bought one that could recite all Homer by heart;
a second that was ready at Hesiod; a third at Pindar; and for every
of the Lyricks one: having this fancy that all that learning was his
own, &amp; what soever his servants knew, made him so much the more
skilful. It was noted in the man for a rich and a prodigal folly: but if
he had chang'd his instance, &amp; bought none but vertuous servants in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his house, he might better have reckoned his wealth upon their
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> stock, &amp; the piety of his family might have helped to blesse him, and
to have increased the treasure of the Masters vertue. Every man that
would either cut off the title of an old curse, or secure a blessing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a new stock, must make vertue as large in the fountain as he can
that it may the sooner water all his Relatives with fruitfulnesse and
blessings. And this was one of the things that God noted in Abraham,
and blessed his family for it, and his posterity. <hi>I know that Abraham
will teach his sons to fear me.</hi> When a man teaches his family to know
and fear God, then he scatters a blessing round about his habitation.
And this helps to illustrate the reason of the thing as well as to prove
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> its certainty. We hear it spoken in our books of Religion, that the
faith of the parents is imputed to their children to good purposes, &amp;
that a good husband sanctifies an ill wife, &amp; <hi>a beleeving wife, an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
husband;</hi> and either of them makes the children to be sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>else they were unclean, and unholy;</hi> that is, the very designing chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to the service of God is a sanctification of them; and therefore
S. Hierom cals Christian children <hi>Candidatos fidei Christianae:</hi> and
if this very designation of them makes them holy; that is, acceptable
to God, intitled to the promises, partakers of the Covenant, within
the condition of sons; much more shall it be effectual to greater bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> when the Parents take care that the children shall be actually
pious, full of sobriety, full of religion, then it becomes a holy house,
<hi>a chosen generation, an elect family;</hi> and then there can no evil happen
to them, but such which will bring them neerer to God; that is, no
crosse, but the crosse of Christ; no misfortune, but that which shall
lead them to felicity: and if any semblance of a curse happens in the
generations it is but like the anathema of a sacrifice; not an <hi>accursed,</hi>
but a <hi>devoted</hi> thing: for so the sacrifice upon whose neck the Priests
knife doth fall, is so far from being accursed, that it helps to get a
blessing to all that joyn in the oblation: so every misfortune that shal
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> discompose the ease of a pious and religious family shall but make
them sit to be presented unto God; and the rod of God shall be like
the branches of fig-trees, bitter and sharp in themselves, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive
of most delicious fruit: no evil can curse the family whose
stock is pious, and <hi>whose branches are Holinesse unto the Lord.</hi> If any
leaf, or any boughs shall fall untimely, God shall gather it up, and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53465:33"/>
place it in his Temple, or at the foot of his throne; and that family <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
must needs be blessed, whom infelicity it self cannot make accursed.</p>
            <p>3. If a curse be feared to descend upon a family for the fault of
their Ancestors; pious sons have yet another way to secure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
&amp; to withdraw the curse from the family, or themselves from
the curse; and that is, by doing some very great &amp; illustrious act of
piety, an action <hi>in gradu heroico</hi> (as Aristotle cals it) an heroicall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
If there should happen to be one Martyr in a family, it would re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>concile
the whole kinred to God, &amp; make him who is more inclined
to mercy then to severity, rather to be pleased with the Relatives of
the Martyr, then continue to be angry with the Nephews of a decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
sinner. I cannot insist long upon this: But you may see it proved
by one great instance in the case of Phinehas, who killed an unclean
Prince, &amp; turned the wrath of God from his people: he was zealous
for God and for his countreymen, &amp; did an heroicall action of zeal:
Wherefore (saith God) <hi>Behold I give unto him my covenant of peace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Numb. 25. 12.</note>
               <hi>and he shall have it, &amp; his seed after him, even the covenant of an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, &amp; made an atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the children of Israel.</hi> Thus the sons of Rechab obtain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d the
blessing of an enduring and blessed family, because they were most
strict &amp; religious observers of their fathers precept, and kept it after <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
his death, &amp; abstained from wine for ever; and no temptation could
invite them to taste it; for they had as great reverence to their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ashes, as being children they had to his rod, &amp; to his eyes. Thus
a man may turn the wrath of God from his family, &amp; secure a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
for posterity, by doing some great noble acts of charity, or a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
chastity, like that of Joseph; or an expensive, an effectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
religion and love to Christ and his servants (as Mary Magdalene
did). Such things as these which are extraordinary egressions and
transvolations beyond the ordinary course of an even piety, God
loves to reward with an extraordinary favour; and gives it testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
by an extraregular blessing.</p>
            <p>One thing more I have to adde by way of advice; and that is, that
all parents and fathers of families, from whose loyns a blessing or a
curse usually does descend, be very carefull, not onely generally
in all the actions of their lives (for that I have already pressed) but,
particularly in the matter of repentance; that they be curious that
they finish it, &amp; do it thorowly: for there are certain <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
leavings of repentance, which makes that Gods anger is taken from
us so imperfectly: and although God for his sake who died for us,
will pardon a returning sinner, &amp; bring him to heaven through tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
&amp; a fiery triall; yet when a man is weary of his sorrow, &amp;
his fastings are a load to him, &amp; his sins are not so perfectly renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
or hated as they ought, the parts of repentance which are left
unfinished do sometimes fall upon the heads, or upon the fortunes
of the children. I do not say, this is regular and certain, but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53465:33"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> God deals thus. For this thing hath been so, and therefore it
may be so again: we see it was done in the case of <hi>Ahab;</hi> he humbled
himself and went softly, and lay in sackcloth, and called for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
and God took from him a judgement which was falling hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily
upon him: but we all know his repentance was imperfect and
lame: The same evil fell upon his sons; for so said God; I will bring
the evil upon his house in his sons dayes. Leave no arreares for thy
posterity to pay; but repent with an integral, a holy and excellent
repentance, that God being reconciled to thee thoroughly, for thy
sake also he may blesse thy seed after thee.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> And after all this, adde a continual, a servent, a hearty, a never
ceasing prayer for thy children, ever remembring when they beg a
blessing, that God hath put much of their fortune into your hands;
and a transient formal <hi>[God blesse thee]</hi> will not out-weigh the load
of a great vice; and the curse that scatters from thee by virtual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact,
and by the chanels of relation, if thou beest a vicious person:
Nothing can issue from thy fountain but bitter waters. And as it were
a great impudence for a condemned Traitor to beg of his injured
Prince a province for his son, for his sake so it is an ineffective blessing
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> we give our children, when we beg <hi>for them,</hi> what we have no title
to for our selves, Nay, when we can convey to them nothing but a
curse. The praier of a sinner, the unhallowed wish of a vit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is but a poor donative to give to a childe who suck'd poison from
his nurse, and derives cursing from his Parents. They are punished
with a double torture in the shame and paines of the damned, who
dying Enemies to God have left an inventary of sins and wrath to be
divided amongst their children. But they that can truely give a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to their children, are such as live a blessed life, and pray holy
prayers, and perform an integral repentance, and do separate from
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the sins of their Progenitors, and do illustrious actions, and begin
the blessing of their family upon a new stock; for as from the eyes
of some persons, there shoots forth a visible influence; and some
have <hi>an evil eye,</hi> and are infectious; some look healthfully as a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
planet, and innocent as flowers: and as some fancies convey pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

own gracious acceptation. For God cannot be glorified by any
thing but by himself, and by his own instruments, which he makes
as mirrours to reflect his own excellency, that by seeing the glory
of such emanations, he may rejoyce in his own works, because
they are images of his infinity. Thus when he made the beauteous
frame of heaven and earth, he rejoyced in it, and glorified himself,
because it was the glasse in which he beheld his wisedom, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
power: And when God destroyed the old world, in that
also he glorified himself; for in those waters he saw the image of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> his justice; they were the looking glasse for that Attribute; and
God is said <hi>to laugh at,</hi> and <hi>rejoyce in the destruction of a sinner,</hi>
because he is pleased with the Oeconomy of his own lawes, and
the excellent proportions he hath made of his judgements, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
to our sins. But above all, God rejoyced in his Holy Son,
for he was the image of the Divinity, <hi>the character and expresse
image of his person,</hi> in him he beheld his own Essence, his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
his power, his justice, and his person, and he was that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
instrument, designed from eternall ages to represent as in
a double mirrour, not onely the glories of God to himself, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to all the world; and he glorified God by the instrument of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
in which God beheld his own dominion, and the sanctity
of his lawes clearly represented; and he saw his justice glorified,
when it was fully satisfied by the passion of his Son; and so he
hath transmitted to us a great manner of the Divine glorification,
being become to us the Authour, and the Example of giving glory
to God after the manner of men, that is, by well-doing, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
suffering, by obeying his lawes, and submitting to his power,
by imitating his holinesse, and confessing his goodnesse, by remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
innocent, <hi>or becoming penitent;</hi> for this also is called in the Text
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>[GIVING GLORY TO THE LORD OUR GOD.]</p>
            <p>For he that hath dishonoured God by sins, that is, hath denied,
by a morall instrument of duty, and subordination, to confesse
the glories of his power, and the goodnesse of his lawes, and hath
dishonoured, and despised his mercy, which God intended as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of our piety, hath no better way to glorifie God, then
by returning to his duty, to advance the honour of the Divine
Attributes in which he is pleased to communicate himself, and to
have entercourse with man. He that repents, confesses his owner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and the righteousnesse of Gods lawes, and by judging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
confesses that he deserves punishment, and therefore that God
is righteous if he punishes him: and by returning, confesses God
to be the fountain of felicity, and the foundation of true, solid,
and permanent joyes, saying in the sense and passion of the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<hi>Whither shall we go? for thou hast the words of eternall life:</hi>
and by humbling himself, exalts God by making the proportions
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53465:35"/>
of distance more immense, and vast: and as repentance does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
in it all the parts of holy life which can be performed by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
sinner (all the acts, and habits of vertue, being but parts,
or instances, or effects of repentance): so all the actions of a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
life do constitute the masse and body of all those instruments
whereby God is pleased to glorifie himself. * For if God is glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in the Sunne and Moon, in the rare fabrick of the honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combs,
in the discipline of Bees, in the oeconomy of Pismires, in
the little houses of birds, in the curiosity of an eye, God being
pleased to delight in those little images and reflexes of himself
from those pretty mirrours, which like a crevice in a wall thorow <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
a narrow perspective transmit the species of a vast excellency:
much rather shall God be pleased to behold himself in the glasses
of our obedience, in the emissions of our will and understanding;
these being rationall and apt instruments to expresse him, farre
better then the naturall, as being neerer communications of
himself.</p>
            <p>But I shall no longer discourse of the Philosophy of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression;
certain it is, that in the stile of Scripture, <hi>repentance</hi> is
the great <hi>glorification of God;</hi> and the Prophet, by calling the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to <hi>give God glory,</hi> calls upon them to <hi>repent;</hi> and so expresses <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
both the duty and the event of it; the event being <hi>[Glory to God
on high, and peace on earth, and good will towards men]</hi> by the
sole instrument of <hi>repentance.</hi> And this was it which Joshuah said
to Achan,<note place="margin">Joshuah 7. 19.</note> [Give I pray thee glory to the Lord God of Israel,
and make confession unto him: that one act of repentance is one
act of glorifying God:<note place="margin">Psal. 51. 4.</note> and this, David acknowledged, Against
the onely have I sinned, <hi>ut tu justificeris,</hi> that thou mightest be
justified, or cleared, that is, that God may have the honour of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
righteous, and we, the shame of receding from so excellent a
perfection:<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 4.</note> or as S. Paul quotes and explicates the place. <hi>Let God
be true, and every man a liar, as it is written, that thou mightest be</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               <hi>justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.</hi>
But to clear the sense of this expression of the Prophet, observe
the words of S. John:<note place="margin">Revel. 16. 9.</note> 
               <hi>and men were scorched with great heat, and
blasphemed the name of God who hath power over those plagues, and
they repented not to give him glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that having strength and reason from these so many autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
I may be free to read the words of my Text thus, <hi>[Repent of
all your sins before God cause darknesse, and before your feet stumble
upon the dark mountains]</hi> and then we have here the duty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
and the time of its performance; it must be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
a seasonable and timely repentance, a repentance which must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
before our darknesse begin, a repentance in the day time, <hi>ut
dum dies est operemini,</hi> that ye may work while it is to day, lest if
we <hi>stumble upon the dark mountains,</hi> that is, fall into the ruines of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53465:35"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> old age, which makes a broad way narrow, and a plain way to
be a craggy mountain; or if we stumble and fall into our last
sicknesse, instead of health God send us to our grave, and instead
of light and salvation which we then confidently look for, he
make our state to be outer darknesse, that is, misery irremediable,
misery eternall.</p>
            <p>This exhortation of the Prophet was alwayes full of caution
and prudence, but now it is highly necessary; since men who are so
clamorously called to repentance that they cannot avoid the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of it, yet that they may reconcile an evil life with the hopes of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> heaven, have crowded this duty into so little room, that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
strangled and extinct; and they have lopped off so many
members, that they have reduced the whole body of it to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions
of a little finger, sacrificing their childhood to vanity,
their youth to lust, and to intemperance, their manhood to am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
and rage, pride and revenge, secular desires, and unholy
actions; and yet still further, giving their old age to covetousnesse
and oppression, to the world, and to the Devil; and after all this
what remains for God and for Religion? Oh, for that, they wll
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> do well enough; upon their death-bed they will think a few
godly thoughts, they will send for a Priest to minister comfort to
them; they will pray and ask God forgivenesse, and receive the
holy Sacrament, and leave their goods behinde them, disposing
them to their friends and relatives, and some Dole, and issues of
the almes-basket to the poor; and if after all this they die quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and like a lambe, and be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>anoniz'd by a brib'd flatterer in a
funerall sermon, they make no doubt but they are children of the
kingdom, and perceive not their folly, till without hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
they roar in their expectations of a certain, but a horrid eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of pains. * Certainly nothing hath made more ample harvests
for the Devil, then the deferring of repentance upon vain confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
and lessening it in the extension of parts, as well as inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of degrees, while we imagine that a few tears, and scatterings
of devotion are enough to expiate the basenesse of a fifty or three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
yeers impiety. This I shall endeavour to cure, by shewing
what it is to repent, and that repentance implies in it the duty of a
life, or of many and great, of long and lasting parts of it; and
then by direct arguments, shewing that repentance put off to our
death-bed is invalid and ineffectuall, sick, languid, and impotent,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> like our dying bodies and disabled faculties.</p>
            <p>1. First therefore, Repentance implies a deep sorrow, as the
beginning and introduction of this duty; not a superficiall sigh,
or tear, not a calling our selves sinners, and miserable persons;
this is far from that <hi>godly sorrow that worketh repentance;</hi> and
yet I wish there were none in the world, or none amongst us, who
cannot remember that ever they have done this little towards the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53465:36"/>
abolition of their multitudes of sins; but yet if it were not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
a hearty, pungent sorrow, a sorrow that shall break the heart in
pieces; a sorrow that shall so irreconcile us to sin, as to make
us rather choose to die then to sin, it is not so much as the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of repentance. But in Holy Scripture, when the people are
called to repentance, and sorrow (which is ever the prologue to it)
marches sadly, and first opens the seene, it is ever expressed to be
great,<note place="margin">Ezek. 27. 31.</note> clamorous and sad: it is called [a weeping sorely] in the verse
next after my text,<note place="margin">Joel: 2. 13.</note> [a weeping with the bitternesse of heart; a
turning to the Lord with weeping, fasting, and mourning; a weeping
day and night; the sorrow of heart; the breaking of the spirit; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
the mourning like a dove, and chattering like a swallow;] and if
we observe the threnes and sad accents of the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi>
when he wept for the sins of his Nation, the heart-breakings of
<hi>David</hi> when he mourned for his adultery and murder, and the
bitter tears of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> when he washed off the guilt and base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his fall, and the denying his Master; we shall be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
instructed in this praeludium or introduction to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
and that it is not every breath of a sigh, or moisture of a
tender eye, not every crying [Lord have mercy upon me] that
is such a sorrow as begins our restitution to the state of grace and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
Divine favour: but such a sorrow that really condemnes our
selves, and by an active, effectual sentence declares us wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of stripes and death, of sorrow and eternall paines, and
willingly endures the first to prevent the second; and weeps and
mourns, and fasts to obtain of God but to admit us to a possibility
of restitution: and although all sorrow for sins hath not the same
expression, nor the same degree of pungency and sensitive trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
(which differs according to the temper of the body custome,
the sexe,<note place="margin">see Rule of II. living. D. of repentance. p. 335.</note> and accidental tendernesse) yet it is not a Godly sorrow
unlesse it really produce these effects; that is, 1. That it makes us <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
really to hate, &amp; 2. actually to decline sin, and 3. produce in us a fear
fo Gods anger, a sense of the guilt of his displeasure; and 4. Then,
such consequent trouble as can consist with such apprehension of the
Divine displeasure: which if it expresse not in tears and hearty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
must be expressed in watchings and strivings against sin,
in confessing the goodnesse and justice of God threatning or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
us, in patiently bearing the rod of God, in confession of our
sins, in accusation of our selves, in perpetual begging of pardon,
and mean and base opinions of our selves, and in al the natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
from these; according to our temper and constitution; it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
must be a sorrow of the reasonable faculty, the greatest in its
kinde; and if it be lesse in kinde; or not productive of these
effects, it is not a godly sorrow, not the exordium of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>But I desire that it be observed, that sorrow for sins, is not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53465:36"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> not that duty which gives glory to God, so as to obtain
of him that he will glorifie us. Repentance is a great volume of
duty; and Godly sorrow is but the frontispiece or title page: it is
the harbinger or first introduction to it; or if you will consider it
in the words of Saint <hi>Paul:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor 7.</note> [Godly sorrow worketh repentance]
sorrow is the Parent, and repentance is the product; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is a high piece of ignorance to suppose that, a crying out
and roaring for our sins upon our deathbed can reconcile us to God;
our crying to God must be so early, and so lasting, as to be able
to teeme, and produce such a daughter, which must live long,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and grow from an Embryo to an infant, from infancy to childhood,
from thence to the fulnesse of the stature of Christ, and then it is a
holy and a happy sorrow: but if it be a sorrow onely of a death-bed,
it is a fruitlesse shower, or like the rain of Sodom not the beginning
of repentance, but the kindling of a flame, the comencement of
an eternal sorrow. For Ahab had a great sorrow, but it wrought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
upon his spirit, it did not reconcile his affections to his duty, and
his duty to God. <hi>Judas</hi> had so great a sorrow for betraying the
innocent blood of his Lord, that it was intolerable to his Spirit,
and he burst in the middle: and if meer sorrow be repentance, then
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> hell is full of penitents, for <hi>[there is weeping and wailing, and gna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
of teeth for evermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us therefore beg of God (as <hi>Calebs</hi> daughter did of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
<hi>dedisti mihi terram aridam, da etiam &amp; irrig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hast given me a dry land, give me also a land of waters, a dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
place in tears, rivers of tears, <hi>ut quoniam non sumus digni ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los
orando ad coelum levare, at simus digni oculos plorando caecare,</hi> as
Saint <hi>Austins</hi> expression is, that because we are not worthy to lift
up our eyes to heaven in prayer, yet we may be worthy to weep
our selves blinde for sin, the meaning is, that we beg sorrow of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> God, such a sorrow as may be sufficient to quench the flames of
lust, and surmount the hills of our pride, and may extinguish our
thirst of covetousnesse; that is, a sorrow that shall be an effective
principle of arming all our faculties against sin, and heartily set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
upon the work of grace, and the persevering labours of a holy
life. * I shall onely adde one word to this: That our sorrow for
sin is not to be estimated by our tears, and our sensible expressions,
but by our active hatred, and dereliction of sin: and is many
times unperceived in outward demonstration. It is reported of the
Mother of Peter Lombard, Gratian, and Comestor, that she having
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> had three sons begotten in unhallowed embraces, upon her death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
did omit the recitation of those crimes to her confessour; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
this for Apology, that her three sons proved persons so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
in the Church that their excellency was abundant recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
for her demerit: and therefore she could not grieve, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
God had glorified himself so much by three instruments so
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53465:37"/>
excellent; and that although her sin had abounded, yet Gods grace <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
did superabound. Her Confessor replied, <hi>at dole Saltem quod dolere
non possis,</hi> grieve that thou canst not grieve: and so must we, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
fear that our trouble for sin is nor great enough, that our
sorrow is too remisse, that our affections are indifferent; but we can
onely be sure that our sorrow is a godly sorrow, when it worketh
repentance; that is, when it makes us hate and leave all our sin,
and take up the crosse of patience or penance: that is, confesse our
sin, accuse our selves, condemn the action by hearty sentence;
and then, if it hath no other emanation but fasting and prayer for
its pardon, and hearty industry towards its abolition, our sorrow is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
not reproveable.</p>
            <p>For, sorrow alone will not do it; there must follow a total dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liction
of our sin; and this is the first part of repentance. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which, I consider, that it is a sad mistake amongst many that
do some things towards repentance, that they mistake the first ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses,
and instruments of this part of repentance for the whole
duty it self. Confession of sins is in order to the dereliction of them;
but then confession must not be like the unlading of a ship to take
in new stowage; or the vomits of intemperance, which ease the
stomack that they may continue the merry meeting: but such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
is too frequent, in which men either comply with custome
or seek to ease a present load, or gripe of conscience, or are willing
to dresse up their souls against afestival, or hope for pardon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
so easie terms: these are but retirings back to leap the further
into mischief; or but approaches to God with the lips; no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
can be of any use, but as it is an instrument of shame to the
person, of humiliation of the man, and dereliction of the sin, and
receives its recompence but as it ads to these purposes: all other,
is like the bleating of the calves, and the lowing of the Oxen which
<hi>Saul</hi> reserved after the spoil of <hi>Agag:</hi> they proclaim the sin, but
do nothing towards its cure; they serve Gods end to make us just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
to be condemned out of our own mouthes, but nothing at all
towards our absolution. * Nay, if we proceed further, to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
expressions of humiliation (parts of which I reckon, fasting,
praying for pardon, judging and condemning of our selves by
instances of a present indignation against a crime) yet unlesse this
proceed so far as to a total deletion of the sin, to the extirpation
of every vitious habit, God is not glorified by our repentance,
nor we secured in our eternal interest. Our sin must be brought
to judgement, and like Antinous in <hi>Homer,</hi> layed in the mids as the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
sacrifice and the cause of all the mischief.</p>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Well? let us suppose our penitent advanced thus far,
as that he decrees against all sin, and in his hearty purposes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves
to decline it, as in a severe sentence he hath condemned it
as his betrayer and his murderer; yet we must be curious for now
onely the repentance properly begins) that it be not onely like the
springings of the thorny or the high way ground, soon up and soon
down: For some men when a sadnesse or an unhandsome accident
surprizes them, then they resolve against their sin, but like the
goats in Aristotle they give their milk no longer then they are
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> stung: as soon as the thorns are removed, these men return
to their first hardnesse, and resolve then to act their first tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Others there are who never resolve against a sin, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
when they have no temptation to it, or when their appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites
are newly satisfied with it, like those who immediately
after a full dinner resolve to fast at supper, and they keep it

               </gap>es like
the cords of vanity or the gossamere against the violence of
the Northen winde. Thus a lustfull person fills all the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of his lust, and when he is wearied, and the sin goes off
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> with unquietnesse and regret, and the appetite falls down like
a horseleech when it is ready to burst with putrifaction and
an unwholsome plethory; then he resolves to be a good man
and could almost vow to be a Hermit, and hates his lust, as
Amnon hated his sister Thamar, just when he had newly acted his
unworthy rape; but the next spring tide that comes, every
wave of the temptation, makes an inrode upon the resolution and
gets ground, and prevailes against it more then his resolution pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
against his sin: How many drunken persons, how many
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Swearers resolve daily and hourely against their sin, and yet act
them not once the lesse for all their insinite heape of shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
retreating purposes * That resolution that begins upon
just grounds of sorrow and severe judgement, upon fear and
love, that is made in the midst of a temptation, that is inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
into all the means and instruments of the cure, that prayes
perpetually against a sin; that watches continually against a
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53465:38"/>
surprize, and never sinks into it by deliberation; that fights <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
earnestly and carries on the war prudently and prevailes by a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

pious and well begun repentance. They that have their fits of
a quartan, well and ill for ever, and think themselves in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
health, when the ague is retired till its period returnes, are
dangerously mistaken. Those intervals of imperfect and fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
resolution, are nothing but states of death: and if a man

them) he is no neerer to obtain his blessed hope, then a man in

his disease still remaining, and threatning an unwelcome
return. That resolution onely is the beginning of a holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
which goes forth into act, and whose acts enlarge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
habits, and whose habits are productive of the fruits of a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
life.</p>
            <p>From hence we are to take our estimate, whence our reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
of piety must commence. He that resolves not to live
well till the time comes that he must die, is ridiculous in his
great designe, as he is impertinent in his intermedial purposes,
and vain in his hope. Can a dying man to any real effect resolve <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
to be chast? (for vertue must be an act of election, and chastity
is the contesting against a proud and an imperious lust, active flesh,
and insinuating temptation) And what doth he resolve against who
can no more be tempted to the sin of unchastity then he can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
back again to his youth and vigour. And it is conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
that since all the purposes of a holy life which a dying
man can make, cannot be reduced to act, by what law, or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
or covenant, or revelation are we taught to distinguish the
resolution of a dying man from the purposes of a living and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
person? Suppose a man in his youth and health mooved <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
by consideration of the irregularity and deformity, of sin, the
danger of its productions, the wrath and displeasure of Almightie
God, should resolve to leave the puddles of impurity, and walk
in the paths of righteousnesse; can this resolution alone put him
into the state of grace; is he admitted to pardon and the favour
of God before he hath in some measure performed actually what
he so reasonably hath resolved? By no means. For, [resolution
and purpose] is in its own nature and constitution an imperfect
act, and therefore can signifie nothing without its performance and
consummation. It is as a faculty is to the act, as spring is to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
harvest, as feed time is to the Autumne, as Egges are to
birds, or as a relative to its correspondent; nothing without
it. And can it be imagined that a resolution in our health and
life shall be ineffectual without performance and shall a reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
barely such, do any Good upon our deathbed? Can such
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53465:38"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> purposes prevail against a long impiety rather then against a young
and a newly begun state of sin? Will God at an easier rate pardon
the sins of fifty or sixty yeers, then the sins of our youth onely,
or the iniquity of five yeers, or ten? If a holy life be not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to be liv'd, why shall it be necessary to resolve to live it? But
if a holy life be necessary, then it cannot be sufficient meerly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
it, unlesse this resolution go forth in an actuall and reall ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
Vain therefore is the hope of those persons who either go on
in their sins; before their last sicknesse, never thinking to return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the wayes of God, from whence they have wandred all their life,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> never renewing their resolutions and vows of holy living; or if
they have, yet their purposes are for ever blasted with the next
violent temptation. More prudent was the prayer of David, <hi>[Oh
spare me a little, that I may recover my strength before I go hence and
be no more seen:]</hi> And something like it was the saying of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
Charles the fifth, <hi>Inter vitae negotia &amp; mortis diem oportet
spacium intercedere:</hi> When ever our holy purposes are renewed,
unlesse God gives us time to act them, to mortifie and subdue our
lusts, to conquer and subdue the whole kingdom of sin, to rise
from our grave and be clothed with nerves and flesh and a new skin,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to overcome our deadly sicknesses, and by little and little to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to health and strength; unlesse we have grace and time to do
all this, our sins will lie down with us in our graves. * For when
a man hath contracted a long habit of sin, and it hath been grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon him ten or twenty, fourty or fifty yeers, whose acts he
hath daily or hourly repeated, and they are grown to a second
nature to him, and have so prevailed upon the ruines of his spirit,
that the man is taken <hi>captive by the Devil at his will,</hi> he is fast
bound as a slave tugging at the oar, that he is grown in love with
his fetters, and longs to be doing the work of sin, is it likely that
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> all this progresse and groweth in sin (in the wayes of which he
runs fast without any impediment) is it (I say) likely, that a few
dayes or weeks of sicknesse can recover him? [the especiall hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances
of that state I shall afterwards consider] but, Can a
man be supposed so prompt to piety and holy living, a man (I
mean) that hath lived wickedly a long time together, can he be of
so ready and active a vertue upon the sudden, as to recover in a
moneth, or a week what he hath been undoing in 20, or 30 yeers?
Is it so easie to build, that a weak and infirm person, bound hand and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> foot shall be able to build more in three dayes, then was a building
above fourty yeers? Christ did it in a figurative sence; but in this,
it is not in the power of any man so suddenly to be recovered from
so long a sicknesse. Necessary therefore it is, that all these instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of our conversion, <hi>[Confession of sins, praying for their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and resolutions to lead a new life]</hi> should begin, <hi>[before our
feet stumble upon the dark mountains,]</hi> lest we leave the work onely
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53465:39"/>
resolved upon to be begun, which, it is necessary we should in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
many degrees finish if ever we mean to escape the eternall dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
<q>For that we should actually abolish the <hi>whole body of sin
and death,</hi> that we should <hi>crucifie the old man with his lusts,</hi> that
we should <hi>lay aside every weight, and the sin that doth so easily
beset us,</hi> that we should <hi>cast away the works of darknesse,</hi> that we
should <hi>awake from sleep, and arise from death,</hi> that we should
<hi>redeem the time,</hi> that we should <hi>cleanse our hands and purifie our
hearts,</hi> that we should have <hi>escaped the corruption,</hi> (all the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption)
<hi>that is in the whole world through lust,</hi> that <hi>nothing of
the old leaven should remain in us,</hi> but that we be <hi>wholly a new <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> lump, throughly transformed and changed in the image of our minde:</hi>
               </q>
these are the perpetuall precepts of the Spirit, and the certain
duty of man; and that, to have all these in purpose onely, is
meerly to no purpose, without the actuall eradication of every
vitious habit, and the certain abolition of every criminall adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
is clearly and dogmatically decreed every where in the
Scripture;<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 24.</note> For (they are the words of Saint Paul) <hi>they that are
Christs have crucified the flesh, with the affections and lusts:</hi> the
work is actually done, and sin is dead, or wounded mortally, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they can in any sence belong to Christ, to be a portion of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
inheritance:<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 15.</note> And <hi>He that is in Christ is a new creature.</hi> For <hi>in Christ
Jesus nothing can avail but a new creature:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5. c.</note> nothing but a <hi>Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Commandements of God:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 9.</note> Not all our tears, though we
should weep like David and his men at Ziklag, till <hi>they could
weep no more,</hi> or the women of Ramah, or like <hi>the weeping in
the valley of Hinnom,</hi> could suffice, if we retain the affection to
any one sin, or have any unrepented of, or unmortified. It is true
that <hi>a contrite and broken heart, God will not despise.</hi> No, he will
not. For if it be a hearty and permanent sorrow, it is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
beginning of repentance; and God will to a timely sorrow <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
give the grace of repentance: He will not give pardon to sorrow
alone; but that which ought to be the proper effect of sorrow,
that God shall give. He shall then open the gates of mercy, and
admit you to a possibility of restitution; so, that you may be
within the covenant of repentance, which if you actually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
you may expect Gods promise. And in this sense Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
will obtain our pardon; and humiliation will be accepted;
and our holy purposes, and pious resolutions shall be accounted
for; that is, these being the first steps and addresses to that part of
repentance, which consists in the abolition of sins, shall be accepted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
so far, as to procure so much of the pardon, to do so much of the
work of restitution, that God will admit the returning man to a
further degree of emendation, to a neerer possibility of working
out his salvation: but then if this sorrow, and confession, and strong
purposes begin then when our life is declined towards the West,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53465:39"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and is now ready to set in darknesse and a dismall night; because
of themselves they could but procure an admission to repentance,
not at all to pardon, and plenary absolution; by shewing that on
our death-bed these are too late and ineffectuall, they call upon us
to begin betimes, when these imperfect acts may be consummate,
and perfected in the actuall performing those parts of holy life, to
which they were ordained, in the nature of the thing, and the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
of God.</p>
            <p>Lastly, suppose all this be done, and that by a long course of
strictnesse and severity, mortification and circumspection we have
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> overcome all our vitious and baser habits contracted and grown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us, like the ulcers and evils of a long surfet, and that we are clean
and swept; Suppose that he hath wept and fasted, prayed and
vowed to excellent purposes; yet all this is but the one half of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;
(so infinitely mistaken is the world, to think any thing to
be enough to make up repentance;) but to renew us, and restore us
to the favour of God, there is required far more then what hath
been yet accounted for. See it in the second of S. Peter, 1 Chap. 4, 5.
vers. <hi>Having escaped the corruption that is in the world thorough lust:</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
               <hi>And besides this, giving all diligence, adde to your faith vertue, to
vertue knowledge, to knowledge temperance, to temperance patience,
and so on, to godlinesse, to brotherly kindnesse, and to charity: These
things must be in you and abound:</hi> This is the summe totall of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;
We must not onely have overcome sin, but we must
after great diligence have acquired the habits of all those Christian
graces which are necessary in the transaction of our affairs, in all
relations to God, and our neighbour, and our own person. It
is not enough to say, <hi>Lord, I thank thee I am no extortioner,
no adulterer, not as this Publican;</hi> all the reward of such a poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent

us in Baptisme; which is, <q>That being redeemed from our vain

all our dayes.</q> Now when any of us hath prevaricated our
part of the Covenant, we must return to that state, and redeem
the intermedial time spent in sin by our doubled industry in the
wayes of grace: we must be reduced to our first estate, and make <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
some proportionable returns of duty, for our sad omissions, and
great violations of our Baptismal vow. For God having made no
covenant with us, but that which is consigned in Baptisme; in the
same proportion in which we retain, or return to that, in the same
we are to expect the pardon of our sins, and all the other promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
Evangelicall; but no otherwise; unlesse we can shew a new
Gospel, or be baptized again by Gods appointment. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that by a long habit, by a state and continued course of sin,
hath gone so far from his baptismal purity, as that he hath nothing
of the Christian left upon him but his name; that man hath much <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
to do to make his garments clean, to purifie his soul, to take off
all the stains of sin, that his spirit may be presented pure to the eyes
of God who beholds no impurity. It is not an easie thing to cure
a long contracted habit of sin: Let any intemperate person but
try in his own instance of drunkennesse; or the swearer in the
sweetning his unwholesome language: but then so to command
his tongue that he never swear, but that his speech be prudent,
pious and apt to edifie the hearer, or in some sense to glorifie
God; or to become temperate, to have got a habit of sobriety, or
chastity, or humility, is the work of a life: And if we do but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
that he that lives well from his younger yeers, or takes up
at the end of his youthfull heats, and enters into the courses
of a sober life early, diligently, and vigorously, shall finde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
after the studies and labours of 20. or 30. yeers piety, but a
very imperfect person: many degrees of pride left unrooted up,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53465:40"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> many inroads of intemperance, or beginnings of excesse, much
indevotion and backwardnesse in religion, many temptations to
contest against, and some infirmities which he shall never say he
hath master'd; we shall finde the work of a holy life is not to be
deferred till our dayes are almost done, till our strengths are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed,
our spirits are weak, and our lust strong, our habits con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
and our longings after sin many and impotent: for what
is very hard to be done, and is alwayes done imperfectly when
there is length of time, and a lesse work to do, and more abilities
to do it withall: when the time is short, and almost expired, and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the work made difficult and vast, and the strengths weaker, and
the faculties are disabled, will seem little lesse then absolutely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.
* I shall end this generall consideration with the question
of the Apostle. <hi>If the righteous scarcely be saved,</hi> (if it be so diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to overcome our sins, and obtain vertuous habits: difficult
(I say) to a righteous, a sober, and well living person) where shall
the ungodly and the sinner appear? What shall become of him
who by his evil life hath not onely removed himself from the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
but even from the possibilities of vertue? <hi>He that hath
lived in sin will die in sorrow.</hi>

            <p>BUt I shall pursue this, great and necessary truth, first; by
shewing what parts and ingredients of repentance are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed,
when it is described in holy Scripture. Secondly, by
shewing the necessities, the absolute necessities of a holy life, and
what it means in Scripture to <hi>[live holily].</hi> Thirdly, by consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what directions or intimations we have concerning the last
time of beginning to repent; and what is the longest period that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
any man may venture with safety: And in the prosecution of
these particulars, we shall remove the objections; those aprons of
fig-leaves which men use for their shelter to palliate their sin, and
to hide themselves, from that, from which no rocks or mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ains
shall protect them, though they fall upon them; that is, the
wrath of God.</p>
            <p>First, That repentance is not onely an abolition, and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the body of sin, a bringing it to the altar, and slaying it
before God and all the people; but that we must also <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
mingle gold and rich presents, the oblation of good works,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
and holy habits with the sacrifice, I have already proved: but
now if we will see repentance in its stature and integrity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
described, we shall finde it to be the one half of all that
which God requires of Christians. <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> are the
whole duty of a Christian. Faith is a sacrifice of the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to God: Repentance sacrifices the whole will: That, gives
the knowing; this, gives up all the desiring faculties: That, makes
us Disciples; this, makes us servants of the Holy Jesus. Nothing
else was preached by the Apostles, nothing was enjoyned as the
duty of man, nothing else did build up the body of Christian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
So that, as faith contains all that knowledge which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to salvation: So repentance comprehends in it, all the
whole practise and working duty of a returning Christian: And
this was the sum totall of all that Saint Paul preached to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
when in his farewell Sermon to the Bishops and Priests of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53465:41"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Ephesus, he professed that he kept back nothing that was profitable
to them; and yet it was all nothing but this; <hi>[Repentance towards
God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts. 20. 21.</note> 
               <hi>and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ]</hi> so that whosoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
in Jesus Christ, and repents towards God must make his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
according to this standard, that is, to believe all that Christ
taught him; and to do all that Christ commanded: and this is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked
in Saint Pauls<note n="*" place="margin">Hebr. 6. 1.</note> Catechisme where he gives a more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Catalogue of fundamentals: he reckons nothing but Sacraments
and faith; of which he enumerates two principal articles <hi>[resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the dead, and eternal judgement]</hi> whatsoever is practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> all the whole duty of man, the practise of all obedience is
called <hi>[repentance from dead works]</hi> which, if we observe the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity
of the phrase, does not mean <hi>[sorrow]</hi> For sorrow from
dead works, is not sense; but it must mean <hi>mutationem status,</hi> a
conversion from dead works, which (as in all motions) supposes two
terms; from dead works, to living works, from <hi>the death of sin to
the life of righteousnesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will adde but two places more, out of each Testament one;
in which I suppose you may see every lineament of this great duty
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> described, that you may no longer mistake a grashopper for an Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,
Sorrow and holy purposes, for the intire duty of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
In the 18. of Ezek. 21. you shall finde it thus described.
[<q>
                  <hi>But if the wicked will turne from all his sins that he hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right,
he shall surely live, he shall not die.</hi>
               </q>] or as it is more fully described in
Ezek. 33. 14 <hi>[When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; If</hi>
               <q>
                  <hi>he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right; if the
wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed; walk in the
statutes of life without committing iniquity, he shall surely live, he shall</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
                  <hi>not die.</hi>
               </q>] Here onely is the condition of pardon; to leave all your
sins, to keep all Gods statutes, to walk in them, to abide, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
and make progresse in them; and this, without the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
by a deadly sin, <hi>[without committing iniquity]</hi> to make
restitution of all the wrongs he hath done, all the unjust money
he hath taken, all the oppressions he hath committed, all that
must be satisfied for, and repayed according to our ability: we
must make satisfaction for all injury to our Neighbours fame, all
wrongs done to his soul; he must be restored to that condition of
good things thou didst in any sense remove him from: when this
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> is done according to thy utmost power, then thou hast repented
truely, then thou hast a title to the promise; <hi>thou shalt surely live,
thou shalt not die</hi> for thy old sins thou hast formerly committed.
* Onely be pleased to observe this one thing; that this place of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiel
is it which is so often mistaken for that common saying, <hi>At
what time soever a sinner repents him of his sins from the bottom of
his heart I will put all his wickednesse out of my remembrance, saith
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53465:42"/>
the Lord]</hi> For although <hi>at what time soever a sinner does repent</hi> (as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
is now explained) God will forgive him, and that, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
as it is now stated cannot be done <hi>[At what time soever]</hi> not
upon a mans deathbed; yet there are no such words in the whole
Bible, nor any neerer to the sense of them then the words I have
now read to you, out of the Prophet Ezekiel. Let that therefore no
more deceive you, or be made a colour to countenance a perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
sinner, or a deathbed penitent.</p>
            <p>Neither is the duty of <hi>Repentance</hi> to be bought at an easier rate in
the New Testament. You may see it described in the 2 Cor. 7. 11.
<hi>Godly sorrow worketh repentance.</hi> Well? but what is that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
repentance which is so wrought? This it is, <q>
                  <hi>Behold the self same
thing that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulnesse it wrought
in you, yea what clearing of your selves, yea what indignation,
yea what fear, ye what vehement desire, yea what zeal, yea
what revenge.</hi>
               </q> These are the fruits of that sorrow that is effectual:
these are the parts of repentance; <hi>clearing our selves</hi> of all that
is past, and great <hi>carefulnesse</hi> for the future, <hi>anger</hi> at our selves
for our old sins, and <hi>fear</hi> lest we commit the like again,
<hi>vehement desires</hi> of pleasing God, and <hi>zeal</hi> of holy actions, and <hi>a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge</hi>
upon our selves for our sins, called by Saint Paul in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

               <hi>a judging our selves lest we be judged of the Lord.</hi> And
in pursuance of this truth, the primitive Church did not admit

in such actions which did contradict that wicked incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
which led them into those sins whereof they were now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to repent. And therefore we find that they stood in the
station of penitents seven years, 13 years, and somtimes till their
death, before they could be reconciled to the peace of God, and his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

a sudden and unchosen piety; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
saith Hierocles. He that never repents
till a violent fear be upon him, till he apprehend himself to
be in the jawes of death, ready to give up his unready and unprepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53465:42"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> accounts, till he sees the Judge sitting in all the addresses of
dreadfulnesse and Majesty, just now (as he beleeves) ready to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
that fearfull and intolerable sentence of [Go ye cursed
into everlasting fire] this man does nothing for the love of God,
nothing for the love of vertue; It is just as a condemned man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
that he was a Traytor, but repented not till he was arrested,
and sure to die. Such a repentance as this may still consist with as
great an affection to sin as ever he had; and it is no thanks to him,
if when the knife is at his throat, then he gives good words and
flatters. But suppose this man in his health, and the middest of all
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> his lust, it is evident that there are some circumstances of action in
which the man would have refused to commit his most pleasing
sin. Would not the son of Tarquin have refused to ravish Lucrece
if Junius Brutus had been by him? Would the impurest person in
the world act his lust in the market place? or drink off an intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
goblet if a dagger were placed at his throat? In these cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
their fear would make them declare against the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
acting their impurities. But does this cure the intemperance
of their affections? Let the impure person retire to his closet, and
Junius Brutus be ingaged in a far distant war, and the dagger
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> be taken from the drunkards throat, and the fear of shame, or
death, or judgement be taken from them all, and they shall no
more resist their temptation, then they could before remove their
fear; and you may as well judge the other persons holy, and
haters of their sin, as the man upon his death-bed to be penitent;
and rather they then he, by how much this mans fear, the fear of
death, and of the infinite pains of hell, the fear of a provoked
God, and an angry eternall Judge, are far greater then the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of publike shame, or an abused husband, or the poniard
of an angry person.<note n="*" place="margin">Cogimur à suetis animum suspendere Atque Atque ut viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, vivere desinimus. <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

            </q>
            <p>I shall end this first Consideration, with a plain exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
that since repentance is a duty of so great and giant-like
bulk; let no man croud it up into so narrow room, as that it be
strangled in its birth for want of time and aire to breath in. Let <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
it not be put off to that time when a man hath scarce time enough
to reckon all those particular duties which make up the integrity
of its constitution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Will any man hunt the wild boare in his garden,
or bait a bull in his closet, will a woman wrap her childe in her
handkerchiefe, or a Father send his son to school when he is 50
yeers old? These are undecencies of providence, and the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
contradicts the end; And this is our case. There is no
roome for the repentance, no time to act all its essentiall parts; and
a childe who hath a great way to go before he be wise, may
defer his studies, and hope to become very learned in his old <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
age, and upon his deathbed, as well as a vitious person, may
think to recover from all his ignorances and prejudicate opinions,
from all his false principles and evil customs, from his wicked incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
and ungodly habits, from his fondnesses of vice, and dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations
of vertue, from his promptnesse to sin, and unwillingnesse
to grace, from his spiritual deadnesse and strong sensuality; upon
his deathbed (I say) when he hath no naturall strength, and as little
spirituall, when he is criminal and impotent, hardned in his vice,
and soft in his fears, full of passion, and empty of wisdom, when
he is sick and amazed, and timorous and confounded, and impatient,
and extremely miserable.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
            </p>
            <p>And now when any of you is tempted to commit a sin, remember,
that sin will ruine you unlesse you repent of it. * But this (you
say) is no news, and so far from affrighting you from sin, that God
knows) it makes men sin the rather. For therefore they venture to
act the present temptation, because they know, if they repent, God
will forgive them; and therefore they resolve upon both, to sin
now, and to repent hereafter.</p>
            <p>Against this folly I shall not oppose the consideration of their
danger, and that they neither know how long they shall live, nor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
whether they shall die or no in this very act of sinne; though
this consideration is very materiall, and if they should die in it, or
before it is washed off, they perish; But I consider these things. 1 That
he that resolves to sin upon a resolution to repent, by every act of sin,
makes himself more uncapable of repenting, by growing more in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53465:43"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> love with sin, by remembring its pleasures, by serving it once more,
and losing one degree more of the liberty of our spirit: and if you
resolve to sin now, because it is pleasant, how do ye know that
your appetite will alter? will it not appear pleasant to you next
week, and the next week after that, and so for ever? And still
you sin, and still you will repent; that is, you will repent when the
sin can please you no longer. For so long as it can please you, so long
you are tempted not to repent, as well as now to act the sin. And
the longer you lie in it, the more you will love it. So that it is in
effect to say; I love my sin now, but I will hereafter hate it; onely
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> I will act it a while longer, and grow more in love with it, and then
I will repent, that is, then I will be sure to hate it, when I shal most
love it. 2. To repent signifies to be sorrowful, to be ashamed,
and to wish it had never been done. And then see the folly of this
temptation. I would not sin, but that I hope to repent of it, that is,
I would not do this thing but that I hope to be sorrowful for doing
it, and I hope to come to shame for it, heartily to be ashamed of my
doings, and I hope to be in that condition, that I would give all the
world I had never done it; that is, I hope to feel and apprehend an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
infinitely greater then the pleasures of my sin; &amp; are these argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> fit to move a man to sin? what can affright a man from it, if
these invite him to it? it is as if a man should invite one to be a partner
of his treason by telling him, if you will joyn with me, you shal have
all these effects by it; you shall be hang'd, drawn and quarter'd, and
your blood shall be corrupted, and your estate forfeited, and you
shall have many other reasons to wish you had never done it: He
that should use this Rhetorick in earnest, might well be accounted a
mad man: This is to scare a man, not to allure him, and so is
the other when we understand it truely. 3. For I consider, He that
repents, wishes he had never done that sin. Now I ask, does he
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> wish so upon reason, or without reason? Surely, if he may when
he hath satisfied his lust, ask God pardon, and be admitted upon
as easie termes for the time to come as if he had not done the sin, he
hath no reason to be sorrowful, or wish he had not done it. For
though he hath done it, and pleased himself by enjoying the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of sin for that season, yet all is well again; and let him onely be
carefull now, and there is no hurt done, his pardon is certain. How
can any man that understands the reason of his actions and passions
wish, that he had never done that sin in which then he had pleasure,
and now he feels no worse inconvenience. But he that truely repents,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> wishes, and would give all the world he had never done it. Surely
then his present condition in respect of his past sin hath some very
great evil in it, why else should he be so much troubled? True, and
this it is. He that hath committed sins after baptisme, is fallen out
of the favour of God, is tied to hard duty for the time to come, to
cry vehemently unto God, to call night and day for pardon, to be in
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53465:44"/>
great fear and tremblings of heart, lest God should never forgive <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
him, lest God will never take off his sentence of eternal paines,
and in this fear and in some degrees of it he will remain all the
dayes of his life, and if he hopes to be quit of that, yet he knowes
not how many degrees of Gods anger still hang over his head; how
many sad miseries shall afflict, and burne, and purifie him in this
world with a sharpnesse so poinant as to divide the marrow from
the bones; and for these reasons, a considering man that knows
what it is to repent, wishes with his soul, he had never sinned; and
therefore grieves in proportion to his former crimes, and present
misery and future danger.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
            </p>
            <p>And now, suppose that you can repent when you will, that is,
that you can grieve when you will, (though no man can do it, no
man can grieve when he please) though he could shed tears when he
list, he cannot grieve without a real, or an apprehended infelicity,
but, suppose it, and that he can fear when he please, and that he
can love when he please, or what he please; that is, suppose a
man to be able to say to his palate, though I love sweet meats, yet
to morrow I will hate and loath them, and believe them bitter and
distastful things; suppose (I say) all these impssibilities, yet since,
repentance does suppose a man to be in a state of such real misery <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
that he hath reason to curse the day in which he sinned, is this a
fit argument to invite a man, that is in his wits, to sin? to sin in
hope of repentance? as if dangers of falling into hell, and fear of
the Divine anger, and many degrees of the Divine judgements, and
a lasting sorrow, and a perpetual labour, and a never ceasing tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and a troubled conscience and a sorrowful spirit were fit things
to be desired or hoped for.</p>
            <p>The sum is this. He that commits sins shall perish eternally
if he never does repent. And if he does repent and yet untimely,
he is not the better; and if he does not repent with an intire, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
and complete repentance, he is not the better: But if he does,
yet repentance is a duty full of fears and sorrow, and labour; a vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
to the spirit, an afflictive, paenal, or punitive duty, a duty
which suffers for sin, and labours for grace, which abides and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
little images of hell in the way to heaven; and though it be the
onely way to felicity, yet it is beset with thorns and daggers of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance,
and with rocks and mountains of duty. Let no man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
dare to sin upon hopes of repentance: for he is a foole and a
hypocrite, that now chooses and approves, what he knows here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
he must condemn.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
            </p>
            <p>2. The second generall consideration is, The necessity, the
absolute necessity of holy living, <q>God hath made a Covenant
with us,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 1.</note> that we must give up our selves, bodies and souls, not a
dying, but <hi>a living,</hi> and healthfull <hi>sacrifice.</hi>
               </q> He hath forgiven all
our old sins, and we have bargained to quit them, from the time
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53465:44"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that we first come to Christ, and give our names to him; and to
keep all his Commandements. We have taken the Sacramentall
oath, like that of the old Romane Militia, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
we must beleeve, and obey,
and do all that is commanded us, and keep our station, and fight
against the flesh, the world, and the devil, not to throw away our
mili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ary girdle, and we are to do what is bidden us, or to die for
it, even all that is bidden us, according to our power. For, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
not, that Gods Commandements are impossible. It is disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
to think God enjoyns us to do more then he enables us to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> do; and it is a contradiction to say, we cannot do all that we can:
and <hi>[through Christ which strengthens me, I can do all things, saith
S. Paul,]</hi> however, we can do to the utmost of our strength, and
beyond that we cannot take thought; impossibilities enter not into
deliberation, but according to our abilities, and naturall powers,
assisted by Gods grace, so God hath covenanted with us to live a
holy life. <hi>[For in Christ Jesus nothing avayleth but a new creature,
nothing but faith working by charity, nothing but keeping the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God.]</hi> They are all the words of S. Paul before
quoted; to which he addes. <hi>[and as many as walk according to this</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

Israel of God]</hi> upon those peace and mercy shall abide; if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a new creature, wholly transformed in the image of their
minde; if they have faith, and this faith be an operative working
faith, a faith that produces a holy life, a <hi>faith that works by charity;</hi>
if they <hi>keep the Commandements of God,</hi> then they are within the
Covenant of mercy, but not else; for, <hi>in Christ Jesus nothing else
avayleth.</hi> * To the same purpose are those words <hi>Hebr. 12. 14.
Follow peace with all men, and holinesse, without which no man shall
see the Lord.] Peace with all men]</hi> implies both justice and charity,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> without which it is impossible to preserve peace: <hi>Holinesse]</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
all our duty towards God. universall diligence; and this must
be <hi>followed,</hi> that is, pursued with diligence, in a lasting course of
life and exercise, and without this, we shall never see the face of
God. I need urge no more authorities to this purpose; these two
are as certain and convincing as two thousand, and since thus much
is actually required, and is the condition of the Covenant; it is
certain that sorrow for not having done what is commanded to be
done; and a purpose to do what is necessary to be actually perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
will not acquit us before the righteous judgement of God.

To what purpose are all those Commandements in Scripture, of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
every page almost in it, [of <hi>living holily,</hi> and according to the

of <hi>being holy as God is holy,</hi> of <hi>being humble and meek, as Christ is
humble,</hi> of <hi>putting on the Lord Jesus,</hi> of <hi>living a spirituall life,]</hi>
but that it is the purpose of God, and the intention and designe of
Christ dying for us, and the Covenant made with man, that we
should expect heaven upon no other termes in the world, but of a
holy life, in the faith and obedience of the Lord Jesus.</p>
            <p>Now if a vitious person, when he comes to the latter end of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
dayes, one that hath lived a wicked, ungodly life, can for any
thing he can do upon his death-bed, be said to live a holy life; then
his hopes are not desperate; but he that hopes upon this onely, for
which God hath made him no promise, I must say of him as Galen

               </gap>, the

hopes is an approach to the grave, and a sad eternity.</p>

out of the stones, and he can make ten thousand worlds if he
sees good, and he can do what he list, and he can save an ill living
man though he never repent at all, so much as upon his death-bed.
All this he can do; but Gods power is no ingredient into this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
we are never the better that God can do it, unlesse he also
will; and whether he will, or no, we are to learn from himself, and
what he hath declared to be his will in holy Scripture. Nay since
God hath said, that without actuall holinesse no man shall see God,
God by his own will hath restrained his power, and though abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
he can do all things, yet he cannot do against his own word.
* And indeed the rewards of heaven are so great and glorious, and
Christ <hi>burden is so light, his yoke is so easie,</hi> that it is a shamelesse
impudence to expect so great glories at a lesse rate then so little a
service, at a lower rate then a holy life. It cost the Eternall Son <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
of God his life blood to obtain heaven for us upon that condition,
and who then shall die again for us, to get heaven for us upon easier
conditions. What would you do if God should command you to
kill your eldest son? or to work in the mines for a thousand yeers
together? or to fast all thy life time with bread and water? were
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53465:45"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> not heaven a great bargain even after all this? and when God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
nothing of us but to live soberly, justly, and godly, (which
very things of themselves, to man are a very great felicity, and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to his present well-being) shall we think this to be a load, and an
unsufferable burden? and that heaven is so little a purchase at that
price, that God in meer justice will take a death-bed sigh or
groan, and a few unprofitable tears and promises in exchange for
all our duty? Strange it should be so: but stranger that any man
should rely upon such a vanity, when from Gods word he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to warrant such a confidence. But these men do like the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Dionysius, who stole from Apollo his golden cloak, and gave
him a cloak of Arcadian home-spun, saying that this was lighter
in summer, and warmer in winter. These men sacrilegiously rob
God of the service of all their golden dayes, and serve him in their
hoary head, in their furs and grave clothes; and pretend that this
late service is more agreeable to the Divine mercy on one side, and
humane infirmity on the other, and so dispute themselves into an
irrecoverable condition, having no other ground to rely upon a
death-bed, or late-begun-repentance, but because they resolve to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> enjoy the pleasures of sin, and for heaven, they will put that to the
venture of an after-game. These men <hi>sow in the flesh,</hi> and would
<hi>reap in the spirit,</hi> live to the Devil, and die to God, and therefore
it is but just in God that their hopes should be desperate, and their
craft be folly, and their condition be, the unexpected, unfeared in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
of an eternall sorrow.</p>
            <p>Lastly. Our last inquiry is into the time, the last or latest time <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
of beginning our repentance. Must a man repent a yeer, or two,
or seven yeers, or ten, or twenty before his death? or what is the
last period after which all repentance will be untimely and ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall?
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> To this captious question I have many things to oppose.
1. We have entred into covenant with God, to serve him from the
day of our Baptisme to the day of our death.<note place="margin">Luke 1. 74.</note> He hath <q>
                  <hi>[sworn
this oath to us, that he would grant unto us, that we being delivered
from fear of our enemies, might serve him without fear in holinesse and
righteousnesse before him [all the dayes of our life</hi>
               </q>]. Now although
God will not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> forget our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
but passe by the weaknesses of an honest a watchfull, &amp; industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
person; yet the Covenant he makes with us is from the day of
our first voluntary profession, to our grave: and according as we
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> by sins retire from our first undertaking; so our condition is inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure:
there is no other Covenant made with us, no new beginnings
of another period; but if we be returned, and sin be cancelled,
and grace be actually obtained; then we are in the first condition
of pardon; but because it is uncertain when a man can have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterd
his vices, and obtain'd the graces, therefore no man can tell
any set time when he must begin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:53465:46"/>
2. Scripture describing the duty of repenting sinners, names no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
other time but <hi>[today. To day if ye will hear his voyce harden not
your hearts.</hi> 3. The duty of a Christian is described in Scripture,
to be such as requires length of time, and a continued industry.
<hi>[Let us run with patience the race that is set before us.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hebr. 12. 1. Ver. 3.</note>] and <hi>[Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself,
lest ye be wearied, and faint in your mindes.]</hi> So great a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is not for the agony and contention of an hour, or a day, or a
week, but for the whole life of a Christian, or for great parts of
its abode. 4. There is a certain period and time set for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and beyond that all our industry is ineffectuall. There is <hi>a</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
               <hi>day of visitation, our own day,</hi> and there is a day of visitation, that
is <hi>Gods day.</hi> This appeared in the case of Jerusalem. <hi>[O Jerusalem,
Jerusalem, if thou hadst known the time of thy visitation, at least in this
thy day.]</hi> Well! they neglected it, and then there was a time of
Gods visitation which was <hi>his day;</hi> called in Scripture, <hi>[the day of
the Lord]</hi> and because they had neglected their own day, they fell
into inevitable ruine: No repentance could have prevented their
finall ruine. And this which was true in a Nation, is also clearly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
true in the case of single persons. [<q>
                  <hi>Look diligently lest any
fail of the grace of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>lest there be any person among you as Esau,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
                  <hi>who sold his birth-right, and afterwards when he would have inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
though he sought it carefully with tears.</hi>
               </q>] Esau had time
enough to repent his bargain as long as he lived; he wept sorely
for his folly, and carefulnesse sate heavy upon his soul, and yet
he was not heard, nor his repentance accepted; for the time was
past: And <hi>[take heed]</hi> saith the Apostle, lest it come to passe
to any of you to be in the same case. Now if ever there be a time
in which repentance is too late, it must be the time of our death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
and the last time of our life: And after a man is fallen into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
the displeasure of Almighty God, the longer he lies in his sin
without repentance and emendation, the greater is his danger, and
the more of his allowed time is spent, and no man can antecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or before-hand, be sure that the time of his repentance is not
past; and those who neglect the call of God, and refuse to hear
him call in the day of grace, <hi>God will laugh at them when their cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
comes; they shall call, and the Lord shall not hear them.</hi> * And
this was the case of the five foolish virgins when the arrest of
death surprized them: they discovered their want of oil, they
were troubled at it, they beg'd oil, they were refused, they did <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
something towards the procuring of the oil of grace, (for they
went out to buy oil) and after all this stir the bridegroom came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they had finished their journey, and they were shut out from
the communion of the bridegrooms joyes.</p>
            <p>Therefore concerning the time of beginning to repent, no man
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53465:46"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> is certain but he that hath done his work. <hi>Mortem venientem nemo
hilaris excipit nisi qui se ad eam diù composuerat,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epist. 30.</note> said Seneca. He
onely dies cheerfully who stood waiting for death in a ready dresse
of a long preceding preparation. He that repents to day, repents
late enough that he did not begin yesterday: But he that puts it off
till to morrow is vain and miserable.</p>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Well! but what will you have a man do that hath lived wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly,
and is now cast upon his death-bed? shall this man despair,
and neglect all the actions of piety, and the instruments of restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in his sicknesse? No. God forbid. Let him do what he can
then; It is certain it will be little enough: for all those short
gleames of piety, and flashes of lightning will help towards the
alleviating some degrees of misery; and if the man recovers, they
are good beginnings of a renewed piety: and Ahabs tears and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation,
though it went no further, had a proportion of a reward,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> though nothing to the portions of eternity. So that he that sayes,
it is every day necessary to repent, cannot be supposed to discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
the piety of any day: a death-bed piety, when things are
come to that sad condition may have many good purposes: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
even then neglect nothing that can be done. Well! But shall
such persons despair of salvation? To them I shall onely return
this. That they are to consider the conditions which on one side
God requires of us, and on the other side, whether they have done
accordingly? Let them consider upon what termes God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
salvation, and whether they have made themselves capable
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> by performing their part of the obligation. If they have not, I must
tell them, that, not to hope where God hath made no promise,
is not the <hi>sin</hi> of despair, but the <hi>misery</hi> of despair. A man hath
no ground to hope that ever he shall be made an Angel, and yet,
that not hoping, is not to be called, <hi>despair:</hi> and no man can hope
for heaven without repentance; And for such a man to despair, is
not the sin, but the misery. If such persons have a promise of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
let them shew it, and hope it, and enjoy it; if they have no
promise, they must thank themselves, for bringing themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a condition without the Covenant, without a promise, hopelesse
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and miserable.</p>
            <p>But will not trusting in the merits of Jesus Christ save such a
man? For that we must be tried by the word of God: In which
there is no contract at all made with a dying person that hath lived
in Name a Christian, in practise a Heathen: and we shall dishonour
the sufferings and redemption of our blessed Saviour, if we make
them to be a Umbrello to shelter our impious and ungodly living.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53465:47"/>
But that no such person may after a wicked life repose himself in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
his deathbed upon Christs merits, observe but these two places of
scripture <hi>[Our Saviour Jesus Christ who gave himself for us]</hi> what
to do?<note place="margin">Titus. 2. 14.</note> that we might lives as we list? and hope to be saved by his
merits? No But <q>
                  <hi>[that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and
purifie to himself a peculiar people zealous of good works.</hi> These
things speak and exhort,]</q> saith Saint Paul. But more plainly yet,
in S. Peter <hi>[Christ bare our sins in his own body on the tree.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2 24.</note>] To what
end? <hi>[that we being dead unto sin should live unto righteousnesse.]</hi>
since therefore our living a holy life is the end of Christs dying
that sad and holy death for us, he that trusts on it to evil purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
and to excuse his vicious life, does (as much as lies in him) make
void the very purpose and designe of Christs passion, and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
the blood of the everlasting covenant: which covenant was
confirmed by the blood of Christ: but as it brought peace from God,
so it requires a holy life from us.</p>
            <p>But why may not we be saved as well as the thief upon the
crosse?<note place="margin">See life of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus. Disc. of Repentance. part. 2.</note> even because our case is nothing alike. When Christ dies
once more for us, we may look for such another instance; not till
then. But this thiefe did but then come to Christ; he knew him not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
and his case was as if a Turk or heathen should be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
to Christianity, and be baptized, and enter newly into the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
upon his deathbed. Then God pardons all his sins; and
so God does to Christians when they are baptized, or first give up
their names to Christ by a voluntarie confirmation of their bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismal
vow: but when they have once entred into the Covenant,
they must performe what they promise, and to what they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged.
The thief had made no contract with God in Jesus Christ,
and therefore failed of none; onely the defaillances of the state of
ignorance Christ paid for at the thiefes admission. But we that have
made a covenant with God in baptisme, and failed of it all our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
dayes, and then returne at night, when we cannot work; have
nothing to plead for our selves, because we have made all that to
be uselesse to us which God with so much mercy and miraculous
wisdom, gave us to secure our interest, and hopes of heaven.</p>
            <p>And therfore let no Christian man who hath covenanted with
God to give him the service of his life, think that God will be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
with the sighs and prayers of a dying man; for all that
great obligation which lies upon us cannot be transacted in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
when we have loaded our souls with sin, and made them em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty
of vertue; we cannot so soon grow up to <hi>a perfect man in Christ</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

fortunes may change, or they may be charitable in their gifts and
burthensom in their offices; able to feed you, but unable to counsel
you; or your need may be longer then their kindnesses, or such
in which they can give you no assistance; and indeed generally it is
so in all the instances of men: we have a friend that is wise; but I
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eed not his counsel, but his meat; or my patron is bountiful in
his largesses, but I am troubled with a sad spirit; and money
and presents do me no more ease, then perfumes do to a broken <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
arme: we seek life of a Physician that dies, and go to him for health,
who cannot cure his own breath, or gowt; and so become vain
in our imaginations, abused in our hopes, restlesse in our passions,
impatient in our calamity, unsupported in our need, exposed to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
wandring and wilde, without counsel and without reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
At last after the infatuating and deceiving all our confidences
without, we have nothing left us, but to return home, and dwell
within our selves: for we have a sufficient stock of self-love, that
we may be confident of our own affections, we may trust our selves
surely; for what we want in skill, we shall make up in diligence,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
and our industry shall supply the want of other circumstances:
and no man vnderstands my own case so well as I do my self, and
no man will judge so faithfully as I shall do for my self; for I am
most concern'd not to abuse my self; and if I do, I shall be the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser,
and therefore may best rely upon my self Alas! and God help us!
we shall finde it to be no such matter: For we neither love our
selves well, nor understand our own case, we are partial in our
own questions, deceived in our sentences, carelesse of our interests,
and the most false, persidious creatures to our selves in the whole <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
world: even the <hi>Heart of a man</hi> a mans own heart <hi>is deceitful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all things, and desperately wicked, who can know it?</hi> And who
can choose but know it?</p>
            <p>And there is no greater argument of the deceitfulnesse of our
Hearts, then this, that no man can know it all; it cosens us in
the very number of its cosenage: But yet we can reduce it all to
two heads. We say concerning a false man, trust him not for he
will deceive you, and we say concerning a weak and broken staffe,
lean not upon it, for that will also deceive you. The man deceives
because he is false, and the staffe because it is weak, and the heart <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
because it is both. So that it is deceitful above all things, that is, fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and disabled to support us in many things; but in other things
where it can, it is false and desperately wicked. The first sort of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulnesse
is its calamitie, and the second is its iniquity, and that is
the worst Calamitie of the two.</p>
            <p>1. The heart is deceitfull in its strength; and when we have the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53465:49"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> groweth of a Man, we have the weaknesses of a childe: nay more
yet, and it is a sad consideration, the more we are in age, the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in our courage. It appears in the heats and forwardnesses of
new converts, which are like to the great emissions of Lightning,
or like huge fires, which flame and burn without measure, even
all that they can; till from flames they descend to still fires, from
thence to smoak, from smoak to embers, from thence to ashes;
cold and pale, like ghosts, or the phantastick images of Death.
And the primitive Church were zealous in their Religion up to the
degree of Cherubins, and would run as greedily to the sword of the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> hangman, to die for the cause of God, as we do now to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
joy and entertainment of a Christian spirit, even to the receiving
of the holy Sacrament. A man would think it reasonable that the
first infancy of Christianity should, according to the nature of first
beginnings, have been remisse, gentle, and unactive, and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as the object or evidence of faith grew, which in every Age
hath a great degree of Argument superadded to its confirmation;
so should the habit also and the grace, the longer it lasts &amp; the more
obiections it runs through, it still should shew a brighter and more
certain light to discover the divinity of its principle; and that after
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the more examples, and new accidents and strangenesses of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and daily experience, and the multitude of miracles, still the
Christian should grow more certain in his faith, more refreshed in
his hope, and warm in his charity; the very nature of these graces
increasing and swelling upon the very nourishment of experience,
and the multiplication of their own acts. And yet because the heart
of man is false, it suffers the fires of the Altar to go out, and the
flames lessen by the multitude of fuel. But indeed it is because we
put on strange fire, &amp; put out the fire upon our hearths by letting in
a glaring Sun beam, the fire of lust; or the heates of an angry spirit, to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> quench the fires of God, and suppresse the sweet cloud of incense.
The heart of man hath not strength enough to think one good
thought of it self, it cannot command its own attention to a prayer
often lines long: but before its end it shall wander after some
thing, that is to no purpose: and no wonder then that it grows wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of a holy religion, which consists of so many parts as make the
businesse of a whole life. And there is no greater argument in the
world of our spiritual weaknesse and falsnesse of our hearts in the
matters of religion, then the backwardnesse which most men have
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> alwayes, and all men have somtimes to say their prayers: so weary
of their length, so glad when they are done, so wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e to excuse
and frustrate an opportunity; and yet there is no manner of trouble
in the duty, no wearinesse of bones, no violent labours; nothing
but begging a blessing, and receiving it; nothing but doing our selves
the greatest honour of speaking to the greatest person, and greatest
king of the world; and that we should be unwilling to do this, so
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53465:50"/>
unable to continue in it, so backward to return to it; so without <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
gust and relish in the doing it, can have no visible reason in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the thing, but something within us, a strange sicknesse in the
heart, a spiritual nauseating or loathing of Manna, something that
hath no name; but we are sure it comes from a weake, a faint, and
false heart.</p>
            <p>And yet this weak heart is strong in passions, violent in desires,
unresistable in its appetites, impatient in its lust, furious in anger;
here are strengths enough, one would think: But so have I seen a
man in a feaver, sick and distempered, unable to walk, lesse able to
speak sence, or to do an act of counsel; and yet when his feaver <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
hath boild up to a delirium, he was strong enough to beat his nurse
keeper and his doctor too; and to resist the loving violence of all
his friends, who would faine binde him down to reason and his
bed: And yet we still say he is weak and sick to death. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
for these strengths of madnesse
are not health,<note place="margin">Arrian.</note> but furiousnesse and disease; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
It is weaknesse another way; And so are the strengths of
a mans heart; they are fetters and manacles; strong, but they are
the cordage of imprisonment, so strong, that the heart is not able
to stir. And yet it cannot but be a huge sadnesse, that the heart <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
shall pursue a temporal interest with wit and diligence, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied
industry, and shall not have strength enough in a matter
that concerns its Eternal interest to answer one obiection, to resist
one assault, to defeate one art of the divel; but shall certainly and
infallibly fall when ever it is tempted to a pleasure.</p>
            <p>This, if it be examined, will prove to be a deceit indeed, a
pretence, rather then true upon a just cause, that is, it is not a
natural, but a moral &amp; a vicious weaknesse; and we may try it in one
or two familiar instances. One of the great strengths, shall I call it? or
weaknesses of the heart is, that it is strong, violent and passionate in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
its lusts, and weak and deceitful to resist any. Tell the tempted
person, that if he act his lust, he dishonours his body, makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a servant to follie, and one flesh with a harlot, he defiles the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God, and him that defiles a Temple will God destroy: Tell
him that the Angels who love to be present in the nastinesse and
filth of prisons, that they may comfort and assist chast souls, and
holy persons there abiding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet they are impatient to behold or
come neer the filthynesse of a lustful person: Tell him, that this
sin is so ugly, that the divels, who are spirits, yet they delight to
counterfeit the acting of this crime, and descend unto the daughters <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
or sons of men, that they may rather lose their natures, then
not help to set a lust forward: Tell them these and ten thousand
things more; you move them no more, then if you should read
one of Tullies orations to a mule; for the truth is, they have no
power to resist it, much lesse to master it, their heart fails them
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53465:50"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> when they meet their Mistresse; and they are driven like a fool to
the stocks, or a Bull to the slaughter-house: And yet their heart de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
them; not because it cannot resist the temptation, but because
it will not go about it: For it is certain, the heart can, if it list: For
let a Boy enter into your chamber of pleasure, and discover you
folly, either your lust disbands, or your shame hides it; you will
not, you dare not do it before a stranger Boy; and yet that you dare
do it before the eyes of the All-seeing God, is impudence and folly,
and a great conviction of the vanity of your pretence, and the false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of your heart. If thou beest a man given to thy appetite, and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> thou lovest a pleasant morsell as thy life, do not declame against
the precepts of Temperance, as impossible: Try this once; abstain
from that draught, or that dish. I cannot. No? Give this man a
great blow on the face, or tempt him with twenty pound, and he
shall fast from morning till night, and then feast himself with your
money, and plain wholesome meat. And if <hi>Chastity</hi> and <hi>Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>
be so easie, that a man may be brought to either of them with
so ready and easie instruments; Let us not suffer our hearts to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
us by the weaknesse of its pretences, and the strength of its
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> desires: For we do more for a Boy, then for God; and for 20. pound,
then Heaven it self.</p>
            <p>But thus it is in every thing else; take an Hereticke, a Rebel, a
person that hath an ill cause to mannage; what he wants in the
strength of his reason, he shall make it up with diligence; and a
person that hath Right on his side is cold, indiligent, lazie, and
unactive, trusting that the goodnesse of his Cause will do it alone;
But so, wrong prevails, while evil persons are zealous in a Bad
matter, and others are remisse in a Good; And the same person
shall be very industrious alwayes when he hath least reason so to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> be. Thats the first particular. The heart is deceitfull in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
of its naturall strengths; it is Naturally and Physically
strong, but Morally weak, and impotent.</p>
            <p>2. The Heart of man is deceitfull in making judgement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
its own Acts. It does not know when it is pleased or
displeased, it is peevish and trifling, it would and it would not,
and it is in many Cases impossible to know whether a mans heart
desires such a thing or not. Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> hath an odde saying,
<hi>Facilius inveneris innocentem, quam qui poenitentiam <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>gne egerit.</hi>
It is easier to finde a man that hath lived innocently, then one that
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> hath truly repented him, with a grief and care great according to
the merit of his sins. Now suppose a man that hath spent his
younger yeers in vanity and folly, and is by the grace of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive
of it, and thinks of returning to sober counsels, this man
will finde his heart so false, so subtil and fugitive, so secret and
undiscernable, that it will be very hard to discerne, whether he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,
or no. For if he considers that he hates sin, and therefore
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:53465:51"/>
repents; Alas! he so hates it, that he dares not, if he be wise,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
tempt himself with an opportunity to act it: for in the midst of
that which he calls hatred, he hath so much love left for it, that
if the sin comes again and speaks him fair, he is lost again, he kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
the fire, and dies in its embraces. And why else should it be
necessary for us to pray, that <hi>we be not lead into temptation?</hi> but
because we hate the sin, and yet love it too well; we curse it, and
yet follow it; we are angry at our selves, and yet cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it; we know it undoes us, but we think it pleasant; And when
we are to execute the fierce anger of the Lord upon our sins, yet
we are kinde-hearted, and spare the <hi>Agag,</hi> the reigning sin, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
splendid temptation, we have some kindnesses left towards it.</p>
            <p>These are but ill signes How then shall I know by some infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
token, that I am a true Penitent? What and if I weep for
my sins? will you not then give me leave to conclude my heart
right with God, and at enmity with sin? It may be so. But there
are some friends that weep at parting; and is not thy weeping a sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
of affection? It is a sad thing to part with our long companion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Or it may be thou weepest, because thou wouldest have a signe to
cozen thy self withall; for some men are more desirous to have a
signe, then the thing signified; they would do something to shew <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
their Repentance, that themselves may beleeve themselves to be
Penitents, having no reason from within to beleeve so. And I have
seen some persons weep heartily for the losse of six pence, or for
the breaking of a glasse, or at some trifling accident; and they
that do so cannot pretend to have their tears valued at a bigger rate
then they will confesse their passion to be when they weep, and
are vexed for the durting of their linnen, or some such trifle, for
which the least passion is too big an expence. So that a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell his own heart by his tears, or the truth of his repentance
by those short gusts of sorrow. How then? Shall we suppose a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
man to pray against his sin? So did Saint Austin, when in his youth
he was tempted to lust and uncleannesse, he prayed against it, and
secretly desired that God would not hear him: for here the heart
is cunning to deceive it self. For no man did ever heartily pray
against his sin in the midst of a temptation to it, if he did in any
sence or degree listen to the temptation: For to pray against a sin,
is to have desires contrary to it, and that cannot consist with any
love, or any kindnesse to it. We pray against it, and yet do it, and
then pray again, and do it again; and we desire it, and yet pray
against the desires, and thats almost a contradiction: Now because <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
no man can be supposed to will against his own will, or choose
against his own desires; it is plain that we cannot know whether
we mean what we say, when we pray against sin, but by the event;
If we never act it, never entertain it, alwayes resist it, ever fight
against it; and finally do prevail; then at length we may judge our
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53465:51"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> own heart to have meant honestly in that one particular.</p>
            <p>Nay our heart is so deceitfull in this matter of Repentance,
that the Masters of spirituall life are fain to invent suppletory
Arts and stratagems to secure the duty. And we are advised to
mourn, because we do not mourn, to be sorrowfull because we
are not sorrowfull. Now if we be sorrowfull in the first stage,
how happens it that we know it not? Is our heart so secret to
our selves? But if we be not sorrowfull in the first period, how
shall we be so, or know it in the second period? For we may as
well doubt concerning the sincerity of the second or reflex act of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> sorrow, as of the first and direct action. And therefore we may
also as well be sorrowfull the third time, for want of the just
measure, or hearty meaning of the second sorrow, as be sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
the second time for want of true sorrow at the first; and so on
to infinite. And we shall never be secure in this Artifice, if we be
not certain of our naturall and hearty passion in our direct and first
apprehensions.</p>
            <p>Thus many persons think themselves in a good estate, and make
no question of their salvation, being confident onely because they
are confident; and they are so, because they are bidden to be so;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and yet they are not confident at all, but extreamly timerous and
fearfull. How many persons are there in the world, that say they
are sure of their salvation, and yet they dare not die? And if any
man pretends, that he is now sure he shall be saved, and that he
cannot fall away from grace; there is no better way to confute
him, then by advising him to send for the Surgeon, and bleed to
death. For what should hinder him? not the sin: for it cannot
take him from Gods favour: not the change of his condition: for
he sayes he is sure to go to a Better: why does he not then say
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, like the Romane gallants when they decreed to die. The
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> reason is plainly this. They say they are confident, and yet are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
timerous; they professe to beleeve that Doctrine, and yet
dare not trust it: nay they think they beleeve, but they do not; so
false is a mans heart; so deceived in its own Acts, so great a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to its own sentence and opinions.</p>
            <p>3. The heart is deceitfull in its own resolutions and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:
for many times men make their resolutions onely in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
not in their wills; they resolve it sitting to be done,
not decree that they will do it; And instead of beginning to be
reconciled to God, by the renewed and hearty purposes of holy
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> living, they are advanced so far onely, as to be convinced, and apt
to be condemned by their own sentence.</p>
            <p>But suppose our resolutions advanced further, and that our
Will and Choices also are determined; see how our hearts deceive
us. 1. We resolve against those sins that please us not, or where
temptation is not present, and think by an over-acted zeal against
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53465:52"/>
some sins to get an indulgence for some others. There are some <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
persons who will be Drunk; The Company, or the discourse, or
the pleasure of madnesse, or an easie nature, and a thirsty soul;
something is amisse, that cannot be helped; But they will make
amends, and the next day pray twice as much. Or it may be they
must satisfie a beastly lust; but they will not be drunk for all the
world; and hope by their Temperance to Commute for their
want of Chastity: But they attend not the craft of their secret
enemy, <hi>their Heart:</hi> for it is not love of the vertue; if it were,
they would love Vertue in all its Instances; for Chastity is as much
a vertue as Temperance, and God hates Lust as much as he hates <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
Drunkennesse.<note n="*" place="margin">Virtutem unam si amise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris etsi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note> But this sin is against my health, or it may be it
is against my lust, it makes me impotent, and yet impatient, full of
desire, and empty of strength. Or else I do an act of Prayer, lest
my conscience become unquiet, while it is not satisfied or cozened
with some intervals of Religion: I shall think my self a damned
wretch, if I do nothing for my soul; but if I do, I shall call the one
sin that remains nothing but my Infirmity; and therefore it is my
excuse: and my Prayer is not my Religion, but my Peace, and my
Pretence, and my Fallacy.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
            </p>
            <p>2. We resolve against our sin, that is, we will not act it in
those circumstances as formerly: I will not be drunk in the streets;
but I may sleep till I be recovered, and then come forth sober;
or if I be overtaken, it shall be in Civill and Gentile company;
Or it may be not so much; I will leave my intemperance and my
Lust too, but I will remember it with pleasure, I will revolve the
past action in my mind, and entertain my fancy with a moros
delectation in it, and by a fiction of imagination will represent it
present, and so be satisfied with a little esseminacy, or phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick
pleasure, Beloved, suffer not your hearts so to cozen you,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
as if any man can be faithfull in much, that is faithlesse in a little.
He certainly is very much in love with sin, and parts with it very
unwillingly, that keeps its Picture, and wears its Favour, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
in the fancy of it, even with the same desire, as a most pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate
widow parts with her dearest husband, even when she can
no longer enjoy him: But certainly her staring all day upon his
picture, and weeping over his Robe, and wringing her hands over
his children, are no great signes that she hated him: And just so
do most men hate, and accordingly part with their sins.</p>
            <p>3. We resolve against it when the opportunity is slipped, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
lay it aside as long as the temptation please, even till it come again,
and no longer. How many men are there in the world, that against
every Communion renew their vowes of holy living? Men, that
for twenty, for thirty yeers together, have been perpetually resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
against what they daily Act; and sure enough they did beleeve
themselves: And yet if a man had daily promised us a curtesie,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53465:52"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and failed us but ten times, when it was in his power to have done
it, we should think, we had reason never to beleeve him more:
And can we then reasonably beleeve the resolutions of our hearts,
which they have falsified so many hundred times? We resolve
against a religious Time, because then it is the Custome of men,
and the Guise of the Religion; Or we resolve when we are in a
great danger, and then we promise any thing, possible or impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
likely or unlikely, all is one to us, we onely care to remove
the present pressure, and when that is over, and our fear is gone,
and no love remaining, our condition being returned to our first
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> securities, our resolutions also revert to their first indifferencies:
Or else we cannot look a temptation in the face, and we resolve
against it, hoping never to be troubled with its arguments and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity.
<hi>Epictetus</hi> tells us of a Gentleman returning from ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,

attendancies, but to study, and worship the gods, and die wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> when nature, or necessity called him. It may be this man
beleeved himself, but <hi>Epictetus</hi> did not. And he had reason. For
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Letters from Caesar met him at the
doors, and invited him to Court, and he forgot all his promises,
which were warm upon his lips, and grew pompous, secular, and
ambitious, and gave the gods thanks for his preferment. Thus
many men leave the world, when their fortune hath left them,
and they are severe and philosophicall, and retired for ever, if
for ever it be impossible to return: But let a prosperous Sunshine
warm and refresh their sadnesses, and make it but possible to break
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> their purposes, and there needs no more temptation; Their own
false heart is enough; they are like Ephraim in the day of Battell,
starting aside like a broken Bow.</p>
            <p>4. The heart is false, deceiving and deceived in its intensions
and designes. A man hears the precepts of God injoyning us to
give Alms of all we possesse; he readily obeys with much cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
and alacrity; And his charity, like a fair spreading tree,
looks beauteously: But there is a Canker at the heart; The man
blowes a Trumpet to call the poor together, and hopes the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
will take notice of his Bounty. Nay he gives Alms pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and charges no man to speak of it, and yet hopes by some
Accident or other to be praised both for his Charity and Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
And if by chance, the Fame of his Alms comes abroad it is
but his duty to let his light so shine before men, that God may be
glorified, and some of our neighbours be relieved, and others edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
But then to distinguish the intention of our heart in this
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53465:53"/>
Instance, and to seek Gods glory in a particular, which will also <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
conduce much to our reputation, and to have no filthy adherence
to stick to the heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no reflexion upon our selves, or no compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
and delight in popular noyses, is the nicity of abstraction,
and requires an Angel to do it. Some men are so kind-hearted, so
true to their friend, that they will watch his very dying groans,
and receive his last breath, and close his eyes; And if this be done
with honest intention, it is well: But there are some that do so,
and yet are vultures and harpyes, they watch for the Carcasse,
and prey upon a Legacy. A man with a true story may be malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to his enemy, and by doing himself right, may also do him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
wrong: And so false is the heart of man, so clancular and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
are its Actions and Intentions, that some men pursue vertue
with great earnestnesse, and yet cannot with patience look upon it
in another: It is Beauty in Themselves, and Deformity in the
Other. Is it not plain, that not the Vertue, but its Reputation is
the thing that is pursued? And yet if you tell the man so, he thinks
he hath reason to complain of your malice or detraction. Who is
able to distinguish his fear of God from fear of punishment? when
from fear of punishment we are brought to fear God: And yet the
difference must be distinguishable in new Converts &amp; old Disciples; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
And our fear of punishment must so often change its Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that it must be at last a fear to offend out of pure Love, and
must have no formality left to distinguish it from Charity: It is
easie to distinguish these things in Precepts, and to make the sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in the Schooles: The Head can do it easily, and the Tongue
can do it: But when the Heart comes to separate Alms from Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
Gods glory from Humane praise, fear from fear, and sincerity
from Hypocrisie; it does so intricate the questions and confound
the ends, and blend and entangle circumstances, that a man hath
reason to doubt, that his very best Actions are fullied with some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handsom <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
excrescencie something to mak them very often to be cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal,
but alwayes to be imperfect.</p>
            <p>Here a man would think were enough to abate our confidence and
the spirit of pride, and to make a man eternally to stand upon his
guard, and to keep as strict watch upon his own heart, as upon his
greatest enemy from without. <hi>Custodi, libera me de meipso, Deus.</hi> It
was S. Augustines prayer, Lord keep me, Lord deliver me from my
self. If God will keep a man, that he be not <hi>Felo de se,</hi> that he lay
no violent hands upon himself, it is certain nothing else can do him
mischief, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as Agamemnon said, Neither <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
Jupiter, nor Destinies, nor the Furies, but it is a mans self that
does him the mischief. The Devil can but Tempt, and offer a dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
at the heart, unlesse our hands thrust it home, the Devil can
do nothing, but what may turne to our advantage. And in this
sence we are to understand the two seeming Contradictories in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53465:53"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Scripture, <hi>Pray that ye enter not into Temptation,</hi> said our Blessed
Saviour, and <hi>Count it all joy when you enter into divers Temptations,</hi>
said one of Christs Disciples. The case is easie. When God suffers us
to be tempted, he means it but as a trial of our faith, as the exercise of
our vertues, as the opportunity of reward, and in such cases we have
reason to count it all joy; since the <hi>Trial of our faith worketh Patience
and Patience experience, and experience causeth hope, and hope maketh
not ashamed:</hi> But yet for all this, <hi>pray against temptations:</hi> for when
we get them into our hands, we use them as blind men do their
clubs, neither distinguish person nor part; as soone they strike the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> face of their friends as the back of the Enemie; our hearts betray us
to the enemie, we fall in love with our mischief, we contrive how
to let the lust in, and leave a port open on purpose, and use arts to
forget our duty, and to give advantages to the Divel. He, that uses a
temptation thus, hath reason to pray against it; and yet our hearts
does all this and a thousand times more: so that we may ingrave
upon our hearts the epitaph which was digged into Thiestes grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.</p>

            <p>There is so much falsenesse and iniquity in mans heart, that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>files
all the members; it makes the eyes lustful, and the tongue

and the hands with injury, and the present condition of man
with folly, and makes his future state apt to inherit eternal miserie.
But this is but the beginning of those throws, &amp; damnable impieties,

It is the beginning of wisdom, to know a mans own
weaknesses,<note place="margin">Epict. Arrian.</note> and failings in things of greatest necessitie;
and we have here so many objects to furnish out this knowledge,
that we finde it with the longest and latest before it be obtained. A
man does not begin to know him self till he be old, and then he is
well stricken in death: A mans heart at first being like a plain table,
unspotted indeed, but then there is nothing legible in it. As
soon as ever we ripen towards the imperfect uses of our reason,
we write upon this table such crooked characters, such imperfect <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
configurations, so many fooleries; and stain it with so many blots,
and vitious inspersions, that there is nothing worth the reading in
our hearts for a great while; and when education and ripenesse,
reason and experience, Christian philosophy and the grace of God
hath made fair impressions and written the law in our hearts with
the finger of Gods holy spirit, we blot out this handwriting of Gods
ordinances, or mingle it with false principles, and interlinings of
our our own; we disorder the method of God, or deface the truth of
God; either we make the rule uneven we bribe or abuse our guide,
that we may wander with an excuse. Or if nothing else will do it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
we turn head and professe to go against the laws of God. Our
Hearts are blind; or our hearts are hardned: for these are two
great arguments of the wickednesse of our hearts: they do not see,
or they will not see the wayes of God; or if they do, they make use
of their seeing, that they may avoid them.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. Our hearts are blinde, wilfully blind. I need not instance in
the ignorance and involuntary nescience of men, though if we speak
of the necessary parts of religion, no man is ignorant of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his own fault: such ignorance is alwayes a direct sin, or the direct
punishment of a sin. A sin is either in its bosom, or in its retinue: But <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
the ignorance, that I now intend, is a voluntary, chosen,
delightful ignorance taken in upon designe; even for no
other end, but that we may perish quietly and infallibly.
God hath opened all the windows of Heaven, and sent
the Sun of Righteousnesse with glorious apparition, and hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverd
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53465:54"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the abysses of his own wisdom, made the second person in the
Trinity, to be the doctor and preacher of his sentences and secrets,
and the third person to be his Amanuensis or scribe, and our hearts
to be the Book, in which the doctrine is written, and miracles and
prophecies to be its arguments, and all the world to be the verifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of it: and those leaves contain within their folds all that
excellent morality, which right reason pickt up after the shipwrack
of nature; and all those wise sayings, which singly made so many
men famous for preaching some one of them; all them Christ ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
and added some more out of the immediate book of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> So that now the wisdom of God hath made every mans
heart to be the true Veronica, in which he hath imprinted his own
lineaments so perfectly, that we may dresse our selves like God,
and have the aire and features of Christ our Elder-Brother; that
we may be pure as God is, perfect as our Father, meek and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as the Son, and may have the holy Ghost within us, in gifts and
Graces, in wisdom and holinesse. This hath God done for us;
and see what we do for Him. We stand in our own light, and quench
Gods: we love darknesse more then light, and entertain our s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> accordingly. For how many of us are there, that understand no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the wayes of God; that know no more of the law of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, then is remaining upon them since they learned the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens
Catechisme? But amongst a thousand how many can expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
and unfold for his own practise the ten Commandments; And
how many sorts of sins are there forbidden? which therefore passe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
action, and never passe under the scrutinies of repentance; because
they know not that they are sinnes? Are there not very many,
who know not the particular duties of <hi>meeknesse,</hi> and never consider

you are too deep learned for them. And yet these are duties set
down plainly for our practise, necessary to be acted in order to our
Salvation. We brag of light, and reformation, and fulnesse of the
spirit: in the mean time we understand not many parts of our
dutie. We enquire into something that may make us talk, or be

Denying of our selves, Humility, Peacefulnesse and Charity,

taking up Armes against our rulers: but so we may abuse our selves
at noon and go to bed, if we please to call it midnight. And there
have been a sort of wittie men that maintained that snow was hot:
I wonder not at the probleme; but that a man should beleeve
his paradox, and should let eternity go away with the fallacie, and
rather lose heaven then leave his foolish argument, is a signe that
wilfulnesse and the deceiving heart is the Sophister, and the great
ingredient into our Deception.</p>
            <p>But that I may be more particular; the heart of man uses devices
that it may be ignorant.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
            </p>
            <p>1. We are impatient of honest and severe reproofe; and order the
circumstances of our persons and address that we shall never come
to the true knowledge of our condition. Who will endure to heare

It is Calumny and Reviling if he speak it to his head, and
relates to his person: and yet if he speak onely in general, every
man neglects what is not recommended to his particular. But yet

we are told that our liver is inflamed with lust or anger; that our
heart is vexed with envie; that our eyes rowl with wantonnesse;
And though we think all is well, yet we are sick, sick unto death,
&amp; neer to a sad and fatal sentence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we shall think that man that tells
us so is impudent, or uncharitable; and yet he hath done him no
more injury, then a deformed man receives daily from his looking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glasse;
which if he shall dash against the wall, because it showes
him his face just as it is; his face is not so ugly as his manners. And
yet our heart is so impatient of seeing its own staines, that like the

then stoops and drinks, when he can least see his huge defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie.</p>
            <p>2. In order to this, we heap up teachers of our own, and they
guide us, not <hi>whither,</hi> but <hi>which way</hi> they please: for we are curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to go our own way, and carelesse of our Hospitall or Inne

guide will entice us into the Enemies quarters; and such guides we

at first creeping in unawares have now so filled the pavement of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
the Church, that you can scarce set your foot on the ground, but you

complained of the Oracle, An answer shall be drawn out of
Scripture to countenance the designe, &amp; God made to Rebel against
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> his own Ordinances. And then we are zealous for the Lord God of
Hosts, and will live and die in that quarrel. But is it not a strange
cozenage, that our hearts shall be the main wheel in the engine, and
shall set all the rest on working? The heart shall first put his own
candle out, then put out the eye of reason; then remove the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,
and dig down the causeywayes, and then either hire a blinde
guide, or make him so; and all these Arts to get ignorance, that they
may secure impiety. At first, man lost his innocence onely in hope
to get a little knowledge; and ever since then left knowledge
should discover his errour, and make him returne to innocence, we
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> are content to part with that now, and to kow nothing that may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
or discountenance our sins, or discompose our secular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe.
And as God made great revelations and furnished out a wise
Religion, and sent his spirit to give the gift of Faith to his Church,
that upon the foundation of Faith he might build a holy life; now
our hearts love to retire into Blindnesse, &amp; sneak under the covert of
False principles, and run to a cheape religion, and an unactive disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
and make a faith of our own, that we may build upon it ease
and ambition and a tall fortune, and the pleasures of revenge, and
do what we have a minde to; scarce once in seven years denying a
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> strong and an unruly appetite upon the interest of a just conscience
and holy religion. This is such a desperate method of impiety; so
certain arts and apt instruments for the Divel, that it does his work
intirley, and produces an infallible damnation.</p>
            <p>3. But the heart of man hath yet another stratagem to secure its
iniquity by the means of ignorance; and that is, Incogitancy or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consideration.
For there is wrought upon the spirits of many men
great impression by education, by a modest and temperate nature,
by humane Laws, and the customes &amp; severities of sober persons,
and the fears of religion, and the awfulnesse of a reverend man,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and the several arguments and endearments of vertue: And it is not
in the nature of some men to do an act in despite of reason, and
Religion, and arguments, and Reverence, and modesty, and fear;
But men are forced from their sin by the violence of the grace of
God, when they heare it speak. But so a Roman Gentleman kept
off a whole band of souldiers, who were sent to murther him; and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:53465:56"/>
his eloquence was stronger then their anger and designe: But sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
a rude trooper rushed upon him, who neither had, nor would
heare him speak; and he thrust his spear into that throat, whose
musick had charmed all his fellows into peace and gentlenesse. So
do we. The Grace of God is Armour and defence enough against
the most violent incursion of the spirits, and the works of darknesse,
but then we must hear its excellent charms, and consider its reasons,
and remember its precepts, and dwell with its discourses. But this
the heart of man loves not. If I be tempted to uncleannesse, or to
an act of oppression, instantly the grace of God represents to me,
that the pleasure of the sin is transient, and vain, unsatisfying and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
empty; That I shall die, and then I shall wish too late, that I had
never done it. It tells me that I displease God who made me, who
feeds me, who blesses me, who fain would save me. It represents
to me all the joyes of Heaven, and the horrours and amazements of
a sad eternity And if I will stay and heare them, ten thousand ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
things besides, sit to be twisted about my understanding
forever. But here the heart of man shuffles all these discourses in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
disorder, and will not be put to the trouble of answering the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections;
but by a meer wildenesse of purpose and rudnesse of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
resolution ventures <hi>super totam materiam,</hi> at all, and does the thing,
not because it thinks it fit to do so, but because it will not consider
whether it be or no: it is enough that it pleases a present appetite,
and if such incogitancy comes to be habitual, as it is in very many
men; (first by resisting the motions of the holy spirit, then by
quenching him,) we shall find the consequents to be, first an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differencie,</hi>
then <hi>a dulnesse,</hi> then <hi>a Lethargie,</hi> then a direct <hi>Hating</hi>
the wayes of God; and it commonly ends in a <hi>wretchlessenesse of
spirit</hi> to be manifested on our death-bed; when the man shall passe
hence not <hi>like the shadow,</hi> but like the dog, <hi>that departeth,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
sence or interest, or apprehension, or real concernment in the
considerations of eternity: and tis but just, <hi>when we will not heare
our king speak and plead,</hi> not to save himself, but us, to speak for
our peace, and innocency and Salvation, to prevent our ruine,
and our intolerable calamity: certainly we are much in love with
the wages of death, when we cannot endure to heare God cal us back;
and stop our ears against the voice of the charmer, charme he never
so wisely.</p>
            <p>Nay further yet; we suffer the Arguments of Religion to have
so little impression upon our spirits, that they operate but like <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
the discourses of childhood, or the Problems of uncertain Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy:
A man talks of Religion but as of a dream, and from thence
he awakens into the Businesses of the world, and acts them deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately,
with perfect Action and full Resolution, and contrives,
and considers, and lives in them: But when he falls asleep again,

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> then he dreams again, and Religion makes such Impressions as is

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
a Fish of gold, upon which being over-joyed he made
a vow, that he would never fish more: But when he waked, he
soon declared his vow to be null, because he found his golden
Fish was scaped away through the holes of his eyes, when he first
opened them. Just so we do in the purposes of Religion; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in a good mood we seem to see Heaven opened, and all the
streets of Heavenly Jerusalem paved with gold and precious stones,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and we are ravished with spirituall apprehensions, and resolve never
to return to the low affections of the world, and the impute adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencies
of sin, but when this flash of lightning is gone, and we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
again with the Inclinations, and habituall desires of our false
hearts, those other desires and fine considerations disband, and the
Resolutions taken in that pious fit melt into Indifferency, and old
Customes. He was prettily and fantastically troubled, who having
used to put his trust in Dreams, one night dreamed, that all dreams
were vain; For he considered, If so, then This was vain, and then
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> dreams might be true for all this: But if they might be true, then
this dream might be so upon equall reason; And then dreams were
vain, because This dream, which told him so, was true, and so
round again. In the same Circle runs the Heart of man; All his
cogitations are vain, and yet he makes especiall use of this, that,
that Thought which thinks so, That is vain; and if That be vain,
then his other Thoughts, which are vainly declared so, may be
Reall, and Relied upon; And so we do. Those religious thoughts,
which are sent into us, to condemne and disrepute the thoughts of
sin and vanity, are esteemed the onely dreams; And so all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Instruments, which the grace of God hath invented for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of Impiety, are rendred ineffectuall, either by our direct
opposing them, or (which happens most commonly) by our want
of considering them.</p>
            <p>The effect of all is this, That we are ignorant of the
things of God; we make Religion to be the work of a few
hours in the whole yeer; we are without fancy or affection to the
severities of holy Living; we reduce Religion to the Beleeving of a
few Articles, and doing nothing that is considerable; we Pray sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and then but very coldly and indifferently; we Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> not so often as the Sun salutes both the Tropicks; we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
Christ, but dare not die for him; we are factious for a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and will not live according to its precepts; we call our selves
Christians, and love to be ignorant of many of the Lawes of Christ:
lest our knowledge should force us into shame, or into the troubles
of a holy Life. All the mischiefs that you can suppose to happen
to a furious inconsiderate person, running after the wilde-fires of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53465:57"/>
the night, over Rivers and Rocks, and Precipices without Sun or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
starre, or Angel or Man to guide him: All that, and ten thousand
times worse may you suppose to be the certain Lot of him, who
gives himself up to the conduct of a passionate blinde Heart, whom
no fire can warm, and no Sun enlighten; who hates light and loves
to dwell in the Regions of darknesse. Thats the first generall mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
of the Heart; It is possessed with Blindnesse, wilfull and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary.</p>

also is bound up in the Heart of man. If God strives to soften it
with sorrow and sad Accidents, it is like an Ox, it grows callow,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
and hard. Such a heart was <hi>Pharaohs.</hi> When God makes the
clouds to gather round about us, we wrap our heads in the clouds,
and like the male-contents in Galba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and murmur. Or else if our fears be pregnant, and the
heart yeelding, it sinks low into pusillanimity and superstition;
and our hearts are so childish, so timerous, or so impatient in a
sadnesse, that God is weary of striking us, and we are glad of it.
And yet when the Sun shines upon us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our hearts are hardned
with that too, and God seems to be at a losse, as if he knew not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
what to do to us. Warre undoes us and makes us violent: Peace
undoes us and makes us wanton. Prosperity makes us Proud,
Adversity renders us Impatient; Plenty dissolves us and makes us
Tyrants, Want makes us greedy, liars, and rapacious.</p>

            <p>No fortune can save that City to whom neither Peace nor Warre

no change, save that the heart growes worse and more obdurate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
for every change of Providence? But here also I must descend to
particulars.</p>
            <p>1. The Heart of man is strangely Proud; If men commend
us we think we have reason to distinguish our selves from others,
since the voice of discerning men hath already made the separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
If men do not commend us, we think they are stupid, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
us not, or envious and hold their tongues in spite. If we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
are praised by many, then <hi>Vox populi, vox Dei.</hi> Fame is the voice
of God. If we be praised but by few, then <hi>Satis unus, satis nullus.</hi>
We cry, these are wise, and one wise man is worth a whole herd
of the People. But if we be praised by none at all, we resolve to
be even with all the world, and speak well of no body, and think
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:53465:57"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> well onely of our selves: And then we have such beggerly
Arts, such tricks to cheat for praise; we inquire after our faults
and failings onely to be told we have none, but did excellently,
and then we are pleased; we rail upon our actions onely to be
chidden for so doing; and then he is our friend who chides us into
a good opinion of our selves; which however all the world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make us part with. Nay, Humility it self makes us proud;
so false, so base is the the Heart of man. For Humility is so noble
a vertue, that even Pride it self puts on its upper Garment; And
we do like those, who cannot endure to look upon an ugly or a
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> deformed person, and yet will give a great price for a picture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
like him. Humility is despised in substance, but courted
and admired <hi>in effigie.</hi> And Aesops picture was sold for two talents,
when himself was made a slave at the price of two Philippicks.
And because Humility makes a man to be honoured; Therefore
we imitate all its garbs and postures, its civilities and silence, its
modesties and condescensions. And to prove that we are extreamly
proud in the midst of all this pagentry, we should be extreamly
angry at any man, that should say, we are proud; And thats a sure
signe we are so. And in the middest of all our Arts to seem Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> we use devices to bring our selves into talk; we thrust our
selves into company; we listen at doors; and like the great Beards
in Rome, that pretended Philosophy and strict life, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
We walk by the Obelisk, and meditate in Piazza's,
that they that meet us may talk of us, and they that follow may
cry out, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; Behold! there goes an excellent man!
He is very prudent, or very learned, or a charitable person, or a
good housekeeper, or at least very Humble.</p>
            <p>The Heart of man is deeply in love with wickednesse, and
with nothing else: Against, not onely the Lawes of God, but
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> against his own Reason, its own Interest, and its own Securities.
For is it imaginable, that a man who knows the Lawes of God,
the rewards of Vertue, the cursed and horrid effects of sin; that
knows and considers, and deeply sighes at the thought of the into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
pains of Hell; that knowes the joyes of Heaven to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable,
and that concerning them there is no temptation, but
that they are too big for man to hope for; And yet he certainly
beleeves, that a holy life shall infallibly attain thither; Is it I say
imaginable, that this man should for a transient Action forfeit all
this Hope, and certainly and knowing incur all that calamity? Yea,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> but the sin is pleasant, and the man is clothed with flesh and blood,
and their appetites are materiall, and importunate, and present;
And the discourses of Religion are concerning things spirituall, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
and apt for spirits, Angels and souls departed. To take off
this also; We will suppose the man to consider, and really to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
that the pleasure of the sin, is sudden, vain, empty and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:53465:58"/>
transient; that it leaves bitternesse upon the tongue, before it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
descended into the bowels; that there it is poison, and makes the
Belly to swell, and the Thigh to rot; That he remembers and
actually considers, that as soon as the moment of sin is past, he
shall have an intolerable Conscience; and does at the instant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
moments with Eternity, and with horrour remembers that
the very next minute he is as miserable a man as is in the world;
Yet that this man should sin? Nay, suppose the sin to have no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
at all; such as is the sin of swearing; Nay, suppose it really
to have pain in it; such as is the sin of Envy, which never can have
pleasure in its actions, but much torment and consumption of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
very heart; What should make this man sin so for nothing, so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
himself, so against all Reason and Religion and Interest,
without pleasure for no reward? Here the heart betrayes it self to
be desperately wicked. What man can give a reasonable account
of such a man, who to prosecute his revenge will do himself an
injury, that he may do a lesse to him that troubles him. Such a man
hath given me ill language; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>;
My head akes not for his language, nor hath
he broken my thigh, nor carried away my land. But yet this man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
must be requited. Well, suppose that. But then let it be proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable;
you are not undone, let not him be so. Oh yes; for else
my revenge triumphs not. Well, if you do, yet remember he will
defend himself, or the Law will right him; at least do not do wrong
to your self by doing him wrong. This were but Prudence, and self-Interest.
And yet we see, that the heart of some men hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
them to such furiousnesse of Appetite, as to make them
willing to die, that their enemie may be buried in the same Ruines.
Jovius Pontanus tells of an Italian slave (I think) who being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
against his Lord, watched his absence from home, and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
employment and inadvertency of his fellow-servants: he locked
the doors, and secured himself for a while, and Ravished his
Lady; then took her three sons up to the battlements of the house,
and at the return of his Lord, threw one down to him upon the
pavement, and then a second to rend the heart of their sad Father,
seeing them weltring in their blood and brains. The Lord begd for
his third, and now his onely Son, promising pardon and libertie,
if he would spare his life. The slave seemed to bend a little, and
on condition his Lord would cut off his own Nose, he would
spare his Son. The sad Father did so, being willing to suffer any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
thing, rather then the losse of that Childe; But as soon as he saw
his Lord all bloody with his wound, he threw the third Son, and
himself down together upon the Pavement. The story is sad
enough, and needs no lustre and advantages of sorrow to represent
it: But if a man sets himself down, and considers sadly, he cannot
easily tell upon what sufficient inducement, or what principle the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:53465:58"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> slave should so certainly, so horridly, so presently, and then so
eternally ruine himself. What could he propound to himself as a
recompence to his own so immediate Tragedy? There is not in
the pleasure of the revenge, nor in the nature of the thing, any
thing to tempt him; we must confesse our ignorance, and say,
that The Heart of man is desperately wicked; and that is the truth
in generall, but we cannot fathom it by particular compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension.</p>
            <p>For when the heart of man is bound up by the grace of God,
and tied in golden bands, and watched by Angels, tended by
those Nurse-keepers of the soul; it is not easie for a man to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> And the evil of his heart is but like the ferity and wildnesse
of Lyons-whelps: But when once we have broken the hedge, and
got into the strengths of youth, and the licenciousnesse of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governed
age, it is wonderfull to observe, what a great inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of mischief in a very short time will overflow all the banks of
Reason and Religion. <hi>Vice</hi> first is <hi>pleasing,</hi> then it grows <hi>easie,</hi> then
<hi>delightfull,</hi> then <hi>frequent,</hi> then <hi>habituall,</hi> then <hi>confirmed,</hi> then the
<hi>man is impenitent,</hi> then he is <hi>obstinate,</hi> then he <hi>resolves never to
Repent,</hi> and then he is <hi>Damned.</hi> And by that time he is come half
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> way in this progresse, he confutes the Philosophy of the old Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralists;
For they, not knowing the vilenesse of mans Heart not
considering its desperate amazing Impiety, knew no other degree
of wickednesse but This, That men preferred Sense before Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and their understandings were abused in the choice of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
before an intellectuall and eternall good: But they alwayes
concluded, that the Will of man must of necessity follow the last
dictate of the understanding, declaring an object to be good in one
sence or other. Happy men they were, that were so Innocent;
that knew no pure and perfect malice, and lived in an Age, in
which it was not easie to confute them. But besides that, now the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> wells of a deeper iniquity are discovered, we see by too sad expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
that there are some sins proceeding from the heart of man,
which have nothing but simple, and unmingled malice; Actions
of meer spite; doing evil, because it is evil; sinning without sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall
pleasures; sinning with sensuall pain, with hazard of our lives;
with actuall torment, and sudden deaths, and certain and present
damnation; sins against the Holy Ghost; open hostilities, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
enmities against God and all vertue. I can go no further;
because there is not in the world, or in the nature of things, a
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> greater Evil. And that is the Nature and Folly of the Devil; he
tempts men to ruine, and hates God, and onely hurts himself, and
those he tempts; and does himself no pleasure, and some say, he
increases his own accidentall torment.</p>
            <p>Although I can say nothing greater; yet I had many more things
to say, if the time would have permitted me to represent the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:53465:59"/>
Falsenesse and Basenesse of the Heart. 1. We are false our selves,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
and dare not trust God. 2. We love to be deceived, and are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
if we be told so. 3. We love to seem vertuous, and yet hate
to be so. 4. We are melancholy and impatient, and we know
not why. 5. We are troubled at little things, and are carelesse of
greater. 6. We are overjoyed at a petty accident, and despise
great and eternall pleasures. 7. We beleeve things, not for their
Reasons and proper Arguments; but as they serve our turns, be
they true or false. 8. We long extreamly for things that are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
us; And what we despise, when it is permitted us, we snatch
at greedily, when it is taken from us. 9. We love our selves <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
more then we love God; and yet we eat poysons daily, and feed
upon Toads and Vipers, and nourish our deadly enemies in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
and will not be brought to quit them; but brag of our shame,
and are ashamed of nothing, but Vertue, which is most honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
10. We fear to die, and yet use all means we can to make
Death terrible and dangerous. 11. We are busie in the faults of
others, and negligent of our own. 12. We live the life of spies,
striving to know others, and to be unknown our selves. 13. We
worship and flatter some men, and some things, because we fear
them, not because we love them. 14. We are ambitious of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
Greatnesse, and covetous of wealth, and all that we get by it, is,
that we are more beautifully tempted; and a troop of Clients run
to us, as to a Pool, whom first they trouble, and then draw dry.
15. We make our selves unsafe by committing wickednesse, and
then we adde more wickednesse to make us safe, and beyond pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.
16. We are more servile for one curtesie, that we
hope for, then for twenty that we have received. 17. We enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
slanderers, and without choice spread their calumnies; and
we hugg flatterers, and know they abuse us: And if I should ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the abuses, and impieties, and deceptions of the Heart, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               <hi>Chrysippus</hi> did the oracular Lies of <hi>Apollo</hi> into a Table; I fear they
would seem Remedilesse, and beyond the cure of watchfulnesse
and Religion. Indeed they are Great and Many: But the Grace of
God is Greater; and if Iniquity abounds, then doth Grace super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abound,
and thats our Comfort and our Medicine, which we must
thus use.</p>
            <p>1. Let us watch our hearts at every turn.</p>
            <p>2. Deny it all its Desires, that do not directly or by consequence
end in godlinesse: At no hand be indulgent to its fondnesses, and
peevish appetites.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
            </p>
            <p>3. Let us suspect it as an Enemy.</p>
            <p>4. Trust not to it in any thing.</p>
            <p>5. But beg the grace of God with perpetuall and importunate
prayer, that he would be pleased to bring good out of these evils,
and that he would throw the salutary wood of the Crosse, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53465:59"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of Christs death and passion, into these salt waters, and make
them healthful and pleasant.</p>
            <p>And in order to the mannaging these advises, and acting the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
of this prayer; let us strictly follow a rule; and choose a
Prudent and faithful guide, who may attend our motions, and
watch our counsels, and direct our steps, and <hi>prepare the way of the
Lord, and make his paths streight,</hi> apt and imitable. For without
great watchfulnesse, and earnest devotion, and a prudent Guide,
we shall finde that true in a spiritual sense, which Plutarch affirmed
of a mans body in the natural; that of dead Buls arise Bees; from
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the carcases of horses, hornets are produced; But the body of
man brings forth serpents. Our hearts wallowing in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural

perspective of Philosophy, to look beyond the cloud, and there to
spie that there stood glories behinde their curtain, to which they
could not come but by passing through the cloud, and being wet
with the dew of heaven and the waters of affliction. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as the world grew more englightned by faith so it grew more
dark with mourning &amp; sorrowes: God sometimes sent a light of fire
and pillar of a cloud and the brightnesse of an angel and the lustre of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> a star, and the sacrament of a rainbowe to guide his people thorough
their portion of sorrows, and to lead them through troubles to rest:
But as the Sun of righteousnesse approached towards the chambers
of the East, and sent the harbingers of light peeping through
the curtains of the night, and leading on the day of faith and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
revelation; so God sent degrees of trouble upon wise and good
men, that now in the same degree in the which the world <hi>lives by
faith</hi> and not by sense, in the same degree they might be able to live
in vertue even while she lived in trouble, and not reject so great
a beauty because she goes in mourning, and hath a black cloud of cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> drawn before her face: literally thus; God first entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their services, and allured and prompted on the infirmities of the
infant world by temporal prosperity; but by degrees changed his
method; and as men grew stronger in the knowledge of God and
the expectations of heaven, so they grew weaker in their fortunes,
more afflicted in their bodies, more abated in their expectations,
more subject to their enemies, and were to endure <hi>the contradiction
of sinners</hi> and the immission of the sharpnesses of providence and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Oeconomy.</p>
            <p>First Adam was placed in a Garden of health and pleasure, from
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> which when he fell, he was onely tied to enter into the covenant of
<hi>natural sorrows</hi> which he and all his posteritie till the flood run
through: but in all that period they had the whole wealth of the
earth before them, they need not fight for empires or places for
their cattle to grase in; they lived long and felt no want, no sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
no tyrannie, no war: and the evils that happened were <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,
personal,</hi> and <hi>natural,</hi> and no violences were then done, but they
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:53465:61"/>
were like those things which the law calls <hi>rare contingencies;</hi> for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
which as the law can now take no care, and make no provisions, so
then there was no law; but men lived <hi>free</hi> and <hi>rich</hi> and <hi>long,</hi> and
they exercised no <hi>vertues</hi> but <hi>natural,</hi> and knew no <hi>felicity</hi> but <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural:</hi>
and so long their prosperity was, just as was their vertue,
because it was a natural instrument towards all that which they
knew of happinesse, * But this publick easinesse and quiet, the world
turned into sin; and unlesse God did compel men to do themselves
good they would undoe themselves: and then God broke in upon
them with a flood and destroyed that generation, that he might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
the government of the world upon a new stock, and binde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
vertue upon mens spirits by new bands, endeared to them by new
hopes and fears.</p>
            <p>Then God made new laws and gave to Princes the power of the
sword, and men might be punshed to death in certain cases, and mans
life was shortened, and slavery was brought into the world and the
state of servants; and then war began, and evils multiplied upon
the face of the earth; in which it is naturally certain, that they that
are most violent and injurious prevailed upon the weaker and more
innocent; and every tyranny that began from Nimrod to this day,
and every usurper was a peculiar argument to shew that God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
to teach the world, vertue by suffering; and that therefore he
suffered <hi>Tyrannies</hi> and <hi>usurpations,</hi> to be in the world, and to be
prosperous, and the rights of men to be snatched away from the
owners, that the world might be established in potent and setled
governments and the sufferers be taught al the passive vertues of the
soul. For so God brings good out of evil, turning <hi>Tyranny</hi> into the
benefits of <hi>Government,</hi> and <hi>violence</hi> into <hi>vertue,</hi> and <hi>sufferings</hi> into
<hi>rewards:</hi> and this was the second change of the world: <hi>personal
miseries</hi> were brought in upon Adam and his posterity, as a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of sin in the first period: and in the second, <hi>publick evils</hi> were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
brought in by <hi>tyrants</hi> and <hi>usurpers,</hi> and God suffered them as the
first elements of vertue, men being just newly put to schoole to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
sufferings. But all this was not much.</p>
            <p>Christs line was not yet drawn forth: it began not to appear in
what family the <hi>King of sufferings</hi> should descend till <hi>Abrahams</hi>
time, and therefore till then there were no greater sufferings then
what I have now reckoned. But when Abrahams family was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
from among the many nations, and began to belong to God, by
a special right, and he was designed to be the <hi>Father</hi> of the <hi>Messias,</hi>
then God found out a new way to trie him, even with a sound af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
commanding him to offer his beloved <hi>Isaac;</hi> but this was
accepted and being intended by Abraham was not intended by God:
for this was a type of Christ, and therefore was also but a type of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
excepting the sufferings of the old periods and the sufferings
of nature and accident, we see no change made, for a long while
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53465:61"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> after, but God having established a law in Abrahams family did
build it upon promises, of <hi>health,</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> and <hi>victory,</hi> and <hi>plenty,</hi>
and <hi>riches:</hi> and so long as they did not prevaricate the law of their
God, so long they were prosperous: but God kept a remnant of
Cananites in the land like a rod held over them to vex or to chastise
them into obedience, in which while they persevered, nothing could
hurt them; and that saying of David needs no other sence, but the
letter of its own expression, <hi>I have been young and now am old,
and yet saw I never the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging their
bread:</hi> The godly generally were prosperous, and a good cause sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> had an ill end, and a good man never died an ill death, till
the law had spent a great part of its time, and it descended towards
its declension and period; But that the great prince of sufferings
might not appear upon his stage of tragedies without some fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners
of sorrow, God was pleased to choose out some good men,
and honour them, by making them to become little images of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering:
<hi>Isaiah, Jeremy,</hi> and <hi>Zachary</hi> were martyrs of the law; but
these were single deaths; <hi>Shadrac, Meshec,</hi> and <hi>Abednego</hi> were
thrown into a burning furnace, and <hi>Daniel</hi> into a den of lions, and
<hi>Susanna</hi> was accused for adultery; but these were but little ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ests
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of the prosperity of the Godly: as the time drew neerer that Christ
should be manifest, so the sufferings grew bigger and more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous:
and <hi>Antiochus</hi> raised up a sharp persecution in the time of the
Maccabees, in which many passed through the red sea of blood into
the bosome of Abraham; &amp; then Christ came: and that was the <hi>third
period</hi> in which the changed method of Gods providence was perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
for Christ was to do his great work by sufferings, &amp; <hi>by sufferings</hi>
was to <hi>enter into blessednesse;</hi> &amp; by his passion he was made prince of
the Catholickchurch, and as our Head was, so must the members be:
God made the same covenant with us, that he did with his most holy
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Son; &amp; Christ obtaind no better conditions for us, then for himself;
that was not to be looked for; <hi>the servant must not be above his master,
it is well if he be as his Master: if the world persecuted him, they will also
persecute us; and from the dayes of John the Baptist, the kingdome of
Heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force: not the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
doers,</hi> but <hi>the sufferers of violence</hi> for though the old law was
established in the promises of temporal prosperity, yet the gospel
is founded in temporal adversity. It is directly a covenant of suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and sorrows; <hi>for now the time is come that judgment must begin
at the house of God:</hi> thats the sence and designe of the text; and I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> it as a direct antinomy to the common perswasion of tyrann<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
carnal, and vicious men, who reckon nothing good, out what is
<hi>prosperous:</hi> for though that proposition had many degrees of truth
in the beginning of the law, yet the case is now altered; God hath
established its contradictory: and now every good man must look
for persecution, and every good cause must expect to thrive by
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53465:62"/>
the sufferings and patience of holy persons; and as men do well, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
suffer evil, so they are dear to God: and whom he loves most, he
afflicts most, and does this with a designe of the greatest mercy in
the world.</p>
            <p>1. Then, the state of the Gospel is a state of sufferings, not of
temporal prosperities, this was foretold by the prophets; <hi>a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
shall go out of the house of the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joel. 3.</note> 
               <hi>&amp; irrigahit torrentem spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narum;</hi>
(so it is in the vulgar latin) <hi>and it shall water the torrent of
thorns;</hi> that is, the state or time of the gospel. which like <hi>a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi>
shall cary all the world before it, and like <hi>a torrent</hi> shall be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
in ill weather; and by its banks shall grow nothing but thorns <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
and briers, sharp afflictions, temporal infelicities and persecution.
This sense of the words is more fully explained in the book of the
prophet Isa.<note place="margin">Isaiah. 23. 3.</note> 
               <hi>upon the ground of my people shall thorns and briers
come up, how much more in all the houses of the city of rejoycing;</hi> which
prophecy is the same in the stile of the prophets, that my text is
in the stile of the Apostles: the house of God shall be watered with
the dew of heaven, and there shall spring up briers in it: <hi>judgement
must begin there:</hi> but <hi>how much more in the houses of the city of rejoycing</hi>
how much more amongst them <hi>that are at ease in Sion;</hi> that serve <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
their desires, that satisfie their appetites, that are given over to their
own hearts lust, that so serves themselves, that they never serve God,
that <hi>dwell in the city of rejoycing;</hi> they are like Dives whose porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was in this life, who <hi>went in fine linnen and fared deliciously
every day;</hi> they indeed trample upon their briers and thorns and
suffer them not to grow in their houses; but the roots are in the
ground, and they are reserved for fuel of wrath in the day of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
burning. Thus you see it was prophesied, now see how
it was performed: <hi>Christ</hi> was <hi>the captain of our sufferings</hi> and
he began.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
            </p>
            <p>He entred into the world with all the circumstances of poverty;
he had a star to illustrate his birth but a stable for his bed chamber,
and a manger for his cradle: the angels sang hymnes when he was
born, but he was cold and cried, uneasy and unprovided; he lived
long in the trade of a carpenter, he by whom God made the world
had in his first years the businesse of a mean and an ignoble trade;
he did good where ever he went, and almost where ever he went
was abused; he deserved heaven for his obedience, but found a
crosse in his way thither; and if ever any man had reason to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
fair usages from God, and to be dandled in lap of ease, softnes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
and a prosperous fortune, he it was onely that could deserve that,
or any thing that can be good. But after he had chosen to live a life
of vertue, of poverty, and labour, he entred into a state of death;
whose shame and trouble was great enough to pay for the sins of
the whole world: And I shall choose to expresse this mystery
in the vvords of scripture; he died not by a single, or a sudden death
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53465:62"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> but he was <hi>the Lambe slain from the beginning of the world:</hi> For
he was massacred in <hi>Abel,</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Paulinus)</hi> he was tossed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the waves of the Sea, in the person of <hi>Noah;</hi> It was he that
went out of his Countrey, when <hi>Abraham</hi> was called from <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi>
and wandred from his native soil: He was offered up in
<hi>Isaac,</hi> persecuted in <hi>Jacob,</hi> betrayed in <hi>Joseph,</hi> blinded in <hi>Sampson,</hi>
affronted in <hi>Moses,</hi> sawed in <hi>Esay,</hi> cast into the dungeon with <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy.</hi>
For all these were types of Christ suffering; and then his
passion continued even after his resurrection; for it is he that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
in all his members; it is he that endures <hi>the contradiction of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> all sinners;</hi> it is he that is <hi>the Lord of life,</hi> and is <hi>crucified again,
and put to open shame</hi> in all the sufferings of his servants, and sins
of rebels, and defiances of Apostates, and renegados, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of Tyrants, and injustice of usurpers, and the persecutions
of his Church. It is he that is stoned in Saint <hi>Stephen,</hi> flayed in
the person of Saint <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> he was rosted upon Saint <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
his Cridiron, exposed to lyons in Saint <hi>Ignatius,</hi> burned in
Saint <hi>Polycarpe,</hi> frozen in the lake where stood fourty Martyrs of
Cappadocia; <hi>Vnigenitus enim Dei ad peragendum mortis suae sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
               <hi>consummavit omne genus humanarum passionum</hi> said Saint
<hi>Hilary.</hi> The Sacrament of Christs death is not to be accomplished,
but by suffering all the sorrows of humanity.</p>
            <p>All that Christ came for, was, or was mingled with sufferings:
For all those little joyes which God sent, either to recreate his
person, or to illustrate his office, were abated, or attended with
afflictions; God being more carefull to establish in him the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of sufferings, then to refresh his sorrows: Presently after
the Angels had finished their Halleluiahs, he was forced to fly to
save his life; and the air became full of shrikes of the desolate
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> mothers of Bethlehem for their dying Babes. God had no sooner
made him illustrious with a voyce from heaven, and the descent
of the Holy Ghost upon him in the waters of Baptisme. But he was
delivered over to be tempted and assaulted by the Devil in the
wildernesse: His transfiguration was a bright ray of glory, but
then also he entred into a cloud, and was told a sad story what
he was to suffer at Jerusalem: And upon Palme Sunday, when
he rode triumphantly into Jerusalem, and was adorned with the
acclamations of a King, and a God, he wet the Palmes with his
tears, sweeter then the drops of Mannah, or the little pearls of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> heaven, that descended upon mount Hermon, weeping in the
midst of this triumph over obstinate, perishing, and maliciour <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi>
For this Jesus was like the rain-bowe which God set in
the clouds as a sacrament to confirm a promise, and establish a
grace, he was half made of the glories of the light, and half of
the moisture of a cloud; in his best dayes he was but half tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
and half sorrow; he was sent to tell of his Fathers mercies,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:53465:63"/>
and that God intended to spare us; but appeared not but in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
company, or in the retinue of a shower, and of foul weather:
But I need not tell that Jesus, beloved of God, was a suffering
person: that which concerns this question most, is that he made
for us a covenant of sufferings: His <hi>Doctrines</hi> were such as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely
and by consequent enjoyne and suppose <hi>sufferings,</hi> and a
state of affliction; His very <hi>promises</hi> were <hi>sufferings,</hi> his <hi>beatitudes</hi>
were <hi>sufferings,</hi> his <hi>rewards,</hi> and his <hi>arguments</hi> to invite men to
follow him, were onely taken from <hi>sufferings</hi> in this life, and the
reward of <hi>sufferings</hi> hereafter.</p>
            <p>For if we summon up the <hi>Commandements</hi> of Christ, we shall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
finde <hi>humility, mortification, self-deniall, repentance, renouncing
the world, mourning, taking up the crosse, dying for him, patience</hi>
and <hi>poverty,</hi> to stand in the chiefest rank of Christian precepts,
and in the direct order to heaven: <hi>He that will be my Disciple must
deny himself, and take up his crosse and follow me.</hi> We must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 13.</note> And Saint James
again, <hi>We count them blessed that have suffered:</hi> And Saint Paul when
he gives his blessing to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> he uses this form of prayer:
<hi>Our Lord direct our hearts in the charity of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Thess. 1.</note> 
               <hi>and in the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

sufferings,</hi> whose crown was of thorns, whose scepter was a reed
of scorne, whose imperiall robe was a scarlet of mockery, whose
throne was the Crosse;<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 10.</note> We must serve him in sufferings, in poverty
of spirit, in humility, and mortification, and for our reward we
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> shall have persecution, and all its blessed consequents: <hi>Atque hoc
est esse Christianum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since this was done in the green-tree, what might we expect
should be done in the dry: Let us in the next place consider how
God hath treated his Saints and servants, and the descending ages
of the Gospel; That if the best of Gods servants were followers
of Jesus in this covenant of sufferings,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 12.</note> 
               <hi>we may not think it strange
concerning the fiery tryall, as if some new thing had happened to us.</hi>
For as the Gospel was founded in sufferings, we shall also see it
grow in persecutions: and as Christs blood did cement the corner
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> stones and the first foundations; So the blood and sweat, the
groans and sighings, the afflictions and mortifications of saints,
and martyrs did make the superstructures, and must at last finish
the building.</p>
            <p>If I begin with the Apostles, who were to perswade the world
to become Christian, and to use proper Arguments of invitation,
we shall finde that they never offered an Argument of temporall
prosperity: they never promised Empires and thrones on earth,
nor riches, nor temporall power, and it would have been soon
confuted, if they who were whipt and imprisoned, banished and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> scattered, persecuted and tormented, should have promised Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine
dayes to others, which they could not to themselves: Of all
the Apostles there was not one that died a naturall death but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Saint John;<note place="margin">Tertul. S. Hieron.</note> and did he escape? Yes: But he was put into a
Cauldron of scalding lead and oyl, before the <hi>Port Latin</hi> in Rome,
and scaped death by miracle, though no miracle was wrought to
make him scape the torture: And besides this, he lived long in ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
and that was worse then Saint Peters chains: <hi>Sanctus
Petrus in vinculis, &amp; Johannes ante portam latinam,</hi> were both
dayes of Martyrdom and Church Festivals: and after a long and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> laborious life, and the affliction of being detained from his crown,
and his sorrows for the death of his fellow-disciples, he dyed <hi>full
of dayes and sufferings:</hi> And when Saint Paul was taken into
the Apostolate, his Commissions were signed in these words; <hi>I
will shew unto him how great things he must suffer for my Name:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 9. 15.</note>
and his whole life was a continuall suffering: <hi>Quotidiè morior</hi> was

of the sufferings of Christ which must be filled up by his body the Church;</hi>
and happy are they that put in the greatest symbol: for <hi>in the same
measure you are partakers of the sufferings of Christ, in the same shall
ye be also of the consolation.</hi> And therefore concerning S. Paul, as
it was also concerning Christ, there is nothing or but very little in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
Scripture, relating to his person and chances of his private life, but
his labours and persecutions, as if the holy Ghost did think nothing
fit to stand upon record for Christ, but sufferings.</p>
            <p>And now began to work the greatest glory of the divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:
here was the case of Christianity at stake. The world was
rich and prosperous, learned and full of wise men, the Gospel
was preached with poverty and persecution, in simplicity of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
and <hi>in demonstration of the Spirit:</hi> God was on one side,
and the Devil on the other; they each of them dressed up their
city; <hi>Babylon</hi> upon Earth, <hi>Jerusalem</hi> from above; the Devils city <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
was full of pleasure, triumphs, victories and cruelty; good news
and great wealth, conquest over Kings, and making nations tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary;
<hi>They bound Kings in chains, and the Nobles with links of iron,</hi>
and <hi>the inheritance of the Earth was theirs:</hi> the Romans were
Lords over the greatest parts of the world; and God permitted to
the Devil the Firmament and increase, the wars and the successe of
that people, giving to him an intire power of disposing the great
changes of the world, so as might best increase their greatnesse and
power: and he therefore did it, because all the power of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
greatnesse was a professed enemy to Christianity: and on the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
other side God was to build up <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and the kingdom of the
Gospel: and he chose to build it of hewen stone, cut and broken:
the Apostles he chose for Preachers, and they had no learning;
women and mean people were the first Disciples, and they had no
power: the Devil was to lose his kingdom, and he wanted no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice:
and therefore he stirred up, and as well as he could, he made
active all the power of Rome, and all the learning of the Greeks,
and all the malice of Barbarous people, and all the prejudice and
the obstinacy of the Jews, against this doctrine and institution;
which preached and promised, and brought persecution along with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
it. On the one side there was <hi>scandalum crucis,</hi> on the other <hi>patien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia
sanctorum,</hi> and what was the event? They that had overcome
the world, could not strangle Christianity. But so have I seen the
Sun with a little ray of distant light challenge all the power of
darknesse, and without violence and noise climbing up the hill, hath
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53465:64"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> made night so to retire, that its memory was lost in the joyes and
spritefulnesse of the morning; and Christianity without violence
or armies, without resistance and self-preservation, without
strength or humane eloquence, without challenging of priviledges,
or fighting against Tyranny, without alteration of government,
and scandall of Princes, with its humility and meeknesse, with to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerations
and patience, with obedience and charity, with praying,
and dying, did insensibly turn the <hi>world</hi> into <hi>Christian,</hi> and <hi>perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution</hi>
into <hi>victory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Christ who began, and lived and died in sorrows, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> his own sufferings to succeed so well, and that <hi>for suffering
death, he was crowned with immortality,</hi> resolved to take all his
Disciples and servants to <hi>the fellowship of the same suffering,</hi> that
they might have a participation of his glory; knowing, God had
opened no gate of heaven but <hi>the narrow gate,</hi> to which the
Crosse was the key: and since Christ now being our <hi>High Priest</hi> in
heaven, intercedes for us by representing his passion, and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
of the Crosse, that even in glory he might still preserve the
mercies of his past sufferings, for which the Father did so delight
in him: he also designes to present us to God, dressed in the same
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> robe, and treated in the same manner, and honoured with <hi>the
marks of the Lord Jesus: He hath predestinated us to be conformable
to the image of his Son:</hi> And if under a head crowned with thorns,
we bring to God members circled with roses, and softnesse, and
delicacy, triumphant members in the militant Church God will
reject us; he will not know us who are so unlike our elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
For we are members of the Lamb, not of the Lion, and of
Christs suffering part, not of the triumphant part: and for three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeers together, the Church lived upon blood, and was nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
with blood; the blood of her own children: Thirty three
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Bishops of Rome in immediate succession, were put to violent and
unnaturall deaths: and so were all the Churches of the East and
West built; the cause of Christ and of Religion was advanced by
the sword, but it was the sword of the persecutours, not of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisters,
or warriours: They were all <hi>baptized into the death of
Christ,</hi> their very profession and institution is to live like him; and
when he requires it, to die for him; that is the very formality, the
life and essence of Christianity. This I say lasted for three hundred
yeers, that the prayers and the backs, and the necks of Christians
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> fought against the rods and axes of the persecuto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rs, and prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t it self was fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with Christians: And by this time, <hi>the arm of Martyrs</hi> was
vast and numerous, and the number of sufferers blunted the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
sword: For Christ first triumphed over the princes and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the world, before he would admit them to serve him; he
first felt their malice before he would make use of their defence,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53465:65"/>
to shew that it was not his necessity that required it, but his grace <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
that admitted <hi>Kings and Queens to be nurses of the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now the Church was at ease, and she that sucked the
blood of the Martyrs so long, began now to suck the milk of
Queens: Indeed it was a great mercy in appearance, and was so
intended, but it proved not so. But then the Holy Ghost in pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the designe of Christ, who meant by sufferings to perfect
his Church, as himself was by the same instrument, was pleased
now that persecution did cease, to inspire the Church with the
spirit of mortification and austerity; and then they made Colleges
of sufferers, persons who to secure their inheritance in the world <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
to come, did cut off all their portion in this, excepting so much
of it as was necessary to their present being; and by instruments
of humility, by patience under, and a voluntary undertaking of
the Cro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>e, <hi>the burden of the Lord,</hi> by self deniall, by fastings
and sackeloth, and pernoctations in prayer, they chose then to
exercise the active part of the religion, mingling it as much as they
could with the suffering.</p>
            <p>And indeed it is so glorious a thing to be like Christ, to be dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
like the prince of the Catholick church, who was so a man of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
and to whom a prosperous and unafflicted person is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
that in all ages the servants of God have <hi>put on the armour of
righteousnesse, on the right hand, and on the left,</hi> that is, in the
sufferings of persecution, or the labours of mortification, in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
under the rod of God, or by election of our own; by to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration,
or self denial, by actual martyrdom, or by aptnesse or
disposition towards it, by dying for Christ or suffering for him; by
being willing to part with all when he calls for it, and by parting
with what we can, for the relief of his poor members. For know
this, there is no state in the Church, so serene, no days so pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
in which God does not give to his servants the powers and
opportunities of suffering for him, not onely they that die for
Christ, but they that live according to his laws, shall finde some
lives to part with, and many wayes to suffer for Christ. To kill and
crucifie the old man, and all his lusts, to mortifie a beloved sin, to
fight against temptations, to do violence to our bodies, to live
chastly, to suffer affronts patiently, to forgive injuries and debts,
to renounce all prejudice and interest in religion, and to choose our
side for truthes sake (not because it is prosperous, but because it
pleases God) to be charitable beyond our power, to reprove our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
betters with modesty and opennesse, to displease men rather then
God, to be at <hi>enmity with the world,</hi> that you may preserve friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
with God, to denie the importunity and troublesome kindnesse
of a drinking friend, to own truth in despite of danger or scorn, to
despise shame; to refuse worldly pleasure when they tempt your
soul, beyond duty or safety; to take pains in the cause of religion,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:53465:65"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
               <hi>the labour of love</hi> and the crossing of your anger, peevishnesse and
morosity; these are the daily sufferings of a Christian; and if we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
them well, wil have the same reward and an equal smart and
greater labour then the plain suffering the hangmans sword. This
I have discoursed, to represent unto you, that you cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
from the similitude of Christs sufferings; that God will shut
no age nor no man from his portion of the crosse; that we cannot
fail of the result of this predestination, nor without our own fault
be excluded from the covenant of sufferings: <hi>judgement must begin
at Gods house,</hi> and enters first upon the sons and heirs of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and if it be not by the direct persecution of Tyrants, it will
be by the persecution of the devil, or infirmities of our own flesh:
But because this was but the secondary meaning of the text, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to make use of all the former discourse.</p>
            <p>1. Let no Christian man make any judgement concerning his
condition, or his cause by the external event of things: for although
in the law of Moses, God made with his people a covenant of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
prosperity, and <hi>his Saints did binde the kings</hi> of the Am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rites,
and the Philistines <hi>in chains, and their nobles with links of iron,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and then, <hi>that was the honour which all his Saints had;</hi> yet in <hi>Christ
Jesus</hi> he made a covenant of sufferings: most of the graces of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
are suffering graces, and God hath predestinated us to suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:
and we are baptised into suffering, and our very communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are symbols of our duty, by being the sacrament of Christs death
and passion; and Christ foretold to us tribulation, and promised
onely that he would be with us in tribulation, that he would
give us his spirit to assist us at tribunals, and his grace to despise
the world, and to contemn riches, and boldnesse to confesse every
article of the Christian faith, in the face of armies and armed ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and he also promised that <hi>all things should work together for
the best to his servants,</hi> that is, he would <hi>out of the eater bring meat,
and out of the strong issue sweetnesse,</hi> and crowns and scepters should
spring from crosses, and that the crosse it self should stand upon the
globes and scepters of Princes; but he nev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r promised to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
that they should pursue Kings and destroy armies, that they
should reign over the nations, and promote the cause of Jesus Christ
by breaking his commandments: <hi>The shield of faith</hi> and <hi>the sword
of the spirit, the armour of righteousnesse,</hi> and <hi>the weapons of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
warfare,</hi> these are they by which christianity swelled from a
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> small company, and a lesse reputation, to possesse the chaires of
Doctors, and the thrones of princes, and the hearts of all men.
But men in all ages will be tampering with shadows and toyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The
Apostles at no hand could endure to hear that <hi>Christs kingdom was
not of this world,</hi> and that their Master should die a sad and shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
death; though that way he was to receive his crown, and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into glory:</hi> and after Christs time, when his Disciples had taken
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:53465:66"/>
up the crosse and were marching the Kings high way of sorrows,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
there were a very great many, even the generality of Christians,
for two or three ages together, who fell on dreaming that
Christ should come and reign upon earth again, for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
years, and then the Saints should reigne in all abundance of
temporal power and fortunes: but these men were content to stay
for it, till after the resurrection; in the mean time took up their
crosse and followed after their Lord, the <hi>King of sufferings:</hi> But
now a dayes we finde a generation of men, who have changed the
covenant of sufferings into victories, and triumphs, riches and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous
chances, and reckon their Christianity by their good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
as if Christ had promised to his servants no heaven hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
no spirit in the mean time to refresh their sorrows; as if he
had enjoyned them no passive graces; but as if to be a Christian
and to be a Turk were the same thing, Mahomet entered and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
by the sword: Christ came by the crosse, entered by humility,
and his saints <hi>possesse their souls by patience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God was fain to multiply miracles to make Christ capable of
being a man of sorrows<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and shall we think he will work miracles
to make us delicate? He promised us a glorious portion hereafter,
to which if all the sufferings of the world were put together, they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
               <hi>are not worthy to be compared,</hi> and shall we with Dives choose
our portion of <hi>good things in this life?</hi> If Christ suffered so many
things onely that he might give us glory, shall it be strange that we
shall suffer who are to receive this glory? It is in vain to think
we shall obtain glories at an easier rate, then to <hi>drink of the brook in
the way</hi> in which Christ was drenched. When the Devil appeared
to Saint Martin in a bright splendid shape and said he was Christ, he
answered, <hi>Christus non nisi in cruce apparet suis in hac vita.</hi> And
when Saint Ignatius was newly tied in a chain to be led to his martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
he cryed out, <hi>nunc incipio esse Christianus:</hi> And it was obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
by Minutius Felix, and was indeed a great and excellent truth,
<hi>omnes viri fortes quos Gentiles praedicabant, in exemplum, aerumnis su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is
inclytistoruerunt.</hi> The Gentiles in their whole religion never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
any man imitable, unlesse the man were poor or persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
Brutus stood for his countries liberty, but lost his army and
his life; Socrates was put to death for speaking a religious truth: Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
chose to be on the right side, but happened to fall upon the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
and the injured; he died together with his party.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Victrix causa Deis placuit sed victa Catoni;</hi> And if God thus dealt
with the best of Heathens to whom he had made no cleare revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
of immortal recompences, how little is the faith and how much
lesse is the patience of Christians if they shall think much to suffer
sorrows since they so clearly see with the eye of faith the great
things which are laid up for them that are <hi>faithful unto the death.</hi>
Faith is uselesse, if now in the midst of so great pretended lights we
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53465:66"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> shall not dare to trust God unlesse we have all in hand that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire;
and suffer nothing, for all we can hope for. They that live by
sense have no use of faith, yet our Lord Jesus concerning whose
passions, the gospel speaks much, but little of his glorifications,
whose shame was publick, whose pains were notorious, but his joyes
and transfigurations were secret and kept private, he who would not
suffer his holy mother, whom in great degrees he exempted
from sin, to be exempted from many and great sorrows, certainly
intends to admit none to his resurrection, but by the doors of his
grave, none to glory but by the way of the crosse. <hi>If we be plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
               <hi>into the likenesse of his death, we shall be also of his resurrection,</hi>
else on no termes; Christ took away sin from us, but he left us our
share of sufferings; and the crosse which was first printed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us in the waters of baptisme, must for ever be born by
us in penance, in mortification, in self-denial and in martyrdom,
and toleration according as God shall require of us by the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the world, and the condition of the Church.</p>
            <p>For Christ considers nothing, but souls, he values not
their estate or bodies, supplying our want by his providence,
and being secured that our bodies may be killed, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> perish so long as we preserve our duty and our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences.
Christ our Captain hangs naked upon the crosse,
our fellow souldiers are cast into prison; torne with Lions,
rent in sunder with trees returning from their violent bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
broken upon wheels, rosted upon gridirons, and
have had the honour not onely to have a good cause, but
also to suffer for it, and by faith not by armies, by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
not by fighting, have overcome the world; <hi>&amp; sit
anima mea cum Christianis,</hi> I pray God my soul may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Christians; and yet the Turks have prevailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> a great part of the Christian world, and have made them
slaves, and tributaries, and do them all spite, and are hugely
prosperous; but when Christians are so, then they are
tempted and put in danger, and never have their duty
and their interest so well secured, as when they lose all for
Christ and are adorned with wounds, or poverty, change
or scorn, affronts or revilings which are the obelisks and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
of a holy cause. Evil men and evil causes had need have
good fortune and great successe to support their persons and their
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> pretences; for nothing but innocence and Christianity can flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
in a persecution. I summe up this first discourse in a word:
in all the Scripture, and in all the Authentick stories of the
Church we finde it often, that the Devil appeared in the
shape of an Angell of light, but was never suffered so much
as to conterfeit a persecuted sufferer; say no more therefore
as the murmuring Israelites said; <hi>If the LORD be with us why
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53465:67"/>
have these evils apprehended us?</hi> for if to be afflicted be a signe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
that God hath forsaken a man, and refuses to own his religion, or
his question, then he that <hi>oppresses the widow, and murders the
innocent, and puts the fatherlesse to death,</hi> and <hi>follows providence</hi>
by doing all the evils that he can, that is, all that God suffers him,
he I say is the onely Saint and servant of God: and upon the
same ground the <hi>wolf</hi> and the <hi>fox</hi> may boast when they scatter and
devour a flock of lambs and harmlesse sheep.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>

               <hi>IT follows now that we inquire concerning the reasons of the
Divine Providence, in this administration of affairs, so far as
he hath been pleased to draw aside the curtain, and to unfold
the leaves of his counsels and predestination: and for such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
we have the precedent of the Prophet Jeremy:</hi> Righteous
art thou O Lord,<note place="margin">Jerem. 12. 1, 2.</note> when I plead with thee, yet let us talk to thee of thy
judgements: wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are all they happy that deal very treacherously? Thou hast planted
them, yea they have taken root: they grow, yea they bring forth fruit
<hi>Concerning which, in generall the Prophet Malachy gives this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> after the same complaint made.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mala. 3. 14.</note> And now we call the proud
happy, and they that work wickednesse are set up, yea they that tempt
God are even delivered. They that feared the Lord spake often one
to another, and the Lord hearkened and heard, and a book of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
was written before time for them that feared the Lord, and
thought upon his Name, and they shall be mine (saith the Lord of
Hosts) in that day when I binde up my jewels, and I will spare them
as a man spareth his own son that serveth him: Then shall ye return
and discern betwen the righteous, and the wicked, between him that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
God, and him that serveth him not. <hi>In this interval which is</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
               <hi>a valley of tears, it is no wonder if they rejoyce, who shall weep

when God gathers all the mourners into his kingdom,</hi> they
shall reape with joy.</p>
            <p>For innocence and joy were appointed to dwel together for ever.
And joy went not first but when innocence went away, sorrow and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53465:68"/>
sicknesse dispossessed joy of its habitation; and now this world <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
must be alwayes a scene of sorrows, and no joy can grow here but
that which is imaginary and phantastick: there is no worldly joy, no
joy proper for this world, but that which wicked persons fancy to
themselves, in the hopes and designes of iniquity: He that covets his
neighbours wife or land, dreams of fine things, and thinks it a fair
condition to be rich and cursed, to be a beast and die, or to lie
wallowing in his filthinesse: but those holy souls who are not in
love with the leprosie &amp; the Itch for the pleasure of scratching, they
know no pleasure can grow from the thorns which <hi>Adam</hi> planted in
the hedges of <hi>Paradise;</hi> and that sorrow which was brought in by sin,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
must not go away till it hath returned us into the first condition of
innocence: the same instant that quits us from sin, and the failings of
mortality, the same instant wipes all tears from our eyes; but that
is not in this world; In the mean time.</p>
            <p>God afflicts the godly that he might manifest many of

1. Bringing good out of evil: 2. Of being <hi>with us in tribulation,</hi>
3. Of sustaining our infirmities, 4 Of triumphing over the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of his enemies: 5. Without the suffering of Saints, where were
the exaltation of the crosse, the conformity of the members to
Christ their Head, the coronets of Martyrs? 6. Where were the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               <hi>trial of our faith?</hi> 7. Or the exercise of long suffering? 8. Where
were the opportunities, to give God the greatest love? which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be but by dying and suffering for him? 9. How should that
which the world calls folly prove the greatest wisdom: 10. and
God be glorified by events contrary to the probability and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of their causes: By the suffering of Saints, Christian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is proved to be most excellent whilst the iniquity and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the adversaries proves the <hi>illecebra sectae</hi> as Tertullians phrase
is, it invites men to consider the secret excellencies of that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
               <hi>for which</hi> and <hi>in which</hi> men are so willing to die: for that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
must needs be worth looking into, which so many wise
and excellent men do so much value above their lives and fortunes;
12. That a mans nature is passible, is its best advantage: for by it
we are all redeemed: by the passivenesse and sufferings of our Lord
and brother we were all rescued from the portion of Devils; and
by our suffering we have a capacity of serving God beyond that

and obey him with a more unabated will, and execute his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
with a swifter wing, and a greater power; but they cannot
die for God; they can lose no lands for him; and he that did so for
all us, and commanded us to do so for him, <hi>is ascended farre above
all Angels,</hi> and is Heir of a greater glory. 13. <hi>Do this, and live,</hi>
was the covenant of the Law; but in the Gospel it is, <hi>suffer this,
and live: He that forsaketh house and land, friends and life, for my
sake is my disciple.</hi> 14. By the sufferings of Saints God chastises
their follies and levities, and suffers not their errours to climbe up
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> into heresies, nor their infirmities into crimes.</p>

            <p>Alteration makes a fool leave his folly. If David numbers the

            <p>And in giving physick we alwayes call that just, and sitting that

               </gap>urfet:
Punishments can no other way turn into a mercy, but when they
are designed for medicine; and God is then very carefull of thy
soul, when he will suppresse every of its evils, when it first discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
the order of things, and spirits. And what hurt is it to thee
if a persecution draws thee from the vanities of a former prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and forces thee into the sobrieties of a holy life? What losse
is it, what misery? Is not the least sin a greater evil then the great
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> est of sufferings? God smites some at the beginning of their sin:
Others not till a long while after it is done. The first cannot say,
that God is slack in punishing; and have no need to complain that
the wicked are prosperous; for they finde that God is apt enough
to strike; and therefore that he strikes them, and strikes not the
other, is not de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ct of justice, but because there is not mercy in
store, for them that sin and suffer not: 15. For if God strikes the
godly that they may repent, it is no wonder that God is so good to
his servants; but then we must not call that a misery, which God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to make an instrument of saving them. And if God forbears
to strike the wicked out of anger, and because he hath decreed
death and hell against them, we have no reason to envy that they
ride in a gilded chariot to the gallows: But if God forbears the
wicked, that by his long sufferance they may be invited to repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
then we may cease to wonder at the dispensation, and argue
comforts to the afflicted Saints, thus; 1. For if God be so gracious
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53465:69"/>
to the wicked, how much more is he to the godly? And if sparing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
the wicked be a mercy, then smiting the godly being the expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of his greater kindnesse; affliction is of it self the more eligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
condition. If God hath some degrees of kindnesse for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutor,
so much as to invite them by kindnesse, how much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is his love to them that are persecuted? and therefore his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse
with them is also a greater favour: and indeed it is the
surer way of securing the duty; fair means may do it, but severity
will fix and secure it: fair means are more apt to be abused then
harsh physick; that may be turned into wantonnesse, but none but
the impudent and grown sinners, despise all Gods judgements; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
and therefore God chooses this way to deal with his erring ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
that they may obtain an infallible and a great salvation:
and yet if God spares not his children, how much lesse the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates?
and therefore as the sparing the latter, commonly is a
sad curse, so the smiting the former is a very great mercy. 16 For
by this Oeconomy God gives us a great argument to prove the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
since to his saints and servants he assignes sorrow for
their present portion. Sorrow cannot be the reward of vertue,
it may be its instrument, and hand-maid, but not its reward; and
therefore it may be intermedial to some great purposes, but they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
must look for their portion in the other life: <hi>For if in this life
onely we had hope, then we were of all men the most miserable.</hi> It is
Sain Pauls argument to prove a beatificall resurrection: And we
therefore may learn to estimate, the state of the afflicted godly to
be a mercy great, in proportion to the greatnesse of that reward,
which these afflictions come to secure and to prove.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Nunc &amp; damna juvant, sunt ipsa pericula tanti,</l>

               </l>
            </q>
            <p>It is a great matter, an infinite blessing to escape the pains of hell;
and therefore that condition is also very blessed which God sends
us to create and to confirm our hopes of that excellent mercy.
17. The sufferings of the saints are the sum of Christian Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy;
they are sent to wean us from the van<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of this world, and to create in us strong desires of heaven, whiles
God causes us to be here treated rudely, that we may long to be

his Church by sufferings. 19 He hath given a single blessing to

a double one.<note place="margin">Matth. 5. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

like Christ, and then to be afflicted like him. 20. Without this,
the miracles of patience, which God hath given to fortifie the spirits
of the saints would signifie nothing. <hi>Nemo enim tolerare tanta</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
               <hi>velit sine causâ, nec potuit sine Deo,</hi> as no man would bear evils
without a cause, so no man could bear so much without the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
hand of God; and we need not the Holy Ghost to so great
purposes, if our lot were not sorrow and persecution; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
without this condition of suffering, the Spirit of God should
lose that glorious attribute of <hi>The Holy Ghost the Comforter.</hi> 21. Is
there any thing more yet? Yes They that have suffered or forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
any lands for Christ, <hi>shall sit upon thrones and judge the twelve

               <hi>judge Angels,</hi> (saith saint Paul) well therefore might Saint Paul say,
<hi>I rejoyce exceedingly in tribulation.</hi> It must be some great thing
that must make an afflicted man to rejoyce exceedingly; and so it
was. For since <hi>patience is necessary that we receive the promise,</hi> and
tribulation does work this: <hi>For a short time it worketh the consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of our hope, even an exceeding weight of glory.</hi> We have no
reason to <hi>think it strange concerning the fiery triall, as if it were
a strange thing.</hi> It can be no hurt; the Church is like Moses bush,
when it is all on sire, it is not at all consumed, but made full of
miracle, full of splendour, full of God: and unlesse we can finde
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> something that God cannot turn into joy, we have reason not
onely to be patient, but rejoyce, when we are persecuted in a
righteous cause: For <hi>love is the soul of Christianity, and suffering
is the soul of love.</hi> To be innocent, and to be persecuted, are the
body and soul of Christianity. <hi>I John your brother, and partaker
of tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus,</hi> said Saint
John: those were the titles and ornaments of his profession; that
is, <hi>I John your fellow Christian;</hi> thats the plain song of the former
descant. He therefore that is troubled, when he is afflicted in his
outward man, that his inward man may grow strong, like the birds
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> upon the ruines of the shell, and wonders that a good man should
be a begger, and a sinner be rich with oppression, that Lazarus
should die at the gate of Dives, hungry and sick, unpitied, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relieved,
may as well wonder, that carrion crowes should feed
themselves fat upon a fair horse, farre better then himself; or that
his own excellent body should be devoured by wormes, and the
most contemptible creatures, though it lies there to be converted
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53465:70"/>
into glory; That man knows nothing of <hi>nature,</hi> or <hi>providence,</hi>

or <hi>Christianity,</hi> or <hi>the rewards of vertue,</hi> or <hi>the nature of its consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</hi>

<hi>the glorifications of Christs exalted humanity,</hi> or <hi>the precepts of the
Gospel,</hi> who is offended at the sufferings of Gods deerest servants, or
declines the honour and the mercy of sufferings in the cause of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse;
For <hi>the securing of a vertue,</hi> for <hi>the imitation of Christ,</hi>
and <hi>for the love of God,</hi> or <hi>the glories of immortality.</hi> It cannot,
it ought not, it never will be otherwise, the world may as well
cease to be measured by time, as good men to suffer affliction.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
I end this point with the words of Saint Paul,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Let as many as are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
be thus minded, and if any man be otherwise minded, God also
will reveal this unto you,</hi> this, of the covenant of sufferings, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which the old Prophets, and holy men of the Temple had
many thoughts of heart; but in the full sufferings of the Gospel,
there hath been a full revelation of the excellency of the sufferings.
I have now given you an account of some of those reasons, why
God hath so disposed it, that at this time, that is, under the period
of the Gospel, judgement must begin at the house of God, and
they are either, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or imitation of Christs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, chastisements, or trials, martyrdom, or a conformity to the
sufferings of the Holy Jesus.</p>
            <p>But now besides all the premises, we have another account to
make concerning the prosperity of the wicked: <hi>For if judgment
first begin at us? what shall the end be of them that obey not the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
of God?</hi> that is the question of the Apostle, and is the great
instrument of comfort to persons ill treated in the actions of the
world. The first ages of the Church lived upon <hi>promises,</hi> and
<hi>prophecies;</hi> and because some of them are already fulfilled for ever,
and the others are of a continuall and a successive nature, and are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
verified by the actions of every day: Therefore we and all the
following Ages live upon <hi>promises</hi> and <hi>experience:</hi> and although
the servants of God have suffered many calamities, from the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
and prevalency of evil men their enemies, yet still it is
preserved as one of the fundamentall truths of Christianity; That
all the fair fortunes of the wicked are not enough to make them
happy, nor the persecutions of the godly, able to make a good
man miserable; nor yet their sadnesses arguments of Gods displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
against them. For when a godly man is afflicted and dies, it
is his work and his businesse; and if the wicked prevail, that is,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
if they persecute the godly, it is but that which was to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
from them: For who are fit to be hangmen, and executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of publike wrath but evil and ungodly persons? And can it
be a wonder that they whose cause wants reason, should betake
themselves to the sword? that what he cannot perswade he may
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53465:70"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> wrest? onely we must not judge of the things of God by the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of men, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the things of men have this world for
their stage, and their reward, but <hi>the things of God</hi> relate to <hi>the
world to come:</hi> and for our own particulars we are to be guided by
rule, and by <hi>the end of all,</hi> not by events intermedial, which are varied
by a thousand irregular causes. For if all the evil men in the
world were unprosperous (as most certainly they are) and if all
good persons were temporally blessed (as most certainly they are
not) yet this would not move us to become vertuous: <hi>If an angel
should come from heaven,</hi> or <hi>one arise from the dead</hi> and preach re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> or justice, and temperance, all this would be ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
to those to whom the plain doctrines of God, delivered in the
Law and the Prophets will not suffice.</p>
            <p>For why should God work a signe to make us to beleeve that
we ought to do justice; if we already beleeve, he hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it, no man can need a miracle for the confirmation of that which
he already beleeves to be the command of God: And when God
hath expressely bidden us to <hi>obey every ordinance of man for the Lords
sake, the King as supreme, and his deputies as sent by him:</hi> It is a
strange infidelity to think, that a rebellion against the ordinance of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> God, can be sanctified by successe and prevalency, of them that
destroy <hi>the authority,</hi> and <hi>the person,</hi> and <hi>the law,</hi> and <hi>the religion:</hi>
The sin cannot grow to its height if it be crushed at the beginning;
unlesse it prosper in its progresse, a man cannot easily fill up the
measure of his iniquity: but then that the sin swels to its fulnesse
by prosperity, and grows too big to be suppressed without a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,
it is so far from excusing, or lessening the sin, that nothing
doth so nurse the sin as it: It is not vertue, because it is prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
but if it had not been prosperous, the sin could never be
so great.</p>

            <q>Jusque datum sceleri—</q>
            <p>But thats not innocence, and if prosperity were the voice of
God to approve an action, then no man were vitious, but he that

a little vessell, and no man could be a Tyrant but he that is no
prince, and no man an unjust invader of his neighbours rights, but
he that is beaten and overthrown. Then the crime grows big and
loud, then it calls to Heaven for vengeance, when it hath been long
a growing, when it hath thrived under the Devils managing; when
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53465:71"/>
God hath long suffered it, and with patience in vain expecting the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
repentance of a sinner: he that treasures up wrath against the day
of wrath, that man hath been a prosperous that is an unpunished
and a thriving sinner: but then it is the <hi>sin</hi> that thrives <hi>not the man:</hi>
and that is the mistake upon this whole question: for the sin cannot
thrive, unlesse the man goes on without apparent punishment, and
restraint. And all that the man gets by it is, that by a continual
course of sin, he is prepared for an intollerable ruine. The Spirit of
God bids us look upon <hi>the end of these men;</hi> not the way they
walk or the instrument of that pompous death. When Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas

observed S. Augustine die with grief that very night, would have
perceived his calamity more visible then the reward of his piety
and holy religion. When Lewis firnamed <hi>Pius</hi> went his voyage to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
Palestine upon a holy end, and for the glory of God to fight against
the Saracens and Turks, and Mamalukes, the world did promise to
themselves that a good cause should thrive in the hands of so holy
a man: but the event was far otherwise; his brother Robert was
killed, and his army destroyed, and himself taken prisoner, and
the money which by his Mother was sent for his redemption was
cast away in a storm, and he was exchanged for the last town the
Christians had in Egypt, and brought home the crosse of Christ
upon his shoulder in a real pressure and participation of his Masters
sufferings. When Charles the fifth went to Algier to suppresse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
pirates and unchristned villains, the cause was more confident then
the event was prosperous: and when he was almost ruined in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
storme, he told the minutes of the clock, expecting that at
midnight, when religious persons rose to Mattins, he should be eased
by the benefit of their prayers: but the providence of God trod
upon those waters, and left no footstoops for discovery: his navie
was beat in pieces, and his designe ended in dishonour, and his life
almost lost by the bargain. Was ever cause more baffled then the

and lingring judgement, and, a wrath breaking out in the next
age, is like an universal proposion, teaching our posterity, that
God was angry all the while, that he had a long indignation in
his brest, that he would not forget to take veangeance: and it is a
demonstration, that even the prosperous sins of the present age,
will finde the same period in the Divine revenge when men see a

dayes, some great men pulled dovvn Churches and built palaces, and
robd religion of its just incouragements, and advantages; the
men that did it were sacrilegious; and we finde also that God hath
been punishing that great sin, ever since; and hath displaied to so
many generations of men, to three or four descents of children,
that those men could not be esteemed happy in their great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
against whom God was so angry, that he would show his
displeasure for a hundred years together. When Herod had killed
the babes of Bethlehem, it was seven years before God called him
to an account. But he that looks upon the end of that man, would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
rather choose the fat of the oppressed babes, then of the prevailing
and triumphing Tyrant: It was fourty years before God punished
the Jews, for the execrable murder committed upon the person
of their King, <hi>the holy Jesus;</hi> and it was so long, that when it did
happen, many men attributed it to their killing S. James their Bishop
and seemed to forget the greater crime, but <hi>non eventu rerum sed
fide verborum stamus:</hi> we are to stand to the truth of Gods word
not to the event of things. Because God hath given us a rule but
hath left the judgement to himself; and we die so quickly, (and
God measures althings by his standard of eternity, and 1000 years <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
to God is but as one day) that we are not competent persons to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure

            <p>But if we should look under the skirt of the prosperous and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> such allayes and abatements of his pleasure, as may serve to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

seen a young and healthful person warm and ruddy under a poor
and a thin garment, when at the same time, an old rich person hath
been cold, and paralytick, under a load of sables and the skins of
foxes; it is the body that makes the clothes warm, not the clothes
the body: and the spirit of a man makes felicity and content, not any
spoils of a rich fortune wrapt about a sickly and an uneasie soul. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollodorus
was a Traitor, and a Tyrant, and the world wondered
to see a bad man have so good a fortune; But knew not that he
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> nourished Scorpions in his brest, and that his liver and his heart
were eaten up with Spectres and images of death; his thoughts
were full of interruptions, his dreams of illusions, his fancie was
abused with real troubles, and phantastick images, imagining that
he saw the Scythians flaying him alive, his daughters like pillars of
fire dancing round about a cauldron in which himself was boyling,
and that his heart accused it self to be the cause of all these evils:
And although all tyrants have not imaginative and phantastick
consciences, yet all tyrants shall die and <hi>come to judgement;</hi> and
such a man is not to be feared, nor at all to be envied: and in the

who is already designed for hell, he whom God hates and
the people curse, and who hath an evil name, and against whom all
good men pray, and many desire to fight, and all wish him destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and some contrive to do it? is this man a blessed man? Is that
man prosperous who hath stolen a rich robe, &amp; is in fear to have his
throat cut for it, and is fain to defend it with the greatest difficulty

            <p>A Christian so long as he preserves his integrity to God and to

loose all the ill, that they can have, if we do not set an

riches take their wealth, and death sharpens his arrows at our

gather into his repository, all praying for ease and deliverances,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> for <hi>Halcyon dayes</hi> and fine sunshine, for <hi>nursing fathers and nursing

And it was 3 hundred years before God would hear their prayers:
and all that while the persecuted people were in a cloud, but they
were safe and knew it not: and God kept for them the best wine
untill the last; they ventured for a crown and fought valiantly, they

in the dayes of suffering were frequent and popular. And after all
our fears of sequestration and poverty, of death or banishment,
our prayers against the persecution, and troubles under it, we may
please to remember that twenty years hence (it may be sooner, it

from dishonour. As long as they belong to God, it is necessary
that they suffer persecution, or sorrow, no rules can teach them
to avoid that; but <hi>the evil</hi> of the suffering, and the <hi>danger,</hi> must
be declined, and we must use such spirituall arts as are apt to turn
them into health and medicine: For it were a hard thing, first to
be scourged, and then to be crucified; to suffer here, and to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> hereafter; through the fiery triall, and purging fire of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to passe into hell: that, is intollerable; and to be prevented
with the following cautions, least a man suffers like a fool, and a
malefactour, or inherits damnation for the reward of his impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
suffering.</p>
            <p>1. They that suffer any thing for Christ, and are ready to die
for him, let them do nothing against him. For certainly they
think too highly of martyrdom, who beleeve it able to excuse all
the evils of a wicked life. A man may give his body to be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and yet have no charity; and he that dies without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>harity,
dies without God, <hi>for God is love:</hi> And when those who fought
in the dayes of the Maccabees, for the defence of true Religion,
and were killed in <hi>those holy warres,</hi> yet being dead, were found
having about their necks, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or pendants, consecrated to
idols of the <hi>Jamnenses,</hi> it much allayed the hope, which by their
dying in so good a cause was entertained concerning their beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficall
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53465:75"/>
resurrection. He that overcomes his fear of death does well; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
but if he hath not also overcome his lust, or his anger, his <hi>baptisme
of blood</hi> will not wash him clean. Many things may make a man
willing to die in a good cause: Publike reputation, hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
gallantry of spirit, a confident resolution, and a mascu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
courage; or a man may be vexed into a stubborn and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relenting
suffering: But nothing can make a man live well, but the
grace and the love of God. But those persons are infinitely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by their last act, who professe their religion to be worth
dying for, and yet are so unworthy, as not to live according to its
institution. It were a rare felicity, if every good cause could be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
mannaged by good men onely; but we have found that evil men
have spoiled a good cause, but never that a good cause made those
evil men good and holy. If the Governour of Samaria had cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Simon Magus for receiving Christian Baptisme, he had no
more died a martyr, then he lived a saint. For dying is not enough,
and dying in a good cause is not enough, but then onely we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the crown of martyrdom, when our death is the seal of our
life, and our life is a continuall testimony of our duty, and both
give testimony to the excellencies of the religion, and glorifie the
grace of God. If a man be gold, the fire purges him, but it burns <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
him if he be like stubble, cheap, light, and uselesse: For martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is the consummation of love: But then it must be supposed,
that this grace must have had its beginning, and its severall stages,
and periods, and must have passed thorow <hi>labour</hi> to <hi>zeal,</hi> tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
all the regions of duty, to the perfections of sufferings; and
therefore it is a sad thing to observe, how some empty souls will
please themselves with being of such a religion, or such a cause, and
though they dishonour their religion, or weigh down the cause
with the prejudice of sin, beleeve all is swallowed up by one ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
name, or the appellative of one vertue: If God had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
nothing but heresie and treason, then to have been <hi>a loyall man,</hi>
or <hi>of a good beleef,</hi> had been enogh; but he that forbad rebellion,
forbids also swearing, and covetousnesse, rapine, and oppression,
lying, and cruelty: And it is a sad thing to see a man not onely to
spend his time, and his <hi>wealth and his money,</hi> and <hi>his friends</hi> upon
his lust, but to spend <hi>his sufferings</hi> too, to let the canker-worm
of a deadly sin, devour his Martyrdom: He therefore that suffers
in a good cause, let him be sure to walk worthy of that honour,
to which God hath called him; Let him first deny his sins, and then
deny himself, and then he may take up his crosse and follow Christ; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
ever remembring that no man pleases God in his death, who hath
walked perversely in his life.</p>
            <p>2. He that suffers in a cause of God, must be indifferent what
the instance be, so that he may serve God. I say, he must be indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
in the cause, so it be a cause of God, and indifferent in the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53465:75"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> suffering, so it be of Gods appointment. For some men have a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
aversation to some vices, or vertues, and a naturall affection
to others. One man will die for his friend, and another will die
for his money: Some men hate to be a rebell and will die for their
Prince; but tempt them to suffer for the cause of the Church, in
which they were baptized, and in whose communion they look for
heaven, and then they are tempted, and fall away. Or if God
hath chosen the cause for them, and they have accepted it, yet
themselves will choose the suffering. Right or wrong, some men
will not endure a prison; and some that can, yet choose the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viest
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> part of the burden, the pollution and stain of a sin, rather
then lose their money; and some had rather die twice then lose
their estates once. In this our rule is easie. Let us choose God, and
let God choose all the rest for us, it being indifferent to us, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by poverty or shame, by lingring or a sudden death, by the
hands of a Tyrant Prince, or the despised hands of a base usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
or a rebell, we receive the crown, and do honour to God and
to Religion.</p>
            <p>3. Whoever suffer in a cause of God, from the hands of cruell
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and unreasonable men, let them not be too forward to prognosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
evil and death to their enemies; but let them solace them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the assurance of the divine justice, by generall considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and in particular, pray for them that are our persecutours.
Nebuchadnezzar was the rod in the hand of God against the
Tyrians, and because he destroyed that city, God rewarded him
with the spoil of Egypt; and it is not alwayes certain, that God
will be angry with every man, by whose hand affliction comes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us. And sometimes two armies have met and fought, and the
wisest man amongst them could not say, that either of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> had prevaricated either the lawes of God, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or of Nations, and
yet it may be some superstitious, easie, and half witted people of
either side, wonder that their enemies live so long! And there
are very many cases of warre concerning which God hath declared
nothing: and although in such cases, he that yeelds and quits his
title rather then his charity, and the care of so many lives, is the
wisest and the best man; yet if neither of them will do so, let us
not decree judgements from heaven, in cases where we have no
word from heaven, and thunder from our Tribunals, where no
voice of God hath declared the sentence. But in such cases where
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> there is an evident tyranny or injustice, let us do like the good Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan,
who dressed the wounded man, but never pursued the
thief; let us do charity to the afflicted, and bear the crosse with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse,
and look up to Jesus, <hi>who endured the crosse, and despised
the shame;</hi> but let us not take upon us the office of God, who will
judge the Nations righteously, and when he hath delivered up our
bodies will rescue our souls from the hands of unrighteous judges.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:53465:76"/>
I remember in the story that Plutarch tels concerning the soul of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
Thespesius, that it met with a Prophetick Genius, who told him
many things that should happen afterwards in the world, and the
strangest of all was this, That there should be a King, <hi>Qui bonus
cum sit, tyrannide vitam finiet:</hi> An excellent Prince, and a good
man should be put to death by a rebell and usurping power; and
yet that Prophetick soul could not tell that those rebels should
within three yeers die miserable and accursed deaths; and in that
great prophecy recorded by Saint Paul,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 1.</note> 
               <hi>That in the last dayes pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous
times should come, and men should be traitours, and selvish,
having forms of godlinesse, and creeping into houses,]</hi> yet could <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
not tell us when these men should come to finall shame and ruine;
onely by a generall signification he gave this signe of comfort to
Gods persecuted servants,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 9.</note> 
               <hi>But they shall proceed no further, for their
folly shall be manifest to all men:</hi> that is, at long running they
shall shame themselves, and <hi>for the elects sake those dayes</hi> of evil
<hi>shall be shortned.</hi> But you and I may be dead first: And therefore
onely remember, that they that with a credulous heart, and a
loose tongue are too decretory, and enunciative of speedy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to their enemies, turn their religion into revenge, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
do beleeve it will be so, because they vehemently desire it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
should be so, which all wise and good men ought to suspect, as
lesse agreeing with that charity which overcomes all the sins, and
all the evils of the world, and sits down and rests in glory.</p>
            <p>4. Do not trouble your self by thinking how much you are
afflicted, but consider how much you make of it: For reflex acts
upon the suffering it self, can lead to nothing but to pride, or to
impatience to temptation, or apostacy. He that measures the grains
and scruples of his persecution, will soon sit down and call for
ease, or for a reward; will think the time long, or his burden
great; will be apt to complain of his condition, or set a greater <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
value upon his person. Look not back upon him that strikes thee,
but upward to God that supports thee, and forward to <hi>the crown
that is set before thee;</hi> and then consider, if the losse of thy estate
hath taught thee to despise the world? whether thy poor fortune
hath made thee poor in spirit? and if thy uneasie prison sets thy
soul at liberty, and knocks off the fetters of a worse captivity.
For then the rod of suffering turns into crowns and scepters, when
every suffering is a precept, and every change of condition produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
a holy resolution, and the state of sorrows makes the resolution
actuall, and habituall, permanent, and persevering. For as the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
silk-worm eateth it self out of a seed to become a little worm, and
there feeding on the leaves of mulberies, it grows till its coat be
off, and then works it self into a house of silk, then casting its
pearly seeds for the young to breed, it leaveth its silk for man, and
dieth all white and winged in the shape of a flying creature: So is
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53465:76"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the progresse of souls: when they are regenerate by Baptisme, and
have cast off their first stains and the skin of worldly vanities, by
feeding on the leaves of Scriptures, and the fruits of the vine, and
the joyes of the Sacrament, they incircle themselves in the rich gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of holy and vertuous habits; then by leaving their blood,
which is the Churches seed, to raise up a new generation to God,
they leave a blessed memory, and fair example, and are themselves
turned into Angels, whose felicity is to do the will of God, as their
imployments was in this world to suffer it; <hi>fiat voluntas tua</hi> is our
daily prayer, and that is of a passive signification; <hi>thy will be done</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> upon us: and if from thence also we translate it into an active
sence; and by suffering evils increase in our aptnesses to do well, we
have done the work of Christians, and shall receive the reward
of Martyrs.</p>
            <p>5. Let our suffering be entertained by a direct election, not by
collateral ayds and phantastick assistances. It is a good refreshment
to a weak spirit to suffer in good company: and so Phoeion encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
a timerous Greek condemned to die; and he bid him be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
because that he was to die with Phocion; and when 40. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs

confessors, and turnd them into consummate Martyrs. But if mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom
were but a phantastick thing, or relyed upon vain accidents
and irregular chances, it were then very necessary to be assisted by
images of things, and any thing, lesse then the proper instruments of
religion: But since it is the greatest action of the religion, and relies
upon the most excellent promises, and its formality is to be an
action of love, and nothing is more firmely chosen, (by an after e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>(at least) then) an act of love; to support Martyrdom, or
the duty of sufferings, by false arches and exteriour circumstances,
is to build a tower upon the beams of the Sun, or to set up a wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
ladder to climbe up to Heaven; the soul cannot attain so huge
and unimaginable felicities by chance and instruments of fancy:
and let no man hope to glorifie God and go to Heaven by a life of
sufferings, unlesse he first begin in the love of God, and from thence
derive his <hi>choice,</hi> his <hi>patience,</hi> and <hi>considence</hi> in the causes of vertue
and religion, like <hi>beams,</hi> and <hi>warmth,</hi> and <hi>influence,</hi> from the body
of the Sun. Some there are that fall under the burden, when they
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> are pressed hard, because they use not the proper instruments in
fortifying the will in <hi>patience</hi> and <hi>resignation,</hi> but endeavour to
lighten the burden in imagination; and when these temporary sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters
fail, the building that relies upon them, rushes into coldnesse,
recidivation, and lukewarmnesse: and among all instances, that of

            <p>Sometimes God destroyes their armies, or their strong holds,
Sometimes breakes their ships, but this happens either for the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of some of his servants, and their too great aptnesse to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
at a prosperous iniquity, or when he will not suffer the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
to grow too great, or for some end of his providence; and
yet if this should be very often, or last long, God knows the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and vve should feel the inconvenience. Of all the types of
Christ onely Joshuah and Solomon vvere noted to be generally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
and yet the fortune of the first was to be in perpetual vvar
and danger, but the other vvas as himself could vvish it, rich and
peaceful, and powerful, and healthful, and learned, and beloved,
and strong and amorous, and voluptuous, and so he fell, and though
his fall was, yet his recovery vvas not upon record.</p>
            <p>And yet the vvorst of evils that happen to the godly is better,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:53465:78"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> temporally better, then the greatest eternal felicity of the wicked:
that in all senses the question may be considerable and argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;
<hi>If the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly appear?</hi>
if it be hard with good men, with the evil it shall be far worse. But
see the difference. The godly man is timorous and yet safe, tossed
by the seas, and yet safe at anchor, impaired by evil accidents and
righted by divine comforts: made sad with a black cloud, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed
with a more gentle influence, abused by the world, and
yet an heir of heaven, hated by men, and beloved by God, loses
one house and gets an hundred, he quits a convenient lodging room
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and purchases a glorious countrey, is forsaken by his friends, but
never by a good conscience, he fares hardly and sleeps sweetly, he
flies from his enemies, but hath no distracting fears, he is full of
thought, but of no amazement; It is his businesse to be troubled, and
his portion to be comforted, he hath nothing to afflict him, but the
losse of that which might be his danger, but can never be his good,
and in the recompence of this, he hath God for his father, Christ
for his captain, the holy Ghost for his supporter so that he shall
have all the good which God can give him, and of all that good he
hath the holy Trinity for an earnest and a gage, for his mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> at the present, and his portion to all eternity. But though Paul
and Silas sing psalms in prison and under the hang-mans whips and
in an earth-quake, yet neither the Jaylor nor the persecuting Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
could do so: For the prosperitie of the wicked is like a
winters sun, or the joy of a condemned drunkard, it is a forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his present danger, and his future sorrows, nothing but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
arts of inadvertency: he sits in the gates of the city and
judges others, and is condemned himself; he is honoured by the
passers by, and is thought happy, but <hi>he sighs deeply; he heapeth up
riches and cannot tell who shall gather them;</hi> he commands an army
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and is himself a slave to his passions; he sleeps because he needs it,
and starts from his uneasie pillows which his thoughtful head hath
discomposed; when he is waking he dreames of greatnesse, when
he sleeps he dreams of spectars and illusions; he spoils a poor man of
his lamb, and himself of his innocence and peace, and in every unjust
purchase himself is the greatest loser.</p>

hewes a man down from a high fortune, to an even one, or

God to his servants; he rends their upper garments, and strips them

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> but the outward sense, and opinion of evil, not the reall substance:
But if we would take the measures of images, we must not take
the height of the base, but the proportion of the members, nor
yet measure the estates of men by their big looking supporter, or
the circumstance of an exteriour advantage, but by its proper com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensuration
in its self, as it stands in its order to eternity: And then
the godly man that suffers sorrow and persecution ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
by us, but needs not be pitied in the summe of affairs. But
since the two estates of the world are measured by time, and by
eternity, and divided by joy and sorrow, and no man shall have
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> his portions of joyes in both the durations; the state of those men
is insupportably miserable, who are fatted for slaughter, and are
crowned like beasts for sacrifice; who are feared and fear, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
enjoy their purchases but by communications with others,
and themselves have the least share, but themselves are alone in the
misery, and the saddest dangers, and they possesse the whole porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of sorrows: to whom their prosperity gives but occasions to evil
counsels, and strength to do mischief, or to nourish a serpent, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
a neighbour, or to nurse a lust, to increase folly, and treasure
up calamity: And did ever any man see, or story tell, that any ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant

Imperiall ensignes of power? They shine like a taper to all things
but it self, but we read of many Martyrs who kissed their chains,
and hugged their stakes, and saluted their hangman with great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearments,
and yet abating the incursions of their seldom sins, these
are their greatest evils; and such they are, with which a wise and a
good man may be in love: And till the sinners and ungodly men can
be so with their deep groans, and broken sleeps, with the wrath of
God, and their portions of eternity; till they can rejoyce in death,
and long for a resurrection, and with delight and a greedy hope can
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> think of the day of judgement, we must conclude that their glasse
gems, and finest pageantry, their splendid outsides, and great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers
of evil, cannot make amends for that estate of misery which
is their portion, with a certainty as great as is the truth of God, and
all the Articles of the Christian Creed. Miserable men are they who
cannot be blessed, unlesse there be no day of judgement; who
must perish unlesse the word of God should fail; If that be all their
hopes, then we may with a sad spirit and a soul of pity inquire into
the Question of the Text, <hi>Where shall the ungodly and sinner appear?</hi>
Even there where Gods face shall never shine, where there shall be

nothing but emanations of his goodnesse, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
in variety of circumstances. He made man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
with no other designe, then that man should
be happy, and by receiving derivations from
his fountain of mercy, might reflect glory to
him. And therefore God making man for his
own glory, made also a paradise for mans use, and did him good
to invite him to do himself a greater; for God gave forth demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:53465:81"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of his power by instances of mercy: and he who might
have made ten thousand worlds, of wonder and prodigy, and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
man with faculties able onely to stare upon, and admire those
miracles of mightinesse, did choose to instance his power in the
effusions of mercy, that at the same instant he might represent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
desireable and adorable, in all the capacities of amability;
that is, <hi>as excellent in himself, and profitable to us.</hi> For as the Sun sends
forth a benigne and gentle influence on the seed of Plants, that it
may invite forth the active and plastick power from its recesse and
secresie, that by rising into the tallnesse and dimensions of a tree, it
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> may still receive a greater and more refreshing influence from
its foster-father, the prince of all the bodies of light; and in all
these emanations, the Sun its self receives no advantage, but the
honour of doing benefits; so doth the Almighty Father of all the
creatures: He at first sends forth his blessings upon us, that we by
using them aright, should make our selves capable of greater;
while the giving glory to God, and doing homage to him are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for his advantage, but onely for ours: our duties towards
him being like vapours ascending from the earth, not at all to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh
the region of the clouds, but to return back in a fruitfull and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> refreshing shower: And God created us, not that we can increase
his felicity, but that he might have a subject receptive of felicity
from him: thus he causes us to be born, that we may be capable
of his blessings; he causes us to be baptized, that we may have a
title to the glorious promises Evangelicall; he gives us his Son,
that we may be rescued from hell: and when we constraine him
to use harsh courses towards us, it is also in mercy: he smites us
to cure a disease, he sends us sicknesse to procure our health; and
as if God were all mercy, he his mercifull in his first designe, in all
his instruments, in the way, and in the end of the journey, and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> does not onely shew the riches of his goodnesse to them <hi>that do
well,</hi> but to all men that <hi>they may do well:</hi> he is good to make us
good; he does us benefits to make us happy: and if we by <hi>despising</hi>
such gracious rayes of light and heat, stop their progresse and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt
their designe, the losse is not Gods but ours,; we shall be
the miserable and accursed people: This is the sense and para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase
of my Text. <hi>Despisest thou the riches of his goodnesse, &amp;c.
Thou dost not know,</hi> that is, thou considerest not that it is for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
benefit that God does thee this; the goodnesse of God is not
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> a designe to serve his own ends upon thee, but thine upon him:
<hi>The goodnesse of God leadeth thee to repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here then is <hi>Gods method of curing man-kind,</hi>

First <hi>goodnesse,</hi> or inviting us to him by sugred words,
by the placid arguments of temporall favour, and the proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

our stubbornnesse, he forbears to punish, and when he does begin <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
to strike, takes his hand off, and gives us truce and respite. For so

               </gap>
still, a long putting off, and deferring his <hi>finall destroying anger,</hi>
by using all meanes to force us to repentance; and this especially,
by the way of judgements; these being the last reserves of the
Divine mercy, and how ever we esteem it, is the greatest instance
of the divine long sufferance that is in the world. After these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,
we may consider the end, the strand upon which these
land us, the purpose of this variety, of these laborious and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
arts, with which God so studies and contrives the happinesse and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
salvation of man; it is onely that man may be brought by these
meanes unto repentance, and by repentance may be brought to
eternall life: This is <hi>the treasure of the Divine goodnesse,</hi> the great
and admirable efflux of the eternal beneficence; the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>the riches of his goodnesse,</hi> which whosoever despises, despises him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and the great interest of his own felicity; he shall die in his
impenitence, and perish in his folly.</p>
            <p>1. The first great instrument, that God chooses to bring us to
him is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, profit, or benefit, and this must needs be first, for
those instruments whereby we have a being are so great mercies,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
that besides that they are such which give us the capacities of all
other mercies, they are the advances of us in the greatest instances
of promotion in the world: For from nothing to something is an
infinite space, and a man must have a measure of infinite passed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, Before he can perceive himself to be either happy or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable:
he is not able to give God thanks for one blessing, untill
he hath received many. But then God intends we should enter
upon his service at the beginning of our dayes, because even then
he is before-hand with us, and hath already given us great instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of his goodnesse: What a prodigy of favour is it to us, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
he hath passed by, so many formes of his creatures, and hath not
set us down in the rank of any of them, till we came to be <hi>paulò
minores angelis,</hi> a little lower then the angels: and yet from the
meanest of them God can perfect his own praise; The deeps and
the snows, the hail and the rain, the birds of the air, and the fishes
of the sea, they can and do glorifie God, and give him praise in
their capacity; and yet he gave them no speech, no reason, no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall
spirit, or capacity of eternall blessednesse; but he hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
us from them by the absolute issues of his predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and hath given us a lasting and eternall spirit, excellent organs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
of perception, and wonderfull instruments of expression, that we
may joyn in consort with the morning star, and bear a part in the
<hi>Chorus</hi> with the Angels of light, to sing <hi>Alleluiah</hi> to the great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of men and Angels.</p>
            <p>But was it not a huge chain of mercies that we were not stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53465:82"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> in the regions of our own naturall impurities, but were sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the breath of God, from perishing in the womb, where God
formed us <hi>in secreto terrae,</hi> told our bones, and kept the order of
nature, and the miracles of creation; and we lived upon that which
in the next minute after we were born would strangle us if it were
not removed: but then God took care of us, and his hands of
providence clothed us and fed us. But why do I reckon the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of production which in every minute of our being are alike
and continued, and are miracles in all senses but that they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and usuall? I onely desire you to remember, that God made
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> all the works of his hands to serve him; and indeed this mercy of
creating us such as we are, was not <hi>to lead us to repentance,</hi> but was
a designe of innocence: he intended we should serve him as the
Sun and the Moon do; as fire and water do: never to prevaricate
the laws he fixed to us, that we might have needed no repentance.
But since we did degenerate, and being by God made better and
more noble creatures then all the inhabitants of the air, the water
and the earth besides, we made our selves baser and more ignoble
then any: For no dog, crocodile, or swine was ever Gods enemy,
as we made our selves: yet then from thence forward, God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> his work of <hi>leading us to repentance,</hi> by the <hi>riches of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>
He causeth us to be born of Christian parents, under whom
we were taught the mysteriousnesse of its goodnesse and designes,
for the redemption of man: And by the designe of which reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<hi>repentance</hi> was taught to mankind, and an excellent law given
for distinction of good and evil; and this is a blessing which though
possibly we do not often put into our eucharisticall Letanies to give
God thanks for, yet if we sadly consider, what had become of us,
if we had been born under the dominion of a <hi>Turkish</hi> Lord, or in
<hi>America</hi> where no Christians do inhabite, where they worship the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Devil, where witches are their priests, their prophets, their phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,
and their Oracles, can we choose but apprehend a visible no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
necessity of perishing in those sins which we then should
not have understood by the glasse of a divine law, to have decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
nor by a revelation have been taught to repent of? But since
the best of men does in the midst of all the great advantages of
<hi>lawes,</hi> and <hi>examples,</hi> and <hi>promises,</hi> and <hi>threatnings</hi> do many things
he ought to be ashamed of, and needs to repent of, we can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the riches of the Divine goodnesse best, by considering that
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the very designe of our birth and education in the Christian religion
is, that we may recover of, and cure our follies by the antidote of
repentance, which is preached to us as a doctrine, and propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
as a favour, which was put into a law, and purchased for us by
a great expence, which God does not more command to us as a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
then he gives us a blessing; For now that we shall not perish
for our first follies, but be admitted to new conditions, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53465:83"/>
by second thoughts, to have our infirmities excused, and our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
sins forgiven, our habits lessened, and our malice cured after we
were wounded, and sick, and dead, and buried, and in the possession
of the Devil; this was such a blessing, so great riches of the Divine
goodnesse, that as it was taught to no religion but the Christian,
revealed by no law-giver but Christ, so it was a favour greater
then ever God gave to the Angels and Devils: for although God
was rich in the effusion of his goodnesse towards them, yet they
were not admitted to the condition of second thoughts; Christ ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
shed one drop of blood for them, <hi>his goodnesse did not lead them
to repentance:</hi> but to us it was that he made this largesse of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
goodnesse; to us, to whom he made himself a brother, and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
the paps of our mother; he paid the scores of our sin, and
shame, and death, onely that we might be admitted to repent, and
that this repentance might be effectuall to the great purposes of
felicity and salvation: And if we would consider this sadly, it
might make us better to understand our madnesse and folly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
to repent; That is, <hi>to be sorrowfull,</hi> and <hi>to leave all our sins,</hi>
and <hi>to make amends by a holy life.</hi> For that we might be admitted
and suffered to do so, God was fain to pour forth all the riches of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
his goodnesse: It cost our deerest Lord the price of his deerest
blood, many a thousand groans, millions of prayers and sighes,
and at this instant, he is praying for our repentance: nay he hath
prayed for our repentance these 1600. yeers incessantly, night and
day, and shall do so till doomes-day, <hi>[He sits at the right hand
of God making intercession for us.]</hi> And that we may know what
he prayes for, he hath sent us Embassadours to declare the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of all his designe, for Saint Paul saith, <hi>[We are Embassadours
for Christ, as though he did beseech you by us, we pray you in Christs
stead to be reconciled to God.]</hi> The purpose of our Embassy and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
Ministery, is a prosecution of the mercies of God, and the work
of Redemption, and the intercession and mediation of Christ: It
is the work of atonement and reconciliation that God designed, and
Christ died for, and still prayes for, and we preach for, and you
all must labour for.</p>
            <p>And therefore here consider, if it be not infinite impiety to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
the riches of such a goodnesse, which at so great a charge, with
such infinite labour, and deep mysterious arts, invites us to repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
that is, to such a thing which could not be granted to us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
Christ should die to purchase it; such a glorious favour, that is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
the issue of Christs prayers in heaven, and of all his labours, his sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,
and his sufferings on earth: if we refuse to repent now, we
do not so much refuse to do our own duty as to accept of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
it is the greatest and the dearest blessing that ever God gave
to Men, that they may repent, and therefore to deny it, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
it, is to refuse health, brought us by the skill and industry of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53465:83"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the Physitian; it is to refuse liberty indulged to us by our gracious
Lord; and certainly we had reason to take it very ill if at a great
expence we should purchase a pardon for a servant and he out of a
peevish pride or negligence shall refuse it; the scorne payes it
self, the folly is its own scourge and sets down in an inglorious
ruine.</p>
            <p>After the enumeration of these glories, these prodigies of mercies
&amp; loving kindnesses, of Christs dying for us, and interceding for us
and merely that we may repent, and be saved; I shall lesse need
to instance those other particularities wherby God continues, as by
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> so many arguments of kindnesse to sweeten our natures and
make them malleable to the precepts of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>obedience,</hi> the
twinne daughters of holy <hi>repentance;</hi> but the poorest person amongst
us, besides the blessing and graces already reckoned hath enough
about him, and the accidents of every day to shame him into
repentance. Does not God send his angels to keep thee in all thy
wayes? are not they ministring spirits sent forth to wait upon thee
as thy guard? art not thou kept from drowing, from fracture of
bones, from madnesse, from deformities, by the riches of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> goodnesse? Tell the joynts of thy body, dost thou want a fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger?
and if thou doest not understand how great a blessing that is,
do but remember how ill thou canst spare the use of it when thou
hast but a thorn in it? The very privative blessings, the blessings of
immunity, safeguard, and integrity, which we all enjoy deserve a
thanksgiving of a whole life. If God should send a cancer upon thy
face or a wolf into thy brest, he if should spread a crust of
leprosie upon thy skin, what wouldest thou give to be but as now
thou art? wouldest thou not repent of thy sins upon that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
which is the greater blessing to be kept from them, or to be
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> cured of them? and why therfore shall not this greater blessing
lead thee to repentance? why do we not so aptly promise repentance
when we are sick upon the condition to be made well, and yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
forget it when we are well? as if health never were a
blessing, but when we have it not; rather I fear the reason, is when
we are sick we promised to repent, because then we cannot sin the
sins of our former life; but in health our appetites return to their
capacity, and in all the way we despise <hi>the riches of the divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>
which preserves us from such evils which would be full of
horror and amazement if they should happen to us.</p>

And Hippocrates said, that although poor men use to murmur

in the other, he asked what those symbols ment, she answered my
purpose is with fire to burn Paradise, and with my water to quench
the flames of hell, that men may serve God without the incentives of
hope and fear, &amp; purely for the love of God. But this woman began
at the wrong end: the love of God is not produced in us after we have
contracted evil habits, til God with his fan in his hand hath through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
purged the floore, till he hath cast out all the devils and swept
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the house with the instrument of hope and fear and with the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieuments
and efficacy of mercies and judgements. But then since
God may truely say to us, as of old to his rebellious people. <hi>Am I
a dry tree to the house of Israel?</hi> that is, do I bring them no fruit, do
they <hi>serve me for nought,</hi> and he expects not our duty till first we

            <p>However that we may see the greatnesse of this treasure, of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
God seldom leaves us thus: for he sees [be it spoken to the
shame of our natures, and the dishonour of our manners] he
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> sees that his mercies do not allure us, do not make us thankful; but
(as the Roman said), <hi>felicitate corrumpimur,</hi> we become worse for
Gods mercy: and think it will be alwayes holiday, and are like
the Christal of Arabia hardned not by cold, but made crusty and
stubborn, by the warmth of the divine fire, by its refreshments and
mercies; therefore to demonstrate that God is good indeed, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
his mercise still to us; but in another instance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
to us in punishing us, that by such instruments we may be

God begins his cure by causticks, by incisions and instruments of
vexation, to try if the disease that will not yeild to the allectives of
cordials and perfumes, friction and baths, may be forced out
by deleteries, scarifications, and more salutary but least pleasing

God remembers mercy,</hi> yet we are under discipline, we are brought

and if like Moses rod it turnes us into serpents, and that we repent
not but grow more Devils, yet, then it turnes into a rod again and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:53465:85"/>
finishes up the smiting or the first designed affliction.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
            </p>
            <p>But I consider it first in general, the riches of the divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is manifest in beginning this new method of curing us, by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
and by a rod. And that you may not wonder that I expound
this <hi>forbearance</hi> to be an act of <hi>mercy punishing,</hi> I observe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that the word supposes the method changed, and it is a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
about judgements, and their manner of execution; it is also in
the nature of the thing, in the conjunction of circumstances and
the designes of God, a mercy when he threatens us or strike us into
repentance.</p>
            <p>We think that the way of blessings and prosperous accidents is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
the finer way of securing our duty, and that when our heads are
anointed, our cups crowned, and our tables full, the very caresses of
our spirits will best of all dance before the Ark, and sing perpetual
Anthemes to the honour of our <hi>Benefactor</hi> and <hi>Patron God;</hi> and we
are apt to dream that God will make his Saints raigne here as
kings in a millenary kingdom, and give them the riches and
fortunes of this world, that they may rule over men and sing
psalms to God for ever. But I remember what Xenophanes saies
of God.</p>

            <p>God is like to men neither in shape nor in counsel, he knowes

are competent and apt instruments of grace, if we would; but
because we are more dispersed in our spirits and by a prosperous
accident are melted into joy and garishness, and drawn off from
the sobriety of recollection. Jeshurun waxed fat and kicked. Many <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

the sun to a weak eye, glorious indeed in it self, but not proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned

not dwell one night in Paradise, but was poisoned with prosperity,

were obnoxious to the common suffering: but as soon as the one of

Saviour</hi> was pleased to make none at all, but to leave them invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in general comprehensions and to have a title to the special pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
onely by becomming <hi>poor in spirit,</hi> and in preparation of
minde, though not in fortune and possession. How ever; it is hard
for God to perswade us to this, till we are taught it by a sad experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that those prosperities which we think will make us serve God
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> cheerfully, make us to serve the world and secular ends diligently
and God not at all.</p>
            <p>Repentance is a duty that best complies with affliction, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> is a sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical
estate, of the same complexion and constitution; half the
work of repentance is done by a sad accident, our spirits are made
sad, our gayeties mortified, our wildnesse corrected, the water springs
are ready to run over: but if God should grant our desires, and give
to most men prosperity, with a designe to lead them to repentance,
all his pompe and all his employment, and all his affections and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and all his circumstances are so many degrees of distance
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> from the conditions and natures of repentance. It was reported by
Dio concerning Neros mother, that she often wished that her Son
might be Emperour, and wished it with so great passion that upon
that condition she cared not though her Son might kill her; Her
first wish and her second fear were both granted; but when she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to fear that her Son did really designe to murder her, she used
all the art and instruments of diversion that a witty and a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
a timerous person, and a woman could invent or apply. Just so
it is with us, so we might have our wishes of prosperity we promise to
undergo all the severities of repentance; but when we are landed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> our desire, then every degree of satisfaction of those sensuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
is a temptation against repentance: for a man must have his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
weaned from those possessions, before he can be reconciled
to the possibilities of repentance.</p>
            <p>And because God knowes this well and loves us better then we
do our selves, therefore he sends upon us the 1. scrolls of vengeance,
<hi>the hand writing upon the wall</hi> to denounce judgement against us: for
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:53465:86"/>
God is so highly resolved to bring us to repentance some way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
that if by his <hi>goodnesse</hi> he cannot shame us into it, he will try
if by his <hi>judgements</hi> he can scare us into it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not that he strikes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
as soon as he hath sent his warrants out, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>
said Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo.
Thus God sent Jonas and denounced judgements against Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh;
but with the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, with the forbearance of forty dayes for
the time of their escape if they would repent. When Noah the great
<hi>preacher of righteousnesse,</hi> denounced the flood to all the world,
it was with the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> with the forbearance of 120. years, and
when the great extermination of the Jewish nation, and their to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
deletion from being Gods people, was foretold by Christ, and
decreed by God, yet they had the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of forty years, in which
they were perpetually called to repentance. These were reprieves
and deferrings of the stroke. But sometimes God strikes once and
then forbeares, and such are all those sadnesses which are lesse then
death; every sicknesse, every losse, every disgrace, the death
of friends and neerest relatives, sudden discontents; these are all
of them the lowder calls of God to repentance; but still, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of forbearance.</p>
            <p>Indeed many times this forbearance makes men impudent, it was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
so in the case of Pharaoh when God smote him, and then forbore;
Pharaohs heart grew callous and insensible till God struck again;
and this was the meaning of these words of God, <hi>I will harden the
heart of pharaoh,</hi> that is, I wil forbear him, smite him, and then take
the blow off, <hi>Sic enim Deus induravit Pharaonis cor,</hi> said Saint Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil.
For as water taken off from fire will sooner congeale and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
icy, then if it had not been attenuated by the heate: so is
the heart of some men, when smitten by God, it seemes soft and
plyable, but taken off from the fire of affliction, it presently becomes
horrid, then stiff and then hard as a rock of Adamant, or as the gates <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
of death and hell. But this is besides the purpose and intention of
the Divine mercy; this is an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a plain contradiction to
<hi>the riches of Gods goodnesse;</hi> this is to be <hi>evill because God is good;</hi>
to burn with flames, because we are coold with water; this is to
put out the lamps of heaven, or (if we cannot do it) to put our own
eyes out, least we should <hi>behold the fair beauty of the Lord,</hi> and be
enamoured of his goodnesse, and repent and live. O take heed of
despising this goodnesse; for this is one of Gods latest arts to
save us; he hath no way left beyond this, but to punish us with a
lasting judgement and a poinant affliction. In the tomb of Teren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
certain lamps burned under ground many ages together, but as
soon as ever they were brought into the aire and saw a bigger
light, they went out, never to be reenkindled: so long as we are
in the retirements of sorrow, of want, of fear, of sicknesse or of any
sad accident we are <hi>burning and shining lamps,</hi> but when God
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:53465:86"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> comes with his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, with his <hi>forbearance</hi> and lifts us up from the
gates of death and carries us abroad into the open aire,
that we converse with prosperity and temptation, we go out in
darknesse: and we cannot be preserved in heat and light but
by still dwelling in the regions of sorrow: And if such be our
weaknesses, or our folly, it concerns us to pray against <hi>such
deliverances,</hi> to be afraid of health, to beg of God to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
a persecution, and not to deny us the mercy of an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</p>
            <p>And do not we finde all this to be a great truth in our selves?
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> are we so great strangers to our own weaknesses and unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
as not to remember when God scared us with judgements
in the neighbourhood, whence we lived in a great plague, or
if were ever in a storm, or God had sent a sicknesse upon us;
then we may please to remember that repentance was our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse,
that we designed mountains of piety, renewed our holy
purposes, made vows and solemn sacraments to God to become
penitent, and obedient persons; and we may also remember
without much considering, that assoon as God began to forbear
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> us, we would no longer forbear to sin, but adde flame to flame,
a heap of sins to a treasure of wrath, already too big; being like
Pharaoh, or Herod, or like the oxe and mule, more hardy and
callous for our stripes; and melted in the fire, and frozen har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in the cold, worse for all our afflictions, and the worse for
all Gods judgements; not bettered by his goodnesse, nor molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by his threatnings: and what is there more left for God to
do unto us? He that is not won by the sence of Gods mercy,
can never finde any thing <hi>in God</hi> that shall convert him; and he
whom fear and sense of pain cannot mend, can never finde any
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> argument <hi>from himself</hi> that shall make him wise; This is sad, that
<hi>nothing from without,</hi> and <hi>nothing from within</hi> shall move us; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in Heaven and nothing in Hell, neither love nor fear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
to God, nor preservation of our selves shall make us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,

               </gap>, that shall be his final sentence:
<hi>He shall never escape that ruine from which the greatest art of God

            <p>When thy gluttony gave thee a surfet, and God gave thee a

And that, God shall support our spirit, and preserve our patience,
and nourish our hope, and correct our stubbornnesse, and mortifie
our pride, and bring us to him whether we will or no, by such
gracious violences, and mercifull judgements which he uses to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us as his last remedies, is not onely the demonstration of a
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> mighty mercy, but of an almighty power: So hard a thing it is to

of God an effective pity, and clothed in all the way of its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse

observe, that when we are under this state of cure, we are so neer
destruction that the same instrument that God uses for remedy to
us, is also prepared to destroy us; the fire is as apt to burn us to
ashes, as to cleansing, when we are so overgrown; and the ax as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentall
to cut us down for fewell, as to square us for building

our selves. For what Plato said concerning his dream of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
is true here: <hi>Quicunque non purgatus migrat ad inferos, jace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
in luto: quicunque verò mitratus illuc accesserit, habitabit cum
Deis: He that dies in his impurities shall lie in it for ever, but he that
descends to his grave purged and mitred,</hi> that is, <hi>having quitted his
vices, &amp; superinduens justitiam, being clothed with righteousnesse,</hi>
shall dwell in light and immortality. It is sad that we put God to
such extremities, and as it happens in long diseases, those which
Physitians use for the last remedies seldom prevail; and when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptive
persons come to have their heads shaven, they do not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
escape: So it is when we put God to his last remedies; God
indeed hath the glory of his patience, and his long-suffering, but
we seldom have the benefit and the use of it. For if when our
sin was young, and our strength more active, and our habits lesse,
and vertue not so much a stranger to us, we suffered sin to prevail
upon us, to grow stronger then the ruins of our spirit, and to lesson
us into the state of sicknesse and disability, in the midst of all those
remedies which God used to our beginning diseases: much more
desperate is our recovery, when our disease is stronger and our
faculties weaker, when our sins raigne in us, and our thoughts of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
vertue are not alive.</p>
            <p>However, although I say this, and it is highly considerable, to
the purpose that we never suffered things to come to this extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
yet if it be upon us, we must do as well as we can: But then
we are to look upon it as a designe of Gods last mercy, beyond
which, if we protract our repentance, our condition is desperately
miserable. The whole state of which mercy we understand by the
parable of the King reckoning with his servants that were in arrears
to him: <hi>One was brought to him, which owed him ten thousand ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents:
but forasmuch as he had not to pay, his Lord commanded him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
to be sold, and his wife and children, and all that he had, and payment
to be made:</hi> The man you see was under the arrest; the sentence
was passed upon him, he was a condemned man; but before the
execution of it, he fell down and worshipped and said, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>Lord suffer me longer a while; have patience with me and I will</hi>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:53465:88"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
               <hi>pay thee all.</hi> This tells its meaning: this is <hi>a long-sufferance,</hi> by being
<hi>a forbearance</hi> onely of execution of the last sentence; a putting off
damnation upon a longer triall of our emendation; but in the mean
time it implies no other ease, but that together with his long-suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
God may use all other severities and scourges to break our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamed
spirits, and to soften them with hammers; so death be put
off, no matter else what hardship and loads of sufferance we have.
<hi>Hic ure, hic seca, ut in aeternum parcas,</hi> so Saint Austin prayed,
<hi>Here O Lord cut me, here burn me, spare me not now, that thou mayest
spare me for ever:</hi> And it is just like the mercy used to a mad man,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> when he is kept in a dark room and tamed with whips, it is a cruel
mercy, but such as his condition requires, he can receive no other
mercy; all things else were cruelly unmercifull.</p>
            <p>I remember what Bion observed wittily of the punishment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
upon the daughters of Danaeus, whom the old Poets fained
to be condemned in hell to fill a bottomlesse tub with water, and
to increase the pain (as they fancied) this water they were to carry
in sieves, and never to leave work till the tub were full; It is
well (sayes he) since their labour must be eternall, that it is so
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> gentle, for it were more pains to carry their water in whole vessels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and a sad burden to go loaden to a leaking tub with unfruitfull
labours: Just so is the condition of these persons upon whom a
wrath is gone out; it is a sad sentence, but acted with a gentle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument;
and since they are condemned to pay the scores of their
sins with the sufferance of a load of judgements, it is well they
are such as will run quite thorough them, and not stick upon them
to eternity. <hi>Omnes enim poenae non exterminantes sunt medici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

All punishments whatsoever which do not destroy us, are intended
to save us; they are lancets which make a wound but to let forth
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the venome of our ulcers; when God slue twenty three thousand
of the Assyrians for their fornication, that was a finall justice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their persons, and consigned them to a sad eternity: for beyond
such an infliction there was no remedy. But when God sent lions
to the Assyrian inhabitants of Samaria, and the judgements drave
them to inquire after the manner of the God of the land, and they
sent for Priests from Jerusalem to teach them how to worship the
God of Israel, that was a mercy and a judgement too: the long
forbearance of God who destroyed not at all the inhabitants, lead
the rest into repentance.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 1. And I must make this observation to you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That when
things come to this passe that God is forced to the last remedies
of judgements, this long-sufferance will little or nothing concern
particular persons, but nations and communities of men: for those
who are smitten with judgement if God takes his hands off again
and so opens a way for their repentance by prolonging their time;
that comes under the second part of Gods method, <hi>the</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>or
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:53465:89"/>
forbearance;</hi> but if he smites single persons with a small judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
that is, <hi>a long-suffering</hi> not of him, but towards others:
and God hath destroyed my neighbour to make me repent, my
neighbours time being expired and the date of his possibility de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined.
For a mans death-bed is but an ill station for a peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and a finall judgement is no good monitor to him, to whom
it is a severe executioner. They that perished in the gain-saying
of Corah were out of the conditions of repentance; but the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that were affrighted with the neighbourhood of the judgement
and the expresses of Gods anger manifested in such visible remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strances,
they were the men called unto repentance. But concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
whole nations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or communities of men this long-sufferance is
a Sermon of repentance; loud, clamorous, and highly argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative.
When God suffered the mutinies, the affronts, the base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and ingratitude, the follies, and relapses of the children
of Israel, who murmured against God ten times in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
God sent evil angels among them, and fiery serpents,
and pestilence, and fire from heaven, and prodigies from the earth,
and a prevailing sword of the enemies, and in all these accidents,
although some innocent persons felt the contingencies and variety
of mortality, yet those wicked persons who fell by the designe of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
Gods anger, were made examples unto others and instances of
Gods forbearance to the Nation: and yet this forbearance was
such that although God preserved the Nation in being and in title
to the first promises, yet all the particular persons that came from
Egypt died in the wildernesse, two onely excepted.</p>
            <p>2. And I desire you to observe this, that you may truly
estimate the arts of the Divine justice and mercy: For all the
world being one continuall and intire argument of the Divine
mercy, we are apt to abuse that mercy to vain confidences and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption;
First, mistaking the end, as if Gods mercy would be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
indulgent to our sin, to which it is the greatest enemy in the world,
for it is a certain truth that the mercy of God is as great an enemy
to sin as his justice is, and as Gods justice is made the hand-maid
of his mercy to cure sin, so it is the servant also and the instrument
to avenge our despight and contempt of mercy; and in all the way
where a difference can be there, justice is the lesse principall. And
it were a great signe of folly and a huge mistake to think our Lord
and friends do us offices of kindnesse, to make themselves more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of affronts; and that our fathers care over us, and provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for us can tempt us to disobey them: The very purpose of all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
those emanations is, that their love may return in duty, and their
providence be the parent of our prudence, and their care be crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with our piety, and then we shall all be crowned, and shall
return like the yeer, the ends into its own circle; and the fathers
and the children, the benefactours and the beneficiary shall knit
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:53465:89"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the wreath and binde each other in the eternall inclosures and
circlings of immortality, * but besides the men who presume to sin
because of Gods mercy, do mistake the very end and designe of Gods
mercy, they also mistake the Oeconomy of it, and the manner of
its ministration.</p>
            <p>3 For if God suffers men to go on in sins and punishes them not,
it is not a mercy, it is not a forbearance; it is a hardning them, a
consigning them to ruine, and reprobation; and themselves give
the best argument to prove it; for they continue in their sin, they
multiply their iniquity, and every day grow more enemy to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> God, and that is no mercy that increases their hostility and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
with God. A prosperous iniquity, is the most unprosperous
condition in the whole world; <hi>when he slew them, that sought him,
and turned them early and enquired after God:</hi> but as long as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
upon their enemies then <hi>they forgat that God was their strength
and the high God was their redeemer.</hi> It was well observed by the
Persian Embassadour of old, when he was telling the King a sad sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the overthrow of all his army by the Athenians; he addes
this of his own; that the day before the sight, the young Persian
gallants being confident they should destroy their enemies, were
drinking drunk, and railing at the timerousnesse and fears of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and against all their Gods, saying, there were no such things,
and that all things came by chance, &amp; industry, nothing by the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the supreme power. But the next day when they had
fought unprosperously and flying from their enemies, who were
eager in their pursuit, they came to the river <hi>strymon,</hi> which was
so frozen, that their boats could not lanch, and yet it began to
thaw, so that they feared the ice would not bear them. Then you
should see the bold gallants that the day before said there was no
God, most timorously and superstitiously fall upon their faces and
begged of God that the river strymon might bear them over from
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> their enemies. What wisdom and Philosophy and perpetual expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
and revelation and promises and blessings cannot do, a
mighty fear can; it can allay the confidences of a bold lust, and an
imperious sin, and soften our spirit into the lownesse of a Childe,
our revenge into the charity of prayers, our impudence into the
blushings of a chidden girle; and therefore God hath taken a course
proportionable: for he is not so unmercifully merciful, as to give
milk to an infirm lust, and hatch the egge to the bignesse of a coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atrice: and therefore observe how it is, that Gods mercy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> over all his works; it is even then when nothing can be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
but his judgements. For as when a famin had been in Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
in the dayes of Ahab for three years and a half, when the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
prophet Elijah met the King and presently a great winde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose,
and the dust blew into the eyes of them that walked abroad,
and the face of the heavens was black and all tempest, yet then the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:53465:90"/>
prophet was the most gentle, and God began to forgive, and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
heavens were more beautiful, then when the Sun puts on the
brightest ornaments of a bridegrome going from his chambers of
the east: so it is in the Oeconomy of the divine mercy; when God
makes our faces black and the windes blow so loud till the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
cracks, and our gay fortunes split, and our houses are dressed
with Cypresse and yew, <hi>and the mourners go about the streets,</hi> this
is nothing but the <hi>pompa misericordiae,</hi> this is the funeral of oursins,
dressed indeed with emblems of mourning, and proclaimed with
sad accents of death, but the sight is refreshing, as the beauties
of the <hi>field, which God hath blessed,</hi> and the sounds are healthful <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
as the noise of a physitian.</p>
            <p>This is that riddle spoken of in the psalme,<note place="margin">Psal. 74. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Calix in manu
Dom, vini meri plenus misto; the pure impure, the mingled unmingled
cup;</hi> for it is a cup in which God hath poured much of his severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and anger, and yet it is pure and unmingled; for it is all mercy:
and so the riddle is resolved, and our cup is full and made more
wholsome <hi>lymphatum crescit, dulcescit, laedere nescit,</hi> it is some justice
and yet it is all mercy; <hi>the very justice of God being an act of mercy,</hi>
a forbearance of the man, or the nation, and the punishing the sin.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
Thus it was in the case of the children of Israel, when they ran af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the bleating of the idolatrous calves, Moses prayed passionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and God heard his prayer,<note place="margin">Psal. 98. 8.</note> and forgave their sin upon them. And
this was Davids observation of the manner of Gods mercy to them;
<hi>Thou wast a God and forgavest them, though thou tookest veangeance of
their inventions:</hi> for Gods mercy is given to us by parts; and to
certain purposes; sometimes God onely so forgives us, that he
does not cut us off in the sin, but yet layes on a heavy load of
judgements: so he did to his people, when he sent them to schoole
under the discipline of 70 years captivity; somtimes he makes a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
judgement lesse and forgives in respect of the degree of the infliction;
he strikes more gently; and whereas God had designed it may
be the death of thy self or thy neerest relative, he is content to take
the life of a childe, and so he did to David when he forbore him.
<hi>the Lord hath taken away thy sin, thou shalt not die, neverthelesse the
childe that is born unto thee that shall die:</hi> sometimes he puts the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
off to a further day, as he did in the case of Ahab, and Hezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah:
to the first he brought the evil upon his house, and to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
he brought the evil upon his kingdom, in his sons dayes;
God forgiving onely so as to respite the evil, that they should have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
peace in their own dayes. And thus when we have committed a
sin, against God, which hath highly provoked him to anger, even
upon our repentance we are not sure to be forgiven, so as we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
forgivenes; that is, to hear no more of it, never to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to an account; but we are happy, if God so forgives us, as not
to throw us into the insufferable flames of hell, though he smite us
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:53465:90"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> still we groan for our misery <hi>till we chatter like a swallow</hi> (as Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids
expression is) and though David was an excellent penitent, yet
after he had lost the childe begotten of Bathsheba, and God had told
him he had forgiven him, yet he raised up his darling son against
him, and forced him to an inglorious flight, and his son lay with his
Fathers concubins in the face of all Israel: so that when we are
forgiven, yet it is ten to one, but GOD will make us
to smart <hi>and roar for our sinnes, for the very disquietnesse of our
souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For if we sin and ask God forgivenesse and then are quiet, we
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> feele so little inconvenience in the trade that we may more easily be
tempted to make a trade of it indeed. I wish to God that for every
sin we have committed, we should heartily cry God mercy and leave
it, and judge our selves for it to prevent Gods anger, but when
we have done all that we commonly call repentance, and when pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
God hath forgiven us to some purposes, yet it may be he
punishes our sin when we least think of it; that sin which we
have long since forgotten. It may be for the lust of thy youth
thou hast a healthlesse old age; an old religious person long agoe
complained, it was his case.</p>
            <q>

            </q>
            <p>It may be thy sore eyes are the punishment of thy intemperance
seven years ago, or God cuts thy dayes shorter and thou shalt die
in a florid age, or he raises up afflictions to thee in thine own
house, in thine own bowels, or hath sent a gangren into thy estate,
or with any arrow out of his quiver he can wound thee, and the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> arrow shall stick fast in thy flesh, although God hath forgiven thy
sin to many purposes. Our blessed Saviour was heard in all that he
prayed for (said the Apostle) and he prayed for the Jews, that
crucified him: Father forgive them for they know not what they
do, and God did forgive that great sin, but how far? whereas it
was just in God to deprive them of all possibility of receiving
benefit from the death of Christ, yet God admitted them to i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, he
gave them time and possibilities, and helps, and great advantages
to bring them to repentance; he did not presently shut them up,
in his final and eternal anger: and yet he had finally resolved to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> destroy their city and nation and did so, but forbore them forty
years, &amp; gave them al the helps of miracles and sermons apostolical
to shame them, and force them into sorrow for their fault. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any man can repent God hath forgiven the man in one degree
of forgivenesse; for he hath given him grace of repentance and
taken from him that final anger of the spirit of reprobation: and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:53465:91"/>
when a man hath repented, no man can say that God hath forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
him to all purposes, but he hath reserves of anger to punish
the sin, to make the man affraid to sin any more, and to represent
that when any man hath sinned what ever he does afterwards he
shall be miserable as long as he lives, vexed with its adherencies and
its neighbour-hood, and evil consequence. For as no man that
hath sinned, can during his life ever returne to an integral and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
innocence: so neither shall he be restored to a perfect peace,
but must alwayes watch and strive against his sinne, and alwayes
mourn and pray for its pardon, and alwayes finde cause to
hate it by knowing himself to be for ever in danger of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
some grievous calamity, even for those sinnes for
which he hath truely repented him, for which God hath in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
gracious degrees passed his pardon; this is the manner of the
dispensation of the divine mercy in respect of particular persons,
and nations too.</p>
            <p>But sometimes we finde a severer judgement happening upon a
people, and yet in that sad story, Gods mercy sings the triumph
which although it be much to Gods glory, yet it is a sad story to sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 600000. sighting men besides women and children,
and decrepit persons, came out of Egypt and God destroyed them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
all in the wildernesse except Caleb and Joshuah, and there it was
that <hi>Gods mercy prevailed over his justice,</hi> that he did not destroy
the nation; but still preserved a succession to Jacob, to possesse
the promise. God <hi>drowned all the world except eight persons</hi> his
mercy there also <hi>prevailed over his justice,</hi> that he preserved a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to mankinde; his justice devoured all the world, and his
mercy which preserved but eight, had the honour of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
attribute. God destroyed Sodom, and the five cities of the
plain, and rescued but four from the flames of that sad burning,
and of the four lost one in the flight and yet his mercy prevailed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
his justice, because he did not destroy all.</p>
            <p>And in these senses we are to understand the excellency of the
divine mercy even when he smites, when <hi>he rebukes us for sin,</hi>
when he makes <hi>our beauty to fail</hi> and <hi>our flesh to consume away like a
moth fretting a garment,</hi> yet then his mercy is the prevailing ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient.
If his judgements be but sines set upon our heads accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the mercy of our old lawes, <hi>Salvo contenemento,</hi> so as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
our estates, to continue our hopes and possibilities of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
and all the other judgements can be nothing but mercies,
excellent instruments of grace arts to make us sober and wise, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
take off from our vanity to restrain our wildnesses, which if they
were left unbridled would set all the world on fire, Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are like to censures of the Church in which a sinner is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
over to Satan to be buffetted <hi>that the spirit may be saved;</hi> the
result of all this, is, that Gods mercies are not, ought not, cannot
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:53465:91"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> be, instruments of confidence to sin, because the very purpose of
his mercy is to the contrary, and the very manner of his Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
and dispensation is such that Gods mercy goes along in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plection
and conjunction with his judgements; the riches of his
forbearance is this, that he forbears to throw us into hell, and sends
the mercies of his rod to chide us unto repentance, and the mercies
of his rod to punish us for having sinned, and that when we have
sinned we may never think our selves secured, nor ever be reconciled
to such dangers and deadly poisons. This, this is the manner of the
divine mercy. Go now fond man, and because God is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> presume to sin, as heaving grounds to hope that thou mayest
sin and be safe all the way. If this hope (shall I call it) or sordid
flattery could be reasonable, then the mercies of God would not
leade us to repentance; so unworthy are we in the sense and

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> cataplasmes, but proceeds further and gives us stibium or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
steele, sharp arrows of his anger, and the sword, and the
hand of sicknesse, yet we are not sure of so much favour as to
be entertained longer in Gods hospital, but many be thrust
forth among the <hi>incurabili,</hi> Plutarch reports concerning swine
that their optick nervs are so disposed to turne their eyes down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:53465:92"/>
that they cannot look upwards nor behold the face of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
unlesse they be thrown upon their backs. Such Swine are we, we
seldom can look up to heaven til God by his judgements throws us
upon our backs; till he humbles us &amp; softens us with showers of our
own blood, and tears of sorrow: and yet God hath not promised
that he will do so much for us; but for ought we know as soon as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the devil enters into our swinish and brutish hearts we shall run
down the hill and perish in the floods and seas of intolerable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie;
And therefore besides that it is a huge folly in us that we wil
not be cured with pleasant medicines, but must be longing for col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquintida
and for vomits, for knives and poniards instead of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
gentle shoures of the divine refreshments, besides that this is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence
and sottishnesse, we do infinitely put it to the venture
whether we shall be in a saverable condition or no, after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
of the first state of mercies. But however, then begins
the first step of the judgement, and pungent misery, we are
perishing people, or if not, yet at the last, not to be cured without
the abscision of a member, without the cutting of a hand or leg;
or the putting out of an eye: we must be cut to take the stone
out of our hearts, and that is a state of a very great infelicity: and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
if we scape the stone, we cannot escape the surgeons knife; if we
scape death, yet we have a sicknesse; and though that be a great
mercy in respect of death, yet it is as great a misery in respect
of health: and that is the first punishment for the despite
done to the first, and most sensible mercies: we are fallen
into a sicknesse, that cannot be cured but by disease and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
            <p>But if this despite runs further, and when the mercies look
on us with an angry countenance, and that God gives us onely
the mercy of a punishment, if we despise this too, we increase <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
but our misery as we increase our sin: the summe of which is
this, that if Pharaoh will not be cured by one plague, he shall
have ten, and if ten will not do it, the great and tenth wave,
which is far bigger then all the rest, the severest and the
last arrow of the quiver, then we shall perish in the red sea,
the sea of flames and blood, in which the ungodly shall roule e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally.</p>
            <p>But some of these despisers are such as are unmooved when
God smites others; like Gallio when the Jews took Softhenes
and beat him in the pleading place, he cared for none of these <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
things; he was not concerned in that interest; and many Gallio's
there are amongst us, that understand it not to be a part of the
divine method, of Gods <hi>long sufferance</hi> to strike others to make us
afraid. But however, we sleep in the midst of such alarums, yet
know, that there is not one death in all the neighbour-hood, but
is intended to thee; every crowing of the cock is to awake thee
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:53465:92"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to repentance: and if thou sleepest still, the next turn may be
thine; God will send his Angel as he did to Peter and smite thee
on thy side, and wake thee from thy dead sleep of sin and sottish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
But beyond this, some are despisers still, and hope to drown
the noises of mount Sinai, the sound of Canons, of thunders, and
lightnings, with a counternoise of revelling and clamorous roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
with merry meetings; like the sacrifices to Moloch, they
sound drums and trumpets, that they might not hear the sad shrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of their children as they were dying in the cavety of the
brazen idoll, and when their conscience shrikes out or murmurs
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> in a sad melancholy; or something that is dear to them is smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
they attempt to drown it in a sea of drink, in the heathenish
noises of idle and drunen company; and that which God sends to
lead them to repentance, leads them to a taverne, not to refresh their
needs of nature, or for ends of a tolerable civility, or innocent
purposes, but like the condemned persons among the Levantines,
they tasted wine freely that they might die and be insensible. I
could easily reprove such persons with an old Greek proverb men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
by Plutarch, <gap reason="foreign">

of a sin or vanity to cure the smart of a divine judgement, but
it is a great increaser of the misery, by swelling the cause to big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and monstrous proportions. It is just as if an impatient fool,
feeling the smart of his medicine, shall tear his wounds open and

thence, or strew flowers, roses, and Jessamine, the downe of
thistles, and the softest Gossamere, that he may die without pain,
die quietly and like a lamb, sink to the bottom of hell without
noise, this man is a fool, because he accepts death, if it arrest him
in civil language, is content to die by the sentence of an eloquent
Judge, and prefers a quiet passage to hell, before going to heaven
in a storm.</p>
            <p>That Italian Gentleman was certainly a great lover of his
sleep, who was angry with the lizard that wak't him, when a

us to poison our spirits, and steal our souls away while we are
sleeping in the lethargy of sin, God sends his sharp messages to
awaken us, and we call that the enemy, and use arts to cure the
remedy, not to cure the disease. There are some persons that
will never be cured, not because the sicknesse is incurable, but
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:53465:93"/>

more to be said in this affair, but to read the poor wretches sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,

for the Church any more to punish them; and this court Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
is an imitation and paralell of the justice of the court of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
When a sinner is not mended by judgements at long running,
God cuts him off from his inheritance and the lot of sons, he will
chastise him no more, but let him take his course and spend his
portion of prosperity, such as shall be allowed him in the great
Oeconomy of the world. Thus God did to his Vineyard which
he took such pains to fence, to plant, to manure, to dig, to cut,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
and to prune: and when after all, it brought forth wilde grapes,
the last and worst of Gods anger was this,<note place="margin">Isai. 5. 5.</note>

God had fenced it with a hedge of thorns, and God would take

one judgement to reprove or admonish them, but all the wilde
beasts, and wilder and more beastly lusts, may come and devour
it, and trample it down in scorn.</p>
            <p>And now what shall I say, but those words quoted by Saint
Peter in his Sermon:<note place="margin">Acts 13. 14.</note>

perish in your own folly by stubbornesse and ingratitude. For it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
is a huge contradiction to the nature and designes of God; God
calls us, we refuse to hear; he invites us with fair promises, we
hear and consider not; he gives us blessings, we take them and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
not his meaning: we take out the token, but read not the
letter: then he threatens us, and we regard not; he strikes our
neighbours, and we are not concerned; then he strikes us gently,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:53465:93"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> but we feel it not; then he does like the Physitian in the Greek Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram,

might make him at least sensible of blows; but this makes us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of running to God, to trust in unskilfull Physitians, or like
Saul to run to a Pythonisse, we run for cure to a crime, we take
sanctuary in a pleasant sin; just as if a man to cure his melancholy

it was no wonder that whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

were instantly professed, and their

and their wills followed their understandings, and they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
by miracle, and overcome by grace, and passionate with
zeal, and wisely governed by their Guides, and ravished with the
sanctity of the Doctrine, and the holinesse of their examples: And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
this was not onely their duty, but a great instance of providence,
that by the great religion and piety of the first Professors,
Christianity might be firmly planted, and unshaken by scandall,
and hardened by persecution; and that these first lights might be
actuall Precedents for ever, and Copies for us to transcribe in all
descending ages of Christianity, that thither we might run to fetch

disorderly; for then a man must have gone out of the world. But
they were not to endure so much as <hi>to eat with,</hi> or <hi>to salute a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly

is multiplied every where in name and title, so it is destroyed
in life, essence, and proper operation; and we have very great
reason to fear, that Christs name will serve us to no end but to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid
our basenesse; and his person onely to be our Judge, and
his lawes as so many bills of accusation, and his graces and helps
offered us, but as aggravations of our unworthinesse; and our ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisme,
but an occasion of vow-breach; and the holy Communion,
but an act of hypocrisie, formality, or sacrilege; and all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of the Gospel but as pleasant dreams; and the threatnings
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> but as arts of affrightment; for Christianity lasted pure and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
it kept its rules, and observed its own lawes for three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

rare devotion and religion of our fathers in the Gospel.</p>
            <p>Men of old looked upon themselves as they stood by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
and precedents of Martyrs, and compared their piety to
the life of Saint Paul, and estimated their zeal by the flames of
the Boanerges, Saint James and his brother: and the Bishops were
thought reproveable as they fell short of the ordinary government
of Saint Peter, and Saint John; and the assemblies of Christians
were so holy, that every meeting had religion enough to hallow
a house and convert it to a Church; and every day of feasting was
a Communion, and every fasting day was a day of <hi>repentance and</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
               <hi>alms;</hi> and every day of thanksgiving was a day of <hi>joy, and alms:</hi>
and religion begun all their actions, and prayer consecrated them,
and they ended in charity, and were not polluted with designe:
they despised the world heartily, and pursued after heaven greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
they knew no ends but to serve God, and to be saved; and had
no designes upon their neighbours, but to lead them to God, and
to felicity; till Satan full of envy to see such excellent dayes,
mingled covetousnesse, and ambition within the throngs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
of the Church, and a vice crept into an office, and then
the mutuall confidence grew lesse, and so <hi>charity was lessened;</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
and heresies crept in, and then <hi>faith began to be sullied,</hi> and <hi>pride</hi>
crept in; and then men snatched at offices, not for the work, but
for the dignity; and then they served themselves more then God
and the Church; till at last it came to the passe where now it is,
that the Clergy live lives no better then the Laity, and the Laity
are stooped to imitate the evil customes of strangers and enemies
of Christianity; so that we should think Religion in a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
so that men did offer up to God but the actions of an <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
even,</hi> and <hi>just life,</hi> without the scandall and allayes of a
great impiety: But because such is the nature of things, that either <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
they grow towards perfection, or decline towards dissolution;
There is no proper way to secure it but by setting its growth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:
for religion hath no station, or naturall periods; if it does
not grow better, it grows much worse, not that it alwayes returns
the man into scandalous sins, but that it establishes and fixes him
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:53465:95"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> in a state of indifferency and lukewarmnesse: and he is more averse
to a state of improvement, and dies in an incurious, ignorant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relenting
condition.</p>
            <p>But grow in grace] Thats the remedy, and that would make
us all wise and happy, blessed in this world, and sure of heaven:
Concerning which, we are to consider first; what the estate of grace
is, into which every one of us must be entred, that we may grow in it;
secondly the proper parts, acts and offices of growing in grace, 3. The
signes, consequences, and proper significations, by which if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
perceive <hi>the growing,</hi> yet afterwards we may perceive that <hi>we
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> are grown,</hi> and so judge of the state of our duty, and concerning our
finall condition of being saved.</p>
            <p>1. Concerning the state of grace, I consider that no man can
be said to be in the state of grace, who retaines an affection to
any one sin. The state of pardon and the divine favour, begins
at the first instance of anger against our crimes, when we leave
our fondnesses and kinde opinions, when we excuse them not,
and will not endure their shame; when we feele the smarts of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of their evil consequents; for he that is a perfect lover of sin,
and is <hi>sealed up to a reprobate sense,</hi> endures all that sin brings along
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> with it, and is reconciled to all its mischiefes, can suffer the sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his own drunkennesse, and yet call it pleasure, he can
wait like a slave to serve his lust, and yet count it no disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
he can suffer the dishonour of being accounted a base and
dishonest person, and yet look confidently, and think himself no
worse. But when the grace of God begins to work upon a mans
spirit, it makes the conscience nice and tender and although the
sin as yet does not displease the man, but he can endure the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
and alluring part, yet he will not endure to be used so ill
by his sin; he will not be abused and dishonoured by it; But because
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> God hath so allayed the pleasures of his sin, that he that drinks
the sweet should also strain the dregs through his throat, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
Gods grace doth irreconcile the convert, and discovers, first
its base attendance, then its worse consequents, then the displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of God, that here commences the first resolutions of leaving
the sin, and trying if in the service of God, his spirit and the
whole appetite of man may be better entertained. He that is thus
far entred shall quickly perceive the difference, and meet argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
enough to invite him further; For then God treats the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> man as he treated the spies, that went to discover the land of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise;
he ordered the year in plenty and directed them to a pleasant
and a fruitful place, and prepared bunches of grapes of a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and prodigious greatnesse that they might report good things
of Canaan, and invite the whole nation to attempt its conquest:
so Gods grace represents to the new converts and the weak ones in
faith the pleasures and first deliciousnesses of religion: and when
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:53465:96"/>
they come to spie the good things of that way that leads to heaven,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
they presently perceive themselves eased of the load of an evil
conscience, of their fears of death, of the confusion of their shame,
and Gods spirit gives them a cup of sensible comfort, and makes
them to rejoyce in their prayers, and weep with pleasures ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with innocent passions, and religious changes; and although
God does not deal with all men in the same method, or in manners
that can regularly be described, and all men do not feele, or do
not observe, or cannot for want of skill discern such accidental
sweetnesses, and pleasant grapes at his first entrance into religion:
yet God to every man does minister excellent arguments of invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
and such that if a man will attend to them, they will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
move either his affections or his will, his fancy or his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and most commonly both: But while the spirit of God is
doing this work of man, man must also be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>a fellow
worker with God,</hi> he must entertain the spirit, attend his inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

and utterly renounce all confederacy with his enemy, sin;
at no hand suffering any <hi>root of bitternesse to spring up,</hi> not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to himself any reserve of carnal pleasure, no clancular lust,
no private oppressions, no secret covetousnesse, no love to this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
world that may discompose his duty; for if a man prayes all day
and at night is intemperate if he spends his time in reading, and
his recreation be sinful; if he studies religion, and practises self
interest; if he leaves his swearing and yet retaines his pride; if he
becomes chast and yet remains peevish and imperious; this man
is not changed from the state of sin, into the first stage of the state
of grace: he does at no hand belong to God, he hath suffered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be scared from one sin, and tempted from another by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
and hath left a third, by reason of his inclination, and a fourth
for shame, or want of opportunity: But the spirit of God hath not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
yet planted one perfect plant there; God may make use of the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally
prepared advantages<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But as yet the spirit of God hath not
begun the proper and direct work of grace in his heart, But when we
leave every sin, when we resolve never to return to the chaines, when
we have no love for the world, but such as may be a servant of
God; then I account that we are entred into a state of grace, from
whence I am now to begin to reckon the commencement of this
precept, <hi>grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. And now the first part of this duty is <hi>to make religion to be</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
               <hi>the businesse of our lives;</hi> for this is the great instrument, which
will naturally produce our growth in grace, and the perfection of
a Christian. For a man cannot after a state of sin be instantly a
Saint: the work of heaven is not done by a flash of lightning, or a
dash of affectionate raine, or a few tears of a relenting pity; God
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:53465:96"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and his Church have appointed holy intervals, and have taken por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of our time for religion, that we may be called off from the
world, and remember the end of our creation, and do honour to
God, and think of heaven with hearty purposes and peremptory
designes to get thither. But as we must not neglect those times
which God hath reserved for his service, or the Church hath pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
decreed, nor yet act religion upon such dayes with forms
and outsides, or to comply with customs; or to seem religious;
so we must take care that all the other portions of our time be
hallowed with little retirements of all thoughts, and short conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> with God; and all along be guided with a holy intention,
that even our works of nature may passe into the relations of grace,
and the actions of our calling may help towards the obtaining <hi>the
price of our high calling;</hi> while our eatings are actions of tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
our labours are profitable our humiliations are acts of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
and our almes are charity: our marriages are cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>, and
<hi>whether we eat or drink, sleep or wake we may do all to the glory of
God,</hi> by <hi>a direct intuition</hi> or by a reflex act, by designe or by sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plment,
by fore sight or by an after election: and to this purpose
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> we must not look upon religion as our trouble, and our hind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
nor think almes chargeable or expensive; nor our fastings
vexatious and burdensom; nor our prayers a wearinesse of spirit;
But we must make these and all other the dutis of religion, our
imployments, our care the work and end for which we came into
the world; and remember that we never do the work of men,
nor serve the ends of God, nor are in the proper imployment
and businesse of our life, but when we worship God or live like
wise or sober persons, or do benefit to our brother.</p>
            <p>I will not turne this discourse into a reproofe, but leave it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> as a duty: Remember that God se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> you into the world
for religion; we are but to passe through our pleasant fields, or
our hard labours; but to lodge a little while in our faire palaces
or our meaner cottages; but to bait in the way at our full tables
or with our spare diet; but then onely, man does his proper
imployment, when he prayes and does charity, and mortifies his
unruly appetites, and restrains his violent passions, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
like to God, and imitates his holy Son, and writes after the
coppies of Apostles, and Saints. Then he is dressing himself for
eternity, where he must dwell or abide, either in an excellent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atifical
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> country, or in a prison of amazment and eternal horrour:
And after all this, you may if you please call to minde, how much
time you allovv to God and to your souls every day, or every
moneth, or in a year if you please; for I fear the account of the
time is soon made; but the account for the neglect, vvill be har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
And it vvill not easily be ansvvered, that all our dayes and
years are little enough to attend perishing things, and to be svval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:53465:97"/>
up in avaritious and vain attendances, and we shall not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
to religion with a zeal so great as is our revenge, or as is the
hunger of one meale. Without much time, and a wary life, and a
diligent circumspection, we cannot mortify our sins, or do the
first works of grace. I pray God we be not found to have grown
like the sinnews of old age, from strength to remisnesse, from
thence to dissolution, and infirmity and death; Menedemus
was wont to say that the young boyes that went to Athens the
first year were <hi>wise men,</hi> the second year, <hi>Philosophers,</hi> the third,
<hi>Orators,</hi> and the fourth were but <hi>Plebeians</hi> and understood nothing
but their own ignorance.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
            </p>
            <p>And just so it happens to some in the progresses of religion: at
first they are violent and active; and then they satiate all the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites
of religion; and that which is left, is, that they were soon
weary, and sat down in displeasure, and return to the world and
dwell in the businesse of pride, or mony; and by this time they
understand that their religion is declined, and passed from the
heats and follies of youth, to the coldnesse and infirmities of old
age; The remedies of which is onely a diligent spirit and a busie
religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a great industry &amp; a full portion of time in holy offices;
that as the Oracle said to the Cirrheans, <hi>noctes diesque belligeran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
they could not be happy unlesse they waged war night and
day: that is, unlesse we perpetually fight against our own vices; and
repell our Ghostly enemies, and stand upon our guard, we must
stand for ever in the state of babes, in Christ, or else return to the
first imperfections of an unchristened soul, and an unsanctified spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
Thats the first particular.</p>
            <p>2. The second step of our growth in grace is, <hi>when vertues
grow habitual,</hi> apt and easie in our manners, and dispositions. For
although many new converts have a great zeal, and a busie spirit,
apt enough as they think to contest against all the difficulties of a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
spiritual life, yet they meet with such powerful oppositions from
without, and a false heart within, that their first heats are soon
broken, and either they are for ever discouraged, or are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to march more slowly and proceed more temperately for ever
after.</p>

and labour at home, and good guides abroad to be instruments
and means to purchase vertue.</p>
            <p>The way is long and difficult at first; but in the progresse

made smooth.</p>

            <p>Now, the spirit of grace is like a new soul within him,
and he hath new appetites and new pleasures, when the things of
the world grow unsavory and the things of religion are delicious;
when his temptations to his old crimes return but seldom, and they
prevail not at all, or in very inconsiderable instances, and stay not
at all, but are reproached with a penitentiall sorrow, and speedy
amendment; when we do actions of vertue quickly, frequently,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and with delight: then we have grown in grace in the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
in which they can perceive these excellent dispositions. Some
persons there are who dare not sin: they dare not omit their hours
of prayer; and they are restlesse in their spirits till they have done;
but they go to it as to execution; they stay from it as long as they
can, and they drive like Pharoahs charets with the wheels off, sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and heavily: and besides that such persons have reserved to
themselves, the best part of their sacrifice, and do not give their
will to God, they do not love him with all their heart; they are
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> also soonest tempted to retire and fall off. <hi>Sextius Romanus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
the honours and offices of the city, and betook himself to
the severity of a Philosophical life. But when his unusual diet and
hard labour began to pinch his flesh, and he felt his propositions
smart, and that which was fine in discourse at a Symposiack, or an
Academical dinner, began to sit uneasily upon him in the practise;
he so despaired that he had like to have cast himself into the sea, to
appease the labours of his religion; Because he never had gone fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then to think it a fine thing to be a wise man: he would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
it, but he was loth to pay for it at the price that God and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the Philosopher set upon it. But he that his <hi>grown <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> grace</hi> and hath
made religion habitual to his spirit, is not at ease but when he is
doing the works of the new man, he rests in religion and comforts
his sorrows with thinking of his prayers, and in all crosses of the
world he is patient, because his joy is at hand to refresh him
when he list, for he cares not so he may serve God: and if
you make him poor here, he is rich there, and he counts
that to be his proper <hi>service,</hi> his <hi>worke,</hi> his <hi>recreation,</hi> and
<hi>reward.</hi>

               </gap>cause in the course of holy living, although the duty
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> be regular and constant, yet the sensible relishes and the flowrings
of affections, the zeal and the visible expressions do not alwayes
make the same emission; but sometimes by designe, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by order, somtimes by affection we are more busie, more
intire, and more intent upon the actions of religion; in such ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
we are to judge of our growth in grace, if after every interval
of extraordinary piety, the next return be more devout and more
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:53465:98"/>
affectionate, the labour be more cheerfull and more active; and if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
religion returnes oftner and stayes longer in the same expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and leaves more satisfaction upon the spirit. Are your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions
more frequent? and when they are, do ye approach
neerer to God? have you made firmer resolutions and entertained
more hearty purposes of amendment? Do you love God more
dutifully and your neighbour with a greater charity? do you not
so easily return to the world as formerly? are not you glad when
the thing is done? do you go to your secular accounts with a more
weaned affection then before? if you communicate well, it is certain,
that you will still do it better: if you do not communicate well,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
every opportunity of doing it is but a new trouble, easily excused,
readily omitted, done because it is necessary, but not because we
love it: and we shall finde that such persons in their old age do it
worst of all; And it was observed by a Spanish Confessor, who
was also a famous preacher, that in persons not very religious, the
confessions which they made upon their deathbed were the coldest,
the most imperfect, and with lesse contrition then all that he had
observed them to make in many years before. For so the Canes
of Egypt when they newly arise from their bed of mud and slime
of Nilus, start up into an equal and continual length, and are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
but with few knots, and are strong and beauteous with
great distances, and intervals: but when they are grown to their
full length they lessen into the point of a pyramis, and multiply
their knots and joynts, interrupting the finenesse and smoothnesse of
its body: so are the steps &amp; declensions of him that does not grow in
grace: at first when he springs up from his impurity, by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of baptisme and repentance, he grows straight and strong,
and suffers but few interruptions of piety, and his constant cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of religion are but rarely intermitted; till they ascend up to a
full age or towards the ends of their life, then they are weak and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
their devotions often intermitted, and their breaches are frequent,
and they seek excuses, and labour for dispensations, and love
God and religion lesse and lesse, till their old age instead of a crown
of their vertue and perseverance ends in levity and unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
courses; light and uselesse as the tufted feathers upon the cane,
every winde can play with it and abuse it, but no man can make
it useful. When therefore our piety interrupts its greater and more
solemn expressions, and upon the return of the great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> offices, and

               </gap> spirits like
the wave of a tide, which retired onely because it was natural so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
to do and yet came further upon the strand at the next rolling;
When every new confession, every succeeding communion, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
time of separation for more solemn and intense prayer is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
spent and more affectionate, leaving a greater relish upon the
spirit, and possessing greater portions of our affections, our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:53465:98"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and our choice, then we may give God thanks, who hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us more grace to use that grace, and a blessing to endeavour
our duty, and a blessing upon our endeavour.</p>
            <p>4. To discern our growth in grace, we must inquire concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
our passions, whether they be mortified and quiet, comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with our ends of vertue and under command. For since the
passions are the matter of vertue and vice respectively, he that
hath brought into his power all the strengths of the enemy, and
the forts from whence he did infest him, he onely hath secured his
holy walking with God. But because this thing is never perfectly
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> done, and yet must alwayes be doing, grace grows according as
we have finished our portions of this work. And in this we must
not onely inquire concerning our passions, whether they be sinfull
and habitually prevalent; for if they be, we are not in the state
of grace; But whether they return upon us in violences and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decencies,
in transportation and unreasonable, and imprudent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions;
for although <hi>a good man</hi> may be incident to a violent
passion, and that without sin, yet <hi>a perfect man</hi> is not; a well-grown
Christian hath seldom such sufferings; to suffer such things
sometimes may stand with <hi>the being of vertue,</hi> but not with <hi>its</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
               <hi>security:</hi> For if passions range up and down and transport us fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
and violently, we may keep in our forts, and in our dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
but our enemy is master of the field, and our vertues are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained,
and apt to be starved, and will not hold out long; <hi>a good
man</hi> may be spotted with a violence, but <hi>a wise man</hi> will not:
and he that does not adde <hi>wisedom</hi> to his <hi>vertue,</hi> the <hi>knowledge of
Jesus Christ</hi> to his vertuous habits, will be a good man but till a
storm comes. But beyond this, inquire after the state of your
passions, in actions of religion: Some men fast to mortifie their
iust, and their fasting makes them peevish: some reprove a vice
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> but they do it with much inpatience; some charitably give excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
counsell, but they do that also with a pompous and proud
spirit; and passion being driven from open hostilities, is forced
to march along in the retinue and troops of vertue: And although
this be rather a deception and a cosenage then an imperfection;
and supposes a state of sin rather then an imperfect grace; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it tacitly and secretly creeps along among the circumstances
of pious actions, as it spoils a vertue in some, so it lessens it in
others, and therefore is considerable also in this question.</p>
            <p>And although no man must take accounts of his <hi>being in, or</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
               <hi>out of the state of grace,</hi> by his being dispassionate, and free from
all the assaults of passion, yet as to the securing his being in the state
of grace, he must provide that he be not a slave of passion, so <hi>to
declare his growth in grace,</hi> he must be sure to take the measures
of his affections, and see that they be lessened; more apt to be
suppressed; not breaking out to inconvenience and imprudencies,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:53465:99"/>
not rifling our spirit and drawing us from our usuall and more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
sober tempers. Try therefore if your fear be turned into caution,
your lust into chast friendships, your imperious spirit into prudent
government, your revenge into justice, your anger into charity,
and your peevishnesse and rage, into silence and suppression of
language. Is our ambition changed into vertuous and noble
thoughts? can we emulate without envy? is our covetousnesse les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen'd
into good husbandry, and mingled with alms, that we may
certainly discern the love of money to be gone? do we leave to
despise our inferiours, and can we willingly endure to admit him
that excels us in any gift or grace whatsoever, and to commend <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
it without abatement, and mingling allayes with the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and disparagements to the man? If we be arrived but thus
farre, it is well, and we must go further. But we use to think that
all disaffections of the body are removed, if they be changed into
the more tolerable, although we have not an athletick health, or
the strength of porters or wrastlers: For although it be felicity to
be quit of all passion, that may be sinfull or violent; and part of
the happinesse of heaven shall consist in that freedom; yet our
growth in grace consists in the remission and lessening of our passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
onely he that is incontinent in his lust, or in his anger, in his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
desires of money, or of honour, in his revenge, or in his fear, in his
joyes, or in his sorrows, that man is not grown at all in the grace
<hi>and knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ:</hi> This onely; in the seruting
and consequent judgement concerning our passions, it will concern
the curiosity of our care, to watch against passions in the reflex
act; against pride, or lust, complacency, and peevishnesse attending
upon vertue. For he was noted for a vain person, who being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
for the cure of his pride (as he thought) cried out to his wife,
<hi>Cerne Dionysia deposui fastum, behold I have laid aside all my pride:</hi>
and of that very dream the silly man thought he had reason to boast; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
but considered not that <hi>it</hi> was an act of pride, and levity besides.
If thou hast given a noble present to thy friend, if thou hast rejected
the unjust desire of thy Prince; if thou hast endured thirst and
hunger for religion or continence; if thou hast refused an offer like
that which was made to Joseph, sit down and rest in thy good
conscience, and do not please thy self in opinions, and phantastick
noises abroad, and do not despise him that did not do so as thou hast
done; and reprove no man with an upbraiding circumstance: for
it will give thee but an ill return, and a contemptible reward, if
thou shalt over-lay thy infant-vertue, or drown it with a flood of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
breast-milk.</p>

who is more patient of a sharp reproof, then of a
secret flattery. For a reprehension contains so much
mortification to the pride and complacencies of a man; is so great
an affront to an easie and undisturbed person, is so empty of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and so full of profit, that he must needs love vertue in a
great degree, who can take in that which onely serves her end,
and is displeasant to himself, and all his gayeties. A severe repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hender
of anothers vice, comes dressed like Jacob when he went
to cozen his brother of the blessing: his outside is rough and hairy,
but the voice is Jacobs voice; rough hands, and a healthfull lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> get the blessing, even against the will of him that shall feel
it; but he that is <hi>patient,</hi> and <hi>even,</hi> not apt to excuse his fault,
that is lesse apt to anger, or to scorn him that snatches him rudely
from the flames of hell, he is vertues Confessor, and suffers these
lesser stripes for that interest which will end in spirituall and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
benedictions.</p>
            <p>They who are furious against their monitors are incorrigible:
but it is one degree of meeknesse to suffer discipline: and a meek
man cannot easily be an ill man, especially in the present instance:
he appears, at least, to have a healthfull constitution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he hath
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> good flesh to heal; his spirit is capable of medicine, and that man
can never be despaired of, who hath a disposition so neer his health
as to improve all physick, and whose nature is relieved by every
good accident from without. But that which I observe is, That this
is not onely a good disposition towards repentance, and restitution,
but is a signe of growth in grace, according as it becomes <hi>naturall,
easie,</hi> and <hi>habituall,</hi> Some men chide themselves for all their
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:53465:100"/>
misdemeanours, because they would be represented to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
and opinions of other men, with a fair Character, and such
as need not to be reproved: others out of inconsideration sleep in
their own dark rooms, and untill the charity of a Guide, or of a
friend draws the curtain and lets in a beam of light, dream on
untill the graves open, and hell devours them; But if they be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
upon by the grace of God, let down with a sheet of counsels
and friendly precepts, they are presently inclined to be obedient
to the heavenly monitions, but unlesse they be dressed with cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of honour and civility, with arts of entertainment, and
insinuation they are rejected utterly, or received unwillingly:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
Therefore although upon any termes, to endure a sharp reproof
be a good signe of amendment; yet the growth of grace is not
properly signified by every such sufferance: For when this dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
begins, amendment also begins, and goes on in proportion
to the increment of this. To endure a reproof without adding
a new sin is the first step to amendments, that is, to endure it
without scorn, or hatred, or indignation. 2. The next is to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
reproof without excusing our selves: For he that is apt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
himself is onely desirous in a civill manner to set the reproof
aside, and to represent the charitable monitour to be too hasty in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
his judgement, and deceived in his information; and the fault to
dwell there, not with himself. 3. Then he that proceeds in this
instance admits the reprovers sermon, or discourse, without a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
regret: he hath no secret murmurs, or unwillingnesses to the
humiliation, but is onely ashamed that he should deserve it: but
for the reprehension it self, that troubles him not; but he looks
on it as his own medicine, and the others charity. 4. But if to
this he addes, that he voluntary confesses his own fault, and of
his own accord vomits out the loads of his own intemperance,
and eases his spirit of the infection, then it is certain he is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
a professed and hearty enemy against sin, but a zealous, and a
prudent, and an active person against all its interest; and never
counts himself at ease but while he rests upon the banks of <hi>Sion,</hi>
or at the gates of the temple; never pleased but in vertue and
religion: Then he knows the state of his soul, and the state of
his danger, he reckons it no objection to be abased in the face of
man, so he may be gracious in the eyes of God: And that's a signe
of a good grace, and a holy wisdom; <hi>That man is grown in the
grace of God,</hi> and <hi>in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. Justus
in principio sermonis est accusator sui,</hi> said the Wise man, <hi>The righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
accuseth himself in the beginning:</hi> that is, quickly, lest he
be prevented: And certain it is, he cannot be either wise or good
that had rather have a reall sin within him, then that a good man
should beleeve him to be a repenting sinner; that had rather <hi>keep
his crime,</hi> then <hi>lose his reputation;</hi> that is, rather to <hi>be so,</hi> then to
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:53465:100"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
               <hi>be thought so,</hi> rather be without the favour of God, then of his
neighbour. Diogenes once spied a young man coming out of a
Tavern, or place of entertainment; who perceiving himself ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
by the Philosopher, with some confusion stepped back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
that he might (if possible) preserve his fame with that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
person. But Diogenes told him, <hi>Quanto magis intraveris tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
magis eris in cauponâ:</hi> The more you go back, the longer you
are in the place where you are ashamed to be seen; and he that
conceals his sin, still retains that which he counts his shame, and
his burden. Hippocrates was noted for an ingenious person, that
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> he published and confessed his errour concerning the futures of
the head: and all ages since Saint Austin have called him <hi>pious,</hi>
for writing his book of retractations, in which he published his
former ignorances and mistakes, and so set his shame off to the
world, invested with a garment of modesty, and above half chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
before they were seen. I did the rather insist upon this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
because it is a consideration of huge concernment, and
yet much neglected in all its instances and degrees. We neither
confesse our shame, nor endure it; we are privately troubled, and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> publikely excuse it; we turn charity into bitternesse, and our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof
into contumacy and scorne; and who is there amongst us
that can endure a personall charge? or is not to be taught his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall
duty, by generall discoursings, by parable and apologue, by
acts of insinuation and wary distances? but by this state of persons
we know the estate of our own spirits.</p>
            <p>When God sent his Prophets to the people, and <hi>they stoned
them with stones, and sawed them asunder, and cast them into dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons,
and made them beggers,</hi> the people fell into the condition
of Babylon, <hi>Quam curavimus &amp; non est sanata; We healed her</hi> (said
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the Prophets) <hi>But she would not be cured: Derelinquamus eam,</hi> that's
her doom; let her enjoy her sins and all the fruits of sin laid up
in treasures of wrath against the day of vengeance and retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution.</p>
            <p>6. He that is grown in grace, and the knowledge of Christ
esteems no sin to be little or contemptible; none fit to be cherished
or indulged to. For it is not onely inconsistent with the love of
God, to entertain any undecency or beginning of a crime, any
thing that displeases him, but he alwayes remembers how much
it cost him to arrive at the state of good things, whether the grace
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of God hath already brought him: He thinks of the prayers and
tears, his restlesse nights, and his daily fears, his late escape, and
his present danger, the ruines of his former state, and the difficult
and imperfect reparations of this new; his proclivity and aptnesse
to vice, and naturall aversnesse and uneasie inclinations to the
strictnesse of holy living; and when these are considered truly,
they naturally make a man unwilling to entertaine any begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:53465:101"/>
of a state of life contrary to that which with so much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
and difficulty, through so many objections and enemies he hath
attained. And the truth is, when a man hath escaped the dangers of
his first state of sin, he cannot but be extreamly unwilling to return
again thither, in which he can never hope for heaven: (and so it
must be) for a man must not flatter himself in a small crime, and
say as Lot did when he begged a reprieve for Zoar, <hi>Alas Lord, is
it not a little one and my soul shall live?</hi> And it is not therefore to
be entertained because it is little; for it is the more without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse,
if it be little; the temptations to it are not great; the allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
not mighty; the promises not insnaring, the resistance easie; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
and a wise man considers, it is a greater danger to be overcome
by a little sin, then by a great one; <hi>a greater danger</hi> (I say) not
directly, but accidentally; not in respect of the crime, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the person: for he that cannot overcome a small crime, is
in the state of infirmity, so great, that he perishes infallibly, when
he is arrested by the sins of a stronger temptation: But he that
easily can, and yet will not; he is in love with sin, and courts his
danger, that he may at least kisse the apples of Paradise, or feast
himself with the parings: since he is by some displeasing instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
affrighted from glutting himself with the forbidden fruit,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
in ruder and bigger instances: But the well-grown Christian is cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
of his newly trimmed soul, and like a nice person with clean
clothes, is carefull that no spot or stain fully the virgin whitenesse
of his robe: whereas another whose <hi>albes of baptisme</hi> are sullied
in many places with the smoak and filth of Sodom and unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
cares not in what paths he treads, and a shower of dirt chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
not his state, who already lies wallowing in the puddles of
impurity; It makes men negligent and easie, when they have an
opinion or certain knowledge that they are persons extraordinary
in nothing; that a little care will not mend them; that another <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
sin cannot make them much worse: But it is as a signe of a tender
conscience, and a reformed spirit, when it is sensible of every al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration,
when an idle word is troublesom, when a wandering
thought puts the whole spirit upon its guard; when too free a
merriment is wiped off with a sigh and a sad thought, and a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
recollection, and a holy prayer: Polycletus was wont to
say, That they had work enough to do, who were to make a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruious
picture of clay and dirt, when they were to take accounts
for the handling of mud and morter: A mans spirit is naturally
carelesse of baser and uncostly materials; but if a man be to work <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
in gold, then he will save the filings, and his dust, and suffer not a
grain to perish: And when a man hath laid his foundations in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
stones, he will not build vile matter, stubble and dirt upon
it: So it is in the spirit of a man; If he have built upon the rock
Christ Jesus, and is grown up to a good stature in Christ, he will
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:53465:101"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> not easily dishonour his building nor lose his labours, by an incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
entertainment of vanities and little instances of sin; which
as they can never satisfie any lust or appetite to sin; so they are like
a flie in a box of ointment, or like little follies to a wise man,
they are extreamly full of dishonour and disparagement, they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>array
a mans soul of his vertue, and dishonour him for cockle-shels
and baubles, and tempt to a greater folly: which every man, who
is grown in the knowledge of Christ, therefore carefully avoids,
because he fears a relapse, with a fear as great as his hopes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
are, and knowes that the entertainment of small sins do but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> a mans resolutions to disband, they unravel and untwist his
holy purposes, and begin in infirmities and proceed in folly, and
end in death.</p>
            <p>7. He that is grown in grace pursues vertue for its own interest,
purely and simply without the mixture and allay of collateral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes,
and equally inclining purposes; God in the beginning of our
returns to him entertains us with promises and threatnings, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
of temporal advantages, with fear and shame, and
with reverence of friends and secular respects, with reputation
and coercion of humane laws and at first men snatch at the lesser and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> lower ends of vertue and such rewards are visible, and which God
sometimes gives in hand to entertain our weak, and imperfect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires:
The young Philosophers were very forward to get the
precepts of their sect, and the rules of severity, that they might dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
with Kings, not that they might reform their own man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
and some men study to get the ears and tongues of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
rather then to gain their souls to God; and they obey good
laws, for fear of punishment, or to preserve their own peace and
some are worse they do good deeds out of spite, and <hi>preach Christ
out of envy,</hi> or to lessen the authority and fame of others: some
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of these lessen the excellency of the act, others spoil it quite: it is
in some, imperfect, in others, criminal; in some it is consistent
with a beginning infant-grace, in others it is an argument of the state
of sin and death: but in all cases, the well grown Christian, he
that improoves or goes forward in his way to heaven, brings ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
forth, not into discourses and panegyrickes, but into his life and
manners; his vertue although it serves many good ends acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally,
yet by his intention it onely suppresses his inordinate
passions, makes him temperate and chast, casts out his devils of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> drunkennesse and lust, pride and rage, malice and revenge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it
makes him useful to his brother and a servant of God; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
these flowers cannot choose but please his eye, and delight
his smell, yet he chooses to gather honey, and licks up the dew
of heaven and feasts his spirit upon the Manna, and dwells not
in the collateral usages and accidental sweetnesses which dwell at
the gates of the other senses, but like a Bee loads his thighs with
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:53465:102"/>
wax and his bag with honey; that is, with the useful parts of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
in order to holinesse and felicity. Of which the best signes
and notices we can take will be if we as earnestly pursue vertues
which are acted in private, as those whose scene lies in publick, If
we pray in private, under the onely eye of God and his ministring
angels as in Churches; if we give our almes in secret rather then
in publick; if we take more pleasure in the just satisfaction of our
consciences, and securing our reputation; if we rather pursue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence
then seek an excuse; if we desire to please God, though
we lose our fame with men; if we be just to the poorest servant
as to the greatest prince, if we choose to be among the jewels of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
God though we be the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the off-scouring of the world;
if when we are secure from witnesses and accusers and not obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the notices of the law, we think our selves obliged by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and practise, and live accordingly; then our services and
intentions in vertue are right<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then we are past the twilights of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
and the umbrages of the world, and walk in the light of
God, of his word, and of his spirit, of grace and reason, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
<hi>not babes,</hi> but <hi>men in christ Jesus.</hi> In this progresse of grace
I have not yet expressed, that perfect persons should serve God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
out of mere love of God and the divine excellencies, without the
considerations of either heaven or hell; such a thing as that is tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
of in mystical Theology. And I doubt not but many good per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
come to that growth of Charity that the goodnesse and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of God are more incumbent and actually pressing upon
their spirit then any considerations of reward: But then I shall adde
this; that when persons come to that hight of grace (or contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
rather) and they love God for himself and do their duties in
order to the fruition of him and his pleasure; <hi>all that,</hi> is but heaven
in another sense, and under another name; just as the mystical The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
is the highest duty and the choicest parts of obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a new method: but in order to the present, that which I call
a signification of our growth in grace, is a pursuance of vertue up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such reasons as are propounded to us, as motives in Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
(such as are to glorifie God, and to enjoy his promises in the
way, and in our country, to avoid the displeasure of God, and to
be united to his glories) and then to exercise vertue in such parts
and to such purposes as are useful to good life, and profitable to
our neighbours; not to such onely where they serve reputation,
or secular ends. For though the great Physitian of our souls hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
mingled profits and pleasures with vertue to make its chalice sweet
and apt to be drank off, yet he that takes out the sweet ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
and feasts his palate with the lesse wholsome part, because it
is delicious, serves a low end of sense or interest, but serves not
God at all; and as little does benefit to the soul: such a person is
like Homers bird, deplumes himselfe to feather all the naked callows
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:53465:102"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that he sees, and holds a taper that may light others to heaven, while
he burns his own fingers: but a well grown person, out of habit and
choice out of love of vertue and just intention goes on his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
in straight wayes to heaven, even when the bridle and coercion
of laws or the spurs of interest or reputation are laid aside and
desires witnesses of his actions, not that he may advance his fame,
but for reverence and fear, and to make it still more necessary to
do holy things.</p>
            <p>8. Some men there are in the beginning of their holy walking
with God, and while they are babes in Christ, who are presently
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> busied in delights of prayers, and rejoyce in publick communion,
and count all solemn assemblies, festival; but as they are pleased
with them, so they can easily be without them; It is a signe of a
common and vulgar love onely to be pleased with the company
of a friend, and to be as well with out him, <hi>amoris at morsum
qui verè senserit,</hi> he that ha's felt the stings of a sharp and very dear
affection is impatient in the absence of his beloved object, the soul
that is sick and swallowed up with holy fire loves nothing else; all
pleasures else seem unsavory, company is troublesome, visitors
are tedious, homilies of comfort are flat and uselesse. The plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of vertue to a good and perfect man are not like the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes
of Nard Pistick, which is very delightful when the box is
newly broken, but the want of it is no trouble; we are well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
without it; but vertue is like <hi>hunger and thirst</hi> it
must be satisfied or we die; and when we feel great longings af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
religion and faintings for want of holy nutriment, when a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
of the word and sacraments is more intolerable; and we
think our selves really most miserable, when the Church doors
are shut against us, or like the Christians in the persecution of the
Vandals, who thought it worse then death, that there Bishops were
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> taken from them; If we understand excommunication, or Church
censures (abating the disreputation and secular appendages) in the
sense of the spirit to be a misery next to hell it self, then we have
made a good progresse in the Charity and grace of God; till then
we are but pretenders, or infants, or imperfect, in the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
in which our affections are cold, and our desires remisse; For
a constant and prudent zeal is the best testimony of our mascu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
and vigorous heats, and an houre of fervour is more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to God then a moneth of luke-warmnesse, and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 9 But as some are active onely in the presence of a good object,
but remisse and carelesse for the want of it, so on the other side an
infant grace is safe in the absence of a temptation, but falls easily,
when it is in presence: He therefore that would understand if he
be grown in grace, may consider if his safety consists onely <hi>in peace,</hi>
or in <hi>the strength of the spirit.</hi> It is good that we will not seek out
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:53465:103"/>
opportunities to sin; but are not we too apprehensive of it, when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
it is presented? or do we not sink under when it presses us? can we
hold our tapers neer the flames and not suck it in greedily like
<hi>Naphtha</hi> or prepared <hi>Nitre?</hi> or can we like the children of the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
walk in the midst of slames and not be scorched or consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,?
Many men will (not like Judah) go into high wayes and
untie the girdles of harlots; But can you reject the importunity of
a beautious and an imperious Lady, as Joseph did we had need pray
that we be <hi>not led into temptation;</hi> that is, not onely into the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,
but not into the allurements and neighbour-hood of it, least
by little and little our strongest resolutions be untwist, and crack <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
in sunder like an easie cord severed into single threds: but if we
by the necessity of our lives, and manner of living, dwell where
a temptation will assault us, then to resist, is the signe of a great grace;
but such a signe, that without it, the grace turns into wantonnesse,
and the man into a beast, and an angel into a Devil. R. Moses
will not allow a man to be a true penitent untill he hath left all his
sin, and in all the like circumstances refuses those temptations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which formerly he sinned and died: and indeed it may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
that such a trial onely can secure our judgement concerning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
our selves: and although to be tried in all the same accidents be
not safe, nor alwayes contingent, and in such cases it is sufficient
to resist all the temptations we have, and avoid the rest and decree
against all, yet if it please God we are tempted, as David was by
his eyes, or the Martyrs by tortures, or Joseph by his wanton
Mistris, then to stand sure and to ride upon the temptation like
a ship upon a wave, or to stand like a rock in an impetuous storm,
thats the signe of a great grace and of a well-grown Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</p>
            <p>10. No man is grown in grace but he that is ready for every <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
work, that chooses not his employment, that refuses no imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from God or his superiour; a ready hand, an obedient heart,
and a willing cheerful soul in all the work of God and in every
office of religion is a great <hi>index</hi> of a good proficient in the wayes
of Godlinesse. The heart of a man is like a wounded hand or
arme, which if it be so cured that it can onely move one way and
cannot turn to all postures and natural uses it is but imperfect, and
still half in health, and half wounded: so is our spirit; if it be
apt for prayer and close fisted in almes, if it be sound in faith and
dead in charity, if it be religious to God and unjust to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
there wants some integral part, or there is a lamenesse; and
the deficiency in any one duty implyes the guilt of all (said Saint
James) and <hi>bonum ex integrâ causâ malum exquâlibet particulari,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
fault spoils a grace. But one grace alone cannot make a good
man. But as to be universal in our obedience is necessary to the
being in the state of grace: so readily to change imployment from
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:53465:103"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the better to the worse, from the honourable to the poor, from use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to seemingly unprofitable, is a good Character of a well grown
Christian, if he takes the worst part with indifferency and a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
equally choosing all the events of the divine providence. Can
you be content to descend from ruling of a province to the keeping
of a herd: from the work of an Apostle to be confined into a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
from disputing before Princes to a conversation with Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds?
can you be willing to all that God is willing, and suffer
all that he chooses as willingly as if you had chosen your own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune?
In the same degree, in which you can conform to God, in
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the same you have approached towards that perfection whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we must by degrees arrive in our journey towards
heaven.</p>
            <p>This is not to be expected of <hi>beginners;</hi> for they must be enticed
with apt imployments; and it may be, their office and work so
fits their spirits, that it makes them first in love with it, and then
with God for giving it; and many a man goes to heaven in the
dayes of peace, whose faith, and hopes, and patience would have
been dashed in pieces, if he had fallen into a storm or persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>Oppression will make a wise man mad</hi> (saith Solomon): there are
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> some usages that will put a sober person out of all patience, such
which are besides the customes of this life, and contrary to all his
hopes, and unworthy of a person of his quality: and when <hi>Nero</hi>
durst not die, yet when his servants told him that the Senators had
condemned him to be put to death <hi>more Majorum,</hi> that is, by scourg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
like a slave, he was forced into a preternatural confidence, and fel
upon his own sword; but when God so changes thy estate that
thou art fallen into accidents to which thou art no otherwise di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed,
but by grace and a holy spirit, and yet thou canst passe
through them with quietnesse, and do the work of suffering as well
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> as the works of a prosperous imployment; this is an argument of a
great grace and an extraordinary spirit. For many persons in a
change of fortune perish, who if they had still been prosperous
had gone to heaven; being tempted in a persecution to perjuries
and Apostacy and unhandsome complicances, and hypocricy, and
irreligion: and many men are brought to vertue, and to God, and
to felicity by being persecuted and made unprosperous: and
these are effects of a more absolute and irrespective predestinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but when the grace of God is great and prudent, and mascu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and well grown, it is unalter'd in all changes, save onely that
every accident that is new and violent brings him neerer to God,
and makes him with greater caution and severity to dwell in
vertue.</p>
            <p>11. Lastly, some there are who are firme in all great and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen
changes and have laid up in the store-houses of the spirit
<hi>(reason and religion)</hi> arguments and discourses enough to defend
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:53465:104"/>
them against all violencies and stand at watch so much, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
they are safe where they can consider, and deliberate; but there
may be something wanting yet; and in the direct line, in the strait
progresse to heaven, I call that an infallible signe of a great grace,
and indeed the greatest degree of a great grace, when a man is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
against sudden invasions of the spirit, surreptions and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary
assaults: Many a valiant person dares sight a battle who
yet will be timorous and surprised in a mid-night alarme; or if he
falls into a river; And how many discreet persons are there, who,
if you offer them a sin, and give them time to consider, and tell
them of it before hand, will rather die then be perjured, or tell <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
a deliberate lie, or break a promise; who (it may be tell many
sudden lies, and excuse themselves, and break their promises,
and yet think themselves safe enough; and sleep without either
affrightments, or any apprehension of dishonour done to their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
or their religion. Every man is not armed for all sudden ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
of passions: few men have cast such fetters upon their lusts
and have their passions in so strict confinement, that they may not
be over run with a midnight flood or an unlooked for inundation;
He that does not start when he is smitten suddenly, is a constant
person: and that is it which I intend in this instance; that he is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
a perfect man and well grown in grace, who hath so habitual a
resolution and so unhasty and wary a spirit, as that he decrees up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
no act before he hath considered maturely, and changed the
sudden occasion into a sober counsel David by chance spied
Pathsheba washing her self, and being surprised, gave his heart
away before he could consider, and when it was once gone, it
was hard to recover it; and sometimes a man is betrayed by a
sudden opportunity and all things fitted for his sin ready at the
door; the act stands in all its dresse, and will not stay for an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swear;
and inconsideration is the defence and guard of the sin,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
and makes that his conscience can the more easily swallow it what
shall the man do then? unlesse he be strong by his old strengths,
by a great grace, by an habitual vertue, and a sober unmoved
spirit, he falls and dies in the death and hath no new strengths; but
such as are to be imployed for his recovery; none for his present
guard; unlesse upon the old stock, and if he be a well grown
Christian.</p>
            <p>These are the parts, acts, and offices of our growing in grace,
and yet I have sometimes called them signes; but they are signes,
as eating and drinking are signes of life, they are <hi>signes</hi> so as also <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
they are <hi>parts of life;</hi> and these are parts of our growth in grace,
so that a man can grow in grace to no other purpose but to these or
the like improvements.</p>
            <p>Concerning which I have a caution or two to interpose. 1. The
growth of grace is to be estimated as other morall things are, not
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:53465:104"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> according to the growth of things naturall: Grace does not grow
by observation, and a continuall efflux, and a constant proportion;
and a man cannot call himself to the account for the growth of
every day, or week, or moneth; but in the greater portions of
our life, in which we have had many occasions and instances to
exercise and improve our vertues, we may call our selves to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;
but it is a snare to our consciences to be examined in the
growth of grace in every short resolution of solemn duty, as against
every Communion, or great Festivall. 2. Growth in grace is not
alwayes to be discerned either <hi>in single instances,</hi> or <hi>in single gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Not in single instances; for every time we are to exercise a
vertue, we are not in the same naturall dispositions, nor do we meet
with the same circumstances, and it is not alwayes necessary that
the next act should be more earnest and intence then the former;
<hi>all single acts</hi> are to be done after the manner of men, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are not alwayes capable of increasing; and they have their
termes beyond which easily they cannot swell: and therefore if it
be a good act and zealous, it may proceed from a well grown
grace, and yet a younger and weaker person may do some acts as
great and as religious as it; But neither do single graces alwayes
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> affoord a regular and certain judgement in this affair; for some
persons at the first, had rather die then be unchast, or perjured:
and <hi>greater love then this no man hath, that he lay down his life</hi> for
God: he cannot easily grow in the substance of that act; and if
other persons, or himself, in processe of time do it more cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or with fewer fears, it is not alwayes a signe of a greater grace,
but sometimes of greater collaterall assistances, or a better habit of
body, or more fortunate circumstances: for he that goes to the
block tremblingly for Christ; and yet endures his death certainly,
and endures his trembling too, and runs through all his infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and the bigger temptations; looks not so well many times in
the eyes of men, but suffers more for God, then those confident
Martyrs that courted death in the primitive Church; and therefore
may be much dearer in the eyes of God: But that which I say in
this particular, is that a smallnesse in one, is not an argument of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the imperfection of the whole estate: Because God does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
give to every man occasions to exercise, and therefore not
<hi>to improve</hi> every grace; and the passive vertues of a Christian are
not to be expected to grow so fast in prosperous, as in suffering
Christians: but in this case we are to take accounts of our selves by
the improvement of those graces which God makes to happen of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in our lives; such as are charity and temperance in young men,
liberality and religion in aged persons, ingenuity and humility in
schollers, justice in merchants and artificers, forgivenesse of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in great men, and persons tempted by law-suits; for since ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
grow like other morall habits, by use, diligence, and assiduity,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:53465:105"/>
there where God hath appointed our work and in our instances,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
there we must consider concerning our growth in grace, in other
things we are but beginners: But it is not likely that God will trie
us concerning degrees hereafter, in such things of which in this
world he was sparing to give us opportunities.</p>
            <p>3. Be carefull to observe that these rules are not all to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
<hi>negatively,</hi> but <hi>positively,</hi> and <hi>affirmatively,</hi> that is, that a
man may conclude that he is grown in grace if he observes these
characters in himself, which I have here discoursed of; but he must
not conclude <hi>negatively,</hi> that he is not grown in grace, if he cannot
observe such signall testimonies: for sometimes God covers the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
graces of his servants, and hides the beauty of his tabernacle with
goats hair, and the skins of beasts, that he may rather suffer them
to want present comfort, then the grace of humility; for it is not
necessary to preserve the gayeties and their spirituall pleasures; but
if their humility fails, (which may easily do under the sunshine of
conspicuous and illustrious graces) their vertues and themselves
perish in a sad declension. But sometimes men have not skill to
make a judgement; and all this discourse seems too artificiall to be
tried by, in the hearty purposes of religion. Sometimes they let
passe much of their life, even of their better dayes, without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
of particulars; sometimes their cases of conscience are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate,
or allayed with unavoydable infirmities; sometimes they
are so uninstructed in the more secret parts of religion, and there
are so many illusions and accidentall miscariages, that if we shall
conclude negatively in the present Question, we may produce scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
infinite, but understand nothing more of our estate, and do
much lesse of our duty.</p>
            <p>4. In considering concerning our growth in grace, let us take
more care to consider matters that concern justice, and charity,
then that concern the vertue of religion; because in this there may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
be <hi>much,</hi> in the other there cannot easily be <hi>any illusion,</hi> and cose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage.
That is a good religion that beleeves, and trusts, and hopes
in God through Jesus Christ, and for his sake does all justice, and all
charity, that he can; and our Blessed Lord gives no other descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of love to God, but obedience and keeping his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
Justice and charity are like the matter, religion is the form
of Christianity; but although the form be more noble and the
principle of life, yet it is lesse discernable, lesse materiall, and lesse
sensible; and we judge concerning the form by the matter, and
by materiall accidents, and by actions: and so we must of our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
that is, of our love to God, and of the efficacy of our prayers,
and the usefulnesse of our fastings; we must make our judgements
by the more materiall parts of our duty, that is, by sobriety, and
by justice, and by charity.</p>
            <p>I am much prevented in my intention for the perfecting of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:53465:105"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> this so very materiall consideration: I shall therefore onely tell
you, that to these parts and actions of good life, or of our
growth in grace, some have added some accidentall considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which are rather signes then parts of it: Such are. 1. To
praise all good things, and to study to imitate what we praise,
2. To be impatient that any man should excell us; not out of
envy to the person, but of noble emulation to the excellency;
For so Themistocles could not sleep after the great victory at
Marathon purchased by Miltiades; till he had made himself il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious
by equall services to his countrey. 3. The bearing of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> sicknesse patiently, and ever with improvement, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of some excellent principle, and the firm pursuing it.
4. Great devotion, and much delight in our prayers. 5. Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
inspirations, and often whispers of the Spirit of God prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting
us to devotion, and obedience, especially if we adde to this,
a constant and ready obedience to all those holy invitations.
6. Offering peace to them that have injured me, and the aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the circumstances of honour, or of right, when either
justice, or charity, is concerned in it. 7. Love to the brethren.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 8 To behold our companions, or our inferiours full of honour
and fortune; and if we sit still at home and murmur not, or if
we can rejoyce both in their honour, and our own quiet, that's
a fair work of a good man; And now 9. After all this, I will
not trouble you with reckoning a freedom from being tempted,
not onely from being overcome, but from being tried: for though
that be a rare felicity, and hath in it much safety, yet it hath
lesse honour and fewer instances of vertue, unlesse it proceed from
a confirmed and heroicall grace; which is indeed a little image
of heaven, and of a celestiall charity; and never happens signally
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to any, but to old and very eminent persons. 10. But some
also adde an excellent habit of body and materiall passions, such
as are chast and vertuous dreams, and suppose that as a disease
abuses the fancy, and a vice does prejudice it; so may an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
vertue of the soul smooth and Calcine the body, and make
it serve perfectly, and without rebellious indispositions. 11. Others
are in love with Mary Magdalens tears, and fancy the hard knees
of Saint James, and the fore eyes of Saint Peter, and the very
recreations of Saint John. <hi>Proh! quam virtute praeditos omnia de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent!</hi>
thinking all things becomes a good man; even his gestures
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and little incuriosities: And though this may proceed from a great
love of vertue, yet because some men do thus much and no
more, and this is to be attributed to the lustre of vertue, which
shines a little thorow a mans eye-lids, though he perversely winks
against the light; yet as the former of these two is too Metaphysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call;
so is the later too Phantasticall: he that by the fore-going
materiall parts and proper significations of a growing grace does
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:53465:106"/>
not understand his own condition, must be content to work on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
still <hi>super totam materiam,</hi> without considerations of Particulars;
he must pray earnestly, and watch diligently, and consult with
prudent Guides, and ask of God great measures of his Spirit, and
<hi>hunger and thirst after righteousnesse:</hi> for he that does so, shall
certainly <hi>be satisfied:</hi> and if he understands not his present good
condition, yet if he be not wanting in the down right endeavours
of piety, and in hearty purposes, he shall then finde that he is
grown in grace when he springs up in the resurrection of the just,
and shall be ingrafted upon a tree of Paradise, which beareth fruit
for ever, <hi>Glory to God,</hi> rejoycing to Saints and Angels, and eternall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
felicity to his own pious, though undiscerning soul.</p>

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:53465:107"/>
habits and degrees of perversnesse, that the very kindes of them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
are reducible to a method, and make up the part of a science:
There are variety of stages and descents to death; as there
are diversity of torments, and of sad regions of misery in hell,
which is the centre and kingdom of sorrows. But that we may a
little refresh the sadnesses of this consideration; for every one of
these stages of sin. God hath measured out a proportion of mercy;
for if sin abounds, grace shall much more abound, and God hath
concluded all under sin, not with purposes to destroy us, but, <hi>Vt
omnium misereatur, that he might have mercy upon all;</hi> that light
may break forth from the deepest inclosures of darknesse, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
mercy may rejoyce upon the recessions of justice, and grace may
triumph upon the ruins of sin, and God may be glorified in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
of our conversion, and the wonders of our preservation,
and glories of our being saved. There is no state of sin, but if we
be persons capable (according to Gods method of healing) of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
antidotes, we shall finde a sheet of mercy spread over our
wounds and nakednesse. If our diseases be small, almost necessary,
scarce avoidable, then God does, and so we are commanded to
cure them, and cover them with a vail of pity, compassion, and
gentle remedies: If our evils be violent, inveterate, gangrened <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
and incorporated into our nature by evil customes, they must be
pulled from the flames of hell with censures, and cauteries, and
punishments, and sharp remedies, quickly and rudely; their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
is present and sudden, its effect is quick and intolerable, and
there is no soft counsels then to be entertained; they are already
in the fire; but they may be saved for all that; so great, so infinite,
so miraculous is Gods mercy, that he will not give a sinner over,
though the hairs of his head be singed with the flames of hell;
Gods desires of having us to be saved continue, even when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to be damned; even till we will not be saved, and are gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
Gods method, and all the revelations of his kindnesse. And
certainly that is a bold and a mighty sinner whose iniquity is sweld
beyond all the bulk and heap of Gods revealed loving kindnesse:
If sin hath sweld beyond grace and superabounds over it, that sin
is gone beyond the measures of a man; such a person is removed
beyond all the malice of humane nature, into the evil and spite of
Devils, and accursed spirits; there is no greater sadnesse in the
world then this. God hath not appointed a remedy in the vast
treasures of grace for some men, and some sins; they have sinned
like the falling Angels; and having over run the ordinary evil <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
inclinations of their nature, they are without the protection of
the divine mercy; and the conditions of that grace which was
designed to save all the world, was sufficient to have saved
twenty. This is a condition to be avoyded with the care of God
and his Angels, and all the whole industry of man. In order to
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:53465:107"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> which end my purpose now is to remonstrate to you the several
states of sin, and death, together with those remedies which God
had proportioned out to them, that we may observe the evils of
the least, and so avoid the intolerable mischiefs of the greater, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of those sins which still are within the power and possibilities
of recovery, lest insensibly we fall into those sins and into those
circumstances of person for which Christ never died, which the
Holy Ghost never means to cure, and which the eternal God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
will pardon; for there are of this kinde more then common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men imagine, whilest they amuse their spirits with gaietyes
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and false principles, till they have run into horrible impieties, from
whence they are not willing to withdraw their foot, and God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
never to snatch and force them thence.</p>
            <p>1. [Of some have compassion] and these I shall reduce to four
heads or orders of men and actions; all which have their proper
cure proportionable to their proper state, gentle remedies to the
lesser irregularities of the soul. The first are those that sin without
observation of their particular state; either because they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>instructed
in the special cases of conscience, or because they do an
evil against which there is no expresse commandment. It is a sad
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> calamity, that there are so many milions of men and women that
are entred into a state of sicknesse and danger, and yet are made to
believe they are in perfect health; and they do actions concerning
which they never made a question whether they were just or no;
nor were ever taught by what names to call them. For while they

think they are bound to consider: these men are to be pitied and
instructed, they are to be called upon to use religion like a daily
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:53465:108"/>
diet; their consciences must be made tender and their Catechis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
enlarged; teach them, and make them sensible and they are
cured.</p>
            <p>But the other in this place are more considerable; Men sin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
observation because their actions have no restraint of an expresse
Commandment, no letter of the law to condemn them by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
sentence. And this happens, when the crime is comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
under a general notion without the instancing of particulars;
for if you search over all the Scripture you shall never finde <hi>incest
named</hi> and marked with the black character of death; and there
are diveres sorts of uncleannesse, to which Scripture therefore gives <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
no name, because she would have them have no being; And it
had been necessary that God should have described all particulars
and all kindes, if he had not given reason to man. For so it is fit
that a guide should point out every turning, if he be to teach a childe
or a fool to return under his fathers roof: But he that bids us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
intemperance for fear of a feaver, supposes you to be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
instructed that you may avoid the plague; and when to
look upon a woman with lust is condemned, it will not be necessary
to adde, you must not do more, when even the least is forbidden; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
and when to uncover the nakednesse of Noah brought an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
plague upon the posterity of Cham, it was not necessary that
the law-giver should say, you must not ascend to your fathers bed,
or draw the curtains from your sisters retirements. When the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians
forbad to transports figs from Athens, there was no need
to name the gardens of Alcibiades, much lesse was it necessary to
adde that Chabrias should send no plants to Sparta. What so ever is
comprised under the general notion, and partakes of the common
nature and the same iniquity, needs no special prohibition, unlesse
we think we can mock God and elude his holy precepts with an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
absurd trick of mistaken Logick. I am sure that will not save us
harmlesse from a thunderbolt.</p>
            <p>2. Men sin without an expresse prohibition when they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
a thing that is <hi>like</hi> a forbidden evil. And when Saint Paul had
reckoned many works of the flesh, he addes <hi>[and such like.]</hi> all that
have the same unreasonablenesse &amp; carna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ty. For thus, poligamy is
unlawful; for if it be not lawful for a Christian to put away his wife
and marry another (unlesse for adultery) much lesse may he keep
a first and take a second, when the first is not put away; If a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
may not be drunk with wine, neither may he be drunk with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
passion; if he may not kill his neighbour, neither then must he
tempt him to sin; for that destroyes him more: if he may not
wound him, then he may not perswade him to intemperance, and
a drunken feaver; if it be not lawful to cozen a man, much lesse
is it permitted that he make a man a fool, and a beast, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to every mans abuse and to all ready evils. And yet men are
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:53465:108"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> taught to start at the one half of these, and make no conscience of
the other half; whereof some have a greater basenesse then the
other that are named, and all have the same unreasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
            <p>3. A man is guilty, even when no law names his action, if he
does any thing that is a cause or an effect, a part or unhandsome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct
of a forbidden instance; he that forbad all intemperance, is as
much displeased with the infinite of foolish talk that happens at
such meetings, as he is at the spoiling of the drink and the destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the health. If God cannot endure wantonnesse, how can he
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> suffer lascivious dressings, tempting circumstances, wanton eyes,
high diet? if idlenesse be a sin, then al immoderate mispending of our
time, all long and tedious games, all absurd contrivances how to
throw away a precious hour and a <hi>day of salvation</hi> also, are against
God and against religion. He that is commanded to be charitable
it is also intended he should not spend his money vainely, but be
a good husband and provident that he may be able to give to the
poor, as he would be to purchase a Lordship, or pay his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
portion: and upon this stock it is that Christian religion forbids
jeering, and immoderate laughter and reckon <hi>jestings</hi> amongst the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
               <hi>things that are unseemly.</hi> This also would be considered.</p>
            <p>4. Besides the expresse laws of our religion, there is an universal
line and limit to our passions and designes, which is called <hi>the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology
of Christianity;</hi> that is, the proportion of its sanctity and
strictnesse of its holy precepts. This is not forbidden, but does
this become you? Is it decent to see a Christian live in plenty and
ease and heap up mony and never to partake of Christs passions,
there is no law against a Judge, his being a dresser of gardens or a
gatherer of Sycamore fruits, but it becomes him not, and deserves
a reproof. If I do exact justice to my neighbour and cause him to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> be punished legally for all the evils he makes me suffer, I have
not broken a fragment from the stony tables of the law: but this
is against the <hi>analogy of our religion;</hi> It does not become a Disciple
of so gentle a master to take all advantages that he can. Christ, that
quitted all the glories that were essential to him, and that grew
up in his nature when he lodged in his Fathers bosom, Christ that
suffered all the evils due for the sins of mankinde, himself remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
most innocent, Christ, that promised persecution, injuries and
affronts as part of our present portion, and gave them to his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
as a legacy, and gave us his spirit to enable us to suffer inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and made that the parts of suffering evils should be the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of three or four Christian graces, of <hi>patience</hi> of <hi>fortitude of longa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity</hi>
and <hi>perseverance;</hi> he that of eight beatitudes made that five
of them should be instanced in the matter of humiliation and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
temporal inconvenience, <hi>that blessed Master</hi> was certainly
desirous that his Disciples should take their crowns from the crosse,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:53465:109"/>
not from the evennesse and felicities of the world; He intended <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
we should give something, and suffer more things, and forgive all
things, all injuries whatsoever; and though together with this
may consist our securing a just interest; yet in very many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
we shall be put to consider how far it becomes us, to quit
something of that, to pursue peace; and when we have secured
the letter of the law, that we also look to its analogy; when we
do what we are striectly bound to, then also we must consider
what becomes us, who are disciples of such a Master, who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
with such principles, charmed with so severe precepts and
invited with the certainty of infinite rewards. Now although this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
discourse may seem new and strange, and very severe, yet it is
infinitely reasonable, because Christianity is a law of love, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
services; it can in no sense be confined with laws and strict
measures; well may the Ocean receive its limits, and the whole
capacity of fire be glutted, and the grave have his belly so full, that it
shal cast up al its bowels and disgorge the continual meal of so many
thousand years; but love can never have a limit; and it is indeed to
be <hi>swallowed up</hi> but nothing can <hi>fill</hi> it but God, who hath no bound.
Christianity is a law for sons, not for servants; and God that gives <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
his grace without measure, and rewards without end, and acts of
favour beyond our askings, and provides for us beyond our needs,
and gives us counsels beyond commandments, intends not to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
out by the just evennesses and stricken measures of the words
of a commandment. Give to God <hi>full measure, shaken together, pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
down, heaped up, and running over;</hi> for God does so to us; and
when we have done so to him, we are infinitely short of the
least measure of what God does for us; <hi>we are still unprofitable
servants.</hi> And therefore as the breaking any of the laws of
Christianity provoks God to anger, so the prevaricating in <hi>the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
analogy</hi> of Christianity stirres him up to jealousie: He hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to suspect our hearts are not right with him, when we are
so reserved in the matter and measures of our services: and if we
will give God but just what he calls for by expresse mandate, it
is just in him to require all of that at our hands without any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement
&amp; then we are sure to miscarry. And let us remember that
when God said he was <hi>a jealous God</hi> he expressed the meaning of it
to be, he did punish to <hi>the third and fourth generation.</hi> Jelousie is
like the rage of a man: but if it be also like the anger of God,
it is insupportable and will crush us into the ruines of our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
grave.</p>
            <p>But because these things are not frequently considered, there
are very many sins committed against religion, which because the
commandment hath not marked men, refuse to mark, and think
God requires no more. I am entred into a sea of matter, which I
must not now prosecute; but I shall onely note this to you that it is
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:53465:109"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> but reasonable, we should take accounts of our lives, by <hi>the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
as well as by the <hi>expresse rules,</hi> of our religion; because in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
and civil actions all the nations of the world use so to call
their subjects to account. For that which in the accounts of men
is called <hi>reputation</hi> and <hi>publick honesty,</hi> is the same which in religion
we call <hi>analogy</hi> and <hi>proportion;</hi> in both cases there being some things,
which are besides the notices of laws, and yet are the most certain
consignations of an excellent vertue. He is a base person that does
any thing against <hi>publick honesty</hi> and yet no man can be punished if
he marries a wife the next day after his first wives funeral: and so
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> he that prevaricates the proportions and excellent reasons of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
is a person <hi>without zeal,</hi> and <hi>without love:</hi> and unlesse care
be taken of him he will quickly be <hi>without religion.</hi> But yet these
I say are a sort of persons which are to be used with gentlenesse,
and treated with compassion; for no man must be handled rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to force him to do a kindnesse: and coercion of laws and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Judges, serjeants and executioners are against offenders of
commandments; But the way to cure such persons is the easiest
and gentellest remedy of all others. They are to be instructed in
all the parts of duty, and invited forward by the consideration
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of the great rewards which are laid up for all the sons of God,
who serve him without constraint, without measures and allayes,
even as fire burns, and as the roses grow, even as much as they
can, and to all the extent of their natural and artificial capacities
For it is a thing fit for our compassion, to see men fettered in the
<hi>iron bands of laws</hi> and yet to break <hi>the golden chains of love</hi> but
all those instruments which are proper to enkindle the love
of God and to turn fear into charity are the proper instances of that
compassion which is to be used towards these men.</p>
            <p>2. The next sort of those who are in the state of sin, and yet to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> be handled gently and <hi>with compassion</hi> are those who entertain
themselves with the beginnings and little entrances of sin, which
as they are to be more pitied because they often come by reason
of inadvertancy, and an unavoidable weaknesse in many degrees,
so they are more to be taken care of, because they are underval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
&amp; undiscernably run into inconvenience; when we see a childe
strike a servant rudely, or jeere a silly person, or wittily cheat his
play-fellow, or talk words light as the skirt of a summer garment,
we laugh and are delighted with the wit and confidence of the boy;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and incourage such hopeful beginnings; and in the mean time
we consider not that from these beginnings he shall grow up till
he become a Tyrant, an oppressor, a Goat and a Traytor. <hi>Nemo
simul malus fit &amp; malus esse cernitur; sicut nec scorpijs tum innas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuntur
stimuli cum pungunt</hi> No man is discerned to be vitious so
soon as he is so, and vices have their infancy and their childe-hood
and it cannot be expected that in a childs age should be the vice
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:53465:110"/>
of a man; that were monstrous as if he wore a beard in his cradle; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
and we do not believe that a serpents sting does just then grow when
he stricks us in a vital part: The venome and the little spear was
there, when it first began to creep from his little shell: And little
boldnesses and looser words and wranglings for nuts, and lying
for trifles, are of the same proportion to the malice of a childe, as
impudence and duels and injurious law-suits, and false witnesse
in judgement &amp; perjuries are in men. And the case is the same when
men enter upon a new stock of any sin; the vice is at first apt to
be put out of countenance and a little thing discourages it; and it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muses
the spirit with words, and phantastick images, and cheape <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
instances of sin; and men think themselves safe because they are as
yet safe from laws, and the sin does not as yet out cry the health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
noise of Christs loud cryings and intercession with his Father,
nor call for thunder or an amazing judgement; but according
to the old saying <hi>the thornes of Dauphine will never fetch blood if they
do not scratch the first day:</hi> &amp; we shal finde that the little undecencies
and riflings of our souls, the first openings and disparkings of our
vertue differ onely from the state of perdition, as infancy does from
old age, as sicknesse from death; It is the entrance into those regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
whether whosoever passes finally, shall lie down and groan with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
an eternal sorrow. Now in this case it may happen that a compassion
may ruine a man, if it be the pity of an indiscreet mother, and nurse
the sin from its weaknesse to the strength of habit and impudence;
The compassion that is to be used to such persons is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
of a Phisitian or a severe Tutor; chastise thy infant-sinne
by discipline, and acts of vertue; and never begin
that way from whence you must return with some trouble,
and much shame, or else if you proceed, you finish your eternal
ruine.</p>
            <p>He that means to be temperate and avoid the crime and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
of being a drunkard must not love to partake of the songs or
to bear a part in the foolish scenes of laughter which destract wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and fright her from the company; And Lavina that was
chaster then the elder Sabines, and severer then her Philosophical
guardian, was wel instructed in the great lines of honour and cold ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
to her husband; but when she gave way to the wanton ointments
&amp; looser circumstances of the <hi>Baie</hi> and bathed often in <hi>Avernus,</hi> and
from thence hurried to the companies and dressings of <hi>Lucrinus,</hi>
she quenched her honour, and gave her vertue and her body as a
spoil to the follies and intemperance of a young gentle-man. For <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
so have I seen the little purles of a spring sweat thorow the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of a bank and intenerate the stubborn pavement till it hath
made it fit for the impression of a childes foot, and it was despised
like the descending pearls of a misty morning, till it had opened its
way, and made a stream large enough to carry away the ruines of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:53465:110"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the undermined strand, and to invade the neighbouring gardens:
but then the despised drops were grown into an artificial river and
an intolerable mischief: so are the first entrances of sin, stop'd with
the antidotes of a hearty prayer, and checked into sobriety, by the
eye of a Reverend man, or the counsells of a single sermon: But
when such beginnings are neglected and our religion hath not in it
so much Philosophy as to think any thing evil as long as we can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
it, they grow up to ulcers and pestilential evils; they destroy
the soul by their aboad, who at their first entry might have been
killed with the pressure of a little finger.</p>

from the kingdom of Heaven,</hi> but they are not within its portion;
and let me say this, that although little sins have not yet made our
condition desperate but left it easily recoverable, yet it is a condition
that is quite out of Gods favour: although they are not far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
in their progresse to ruine, yet they are not at all in the state
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of grace, and therefore though they are to be pitied and relieved ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
yet that supposes the incumbency of a present misery.</p>
            <p>3. There are some very much to be pitied and assisted because
they are going to hell and (as matters stand with them) they cannot,<note place="margin">Seneca.</note>
or they think they cannot avoid it. <hi>Quidam ad alienum dormiunt
somnum ad alienum edunt appetitum: amare &amp; odisse (res omnium
maximè liberas) jubentur.</hi> There are some persons whose life is so
wholly in dependance from others, that they sleep when others
please; they eat and drink according to their Masters appetite, or
intemperance: they are commanded to <hi>love or hate,</hi> and are not
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> left free in the very Charter and priviledges of nature: <hi>Miserum est
servire sub Dominis parùm felicibus,</hi> for suppose the Prince or the
Patron be vitious, suppose he calls his servants to bathe their souls
in the goblets of intemperance: if he be also imperious (for such
persons love not to be contradicted in their vices) it is the losse of
that mans fortune, not to lose his soul: and it is the servants excuse
and he esteems it also his glory, that he can tell a merry tale, how
his Master and himself did swim in drink, till they both talked like
fools, and then did lie down like beasts.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> —<hi>Facinus quos inquinat aequat.</hi> There is then no
difference, but that the one is the fairest bull and the master of the
heard. And how many Tenents and Relatives are known to have a
servile conscience and to know no affirmation or negation but such
as shall serve their Land-lords interest? Alas the poor men live by
it, and they must beg their bread if ever they turn recreant, or shall
offer to be honest. There are some trades whose very foundations
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:53465:111"/>
is laid in the vice of others; and in many others if a threed of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
do not quite run thorow all their negotiations, they decay into
the sorrows of beggery; and therefore they will support their
neighbours vice, that he may support their trade: And what would
you advise those men to do, to whom a false oath is offered to
their lips, and a dagger at their heart: their reason is surprized, and
their choice is seized upon, and all their consultation is arrested;
and if they did not prepare before hand, and stand armed with reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and perfect resolutions, would not any man fall, and think
that every good man will say his case is pitiable. Although no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
is bigger then the grace of God, yet many temptations are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
greater then our strengths, and we do not live at the rate of a mighty
and a victorious grace.</p>
            <p>Those persons which cause these vitious necessities upon their
brethren will lie low in hell; but the others will have but small
comfort in feeling a lesser damnation.</p>
            <p>Of the same consideration it is, when ignorant people are Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techized
into false doctrine, and know nothing but such principles
which weaken the nerves, and enfeeble the joynts of holy living;
they never heard of any other; those that follow great and evil <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
examples; the people that are ingaged in the publike sins of a
kingdom wihch they understand not, and either must venture to
be undone upon the strength of their own little reasonings, and
weak discoursings, or else must go <hi>quâ itur, non quâ eundum est,</hi> there
where the popular misery hath made the way plain before their
eyes, though it be uneven and dangerous to their consciences.
In these cases I am forced to reckon a Catalogue of mischiefs;
but it will be hard to cure any of them. Aristippus in his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
was a great flatterer of Dionysius of Sicily, and did own
doctrines which might give an easinesse to some vices, and knew <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
not how to contradict the pleasures of his Prince; but seemed like
a person disposed to partake of them, that the example of a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher,
and the practise of a King might do countenance to a
shamefull life. But when Dionysius sent him two women, slaves,
fair, and young, he sent them back and shamed the easinesse of
his doctrine by the severity of his manners, he daring to be ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
when he was alone, though in the presence of him, whom
he thought it necessary to flatter, he had no boldnesse to own
the vertue: So it is with too many; if they be left alone, and
that they stand unshaken with the eye of their tempter, or the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
of their Lord, they go whither their education or their
custome carries them: but it is not in some natures to deny the
face of a man, and the boldnesse of a sinner; and which is yet worse,
it is not in most mens interest to do it; these men are in a pitiable
condition, and are to be helped by the following rules.</p>
            <p>1. Let every man consider that he hath two relations to serve,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:53465:111"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and he stands between God and his Master, or his neerest relative:
and in such cases it comes to be disputed whether interest be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred;
which of the persons is to be displeased, God or my Master,
God or my Prince, God or my Friend? If we be servants of the
man; remember also that I am a servant of God; adde to this,
that if my present service to the man be a slavery in me, and a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
in him, yet Gods service is a noble freedom: And Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius
said well. It was for slaves to lie, and for free men to speak
the truth. <hi>If you be freed by the blood of the Son of God, then you
are free indeed:</hi> and then consider how dishonourable it is to lie,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to the displeasure of God, and onely to please your fellow-ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.
The difference here is so great, that it might be sufficient
onely to consider the antithesis. Did the man make you what you
are? Did he pay his blood for you, to save you from death? Does he
keep you from sicknesse? True. You eat at his table; but they are
of Gods provisions that he and you feed of. Can your master free
you from a fever, when you have drunk your self into it? and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
your innocence when you have forsworn your self for his
interest? Is the change reasonable? He gives you meat and drink
for which you do him service. But is not he a Tyrant, and an usur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>per,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> an oppressor, and an extortioner, if he will force thee to give
thy soul for him? to sell thy soul for old-shoes, and broken bread?
But when thou art to make thy accounts of eternity, will it be taken
for an answer, My Patron, or my Governour, my Prince, or my
Master, forced me to it? or if it will not. Will he undertake a por<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tion
of thy flames? or if that may not be, will it be in the midst
of all thy torments, any ease to thy sorrows to remember all the
rewards and clothes, all the money, and civilities, all the cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
looks, and familiarity, and fellowship of vices which in your
life time made your spirit so gay and easie? It will in the eternall
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> loads of sorrow, adde a duplicate of groans and indignation, when
it shall be remembred for how base and trifling interest, and upon
what weak principles we fell sick and died eternally.</p>
            <p>2. The next advise to persons thus tempted is, that they
would learn to separate duty from mistaken interest; and let them
be both served in their just proportions, when we have learned
to make a difference. A wife is bound to her husband in all his
just designes, and in all noble usages and Christian comportments:
But a wife is no more bound to pursue her husbands vitious ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treds,
then to serve and promote his unlawfull and wandring loves:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> It is not alwayes a part of duty to think the same propositions, or
to curse the same persons, or to wish him successe in unjust de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes:
And yet the sadnesse of it is, that a good woman is easily
tempted to beleeve the cause to be just, and when her affection
hath forced her judgement, her judgement for ever after shall
carry the affection to all its erring and abused determinations. A
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:53465:112"/>
friend is turned a flatterer if he does not know, that the limits of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
friendship extend no further then the pale and inclosures of reason
and religion. No Master puts it into his covenant that his servant
shall be drunk with him, or give in evidence in his Masters cause,
according to his Masters scrolls: and therefore it is besides and
against the duty of a servant to sin by that authority; it is as if he
should set Mules to keep his sheep, or make his Dogs to carry bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
it is besides their nature and designe; and if any person falls
under so tyrannicall relation, let him consider how hard a Master he
serves; where the Devil gives the imployment, and shame is his
entertainment, and sin is his work, and hell is his wages. Take <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
therefore the counsel of the son of Syrac.<note place="margin">Ecclus. 4. 22.</note> 
               <hi>Accept no person against
thy soul, and let not the reverence of any man cause thee to fall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. When passion mingles with duty, and is a necessary instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of serving God, let not that passion run its own course and
passe on to liberty, and thence to licence and dissolution: but let
no more of it be entertained, then will just do the work. For no
zeal of duty will warrant a violent passion to prevaricate a duty.
I have seen some officers of Warre in passion and zeal of their
duty, have made no scruple to command a souldier with the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
of cursing and accents of swearing, and pretended they could
not else speak words effective enough, and of sufficient authority;
and a man may easily be overtaken in the issues of his government;
while his authority serves it still with passion, if he be not curious
in his measures, his passion will also serve it self upon the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and over rule the Ruler.</p>
            <p>4. Let every such tempted person remember, that all evil comes
from our selves and not from others; and therefore all pretences
and prejudices, all commands and temptations, all opinions and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities,
are but instances of our weaknesse, and arguments of our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
folly: For unlesse we listed, no man can make us drink beyond
our measures: And if I tell a lie for my Masters or my friends ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
it is because I prefer a little end of money, or flattery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
my honour and my innocence. They are huge follies which
go up and down in the mouthes and heads of men. <hi>[He that knows
not how to dissemble, knows not how to reigne.</hi> [He that will not do
as his company does, must go out of the world, and quit all soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
of men: We create necessities of our own, and then think we
have reason to serve their importunity. <hi>Non ego sum ambitiosus,
sed nemo aliter Romae potest vivere, non ego sumptuosus, sed urbs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
ipsa magnas impensas exigit. Non est meum vitium quod iracundus
sum, quod nondum constitui certum vitae genus adolescentia haec facit.</hi>
The place we live in makes us expensive, the state of life I have
chosen renders me ambitious, my age makes me angry or lustfull,
proud or peevish. These are nothing else but resolutions never to
mend as long as we can have excuse for our follies, and untill we
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:53465:112"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> can cozen our selves no more. There is no such thing as a necessity
for a Prince to dissemble, or for a servant to lie, or for a friend to
flatter, for a civil person and a sociable, to be drunk: we cozen
our selves with thinking the fault is so much derivative from others,
till the smart and the shame falls upon our selves, and covers our
heads with sorrow. And unlesse this gap be stopped, and that we
build our duty upon our own bottoms, as supported with the grace
of God, there is no vice but may finde a Patron; and no age or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
or state of life, but will be an engagement to sin: And we
shall think it necessary to be lustfull in our youth, and revengefull
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> in our manhood, and covetous in our old age: and we shall perceive
that every state of men, and every trade and profession, lives upon
the vices of others, or upon their miseries; and therefore they will
think it necessary to promote, or to wish it. If men were tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
Physitians would be poor: and unlesse some Princes were am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious,
or others injurious, there would be no imployment for
souldiers. The Vintners retail supports the Merchants trade, and
it is a vice that supports the Vintners retail; and if all men were
wise and sober persons, we should have fewer beggers, and fewer
rich; and if our Law-givers should imitate Demades of Athens,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> who condemned a man that lived by selling things belonging to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls,
as supposing he could not choose but wish the death of men,
by whose dying he got his living, we should finde most men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
criminalls, because vice is so involved in the affairs of the
world, that it is made the support of many trades and the businesse
of great multitudes of men: Certainly from hence it is that iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
does so much abound; and unlesse we state our questions right,
and perceive the evil to be designed onely from our selves, and that
no such pretence shall keep off the punishment <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the shame from
our selves, we shall fall into a state which is onely capable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> because it is irrecoverable: and then we shall be infinitely
miserable, when we can onely receive an u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>lesse and ineffective pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Whatsoever is necessary cannot be avoided: He therefore that
shall say, he cannot avoid his sin, is out of the mercies of this Text:
they who are appointed Guides, &amp; Physitians of souls cannot to any
purpose do their offices of pity. It is necessary that we serve God,
and do our duty, and secure the interest of our souls, and be as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to preserve our relations to God, as to our friend, or Prince.
But, if it can be necessary for any man, in any condition to sin, it is
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> also necessary for that man to perish.</p>

with compassion, is of them that interrupt the course
of an honest life with single acts of sin, stepping aside
and <hi>starting like a broken bowe;</hi> whose resolution stands fair, and
their hearts are towards God, and they sojourn in religion, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
dwell there; but that like evil husbands they go abroad, and
enter into places of dishonour and unthriftinesse. Such as these,
all stories remember with a sad character; and every narrative <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
concerning David which would end in honour and fair report,
is sullied with the remembrances of <hi>Bathsheba:</hi> and the Holy Ghost
hath called him <hi>a man after Gods own heart, save in the matter of
Vriah;</hi> there indeed he was a man after his own heart; even then
when his reason was stolne from him by passion, and his religion
was sullied by the beauties of a fair woman. I wish we lived in
an age in which the people were to be treated with, concerning
renouncing the single actions of sin, and the seldome interruptions
of piety: Men are taught to say, that every man sins in every acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he does; and this is one of the doctrines, for the beleeving of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
which he shall be accounted a good man; and upon this ground it
is easie for men to allow themselves some sins, when in all cases,
and in every action it is unavoidable. I shall say nothing of the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Question, save that the Scripture reckons otherwise, * and in the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> accounts of Davids life reckon but one great sin, * and in Zachary
and Elizabeth gave a testimony of an unblameable conversation;
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:53465:113"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>* and Hezekiah did not make <hi>his confession</hi> when he prayed to God
in his sicknesse and said <hi>he had walked uprightly before God,</hi> * and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
therefore Saint Paul after his conversion designed and laboured <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
hard, &amp; therefore certainly with hopes to accomplish it, that <hi>he might
keep his conscience void of offence both towards God and towards
man,</hi> * and one of Christs great purposes is to present his whole <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
               <hi>Church pure and spotlesse to the throne of grace,</hi> and * <hi>Saint John the</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
               <hi>Baptist</hi> offended none but <hi>Herod,</hi> * and no pious Christian brought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
a bill of accusation against the holy Virgin Mother; * certain it is,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>
that God hath given us precepts of such a holinesse and such a
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> purity, such a meeknesse and such humility as hath no pattern but
Christ, no precedent but the purities of God: and therefore it is
intended we should live with a life whose actions are not check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er'd
with white and black, half sin and half vertue: Gods sheep
are not like Jacobs flock streaked and spotted: it is an intire ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
that God requires, and will not endure to have a holy course
interrupted by the dishonour of a base and ignoble action. I do
not mean that a mans life can be as pure as the Sun or the rayes of
celestial Jerusalem; but like the Moon in which there are spots;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> but they are no deformity; a lessening onely and an abatement of
light, no cloud to hinder and draw a vail before its face; but
sometimes it is not so serene and bright as at other times. Every
man hath his indiscretions and infirmities, his arrests and sudden
incursions, his neighbourhoods and semblances of sin, his little
vidences to reason and peevish melancholy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and humorous
Phantastick discourses; unaptnesses to a d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>t, and may die of the sicknesse,
die eternally. This happens more frequently in persons of an infant
piety, when the vertue is not corroborated by a long abode and
a confirmed resolution, and an usual victory and a triumphant
grace, and the longer we are accustomed to piety the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequent
will be the little breaches of folly, and a returning sin.
But as the needle of a compasse, when it is directed to its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
star, at the first addresses waves on either side, and seems
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> indifferent in his courtship of the rising or declining sun, and when it
seems first determined to the North, stands a while trembling, as
if it suffered inconvenience in the first fruition of its desires and
stands not still in a full enjoyment till after, first, a great variety
of motion, and then an undisturbed posture: so is the piety, and
so is the conversion of a man; wrought by degrees and several
steps of imperfection; and at first our choices are wavering, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:53465:114"/>
by the grace of God and yet not perswaded, and then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
but not resolved, and then resolved but deferring to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
and then beginning, but (as all beginnings are) in weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and uncertainty, and we flie out often into huge indiscretions
and look back to Sodom and long to return to Egypt; and when
the storm is quite over we finde little bublings and unevennesses
upon the face of the waters, we often weaken our own purposes
by the returns of sin, and we do not call our selves <hi>conquerours</hi>
till by the long possession of vertues it is a strange and unusual,
and therefore an uneasy and unpleasant thing to act a crime. When
Polemon of Athens by chance coming into the schools of Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
was reformed upon the hearing of that one lecture, some
wise men gave this censure of him; <hi>peregrinatus est hujus animus
in nequitiâ, non habitavit,</hi> his minde wandred in wickednesse and
travelled in it, but never dwelt there; the same is the case of some
men; they make inroads into the enemies countrey, not like ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to spoil, but like Dinah to be satisfied with the stranger beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the land, till their vertues are defloured and they enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
tragedies, and are possessed by death, and intolerable sorrows;
but because this is like the fate of Jacobs daughter and happens
not by designe, but folly, not by malice, but surprise, not by the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
strength of will, but by the weaknesse of grace, and yet car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
a man to the same place whether a great vice usually does,
it is hugely pitiable, and the persons are to be treated with
compassion and to be assisted by the following considerations and
exercises.</p>
            <p>First let us consider, that for a good man to be overtake in a
single crime is the greatest dishonour and unthriftinesse in the whole
world. <hi>As a fly in a box of ointment, so is a little folly to him who
is accounted wise,</hi> said the <hi>Son of Sirach:</hi> No man chides a fool
for his weaknesses, or scorns a childe for playing with flies and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
the present appetite, before all the possibilities of to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
event: But men wondered when they saw <hi>Socrates</hi> ride
upon a cane; and when Solomon laid his wisdom at the foot of
Pharaohs daughter, and changed his glory for the interest of wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
sleep, he became the discourse of heaven and earth: and men
think themselves abused, and their expectation cousened when they
see a wise man do the actions of a fool, and a good man seized up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by the dishonours of a crime. But the losse of his reputation
is the least of his evil. <hi>It is the greatest improvidence in the world</hi> to
let a healthful constitution be destroyed in the surfet of one night.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
For although, when a man by the grace of God and a long endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
hath obtained the habit of Christian graces, every single
sin does not spoil the habit of vertue, because that cannot be
lost but as it was gotten, that is, by parts, and succession, yet eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
crime interrupts <hi>the acceptation</hi> of the grace, and makes the man
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:53465:114"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to enter into the state of enmity, and displeasure with God. The
habit is onely lessened <hi>naturally,</hi> but <hi>the value</hi> of it is wholly taken
away: and in this sence is that of Josephus <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
which Saint <hi>James</hi> well renders.<note place="margin">2 Chap. 11.</note> 
               <hi>He that
keeps the whole law and offends in one point is guilty of all;</hi> that
is, if he prevaricates in any commandment, the transgression of
which by the law was capital, shall as certainly die as if he broke
the whole law; and the same is the case of those single actions
which the school calls deadly sins, that is, actions of choice in any sin
that hath a <hi>name,</hi> and makes a <hi>Kinde</hi> &amp; hath a distinct <hi>matter.</hi> And sins
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> once pardoned return again to al the purposes of mischief. If we by
a new sin forfeit Gods former loving kindnesse. <hi>When the righteous
man turneth from his righteousnesse and commiteth iniquity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 18. 24.</note> 
               <hi>all his
righteousnesse that he hath done shall not be remembred, in the tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
that he hath trespassed, and in the sin that he hath sinned, in
them shall he die.</hi> Now then consider how great a fool he is who
when he hath with much labour &amp; by suffering violence contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his first desires; when his spirit hath been in agony and care,
and with much uneasinesse hath denied to please the lower man,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> when with many prayers and groans and innumerable sighs and
strong cryings to God with sharp sufferances and a long severity,
he hath obtained of God to begin his pardon and restitution, and
that he is in some hopes to return to Gods favour, and that he
shall become an heire of heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when some of his amazing
fears and distracting cares begin to be taken off, when he begins to
think, that now it is not certain he shall perish in a sad eternity,
but he hopes to be saved and he considers how excellent a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
that is, <hi>he hopes when he dies to go to God,</hi> and that he
shall never enter into the possession of Devils; and this state, which
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> is but the twilight of a glorious felicity, he hath obtained with
great labour and much care, and infinite danger; that this man
should throw all this structure down, and <hi>then when</hi> he is ready
to reap the fruits of his labours, by one indiscreet action, to set
fire upon his corn fields, and destroy all his dearly earned hopes,
for the madnesse and loose wandrings of an hour; This man is an
indiscreet gamester; who doubles his stake as he thrives, and
at one throw is dispossessed of all the prosperities of a luckie
hand.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> They that are poor (as Plutarch observes) are carelesse of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
things, because by saving them, they think no great moments
can accrue to their estates, and they despairing to be rich, think
such frugality impertinent: But they that feele their banks swell,
and are within the possibilities of wealth, think it useful if they
reserve the smaller minuts of expence, knowing that every thing
will adde to their heap; but then after long sparing, in one night
to throw away the wealth of a long purchase, is an imprudence
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:53465:115"/>
becoming none but such persons who are to be kept under Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>

deadly sin destroyes the rewards of a seven years piety; I adde to
this, that God is more impatient at a sin committed by his servants
then at many by persons that are his enemies; and an uncivil an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
from a son to a Father, from an obliged person to a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor
is a greater undecency, then if an enemy should storm
his house or revile him to his head. Augustus Caesar taxed all the
world and God took no publick notices of it; but when David
taxed and numbered a petty province it was not to be expiated
without a plague; because such persons, besides the direct sin,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
adde the circumstance of ingratitude to God, who hath <hi>redeemed
them from their vain conversation and from death,</hi> and from hell,
and consigned them to the inheritance of sons and given them his
grace and his spirit, and many periods of comfort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a certain
hope and visible earnests of immortality; nothing is baser then
that such a person against his reason, against his interest, against
his God, against so many obligations, against his custome,
against his very habits and acquired inclinations should do an
action.</p>
            <q>Quam nisi Seductis nequeas committere Divis <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
            </q>
            <p>Which a man must for ever be ashamed of, and like Adam must
run from God himself to do it, and depart from the state in which
he had placed all his hopes, and to which he had designed all his
labours. The consideration is effective enough, if we sum up the
particulars; for he that hath lived well and then falls into a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate
sin, is infinitely dishonoured, is most imprudent, most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe,
and most unthankful.</p>
            <p>2. Let persons tempted to the single instances of sin in the midst <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
of a laudable life, be very careful that they suffer not themselves
to be drawn aside by the eminency of great examples. For some
think <hi>drunkennesse</hi> hath a little honesty derived unto it by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Noah, and <hi>Adultery</hi> is not so scandalous and intolerably dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honorable,
since <hi>Bathsheba</hi> bathed, and <hi>David</hi> was defiled and
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:53465:115"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> men think a flight is no cowardise, if a General turns his head
and runs.</p>
            <q>Pompeio fugiente timent</q>
            <p>Well might all the gowned Romans fear when Pompey fled,
and who is there that can hope to be more righteous then David,
or stronger then Samson, or have lesse hypocrisy then Saint Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or be more temperate then Noah? These great examples bear
men of weak discourses and weaker resolutions from the severity
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of vertues. But as Diagoras to them that shewed to him the votive
garments of those that had escaped shipwrack upon their prayers
and vows to Neptune answered, that they kept no account of those
that prayed and vowed, and yet were drowned: So do these men
keep catalogues of those few persons who broke the third of a fair
life in sunder with the violence of a great crime, and by the grace of
God recovered and repented and lived; But they consider not
concerning those infinite numbers of men, who died in their first fit
of sicknesse, who after a fair voyage have thrown themselves o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> boord, and perished in a sudden wildnesse, One said well, <hi>Si quid
Socrates, aut Aristippus contra morem et consuetudinem fecerunt, idem
sibi ne arbitretur licere. Magnis enim illi &amp; divinis bonis hanc licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
assequebantur.</hi> If Socrates did any unusual thing, it is not for
thee who art of an ordinary vertue to assume the same licence; For
he by a divine and excellent life hath obtained leave or pardon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively,
for what thou must never hope for, till thou hast arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to the same glories. First be as devout as <hi>David,</hi> as good a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
as Saint Peter, and then thou wilt not dare with designe to act
that, which they fell into by surprize; and if thou doest fall as
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> they did, by that time thou hast also repented like them, it may
be said concerning thee, that thou dist fall and break thy bones,
but God did heal thee and pardon thee, Remember that all the
damned soules shall bear an eternity of torments for the pleasures
of a short sinfulnesse; but for a single trasient action, to die for ever,
is an intolerable exchange and the effect of so great a folly, that
whosoever falls into and then considers it, it will make him mad
and distracted for ever.</p>
            <p>3. Remember, that since no man can please God or bE par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of any promises, or reap the reward of any actions in the

according to the capacities of a man so <hi>taught,</hi> and so <hi>tempted,</hi> and
so <hi>assisted,</hi> such a person must be curious that he be not cozened
with the duties and performances of any one relation, 1. Some
there are that think all our religion consists in prayers and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
or private offices of devotion, and not in moral actions or
entercourses of justice and temperance, of kindnesse and friendships
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:53465:116"/>
of sincerity and liberality, of chastity and humility, of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
and obedience: indeed no humour is so easie to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited
as devotion, and yet no hypocrisy is more common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
men, nor any so uselesse as to God; for it being an addresse
to him alone who knows the heart and all the secret purposes, it
can do no service in order to heaven, so long as it is without <hi>the
power of Godlinesse,</hi> and the energy and vivacity of a holy life.
God will not suffer us to commute a duty, because all is his due;
and <hi>religion</hi> shall not pay for the want of <hi>temperance:</hi> if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutest

judge themselves by the censures that Kings and Princes give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
them, or as they are spoken of by their betters, and so
make false judgements concerning their condition. For our bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to whom we show our best parts, to whom we speak with
caution and consider what we represent, they see our arts and our
dressings, but nothing of our nature and deformities; Trust not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
their censures concerning thee, but to thy own opinion of thy self,
whom thou knowest in thy retirements and natural peevishnesse
and unhandsome inclinations, and secret basenesse, 3. Some men
have been admired abroad, in whom the wife and the servant never
saw any thing excellent: <hi>a rare judge</hi> and <hi>a good common-wealths man</hi>
in the streets, and publick meetings, and <hi>a just man</hi> to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and <hi>charitable to the poor;</hi> for in all these places the man is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
and kept in awe by the Sun, by light and by voices; But this

            <p>So when a Libian Tiger drawn from his wilder forragings is
shut up and taught to eat civil meat and suffer the authority of a

fear and reverence for his meat: But if he chance to come again

            </q>
            <p>He scarce abstains from eating those hands that brought him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline
and food: so is the nature of a man made tame and gentle
by the grace of God, and reduced to reason, and kept in awe by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and lawes and by an awfull vertue is taught to forget those
alluring and sottish relishes of sin: but if he diverts from his path,
and snatches handfuls from the wanton vineyards, and remembers
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the lasciviousnesse of his unwholesome food that pleased his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
palate, then he grows sick again, and hungry after unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
diet, and longs for the apples of Sodom. A man must walk
thorow the world without eyes, or ears, fancy, or appetite, but
such as are created and sanctified by the grace of God; and being
once made a new man, he must serve all the needs of nature by the
appetites and faculties of grace: nature must be wholly a servant,
and we must so look towards the deliciousnesse of our religion,
and the rayishments of heaven, that our memory must be for ever
uselesse to the affairs and perceptions of sin: we cannot stand, wee
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> cannot live, unlesse we be curious and watchfull in this particular.</p>
            <p>By these and all other arts of the Spirit, if we stand upon our

            <p>He that robs a garden of Coleworts, and carries away an arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

accordingly:</p>

            </q>
            <p>The Poet that Sejanus condemned for dishonouring the memory
of <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> was not an equall criminall with Cataline, or Grac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus:
and Simon Magus and the Nicolaitans committed crimes
which <hi>God hated,</hi> more then the complying of S. Barnabas, or the
dissimulation of S. Peter; and therefore God does treat these persons
severally: Some of these are restrained with a fit of sicknesse, some
with a great losse; and in these there are degrees, and some ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
at death. And in this manner God scourged the Corinthians
for their irreverent and disorderly receiving the Holy Sacrament.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
For although even the least of the sins that I have discoursed of,
will lead to death eternall, if their course be not interrupted, and
the disorder chastised, yet because we do not stop their progresse
instantly, God many times does, and visits us with proportionable
judgements, and so not onely checks the rivulet from swelling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
rivers and a vastnesse, but plainly tells us, that although smaller
crimes shall not be punished with equall severity as the greatest,
yet even in hell there are eternal rods as well as eternal scorpions;
and the smallest crime that we act with an infant-malice, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
deliberation, shall be revenged with the lesser stroaks of wrath;
but yet with the infliction of a sad eternity. But then that we also
should make a difference, is a precept concerning Church discipline,
and therefore not here proper to be considered, but onely as it may
concern our own particulars in the actions of repentance; and our
brethren in internal correction:</p>
            <q>
               <l>—assit</l>
               <l>Regula quae poenas peccatis irroget aequas,</l>

               </l>
            </q>
            <p>Let us be sure that we neglect no sin, but repent <hi>for every one,</hi>
and <hi>judge our selves for every one,</hi> according to the proportion of
the malice, or the scandall, or the danger. And although in this
there is no fear that we would be excessive; yet when we are to
reprove a brother we are sharp enough, and either by pride, or by
animosity, by the itch of government, or the indignation of an
angry minde, we run beyond the gentlenesse of a Christian Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;
we must remember that by Christs law some are to be admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
<hi>privately,</hi> some to be shamed and corrected <hi>publikely,</hi> and
beyond these, there is an <hi>abscission,</hi> or <hi>a cutting off</hi> from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
of faithfull people, <hi>A delivering over to Sathan.</hi> And to

the worst of recoverable sinners.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire.]</hi> Some sins
there are, which <hi>in their own nature</hi> are <hi>damnable,</hi> and some are
such as <hi>will certainly bring a man to damnation;</hi> the first are cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but with much danger; the second are desperate and irrecover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
when a man is violently tempted, and allured with an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
that is proportionable and pleasant to his vigorous appetite,
and his unabated, unmortified nature, this man falls into death,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> but yet we pity him as we pity a thief that robs for his necessity:
this man did not tempt himself, but his spirit suffers violence, and
his reason is invaded, and his infirmities are mighty, and his aids
not yet prevailing: But when this single temptation hath prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
for a single instance, and leaves a relish upon the palate, and
this produces another, and that also is fruitfull and swels into a
family and kinred of sin, that is, it grows first into approbation
then to a clear assent, and an untroubled conscience, thence into
frequency, from thence unto a custome, and easinesse, and a
habit, this man is fallen into the fire. There are also some single
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> acts of so great a malice that they must suppose a man habitually
sinfull before he could arrive at that height of wickednesse. No
man begins his sinfull course with killing of his Father or his
Prince; and Simon Magus had preambulatory impieties; he was
covetous and ambitious, long before he offered to buy the Holy
Ghost.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nemo repente fuit turpissimus</hi>—and
although such actions may have in them the malice and the mischief,
the disorder and the wrong, the principle and the permanent ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
of a habit and a long course of sin, yet because they never or
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> very seldom go alone, but after the praedisposition of other h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
crimes, we shall not amisse comprise them under the name of
habituall sins. For such they are, either formally or equivalently:
and if any man hath fallen into a sinfull habit, into a course and
order of sinning, his case is little lesser then desperate; but that
little hope that is remanent hath its degree according to the infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
or the growth of the habit. 1. For all sins lesse then habitual,
it is certain, a pardon is ready to penitent persons: that is, to all
that sin in ignorance, or in infirmity, by surprize, or inadvertency,
in smaller instances, or infrequent returns, with involuntary acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> or imperfect resolutions, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
said Clemens in his
Epistles: <hi>Lift up your hands to Almighty God, and pray him to be
mercifull to you in all things when you sin unwillingly;</hi> that is, in
which you sin with an imperfect choice: for no man sins against
his will directly, but when his understanding is abused by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:53465:118"/>
or an intolerable weaknesse, our wills follow their blind <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
guide, and are not the perfect mistresses of their own actions, and
therefore leave a way and easinesse to repent, and be ashamed of it;
and therefore a possibility and readinesse for pardon. And these are
the sins that we are taught to pray to God that he would pardon,
as he gives us our bread, that is, <hi>every day.</hi> For <hi>in many things we
offend all,</hi> said Saint James, that is, in many smaller matters, in
matters of surprize, or inevitable infirmity: And therefore Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices
said, that <hi>Saint Austin</hi> was used to say, That <hi>he would not
have even good and holy Priests go from this world without the sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of equall and worthy penances:</hi> and the most innocent life <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
in our account is not a competent instrument of a peremptory
confidence, and of justifying our selves: <hi>I am guilty of nothing,</hi>
(said Saint Paul) that is, of no ill intent, or negligence in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Gospel, <hi>yet I am not hereby justified,</hi> for God it may bee
knows many little irregularities, and insinuations of sin: In this case
we are to make a difference; but humility, and prayer, and
watchfulnesse, are the direct instruments of the expiation of such
sinnes.</p>
            <p>But then secondly, whosoever sins without these abating circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
that is, in great instances, in which a mans understanding
cannot be cozened; as in drunkennesse, murder, adultery, and in
the frequent repetitions of any sort of sin whatsoever, in which
a mans choice cannot be surprized, and in which it is certain there
is a love of the sin, and a delight in it, and a power over a mans
resolutions; in these cases it is a miraculous grace, and an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
change, that must turn the current and the stream of
the iniquity: and when it is begun, the pardon is more uncertain,
and the repentance more difficult, and the effect much abated, and
the man must be made miserable that he may be accursed for ever.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
            </p>
            <p>1. I say his pardon is uncertain, because there are some sins
which are unpardonable, (as I shall shew) and they are not all
named in particular, and the degrees of malice being uncertain,
the salvation of that man is to be wrought with infinite <hi>fear and
trembling.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 7. 22.</note> It was the case of Simon Magus, <hi>Repent and ask pardon
for thy sin, if peradventure the thought of thy heart may be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
thee.</hi> If peradventure;] it was a new crime, and concerning
its possibility of pardon no revelation had been made, and by ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
to other crimes it was very like an unpardonable sin; for it
was <hi>a thinking a thought against the Holy Ghost,</hi> and that was next <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
to <hi>speaking a word against him.</hi> Cains sin was of the same nature;
<hi>It is greater then it can be forgiven,</hi> his passion and his fear was too
severe and decretory: it was <hi>pardonable,</hi> but truly we never finde
that God did pardon it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. But besides this, it is uncertain in the pardon, because it
may be the time of pardon is passed, and though God hath par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:53465:118"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to other people the same sins, and to thee too sometimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
yet it may be he will not now: he hath not promised par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
so often as we sin, and in all the returns of impudence, aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and ingratitude; and it may be <hi>thy day is past,</hi> as was Jerusalems
in the day that they crucified the Saviour of the world.</p>
            <p>3. Pardon of such habitual sins is uncertain, because life is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
and such sins require much time for their abolition and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation.
And therefore although these sins are not <hi>necessariò morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fera,</hi>
that is, unpardonable, yet by consequence they become <hi>dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
because our life may be cut off before we have finished or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
those necessary parts of repentance, which are the severe
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and yet the onely condition of getting pardon. So that you may
perceive, that not onely every <hi>great single crime,</hi> but <hi>the habit of any
sin</hi> is dangerous; and therefore these persons are to be <hi>snatched</hi>
from the fire, if you mean to rescue them, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> if
you stay a day, it may be you stay too long.</p>
            <p>4. To which I adde this fourth consideration, that every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
of return is in the case of habitual sins an approach to desperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
because the nature of habits is like that of Crocodiles they grow
as long as they live; and if they come to <hi>obstinacy,</hi> or <hi>confirmation,</hi>
they are in hell already, and can never return back. For so the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonian
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Bears, when they have clasped a dart in the region of their
Liver, wheel themselves upon the wound and with anger and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
revenge strike the deadly barbe deeper, and cannot be quit
from that fatal steel, but in flying bear along that which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
make the instrument of a more hasty death: So is every vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
person struck with a deadly wound, and his own hands
forced it into the entertainments of his heart. And because it is pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to draw it forth by a sharp and salutary repentance he still
rouls and turns upon his wound, and carries his death in his bowels,
where it first entered by choice, and then dwelt by love, and at last
shall finish the tragedy by divine judgements, and an unalterable
decree.</p>
            <p>But as the pardon of these sins is uncertain, so the conditions of
restitution are hard, even to them who shall be pardoned: their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
and themselves too, must be fetched from the fire; water will
not do it, tears and ineffective sorrow cannot take off a habit, or a
great crime.</p>

               <note place="margin">Chap. 4. 1, 3.</note> but no perfect instruments of restitution. Saint James
plainly declares the possibilities of pardon to great sins, in the cases
of <hi>contention, adultery, lust,</hi> and <hi>envy,</hi> which are the four great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decencies
that are most contrary to Christianity; and in the 5. Chap.
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:53465:119"/>
he implies also a possibility of pardon to an habitual sinner, whom <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
he calls, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>one that erres from the truth,</hi>

<note place="margin">Cha. 4. ver. ult.</note> though he have sinned long; <hi>he that converts such a one, shall

            </p>
            <p>I have now done with my Text, and should adde no more
but that the nature of these sins is such that they may increase in
their <hi>weight,</hi> and <hi>duration,</hi> and <hi>malice,</hi> and then they increase in
<hi>mischief,</hi> and <hi>fatality,</hi> and so go beyond the Text. Cicero said

l. 4. Acad. Qu.</hi> The very custome of consenting in the matters of
civility is dangerous and slippery, and will quickly ingage us in er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and then we think we are bound to defend them, or else we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
are made flatterers by it, and so become vitious; and we love our
own vices that we are used to, and keep them till they are incurable,
that is, till we will never repent of them; and some men resolve ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to repent, that is, they resolve they will not be saved, <hi>they tread
under foot the blood of the everlasting covenant;</hi> those persons are in
the fire too, but they will not be pulled out: concerning whom
Gods Prophets must say as once concerning Babylon, <hi>Curavimus
&amp; non est sanata, derelinquamus eam,</hi> We would have healed them,
but they would not be healed, let us leave them in their sins, and
they shall have enough of it; Onely this, those that put themselves <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
out of the condition of mercy are not to be endured in Christian
societies; they deserve it not, and it is not safe that they should be
suffered.</p>
            <p>But besides all this, I shall name one thing more unto you; for</p>
            <q>
               <l>—nunquam adeò foedis adeoquè pudendis,</l>
               <l>Vtimur exemplis, ut non pejora supersint.</l>
            </q>
            <p>There are some single actions of sin of so great a malice, that in
their own nature they are beyond the limit of <hi>Gospel pardon:</hi> they
are not such things for the pardon of which God entered into cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
because they are such sins which put a man into perfect indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisions,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
and incapacities of entring into, or being in the covenant. In
the first ages of the world, <hi>Atheisme</hi> was of that nature; it was against
their whole religion; and the sin is worse now, against the whole
religion still, and against a brighter light. In the ages after the flood
<hi>idolatry</hi> was also just such another: for as God was known first one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:53465:119"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> as the <hi>creator,</hi> then he began to manifest himself in special con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
with men, and he quickly was declared the <hi>God of Israel</hi> and
<hi>idolatry</hi> perfectly <hi>destroyed all that religion,</hi> and therefore was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
pardoned intirely; but God did visit it upon them that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
and when he pardoned it in some degrees yet he also punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it in some; and yet rebellion against the supreme power of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and Aaron was worse; for that also is a perfect destruction of the
whole religion, because it refused to submit to those hands upon
which God had placed all the religion, and all the government. And
now if we would know in the Gospel what answers these precedent
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> sins? I answer, first the same sins acted by a resolute hand and heart
are worse now then ever they were: and a third or fourth is also
to be added; and that is <hi>Apostacy</hi> or <hi>or a voluntary malicious renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the faith:</hi> The Church hath often declared that sin to be unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable:
<hi>witchcraft</hi> or <hi>final impenitence,</hi> and <hi>obstinacy</hi> in any sin
are infallibly desperate: and in general, and by a certain parity of
reason, whatsoever does destroy charity or the good life of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
with the same general venom and deletery as <hi>Apostacy</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyes
<hi>faith;</hi> and he that is a <hi>Renegado</hi> from charity, is as unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable
as he that returns to solemn <hi>Atheisme</hi> or <hi>infidelity:</hi> for all
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that, is directly the sin against the holy Ghost, that is a throwing that
away wherby onely we can be Christians, wherby onely we can
hope to be saved; <hi>to speak a word against the holy Ghost</hi> in the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees,
was declared unpardonable, because it was such a word which
if it had been true, or believed, would have destroyed the whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
for they said that Christ wrought by Beelzebub, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
did not come from God: He that destroyes al the whole
order of Priesthood, destroyes one of the greatest parts of the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
&amp; one of the greatest effects of the holy Ghost: He that destroyes
government destroyes another part; but that we may come neerer
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to our selves; <hi>to quench the spirit of God</hi> is worse then to speak some
words against him; <hi>to grieve the spirit of God</hi> is a part of the same im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety,
<hi>to resist the holy Ghost</hi> is another part; and if we consider, that
every great sin does this in its proportion, it wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

us;</hi> out of this that I have spoken you may easily gather what sort
of men those are, who cannot be snatched from the fire; for whom as
<hi>S. John</hi> saies, <hi>we are not to pray,</hi> and how neer men come to it that
continue in any known sin; if I should descend to particulars, I might
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> lay a snare to scrupulous and nice consciences. This onely every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
habitual sinner does manifest the divine justice in punishing
the sins of a short life with a never dying worm, and a never quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
flame, because we have an affection to sin that no time will dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish,
but such as would increase to eternal ages; and accordingly as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man hath a degree of love, so he hath lodged in his soul a spark
which unless it be speedily &amp; effectively quenched will break forth

fits to his own purpose, and translates to the signification of
death eternal, which he first revealed clearly to the world; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
no interest of the world can make a man recompence for
his life, because to lose that, makes him incapable of enjoying the
exchange (and he were a strange fool who having no designe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
immortality or vertue, should be willing to be hanged for a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
thousand pound per annum) this argument increases infinitely
in the purpose of our Blessed Saviour; and to gain the
world, and to lose our souls in the Christian sence is infinitely more
madnesse and a worse exchange then when our souls, signifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a temporal life; and because possibly the indefinite hopes
of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lysium or an honorable name, might tempt some hardy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons

            </p>
            <p>Here then first we will consider the propositions of the exchange
the world and a mans soul, by way of supposition, supposing all
that is propounded were obtained; <hi>the whole world.</hi> Secondly we
will consider what is likely to be obtained <hi>really,</hi> and <hi>indeed</hi> of the
world, and what are really the miseries of a lost soul? For it is
propounded in the text by way of supposition: <hi>If a man should gain
the world</hi> which no man ever did, nor ever can; and he that gets
most, gets too little to be exchanged for a temporal life. And third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I shall apply it to your practise and make material considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
            </p>
            <p>1. First, then suppose a man gets all the world, what is it that
he gets? It is a bubble, and a Phantasme, and hath no reality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
a present transient use; a thing that is impossible to be enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
because its fruits and usages are transmitted to us, by parts and
by succession; (He that hath all the world, (if we can suppose
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:53465:121"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> such a man) cannot have a dish of fresh summer fruits in the midst
of winter, not so much as a green fig: and very much of its possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
is so hid, so fugacious and of so uncertain purchase, that it is like
the riches of the sea to the Lord of the shore, all the fish and wealth
within all its hollownesses are his, but he is never the better, for
what he cannot get. All the shell fishes that produce pearl, produce
them not for him; and the bowels of the earth shall hide her trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
in undiscovered retirements; so that it will signifie as much
to this great purchaser, to be intitled to an inheritance in the upper
region of the aire; he is so far from possessing all its riches, that he
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> does not so much as know of them, nor understand the Philosophy
of her minerals.</p>
            <p>2. I consider that he that is the greatest possessor in the world
enjoyes its best and most noble parts and those which are of most
excellent perfection but in common with the inferiour persons, and
the most despicable of his kingdom. Can the greatest Prince in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>close
the Sun, and set one little star in his cabinet for his own use?
or secure to himself the gentle and benigne influence of any one
constellation? Are not his subjects fields bedewed with the same
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> showers that water his gardens of pleasure?</p>
            <p>Nay those things which he esteems his ornament and his singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of his possessions, are they not of more use to others then to
himself. For suppose his garments splendid and shining like the
robe of a cherub or the clothing of the fields, all that he that
wears them enjoyes, is that they keep him warm, and clean and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest;
and all this is done by clean and lesse pompous vestmer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s;
&amp; the beauty of them which distinguishes him from others, is made
to please the eyes of the beholders; and he is like a fair bird or
the meretricious painting of a wanton woman made wholly to be
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> looked on, that is to be enjoyed by every one but himself and
the fairest face and the sparkling eye cannot perceive or enjoy
their own beauties but by reflection. It is I that am pleased with
beholding his gayety, and the gay man in his greates<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
is onely pleased because I am pleased with the sight: so
borrowing his little and imaginary complacency, from the
delight that I have, not from any inherency of his own pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session.</p>
            <p>The poorest Artizan of Rome walking in Caesars gardens, had
the same pleasures which they ministred to their Lord: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> it may be he was put to gather fruits to eat, from another
place, yet his other senses were delighted equally with Caesars: the
birds made him as good musick, the flowers gave him as sweet
smells, he there sucked as good aire, and delighted in the beauty
and order of the place, for the same reason and upon the same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
as the prince himself: save onely that Caesar paid for all
that pleasure vast summes of money, the blood and treasure of a
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:53465:122"/>
province, which the poor man had for nothing.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
            </p>
            <p>3. Suppose a man Lord of all the world, (for still we are but
in supposition) yet since every thing is received, not according to
its own gteatnesse and worth, but according to the capacity of the
receiver, it signifies very little as to our content; or to the riches of
our possession. If any man should give to a Lion a fair meadow
full of hay, or a thousand quince trees, or should give to the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Bull, the master and the fairest of the whole heard, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
fair Stags; If a man should present to a childe a ship laden
with Persian carpets, and the ingredients of the rich scarlet, all these
being either disproportionate to the appetite or to the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
could adde nothing of content, and might declare the freenesse
of the presenter, but they upbraid the incapacity of the receiver:
and so it does if God should give the whole world to any man; He
knows not what to do with it; he can use no more but according
to the capacities of a man. He can use nothing but meat and drink
and cloths; and infinite riches that can give him changes of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
every day, and a full table, do but give him a clean trencher
every bit he eats, it signifies no more but wantonnesse, and variety
to the same, not to any new purposes; He to whom the world can
be given to any purpose greater then a private estate can mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
must have new capacities created in him; He needs the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of an Angel to take the accounts of his estate; He had
need have a stomach like fire or the grave: for else he can eat no
more then one of his healthful subjects, and unlesse he hath an eye
like the Sun, and a motion like that of a thought, and a bulk as
big as one of the orbs of heaven; the pleasures of his eye can be no
greater then to behold the beauty of a little prospect from a hill, or
to look upon the heap of gold packt up in a little room, or to dote
upon a cabinet of Jewels better then which there is no man that
sees at all but sees every day; For not to name the beauties and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
sparkling diamonds of heaven, a mans or a womans or a haukes
eye is more beauteous and excellent, then al the Jewels of his crown.
And when we remember, that a beast who hath quicker senses
then a man, yet hath not so great delight in the fruition of any
object, because he wants understanding and the power to
make reflex acts upon his perception, it will follow, that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
and knowledge is the greatest instrument of pleasure,
and he that is most knowing hath a capacity to become happy,
which a lesse knowing prince or a rich person hath not: and in this
onely a mans capacity is capable of enlargement: but then although <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
they onely have power to relish any pleasure rightly, who right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
understand the nature and degrees and essences, and ends of
things, yet they that do so, understand also the vanity and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfyingnesse
of the things of this world so that the relish
which could not be great, but in a great understanding appears con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:53465:122"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> because its vanity appears at the same time; the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
sees all, and sees thorow it.</p>
            <p>4. The greatest vanity of this world is remarkable in this, that
all its joyes summed up together are not big enough to counterpoise
the evil of one sharp disease, or to allay a sorrow. For imagine a
man great in his dominion as Cyrus, rich as Solomon, victorious as
David, beloved like Titus, learned as Trismegist, powerful as all
the Roman greatnesse, all this, and the results of all this, give him
no more pleasure in the midst of a feaver, or the tortures of the
stone, then if he were only lord of a little dish, and a dishfull of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> fountain water. Indeed the excellency of a holy conscience is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and a magazine of joy, so great, that it sweetens the most bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
potion of the world, and makes tortures and death not only
tolerable, but amiable; and therefore to part with this whose ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
is so great, for the world that is of so inconsiderable a worth
as not to have in it recompence enough, for the sorrows of a sharp
disease, is a bargain fit to be made by none but fools and mad men.
Antiochus, Epiphanes &amp; Herod the great &amp; his grand child Agrippa,
were sad instances of this great truth; to every of which it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
that the grandeur of their fortune, the greatnesse of their
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> possessions, and the encrease of their estate disappeared, and expired
like Camphire at their arrest, by those several sharp diseases, which
covered their head with Cypresse and hid their crowns in an inglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
grave.</p>
            <p>For what can all the world minister to a sick person? If it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
all the spoils of nature and the choicest delicacies of land
and sea. Alas his appetite is lost, and to see a pibble stone is more
pleasing to him: For he can look upon that without loathing, but
not so upon the most delicious fare that ever made famous the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
luxury. Perfumes make his head ake; if you load him with
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> jewels, you presse him with a burden as troublesome as his grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone:
and what pleasure is in all those possessions, that cannot
make his pillow easie, nor tame the rebellion of a tumultuous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
nor restore the use of a withered hand, or straighten a crooked
finger: vain is the hope of that man whose soul rests upon vanity,
and such unprofitable possessions.</p>
            <p>5. Suppose a man lord of all this world, an universal Monarch,
as some princes have lately designed, all that cannot minister con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to him; not that content which a poor contemplative man by
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the strength of Christian Philosophy, and the support of a very small
fortune daily does enjoy. All his power and greatnesse cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the sea to overflow his shores or to stay from the retiring to the
opposit strand. It cannot make his children dutiful or wise &amp; though
the world admired at the greatness of Philip the second's fortune in
the accession of Portugal and the East Indies to his principalities, yet
this could not allay the infelicitie of his family, and the unhandsome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:53465:123"/>
of his condition in having a proud and indiscreet and a vitious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
young prince likely to inherit all his greatnesse. And if nothing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in the face of such a fortune, to tell all the world that it is
spotted and imperfect; yet there is in all conditions of the world,
such wearinesse and tediousnesse of the spirits, that a man is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
pleased with hopes of going off for the present, then in
dwelling upon that condition which it may be others admire, and
think beauteous, but none knoweth the smart of it, but he that
drank off the little pleasure, and felt the ill relish of the appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.
How many Kings have groaned under the burden of their
crowns, and have sunk down and died? How many have quitted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
their pompous cares, and retired into private lives, there to enjoy
the pleasures of Philosophy and religion, which their thrones
denied?</p>
            <p>And if we consider the supposition of the Text, the thing will
demonstrate it self. For he who can be supposed the owner and
purchaser of the whole world, must either be a King or a private
person. A private person can hardly be supposed to be the man.
For if he be subject to another, how can he be Lord of the whole
world? But if he be a King, it is certain, that his cares are greater <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
then any mans, his fears are bigger, his evils mountainous, the
accidents that discompose him are more frequent, and sometimes
intolerable: and of all his great possessions he hath not the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
use and benefit. But they are like a great harvest which more
labourers must bring in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and more must eat of; onely he is the
centre of all the cares, and they fix upon him; but the profits run
out to all the lines of the circle: to all that are about him; whose
good is therefore greater then the good of the Prince: Because
what they enjoy is the purchase of the Princes care; and so they
feed upon his cost.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

            <p>Servants live the best lives; for their care is single, onely how
to please their Lord; but all the burden of a troublesome provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and ministration, makes the outside pompous and more full
of ceremony; but they intricate the condition and disturb the quiet
of the great possessor.</p>
            <p>And imagine a person as blest as can be supposed upon the
stock of worldly interest; when all his accounts are cast up, he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
differs nothing from his subjects, or his servants, but in meer cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance,
nothing of reality or substance. He hath more to wait
at his Table, or persons of higher rank to do the meanest offices;
more ceremonies of addresse, a fairer Escutcheon, louder titles;
But can his multitude of dishes make him have a good stomack,
or does not satiety cloy it: when his high diet is such, that he is not
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:53465:123"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> capable of being feasted, and knows not the frequent delights, and
oftener possibilities, a poor man hath of being refreshed, while not
onely his labour makes hunger, and so makes his meat delicate;
(and then it cannot be ill fare, let it be what it will) but also his
provision is such, that every little addition is a direct feast to him,
while the great owner of the world giving to himself the utmost
of his desires, hath nothing left beyond his ordinary, to become the
entertainment of his festival dayes, but more loads of the same
meat.<note place="margin">Rare volte h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

condition contribute to him. In which he is not further gone beyond
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> a person of a little fortune, in the greatnesse of his possession, then
he is fallen short in the pleasures and possibility of their enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And that is a sad condition when like Midas all that the man
touches shall turn to gold: and his is no better to whom a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
full table not recreated with fasting, not made pleasant with
intervening scarcity ministers no more good then a heap of gold
does, that is, he hath no benefit of it, save the beholding of it with
his eyes. Cannot a man quench his thirst as well out of an Urn
or Chalice, as out of a whole River? It is an ambitious thirst,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and a pride of draught that had rather lay his mouth to Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
then to a petty goblet; but if he had rather, it addes not so
much to his content, as to his danger, and his vanity.</p>

            </q>
            <p>For so I have heard of persons whom the river hath swept away,
together with the Turf they pressed when they stopped to drown
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> their pride rather then their thirst.</p>
            <p>6. But this supposition hath a lessening tearm. If a man could
be born heir of all the world, it were something: But no man ever
was so; except him onely who enjoyed the least of it, the Son of
man, that had not where to lay his head: but in the supposition
it is; <hi>[If a man could [gain] the whole world,]</hi> which supposes
labour and sorrow, trouble and expence, venture and hazard, and
so much time expired in its acquist and purchase, that besides the
possession is not secured to us for tearm of life, yet our lives are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
expired, before we become estated in our purchases. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> it is a sad thing to see an ambitious, or a covetous person,
make his life unpleasant, troublesome, and vexatious, to grasp a
power bigger then himself; To fight for it with infinite hazards of
his life, so that it is a thousand to one but he perishes in the attempt,
and gets nothing at all, but an untimely grave, a reproachfull me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
and an early damnation. But suppose he gets a victory, and
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:53465:124"/>
that the unhappy party is but to begin a new game, then to see <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
the fears, the watchfulnesse, the diligence, the laborious arts to
secure a possession, lest the desperate party should recover a despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
game: And suppose this with a new stock of labours, danger
and expence, be seconded by a new successe; then to look upon the
new emergencies, and troubles, and discontents among his friends,
about parting the spoil, the envies, the jealousies, the slanders, the
underminings, and the perpetuall insecurity of his condition; all
this I say, is to see a man take infinite pains to make himself mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable;
but if he will be so unlearned, as to call this gallantry, or
a splendid fortune, yet by this time when he remembers, he hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
certainly spent much of his time in trouble; and how long he shall
enjoy this he is still uncertain; he is not certain of a moneth, and
suppose it be seven yeers, yet when he comes to die, and cast up
his accounts, and shall finde nothing remaining, but a sad remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of evils, and troubles past, and expectations of worse, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
worse, he must acknowledge himself convinced, that to gain
all this world is a fortune not worth the labour and the dangers,
the fears, and transportations of passions, though the souls losse be
not considered in the bargain.</p>
            <p>But I told you all this while, that this is but a supposition <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
still, the putting of a case, or like a fiction of love, nothing reall:
for if we consider in the second place, how much every man is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to get really, and how much it is possible for any man to get, we
shall finde the account far shorter yet, and the purchase most trifling
and inconsiderable. For 1. the world is at the same time enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by all its inhabitants, and the same portion of it by severall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in their several capacities. A Prince enjoyes his whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
not as all his people enjoyes it, but in the manner of a Prince;
the subjects in the manner of subjects. The Prince hath certain
<hi>Regalia</hi> beyond the rest; But the <hi>feudall right</hi> of subjects does <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
them more emolument, and the <hi>Regalia</hi> does the Prince more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
and these that hold the fees in subordinate right, transmit it
also to their Tenants, and beneficiaries, and dependants to publike
uses, to charity, and hospitality; all which is a lessening of the
lords possessions and a cutting his river into little streams, not that
himself alone, but that all his relatives may drink and be refreshed.
Thus the Well where the woman of Samaria sate was Jacobs
Well, and he drank of it, but so did his wives, and his children,
and his cattel; so that what we call ours, is really ours, but for
our portion of expence and use; we have so little of it, that our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
servants have far more, and that which is ours is nothing but the
title, and the care, and the trouble of securing and dispensing;
save onely that God whose stewards we all are, will call such
owners (as they are pleased to call themselves) to strict accounts
for their disbursments. And by this account the possession or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:53465:124"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> is but a word, and serves a fancy or a passion, or a vice,
but no reall end of nature; it is the use and spending it that makes
a man, to all reall purposes of nature to be the owner of it, and
in this the lord and master have but a share.</p>
            <p>But secondly, consider how far short of the whole world the
greatest Prince that ever reigned did come. Alexander that wept
because he had no more worlds to conquer, was in his knowledge
deceived, and bruitish, as in his passion; he over-run much of Asia,
but he could never passe the Ganges, and never thrust his sword
in the bowels of Europe, and knew nothing of America. And the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or the whole world began to have an appropriate sence,
and was rather put to the Romane Greatnesse as an honourable Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellative
then did signifie that they were lords of the world, who
never went beyond Persia, Egypt, nor Britain.</p>
            <p>But why do I talk of great things in this Question of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
of the soul for the world? Because it is <hi>a reall bargain,</hi>
which many men (too many God knows) do make, we must
consider it as applicable to practice. Every man that loses his soul
for the purchase of the world, must not looke to have the portion
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of a King. How few men are Princes, and of those that are not
born so, how seldom instances are found in story, of persons <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>at
by their industry became so? But we must come far lower yet.
Thousands there are that damne themselves, and yet their purchase
at long-running, and after a base and weary life spent, is but five
hundred pounds a yeer; nay it may be they onely cozen an easie
person out of a good estate, and pay for it at an easie rate, which
they obtain by lying, by drinking, by flattery, by force; and the
gain is nothing but a thousand pound in the whole, or it may bee
nothing but a convenience. Nay how many men hazard their sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> for an acre of ground, for twenty pound, to please a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
to get a smile and a kinde usage from a Superiour? These
men get but little, though they did not give so much for it. So little,
that Epictetus thought the purchase deer enough, though you paid
nothing for it but flattery, and observance, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
Observance was the price of his meal, and he paid too de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r for
one that gave his birth-right for it: but he that exchanges his soul
for it, knowes not the vanity of his purchase, nor the value of his
losse. He that gains the purchase and spoil of a kingdom hath got
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that which to all that are placed in heaven or to a man, that were
seated in the paths of the Sun seem but like a spot in an eye, or a
Mathematical point, so without vastnesse that it seems to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
dimensions. But he whose purchase is but his neighbours field,
or a few unjust acres, hath got that which is inconsiderable, below
the notice and description of the Map; for by such Hieroglyphicall
representments, Socrates chid the vanity of a proud Athenian.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:53465:125"/>
3. Although these premises may suffice to shew that the suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
purchase is but vain, and that all which men use really to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
is lesse then trifles, yet even the possession of it whatsoever
it be is not meer and unmixt, but allaid with sorrow and uneasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
the gain hath but enlarged our appetite, and like a draught
to an hydropick person, hath enraged his thirst; and still that
which he hath not is infinitely bigger then what he hath, since
the first enlargement of his purchase was not to satisfie necessity,
but his passion, his lust or his avarice, his pride or his revenge,
these things cease not by their fewell but their flames grow bigger,
and the capacities are stretched, and they want more then they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
did at first. For who wants most, he that wants five pound, or he
that wants five thousand: And supposing a man naturally suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and provided for in the dispensations of nature there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
but that the poor hath enough to fill his belly, and the
rich man can never have enough to fill his eye. The poor mans
wants are no greater then what may be supplied by charity; and
the rich mans wants are so big, that none but Princes can relieve
them, and they are left to all the temptations of great vices, and
huge cares to make their reparations.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

            </q>
            <p>If the greatnesse of the worlds possessions produce such fruits,
vexation, and care, and want, the ambitious requiring of great
estates, is but like the selling of a fountain, to buy a fever, a parting
with content, to buy necessity, and the purchase of an unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
condition, at the price of infelicity.</p>
            <p>4. He that enjoyes a great portion of this world hath most
commonly the allay of some great crosse, which although some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
God designes in mercy, to wean his affections from the world,
and for the abstracting them from sordid adherencies and cohabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
to make his eyes like stars, to fix them in the orbs of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and the regions of felicity, yet they were an inseparable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant
and condition of humanity. Solomon observed the vanity
of some persons, that heaped up great riches for their heirs, and
yet knew not whether a wise man or a fool should possesse them,
this is a great evil under the Sun. And if we observe the great crosses
many times God permits in great families, as discontent in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
artificiall or naturall bastardies, a society of man and wife
like the conjunction of two politicks, full of state, and ceremony,
and designe, but empty of those sweet caresses, and naturall hearty
complications, and endearments, usuall in meaner and innocent
persons, the perpetuall sicknesse, fulnesse of diet, fear of dying,
the abuse of flatterers, the trouble and noise of company; the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:53465:125"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> officiousnesse, of impertinent and ceremonious visits, the
declension of estate, the sadnesse of spirit, the notoriousnesse of
those dishonours which the meannesse of lower persons conceals,
but their eminency makes us visible, as the spots in the moons
face, we shall finde him to be most happy, that hath most of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and least of the world, because he onely hath the least dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and the most security.</p>
            <p>5. And lastly, his soul so gets nothing that wins all this world,
if he loses his soul, that it is ten to one but he that gets the one,
therefore shall lose the other; For to a great and opulent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> sin is so adherent and insinuating, that it comes to him in the
nature of civility; It is a sad sight to see a great personage under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
an action passionately and upon great interest; and let him
manage it as indiscreetly, let the whole designe be unjust, let it be
acted with all the malice and impotency in the world, he shall
have enough to tell him that he proceeds wisely enough, to be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of his interest, and promoters of his sin, instruments of his
malice and actors of revenge. But which of all his relatives shall
dare to tell him of his indiscretion, of his rage and of his folly?
he had need be a bold man and a severe person, that shall tell him
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of his danger; and that he is in a direct progresse towards <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ell;
and indeed such personages have been so long nourished up in soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
flattery and effeminancy, that too often themselves are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
of a monitor, and think the charity and duty of a modest
reprehension to be a rudenesse and incivility<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Prince is a wise
man that loves to have it otherwise; and certainly it is a strange
civility and dutifulnesse in friends and relatives, to suffer him to
go to hell uncontrolled; rather then to seem unmannerly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
a great sinner. But certainly this is none of the least in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felicities
of them who are Lords of the world and masters of great
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> possessions.</p>
            <p>I omit to speak of the habitual intemperance, which is too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
annexed to Festival and delicious tables, where there is no
other measure or restraint upon the appetite, but its fulnesse and
satiety, and when it cannot or dare not eat more. Oftentimes it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens,
that the intemperance of a poor table is more temperate and
hath lesse of luxury in it, then the temperance of a rich. To this
are consequent all the evil accidents and effects of fulnesse; pride,
lust, wantonnesse, softnesses of disposition and dissolution of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
huge talking, imperiousnesse, despite and contempt of poor
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> persons, and at the best it is a great temptation for a man to have
in his power, whatsoever he can have in his sensual desires: who
then shall check his voracity or calm his revenge or allay his pride
or mortify his lust or humble his spirit? it is like as when a lust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
young and tempted person lives perpetually with his amorous
and delicious mistris, if <hi>he soapes</hi> burning, that is inflamed
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:53465:126"/>
from within and set on fire from without it is a greater miracle <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
then the escaping from the flames of the furnace, by the three
children of the captivity. And just such a thing is the possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the world, it furnishes us with abilities to sin and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
of ruine, and it makes us to dwell with poisons and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and enemies.</p>
            <p>And although the grace of God is sufficient to great personages,
and masters of the world, and that it is possible for a young man to
be tyed upon a bed of flowers and fastned by the arms and band
of a curtesan and tempted wantonly and yet to escape the danger
and the crime, and to triumph gloriously: (for so Saint Hierome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
reports of a son of the king of Nicomedia) and riches and a free
fortune are designed by God to be a mercy and an opportunity of
doing noble things, and excellent charity, and exact justice, and
to protect innocence, and to defend oppressed people; yet it is a
mercy mixt with much danger; yet it is like the present of a whole
vintage to a man in a hectick feaver, he will be shrewdly tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to drink of it, and if he does, he is inflamed and may chance
to die with the kindnesse. Happy are those persons who use the
world and abuse it not, who possesse a part of it and love it for no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
other ends, but for necessities of nature, and conveniencies of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and discharge of all their duty and the offices of religion, and in
charity to Christ and all Christs members; but since he that hath
all the world cannot command nature to do him one office extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary,
and enjoyes the best parts but in common with the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
man in the world, and can use no more of it but according to
a limited and a very narrow capacity, and whatsoever he can use
or possesse cannot out-weigh the present pressure of a sharp disease,
nor can it at all give him content without which there can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of felicity; since a prince in the matter of usiing the world,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
differs nothing from his subjects, but in mere accedents and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
and yet these very many trifling differences are not to
be obtained but by so much labour and care, so great expence
of time and trouble, that the possession will not pay thus much
of the price, and after all this, the man may die two hours after he
hath made his troublesome and expensive purchase and is certain not
to enjoy it long.</p>
            <p>Adde to this last, that most men get so little of the world that
it is all together of a trifling and inconsiderable interest, that they
who have the most of this world, have the most of that but in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
title and in supreme rights, and reserved priviledges, the real use
descending upon others to more substantial purposes; that the
possession of this trifle is mixt with sorrow upon other accidents,
and is allayed with fear, and that the greatnesse of mens pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions
increase their thirst, and enlarge their wants, by swelling
their capacitie, and above all, is of so great danger to a mans vertue
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:53465:126"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that a great fortune and a very great vertue are not alwayes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
to grow together; He that observes all this, and much more
he may observe, will see that he that gains the whole world hath
made no such great bargain of it although he had it for nothing,
but the necessary unavoidable troubles in getting it; but how
great a folly is it to buy so great a trouble, so great a vanity, with
the losse of our pretious soules remains to be considered in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owing

            <p>And therefore when the soul is at stake, not for its tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
but for its eternal interest, it is not good to be hasty in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining,
without taking just measures of the exchange. Solomon
had the good things of the world actually in possession, and he
tried the touch-stone of prudence and natural value and found
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> them allayed with vanitie and imperfection, and wee that see
them wayed in the ballance of the sanctuary, and tryed by the
touch-stone of the spirit, finde them not onely light and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
but pungent and dolorous, but now we are to consider what
it is that men part with, and lose when with passion and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
they get the world and that will present the bargain to be
a huge infelicity. And this I observe to be intimated in the word,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:53465:127"/>
[lose] for he gives gold for cloth or pretious stones for bread <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
serves his needs of nature, and loses nothing by it, and the merchant
that found a pearle of great price, and sold al that he had to make
the purchase of it made a good venture he was no loser, but here
the case is otherwise, when a man gains the whole world, and his
soul goes in the exchange, he hath not done like a merchant, but
like a childe, or a prodigal, he hath given himself away, he hath
lost all that can distinguish him from a slave, or a miserable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
he loses his soul in the exchange, for the soul of a man, all the
world cannot be a just price, a man may lose it or throw it away,
but he can never make good exchange, when he parts with this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
Jewel, and therefore our blessed Saviour rarely well expresses it
by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which is fully opposed to <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> gain, it is such an ill mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
a man makes as if he should proclaim his riches, goods, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
for a garland of thistles decked and trimmed up with the
stinking poppy.</p>
            <p>But we shall better understand the nature of this bargain if we
consider the soul that is exchanged, what it is in it self, in order
not of nature but to felicity and the capacities of joy, secondly
what price the Son of God payed for it, and thirdly what it is to
lose it, that is, what miseries and tortures are signified by losing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
a mans soul.</p>
            <p>First if we consider what the soul is in its own capacity
to happinesse, we shall finde it to be an excellency greater then
the sun; of an angelicall substance, sister to a cherubin, an image
of the divinity, and the great argument of that mercy, whereby
God did distinguish us from the lower form of beasts and trees and
minerals.</p>
            <p>For so it was the scripture affirmes, that <hi>God made man after
his own, image,</hi> that is, <hi>secundum illam imaginem &amp; ideam quam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepit
ipse,</hi> not according to the likenesse of any of those creatures <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
which were prexistent to mans production; not according to any
of those images or ideas whereby God created the heavens, and the
earth; but by a new form; to distinguish him, from all other sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances;
he made him by a new idea of his own, by an uncreated
exemplar; and besides that this was a donation of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
faculties, such as we understand to be perfect, and essential<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
or rather the essence of God, it was also a designation of him to a
glorious immortality and a communication of the rayes and reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his own essential felicities.</p>
            <p>But the soul is al that whereby we may be, and without which we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
cannot be happy. It is not the eye that sees the beauties of the
heaven, nor the ear that hears the sweetnesses of musick, or the glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidings
of a prosperous accident, but the soul that perceives all the
relishes of sensual and intellectual perfections and the more noble
and excellent the soul is the greater and more savory are its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions;
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:53465:127"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and if a childe beholds the rich Ermine, or the Diamonds
of a starry night, or the order of the world, or hears the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
of an Apostle, because he makes no reflex acts upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and sees not that he sees; he can have but the pleasure of a
fool or the deliciousnesse of a mule. But although the reflection
of its own acts be a rare instrument of pleasure or pain respective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
yet the souls excellency is upon the same reason not percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by us, by which the sapidnesse of pleasant things of nature,
are not understood by a childe; even because the soul cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
far enough. For as the Sun which is the fountain of light and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> heat, makes violent and direct emission of his rayes from himself
but reflects them no further then to the bottom of a cloud, or the
lowest imaginary circle of the middle region, and therefore receives
a duplicate of his own heat; so is the soul of man, it reflects upon
its own inferiour actions of particular sense or general understanding;
but because it knows little of its own nature, the manners of volition
the immediate instruments of understanding, the way how it comes
to meditate, and cannot discern how a sudden thought arrives, or
the solution of a doubt, not depending upon preceding premises,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> therefore above halfe its pleasures are abated, and its own worth
lesse understood; and possibly it is the better, it is so. If the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
knew his strength, or the horse the vigorousnesse of his own
spirit, they would be as rebellious against their rulers, as unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
men against government: nay the Angels themselves, because
their light reflected home to their orbs, and they understood all
the secrets of their own perfection, they grew vertiginous and fell
from the battlements of heaven. But the excellency of a humane
soul shall then be truly understood, when the reflection will
make no distraction of our faculties, nor enkindle any ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> fires; when we may understand our selves without
danger.</p>
            <p>In the mean this consideration is gone high enough when we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the soul of a man to be so excellently perfect, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
understand how excellently perfect it is: that being the best
way of expressing our conceptions of God himself; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I shall not need by distinct discourses to represent that the will
of man is the last resort and sanctuary of true pleasure, which in
its formality can be nothing else but a conformity of possession or
of being to the will; that the understanding being the ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nel and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> conveyance of the noblest perceptions feeds upon pleasure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in all its
proportionate acts, and unlesse it be disturbed by intervening sins
and remembrances, derived hence, keeps a perpetual festival; that
the passions are every of them fitted with an object, in which they
rest as in their centre; that they have such delight in these their
proper objects, that too often they venture a damnation, rather
then quit their interest and possession; but yet from these consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:53465:128"/>
it would follow that to lose a soul, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
to be an immense sea of pleasures, even in its natural ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities
is to lose all that whereby a man can possibly be, or be
supposed happy; and so much the rather is this understood to be
an insupportable calamity, because losing a soul in this sense, is not
a meer privation of those felicities of which a soul is naturally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to be a partaker, but it is an investing it with contrary objects,
and crosse effects, and dolorous perceptions: For the will if it mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
its desires, is afflicted, and the understanding when it ceases to
be ennobled with excellent things is made ignorant as a swine, dull
as the foot of a rock, and the afflictions are in the destitution of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
their perfective actions, made tumultuous, vexed and discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
to the height of rage and violence. But this is but the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
the beginning of those throes which end not but in eternal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felicity.</p>
            <p>Secondly if we consider the price that the Son of God payed for
the redemption of a soul, we shall better estimate of it, then from
the weak discourses of our imperfect and unlearned Philosophy:
not the spoil of rich provinces, not the aestimate of kingdoms, not
the price of Cleopatra's draught, not any thing that was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
or perishing; for that, which could not one minute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
the tearm of its own natural dissolution, could not be a price
for the redemption of one perishing soul. And if we list but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
and then consider that a miserable, lost, and accursed soul
does so infinitely undervalue, and disrelish all the goods and
riches that this world dotes on; that he hath no more gust in them,
or pleasure, then the fox hath in eating a turfe; that if he could be
imagined to be the Lord of ten thousand worlds, he would give
them all for any shaddow of a hope of a possibility of returning
to life again; that Dives in hell would have willingly gone on em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassy
to his fathers house that he might have been quit a little from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
his flames, and on that condition would have given Lazarus the
fee-simple of all his temporal possessions, though he had once
denied to relieve him with the superfluities of his table, will soon
confesse that a moment of time is no good exchange for an eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of duration; and a light unprofitable possession is not to be put
in the ballance against <hi>a soul,</hi> which is the glory of the creation;
<hi>a soul,</hi> with whom God had made a contract, and contracted excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
relations, it being one of Gods appellatives, that he is [the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of souls.]</p>
            <p>When God made a soul, it was onely, <hi>faciamus hominem ad <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
imaginem nostram;</hi> He spake the word and it was done; but when
man had lost this soul which the spirit of God breathed in him,
it was not so soon recovered. It is like the resurrection which hath
troubled the faith of many who are more apt to believe, that God
made a man from nothing, then that he can return a man from dust &amp;
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:53465:128"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> corruption; but for this resurrection of the soul, for the reim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placing
the divine image, for the rescuing it from the devils power,
for the reintitling it to the kingdoms of grace and glory, God did
a work greater then the creation; He was fain to contract Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
to a span, to send a person to die for us who of himself
could not die, and was constrained to use rare and mysterious arts,
to make him capable of dying, he prepared a person instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
to his purpose, by sending his Son from his own bosom, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
both God and man, an aenigma to all nations, and to all scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
one that ruled over all the Angels, that walked upon the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> pavements of heaven, whose feet were clothed with stars, whose
eyes were brighter then the Sun, whose voice is louder then thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
whose understanding is larger then that infinite space which
we imagine in the uncircumscribed distance, beyond the first orbe
of heaven, a person to whom felicity was as essential as life to God,
this was the onely person that was designed in the eternal decrees
of the divine predestination to pay the price of a soul, to ransom
us from death; lesse then this person could not do it; for although
a soul in its essence is <hi>finite,</hi> yet there were <hi>many infinites</hi> which
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> were incident and annexed to the condition of lost souls; For all
which because provision was to be made, nothing lesse then <hi>an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
excellence</hi> could satisfie for a soul who was lost to <hi>infinite and
eternal ages,</hi> who was to be afflicted with <hi>insupportable</hi> and <hi>indeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined</hi>
that is next <hi>to infinite paines,</hi> who was to bear the load of an
<hi>infinite anger</hi> from the provocation of an <hi>eternal God:</hi> and yet if it
be possible that infinite can receive degrees, this is but one half
of the abysse, and I think the lesser: for that this person who was
God eternal, should be lessened in all his appearances, to a span, to
the little dimensions of a man, and that he should really become
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> very contemptibly little, although at the same time he was infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and unalterably great, that is <hi>essential, natural</hi> and <hi>necessary felicity</hi>
should turn into an intolerable, violent and immense calamity to
his person, that this great God should not be admitted to pay the
price of our redemption unlesse he would suffer that horrid mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which that lost soul should suffer, as it represents the glories of
his goodnesse, who used such rare and admirable instruments in actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
the designes of his mercy: so it shewes our condition to have
been very desperate, and our losse invaluable.</p>
            <p>A soul in Gods account is valued at the price of the blood, and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> shame, and tortures, of the Son of God, and yet we throw it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>way
for the exchange of sins, that a man naturally is ashamed to own;
we lose it for the pleasure, the sottish beastly pleasure of a night:
I need not say, we lose our soul to save our lives; for though that
was our blessed Saviours instance of the great unreasonablenesse of
men, who by saving their lives lose them, that is, in the great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of Dooms-day, though this (I say) be extreamly unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:53465:129"/>
yet there is something to be pretended in the bargain,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
nothing to excuse him with God, but something in the accounts
of timerous men; but to lose our souls with swearing, that unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
dishonourable, and unpleasant vice, to lose our souls with
disobedience, or rebellion, a vice that brings a curse, and danger
all the way in this life: To lose our souls with drunkennesse, a
vice which is painfull, and sickly in the very acting it, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stens
our damnation, by shortning our lives; are instances fit to be
put in the stories of fools and mad-men; and all vice is a degree
of the same unreasonablenesse, the most splendid temptation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing but a prety well weaved fallacy, a meer trick, a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisme,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
and a cheating, and abusing the understanding; but that
which I consider here is, that it is an affront and contradiction to
the wisdom of God, that we should so slight and undervalue a soul,
in which our interest is so concerned; a soul which he who made
it, and who delighted not to see it lost, did account a fit purchase
to be made, by the exchange of his Son, the eternal Son of God.
To which also I adde this additionall account, that a soul is so
greatly valued by God, that we are not to venture the losse of it,
to save all the world For therefore whosoever should commit a
sin to save kingdoms from perishing, or if the case could be put <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
that all the good men, and good causes, and good things in this
world, were to be destroyed by Tyranny, and it were in our power
by perjury to save all these, that doing this sin would be so farre
from hallowing the crime, that it were to offer to God a sacrifice
of what he most hates, and to serve him with swines blood: and
the rescuing all these from a Tyrant, or a hangman, could not be
pleasing to God upon those termes, because a soul is lost by it,
which is in it self a greater losse and misery, then all the evils in
the world put together can out-ballance; and a losse of that thing
for which Christ gave his blood a price: Persecutions and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
death in holy men, and in a just cause, are but seeming evils,
and therefore not to be bought off with the losse of a soul, which
is a real but an intolerable calamity: And if God for his own sake
would not have all the world saved by sin, that is by the hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a soul, we should do well for our own sakes not to lose a
soul for trifles, for things that make us here to be miserable, and
even here also to be ashamed.</p>
            <p>3. But it may be some natures, or some understandings care
not for all this, therefore I proceed to the third and most material
consideration, as to us; and I consider what it is to lose a soul?<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
which Hierocles thus explicates, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
<hi>An immortall
substance can die, not by ceasing to be, but by losing all being well, by
becomming miserable.</hi> And it is remarkable, when our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
gave us caution, that we should not fear them that can kill the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:53465:129"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> body onely, but fear him (he sayes not that can kill the soul) But
<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>,<note place="margin">Matth. 10. 27.</note> 
               <hi>him that is able to destroy the
body, and soul in hell;</hi> which word signifieth not death but tortures.
For some have chosen death for sanctuary, and fled to it to avoid
intolerable shame, to give a period to the sence of a sharp grief, or
to cure the earthquakes of fear; and the damned perishing souls
shall wish for death, with a desire impatient as their calamity;
But this shall be denied them, because death were a deliverance,
a mercy, and a pleasure, of which these miserable persons must
despair of for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> I shall not need to represent to your considerations those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of Scripture, which the Holy Ghost hath set down to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
to our capacities the greatnesse of this perishing; choosing
such circumstances of character as were then usuall in the world,
and which are dreadful to our understanding as any thing: <hi>Hell
fire]</hi> is the common expression; for the Eastern nations accounted
burnings the greatest of their miserable punishments: and burning
malefactours was frequent, <hi>[brimstone and fire]</hi> to Saint John
<hi>Revel.</hi> 14. 10. calls the state of punishment, <hi>prepared for the Devil
and all his servants,</hi> he adding the circumstance of brimstone, for
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> by this time the Devil had taught the world more ingenious pains,
and himself was new escaped out of boiling oil and brimstone,
and such bituminous matter; and the Spirit of God knew right well
the worst expression was not bad enough, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, so our
blessed Saviour calls it, <hi>the outer darknesse,</hi> that is, not onely an
abjection from the beatifick regions, where God, and his Angels,
and his Saints dwell for ever, but then there is a positive state of
misery expressed by darknesses, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as two Apostles, Saint
Peter and Saint Jude call it, The blacknesse of darknesse for ever.
In which although it is certain, that God whose Justice there rules,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> will inflict but just so much as our sins deserve, and not superadde
degrees of undeserved misery, as he does to the Saints of glory
(for God gives to blessed souls in heaven more, infinitely more
then all their good works could possibly deserve, and therefore
their glory is infinitely bigger glory then the pains of hell are great
pains) yet because Gods Justice in hell rules alone, without the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes
and sweeter abatements of mercy, they shall have pure and
unmingled misery; no pleasant thought to refresh their wearinesse,
no comfort in an other accident to alleviate their pressures, no wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to cool their flames; but because when there is a great cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
upon a man, every such man thinks himself the most misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
and though there are great degrees of pain in hell, yet there
are none perceived by him that thinks he suffers the greatest; It
follows that every man that loses his soul in this darknesse is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
beyond all those expressions which the tortures of this world
could furnish to the Writers of holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>

But I shall choose to represent this consideration in that expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
of our blessed Saviour, <hi>Mark</hi> the 9. the 44. verse; which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
took out of the Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> the 66. verse the 24. <hi>Where the
worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched;</hi> this is the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
spoken of by <hi>Daniel</hi> the Prophet; for although this expression was
a prediction of that horrid calamity and abscision of the Jewish
Nation, when God poured out a full vial of his wrath upon the
crucifiers of his Son, and that this which was the greatest calamity
which ever did or ever shall happen to a Nation, Christ with great
reason took to describe the calamity of accursed souls, as being the
greatest instance to signifie the greatest torment: yet we must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
that the difference of each state makes the same words in the
several cases to be of infinite distinction: The worm stuck close to
the Jewish Nation, and the fire of Gods wrath flamed out till they
were consumed with a great and unheard of destruction; till many
millions did die accursedly, and the small remnant became vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds,
and were reserved, like broken pieces, after a storm, to
shew the greatnesse of the storm, and misery of the shipwrack;
but then this being translated to signifie the state of accursed souls,
whose dying is a continual perishing, who cannot cease to be, it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
must mean an eternity of duration, in proper and naturall signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications.</p>
            <p>And that we may understand it fully, observe the places. In the 34.
<hi>Esa.</hi> 8. The Prophet prophecies of the great destruction of Jerusalem
for all her great iniquities. <hi>It is the day of the Lords vengeance, and the
yeer of recompences, for the controversie of Sion, and the streams thereof
shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the
land thereof shall become burning pitch. It shall not be quenched night
nor day, the smoak thereof shall go up for ever, from generation to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
It shall lie wast, none shall passe thorow it for ever and ever.</hi>
This is the final destruction of the Nation; but this destruction shall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
have an end, because the Nation shall end, and the anger also shall
end in its own period, even then when God shall call the Jews into
the common inheritance with the Gentiles, <hi>and all the sons of God.</hi>
And this also was the period of their <hi>worme,</hi> as it is of their <hi>fire,
The fire of the Divine vengeance</hi> upon the Nation; which was not
to be extinguished till they were destroyed, as we see it come to
passe. And thus also in Saint Jude, the Angels who kept not their
first state, are said to be reserved by God <hi>in everlasting chains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
darknesse:</hi> which word [everlasting] signifies not absolutely
to eternity, but to the utmost end of that period, for so it follows <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
               <hi>[unto the judgement of the great day]</hi> that <hi>[everlasting]</hi> lasts no
longer; and in verse the seventh, the word <hi>[eternal]</hi> is just so used:
<hi>The men of Sodom and Gomorrha are set forth for an example suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
the vengeance</hi> of [eternal fire,] that is, of a fire, which
burned till they were quite destroyed, and the cities and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:53465:130"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> with an irreparable ruine never to be rebuilt, and reinhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as long as this world continues. The effect of which obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
is this;</p>
            <p>That these words <hi>[for ever, everlasting, eternal, the never-dying
worme, the fire unquenchable,]</hi> being words borrowed by our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Saviour and his Apostles from the stile of the old Testament,
must have a signification just proportionable to the state in which
they signifie; so that as this worme when it signifies a temporal
infliction meanes a worme that never ceases, giving torment, till
the body is consumed: So when it is translated to an immortall
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> state, it must signifie as much in that proportion: that <hi>[eternal,]</hi>
that <hi>everlasting,</hi> hath no end at all: because the soul cannot be
killed in the natural sense, but is made miserable and perishing for
ever; that is, <hi>the worme shall not die</hi> so long as the soul shall be
unconsumed: <hi>the fire shall not be quenched,</hi> till the period of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall
nature comes, and that this shall be <hi>absolutely for ever</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any restriction, appears unanswerably in this, because the same
<hi>(for ever)</hi> that is, for the blessed souls, the same <hi>for ever,</hi> is for
the accursed souls; but the blessed <hi>souls that die in the Lord, hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> shall die no more; death hath no power over them; for death is
destroyed, it is swallowed up in victory</hi> (saith Saint Paul) and <hi>there
shall be no more death,</hi> saith Saint John, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 4. So that because
<hi>for ever</hi> hath no end, till the thing or the duration it self have end,
in the same sense in which the Saints and Angels give glory to God
<hi>for ever,</hi> in the same sense the lost souls shall suffer the evils of
their sad inheritance; and since after this death of nature, which is
a separation of soul and body, there remains no more death, but
this second death, this eternal perishing of miserable accursed souls,
whose duration must be eternall; It follows that <hi>the worm of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and <hi>the unquenchable fire</hi> of hell have no period at all;
but shall last as long as God lasts, or the measures of a proper
eternity; that they who provoke God to wrath, by their base,
unreasonable, and sottish practises, may know what their porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
shall be in the everlasting habitations: and yet suppose that
Origens opinion had been true; and that accursed souls should
have ease and a period to their tortures after a thousand years; I
pray let it be considered, whether it be not a great madnesse to
choose the pleasures, or the wealth of a few years here, with
trouble, with danger, with uncertainty, with labour, with inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valls
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of sicknesse, and for this to endure the flames of hell for a
thousand yeers together? The pleasures of the world no mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

have for a hundred yeers, and no man hath pleasure a hundred
dayes together, but he hath some trouble intervening: or at least
a wearinesse and a loathing of the pleasure; and therefore to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
insufferable calamities (suppose it be) for a hundred yeers,
without any interruption, without so much comfort as the light
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:53465:131"/>
of a small candle, or a drop of water amounts to in a fever, is a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
bargain to be made by no man that loves himself, or is not in
love with infinite affliction.</p>
            <p>If a man were condemned but to lie still, or to lie a bed in one
posture without turning, for seven yeers together, would he not
buy it off with the losse of all his estate? If a man were to be put
upon the rack, for every day, three moneths together, (suppose
him able to live so long) what would he do to be quit of his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
Wouldany man curse the King to his face, if he were sure
to have both his hands burnt off, and to be tormented with tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
three yeers together? Would any man in his wits accept of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
a hundred pound a yeer for fourty yeers, if he were sure to be
tormented in the fire for the next hundred yeers together without
intermission? Think then what a thousand yeers signifie: Ten ages,
the age of two Empires; but this account I must tell you is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
short, though I thus discourse to you, how great fools wicked
men are, though this opinion should be true: A goodly comfort
surely! that for two or three yeers sottish pleasure, a man shall be
infinitely tormented but for <hi>a thousand yeers.</hi> But then when we
cast up the minutes, and yeers, and ages of eternity, the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it self is a great hell to those persons who by their evil lives <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
are consigned to such sad and miserable portions.</p>
            <p>A thousand yeers is a long while to be in torment; we finde a
fever of 21. dayes to be like an age in length: but when the dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of an intolerable misery is for ever in the height, and for ever
beginning, and ten thousand yeers hath spent no part of its terme,
but it makes a perpetual efflux, and is like the centre of a circle,
which ever transmits lines to the circumference; this is a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
so sad that the horrour of it and the reflexion upon its abode
and duration, make a great part of the hell; for hell could not be
hell without the despair of accursed souls; for any hope were a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
and a drop of water, which would help to allay those
flames, which as they burn intolerably, so they must burn for
ever.</p>
            <p>And I desire you to consider that although the Scripture uses
the word [fire] to expresse the torments of accursed souls, yet
fire can no more equal the pangs of hell then it can torment a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
substance; the pains of perishing souls being as much more
afflictive then the smart of fire, as the smart of fire is troublesome
beyond the softnesse of Persian carpets, or the sensuality of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian
Luxury: for the pains of hell; and the perishing or losing of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
soul is to suffer the wrath of God, <gap reason="foreign">

and to fall upon us, in spiritual, immateriall, but most accursed,

lose a soul.</p>
            <p>We may guesse at it by the terrours of a guilty conscience, those

horrors of an evil conscience, which are consignations to eternity,
you may please to learn it by your own reason, or els by the sad
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> instances of story. It is reported of Petrus Ilosuanus. A Polonian
School-master that having read some ill managed discourses of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
decrees and divine reprobation, began to be Phantastick
and melancholy and apprehensive that he might be one of those
many whom God had decreed for hell from all eternity; from
possible to probable, from probable, to certain, the temptation
soon carried him, and when he once began to believe himself to be
a person inevitably perishing, it is not possible to understand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,
what infinite fears, and agonies and despairs, what tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> what horrors, what confusion and amazement the poor man
felt within him, to consider that he was to be tormented extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
without remedy even to eternal ages; This in a short continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
grew insufferable, and prevailed upon him so far that he hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himself, and left this account of it or to this purpose in writing in
his study; I am gone from hence to the flames of hell, &amp; have forced
my way thither being impatient to try what those great torments
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:53465:132"/>
are which here I have heard with an insupportable amazement: this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
instance may suffice to show what it is to lose a soul. But I will take
off from this sad discourse; onely I shall crave your attention, to a
word of exhortation.</p>
            <p>That you take care, lest for the purchase of a little, trifling, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
portion of the world you come into this place and state of
torment. Although Homer was pleased to complement the beauty
of Helena to such a height as to say it was a sufficient price for all the
evils which the Greeks and Trojans suffered in ten years.</p>
            <p>
               <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Yet it was a more reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
conjecture of Herodotus, that during the ten years siege of
Troy Helena for whom the Greeks fought was in Egypt, not in the
city, because it was unimaginable but that the Trojans would
have thrown her over the walls rather then for the sake of such a
trifle, have endured so great calamities, we are more sottish then
the Trojans, if we retain our Helena, any one beloved lust,
any painted Devil, any sugar'd temptation with, (not the haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
but) the certainty of having such horrid miseries, such in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
losses. And certainly its a strange stupidity of spirit that can
sleep in the midst of such thunder, when God speaks from heaven
with his lowdest voice, and draws aside his curtain, and shows his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senal
and his armory, full of arrows steeled with wrath, headed and
pointed, and hardned with vengeance, still to snatch at those ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,
if they came but in the retinue of a rich fortune or a vain
Mistris, if they wait but upon pleasure or profit or in the reare of
an ambitious designe.</p>
            <p>But let not us have such a hardinesse against the threats and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentments
of the divine vengeance as to take the little imposts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
and revenues of the world, and stand in defiance against God and
the fears of hell unlesse we have a charm that we can be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
invisible to the judge of heaven and earth and are impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
against, or are sure we shall be insensible of the miseries of a
perishing soul.</p>
            <p>There is a sort of men who because they will be vitious and
Atheistical in their lives, have no way to go on with any plaisance
and without huge disturbances, but by being also Atheistical in their
opinions and to believe that the story of hell is but a bug-bear to
affright children and fools, easy believing people to make them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
soft and apt for government and designes of princes; and this is
an opinion that befriends none but impure and vicious persons;
others there are that believe God to be all mercy, that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
his justice, believing that none shall perish with so sad a ruine,
if they do but at their death-bed ask God forgivenesse and say they
are sorry; but yet continue their impiety till their house be ready
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:53465:132"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to fall; being like the Circassians whose Gentlemen enter not into
the Church till they be threescore years old, that is, in effect till by
their age they cannot any longer use rapine: till then they hear ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
at their windows: dividing unequally their life between sin
and devotition, dedicateing their youth to robbery, and their old
age to a repentance without restitution.</p>
            <p>Our youth, and our man-hood and old age are all of them due to
God, and justice and mercy are to him equally essential, and as this
life is a time of the possibilities of mercy so to them that neglect it,
the next world shall be a state of pure and unmingled justice.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Remember the fatal and decretory sentence which God hath
passed upon all man-kinde <hi>[it is appointed to all men once to die and
after death comes judgement]</hi> and if any of us were certain to die next
morning, with what earnestnesse should we pray, with what ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
should we remember our sins, with what scorn should we
look upon the licentious pleasures of the world; then nothing could
be welcome unto us but a prayer book, no company but a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter
and a Guide of souls, no imployment but repentance, no
passions but in order to religion, no kindnesse for a lust that hath
undone us; and if any of you have been arrested with alarmes of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> death, or been in hearty fear of its approach, remember what
thoughts and designes then possessed you, how precious a soul was
then in your account and what then you would give that you had
despised the world, and done your duty to God and man, and lived
a holy life. It will come to that again and we shall be in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in which we shall perfectly understand, that all the things and
pleasures of the world are vain and unprofitable, and irkesome, and
that he onely is a wise man who secures the interest of his soul
though it be with the losse of all this world and his own life into the
bargain. When we are to depart this life to go to strange company
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and stranger places, and to an unknown condition, then a holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
will be the best security, the best possession, it wil be a horror
that every friend we meet shall with triumph upbraid to us the sot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tishnesse

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen our B. Saviour entailed a law &amp; a condition of
sufferings, &amp; promised a state of persecution to his
servants, and withall had charmed them with the
bands &amp; unactive chains of so many passive graces,
that they should not be able to stir against the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of Tyrants, or abate the edge of axes, by
any instrument, but their own blood; being
<hi>sent forth as sheep among wolves,</hi> innocent and silent, harmlesse, and
defencelesse, certainly exposed to sorrow, and uncertainly guarded
in their persons; their condition seemed nothing else, but a designa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to slaughter: and when they were drawn into the folds of the
church, they were betrayed into the hands of evil men, infinitely
and unavoidably; and when an Apostle invited a proselyte
to come to Christ, it was in effect a snare laid for his life, and he
could neither conceal his religion, nor hide his person, nor avoid
a captious question, nor deny his accusation, nor elude the bloody
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:53465:134"/>
arts of Orators and informers nor break prisons, nor any thing but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
die. If the case stood just thus, it was well eternity stood at the outer
doors of our life, ready to receive such harmlesse people; but sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
there could be no art in the designe, no pitying of humane
weaknesses, no complying with the condition of man, no allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
made for customs and prejudices of the world, no inviting
men by the things of men, no turning nature into religion; but it
was all the way a direct violence, and an open prostitution of our
lives; and a throwing away our fortune into a sea of rashnesse and
credulity. But therefore God ordered the affaires and necessities of
religion in other wayes and to other purposes. Although God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
bound our hands behinde us, yet he did not tie our understandings
up: although we might not use our swords, yet we might use our
reason: we were not suffered to be violent, but we might avoid
violence by all the arts of prudence and innocence; if we did take
heed of sin, we might also take heed of men: &amp; because in al conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
between <hi>wit and violence, prudence</hi> &amp; <hi>rudenesse, learning</hi> and <hi>the
sword,</hi> the strong hand took it first, and the strong head possessed
it last: the strong man first governed, and the witty man succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him, and lasted longer; it came to passe that the wisdom of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
the Father hath so ordered it, that all his Disciples should overcome
the power of the Roman legions by a wise religion; and <hi>prudence</hi>
and <hi>innocence</hi> should become the mightiest guards; and the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
although exposed to persecution, yet is so secured that he shall
never need to die But when the circumstances are so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
that his reason is convinced that then it is fit he should; fit (I
say) in order to Gods purposes and his own.</p>
            <p>For he that is <hi>innocent</hi> is safe against all the rods and the axes of
all the Consuls of the world, if they rule by justice; and he that
is <hi>prudent</hi> will also escape from many rudenesses and irregular vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
that can come by injustice: and no wit of man, no go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
no armies can do more; for Caesar perished in the midst
of all his legions and all his honours, and against <hi>chance</hi> and <hi>irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities</hi>
there is no provision lesse then infinite, that can give secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
and although <hi>prudence</hi> alone cannot do this; yet <hi>innocence</hi> gives
the greatest title to that providence which onely can if he pleases,
and will if it be fitting. Here then are the two armes defensive of a
Christian: <hi>Prudence</hi> against the evils of men, <hi>Innocence</hi> against the
evils of Devils and all that relates to his kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prudence</hi> fences against persecution, and the evil snares, against <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
the opportunities and occasions of sin, it prevents surprizes, it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies
all its proper weaknesses, it improves our talents, it does ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to the kingdom of Christ and the interests of the Gospel,
it secures our condition, and instructs our choice in all the wayes
and just passages to felicity, it makes us to live profitably, and
die wisely; and without it, simplicity would turn to sillinesse, zeal
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:53465:134"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> into passion, passion into fury, religion into scandal, conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
into a snare, civilities into temptation, curtesies into danger,
and an imprudent person falls into a condition of harmelesse, rich
and unwary fools, or rather of birds, sheep, and bevers, who are
hunted and persecuted for the spoils of their fleece, or their flesh,
their skins, or their entrails, and have not the foresight to avoid
a snare, but by their fear and undefending follies are driven thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
where they die infallibly. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Every
good man is incircled with many enemies, and dangers: and his
vertue shall be rifled, and the decency of his soul and spirit shall
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> he discomposed and turned into a heap of inarticulate and disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
fancies, unlesse by the methods and guards of prudence it be
mannaged and secured.</p>
            <p>But in order to the following discourse and its method, we are
first to consider whether this be, or indeed can be a commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or what is it? For can all men that give up their names in
baptisme, be enjoyned to be wise and prudent? It is as if God
would command us to be eloquent, or witty men, fine speakers, or
strait bodied, or excellent schollers, or rich men: If he please to
make us so, we are so; and prudence is a gift of God, a blessing
of an excellent nature, and of great leisure, and a wise opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and a severe education, and a great experience, and a strict ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
and good company; all which being either whol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y, or
in part out of our power, may be expected as free gifts, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be imposed as commandments.</p>
            <p>To this I answer, That Christian prudence is in very many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
a direct duty; in some an instance and advice, in order to
degrees and advantages: where it is a duty, it is put into every mans
power; where it is an advice it is onely expected according to
what a man hath, and not according to what he hath not: and even
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> here, although the events of prudence are out of our power, yet
the endeavours and the observation, the diligence and caution, the
moral part of it, and the plain conduct of our necessary duty
(which are portions of this grace) are such things which God will
demand in proportion to the talent which he hath intrusted into our
Banks. There are in indeed some Christians very unwary and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in the conduct of their religion, and they cannot all help it, at
least not in all degrees; but yet they may be taught to <hi>do prudent
things,</hi> though <hi>not to be prudent persons;</hi> if they have not the <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of <hi>advice,</hi> and <hi>conduct,</hi> yet they may have the <hi>prudence</hi> of
<hi>obedience,</hi> and of <hi>disciples:</hi> and the event is this; without prudence
their vertue is unsafe, and their persons defenselesse, and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
is unguarded; for prudence is a hand-maid waiting at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,
and birth of vertue: It is a nurse to it in its infancy, its
patron in assaults, its guide in temptations, its security in all porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of chance and contingency: And he that is imprudent, if he
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:53465:135"/>
have many accidents and varieties, is in great danger of being <hi>none <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
at all,</hi> or if he be, at the best he is but <hi>a weak and an unprofitable
servant,</hi> uselesse to his neighbour, vain in himself, and as to God,
<hi>the least in the kingdom:</hi> his vertue is contingent, and by chance,
not proportioned to the reward of wisdom, and the election of a
wise religion.</p>

            <p>No purchase, no wealth, no advantage is great enough to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
compared to a wise soul, and a prudent spirit; and he that wants
it, hath a lesse vertue, and a defenselesse minde, and will suffer a
mighty hazard in the interest of eternity. Its parts and proper acts
consist in the following particulars.</p>
            <p>1. It is the duty of Christian prudence to choose the end of a
Christian, that which is perfective of a man, satisfactory to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
the rest of a Christian, and the beatification of his spirit; and
that is, to choose and desire, and propound to himself heaven, and
the fruition of God, as the end of all his acts and arts, his designes
and purposes. For in the nature of things that is most eligible, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
most to be pursued, which is most perfective of our nature, and is
the acquiescence, the satisfaction, and proper rest of our most rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
appetites. Now the things of this world are difficult and
uneasie, full of thornes, and empty of pleasures, they fill a disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
faculty, or an abused sense, but are an infinite dissatisfaction
to reason, and the appetites of the soul: they are short, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sient,
and they never abide, unlesse sorrow like a chain be bound
about their leg, and then they never stir, till the grace of God and
religion breaks it, or else that the rust of time eats the chain in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
they are dangerous and doubtfull, few and difficult, fordid and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
particular, not onely not communicable to a multitude, but not
diffusive upon the whole man; there being no one pleasure or object
in this world, that delights all the parts of man: and after all this,
they are originally from earth, and from the creatures, onely that
they oftentimes contract alliances with hell and the grave, with
shame and sorrow; and all these put together make no great ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
or proportion to a wise mans choice: But on the other side,
the things of God are the noblest satisfactions to those desires,
which ought to be cherished and swelled up to infinite; their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciousnesse
is vast and full of relish, and their very appendant thorns <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
are to be chosen, for they are gilded, they are safe and medicinall,
they heal the wound they make, and bring forth fruit of a blessed
and a holy life: The things of God and of religion are easie and
sweet, they bear entertainments in their hand, and reward at their
back, their good is certain and perpetual, and they make us cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:53465:135"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to day, and pleasant to morrow; and spiritual songs end not
in a sigh and a groan; neither like unwholesome physick do they
let loose a present humour, and introduce an habitual indispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
But they bring us to the felicity of God, the same yesterday,
and to day and for ever; they do not give a private and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
delight, but their benefit is publike, like the incense of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
it sends up a sweet smell to heaven, and makes atonement for
the religious man that kindled it, and delights all the standers by,
and makes the very air wholesome; there is no blessed soul goes
to heaven, but he makes a generall joy in all the mansions where
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the Saints do dwell, and in all the chappels where the Angels sing:
and the joyes of religion are not univocal, but productive of rare
and accidental, and praeternatural pleasures; for the musick of
holy hymnes delights the ear, and refreshes the spirit, and makes
the very bones of the Saint to rejoyce: and charity, or the giving
alms to the poor, does not onely ease the poverty of the receiver,
but makes the giver rich, and heals his sicknesse, and <hi>delivers from
death;</hi> and temperance though it be in the matter of meat, and
drink, and pleasures, yet hath an effect upon the understanding,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and makes the reason sober, and his will orderly, and his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ffecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
regular, and does things beside, and beyond their natural and
proper efficacy; for all the parts of our duty are watered with the
showers of blessing, and bring forth fruit according to the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of heaven, and beyond the capacities of nature.</p>
            <p>And now let the voluptuous person go and try whether put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his wanton hand to the bosome of his Mis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s will get half such
honour as Scaevola put upon his head, when he put his hand into
the fire. Let him see whether a drunken meeting will cure a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
or make him wise? A hearty and a persevering prayer will.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Let him tell me, if spending great summes of money upon his
lusts will make him sleep soundly, or be rich? Charity will; Alms
will increase his fortune, and a good conscience shall charme all
his cares and sorrows into a most delicious slumber; well may a
full goblet wet the drunkards tongue, and then the heat rising from
the stomack will dry the spunge, and heat it into the scorchings
and little images of hell: and the follies of a wanton bed will turn
the itch into a smart, and empty the reins of all their lustfull
powers; but can they do honour, or satisfaction in any thing that
must last, and that ought to be provided for? No: All the things of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> this world are little, and trifling, and limited, and particular, and
sometimes necessary because we are miserable, wanting and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
but they never do any thing toward perfection, but their
pleasure dies like the time in which it danced a while, and when
the minute is gone, so is the pleasure too, and leaves no footstep
but the impression of a sigh, and dwells no where, but in the same
house where you shall finde <hi>yesterday,</hi> that is in forgetfulnesse, and
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:53465:136"/>
annihilation, unlesse its onely childe, <hi>sorrow,</hi> shall marry, and breed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
more of its kinde, and so continue its memory and name to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
ages. It is therefore the most necessary part of prudence to
choose well in the main stake; and the dispute is not much; for if
eternall things be better then temporall, the soul more noble then
the body, vertue more honourable then the basest vices, a lasting
joy to be chosen before an eternall sorrow, <hi>much</hi> to be preferred
before <hi>little, certainty</hi> before <hi>danger, publike good things,</hi> before
<hi>private evils, eternity</hi> before <hi>moments,</hi> then let us set down in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and make heaven to be our end, God to be our Father, Christ
our elder Brother, the Holy Ghost the earnest of our inheritance,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
vertue to be our imployment, and then we shall never enter into
the portion of fools and accursed ill-choosing spirits. Nazianzen
said well, <hi>Malim prudentiae guttam quàm foecundioris fortunae pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus:</hi>
One drop of prudence is more usefull, then an ocean of a
smooth fortune; for prudence is a rare instrument towards hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
and a great fortune is made oftentimes the high-way to hell
and destruction. However, thus farre, prudence is our duty; every
man can be so wise; and is bound to it, to choose heaven and a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation
with God, before the possessions and transient vanities
of the world.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
            </p>
            <p>2. It is a duty of Christian prudence to pursue this great end,
with apt means and instruments in proportion to that end. No
wise man will sail to Ormus in a cock-boat, or use a childe for his
interpreter; and that Generall is a Cyclops without an eye, who
chooses the sickest men to man his Towns, and the weakest to
fight his battels. It cannot be a vigorous prosecution unlesse the
means have an efficacy or worth commensurate to all the difficulty,
and something of the excellency of that end which is designed.
And indeed men use not to be so weak in acquiring the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions
of their temporals; But in matters of religion they think <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
any thing effective enough to secure the greatest interest; as if all
the fields of heaven, and the regions of the Kingdom were waste
ground, and wanted a Colony of planters; and that God invited
men to heaven upon any terms, that he might rejoyce in the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of subjects. For certain it is, men do more to get a little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
then for all the glories of heaven: Men <hi>rise up early,</hi> and <hi>sit
up late,</hi> and <hi>eat the bread of carefulnesse,</hi> to become richer then their
neighbours; and are amazed at every losse, and impatient of an
evil accident, and feel a direct strom of passion, if they suffer in
their interest: But in order to heaven they are cold in their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
indevout in their prayers, incurious in their walking, unwatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in their circumstances, indifferent in the use of their opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
infrequent in their discoursings of it, not inquisitive of the
way, and yet think they shall surely go to heaven: But a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
man knows that by the greatnesse of the purchase, he is to
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:53465:136"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> make an estimate of the value and the price: When we ask of God
any great thing; As <hi>wisdom, delivery from sicknesse, his holy Spirit,
the forgivenesse of sins,</hi> the grace of <hi>chastity, restitution to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</hi>
or the like, do we hope to obtain them without a high opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the things we ask? and if we value them highly, must we
not desire them earnestly? and if we desire them earnestly, must
we not pray for them fervently? and whatsoever we ask for fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently,
must not we beg for frequently? and then because prayer
is but one hand toward the reaching a blessing, and God requires
our cooperation and endeavour; and we must work with both
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> hands: are we not convinced that our prayers are either faint, or
a designe of lazinesse, when we either ask coldly, or else pray
loudly, hoping to receive the graces we need without labour? A
prudent person that knows to value the best object of his desires,
will also know that he must observe the degrees of labour, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the excellency of the reward: Prayer must be <hi>effectuall,
fervent, frequent, continuall, holy, passionate,</hi> that must get a grace,
or secure a blessing: The <hi>love</hi> that we must have to God must be
such as <hi>to keep his commandements,</hi> and to make us willing to part
with all our estate, and all our honour, and our life for the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of a holy conscience. <hi>Our charity</hi> to our neighbours must
be expressive in a language of a reall friendship, aptnesse to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give,
readinesse to forbear, in pitying infirmities, in relieving ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities,
in giving our goods and our lives, and quitting our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges
to save his soul, to secure and support his vertue. <hi>Our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi>
must be full of sorrows and care, of diligence and hatred
against sin, it must drive out all, and leave no affections towards it;
it must be constant and persevering, fearfull of relapse, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of all accidents: <hi>Our temperance</hi> must <hi>sometimes</hi> turn into ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence,
and <hi>most commonly</hi> be severe, and <hi>ever</hi> without reproof:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               <hi>He that striveth for masteries is temperate</hi> (saith Saint Paul) <hi>in all
things;</hi> he that does all this, may with some pretence and reason
say, he intends to go to heaven: But they that will not deny a
lust, nor refrain an appetite, they that will be drunk when their
friends do merrily constrain them, or love a cheap religion, and a
gentle and lame prayer, short and soft, quickly said, and soon
passed over, seldome returning, and but little observed, How is
it possible that they should think themselves persons disposed to
receive such glorious crowns and scepters, such excellent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which they have not faith enough to believe, nor attention
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> enough to consider, and no man can have wit enough to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.
But so might an Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>adian shepherd look from the rocks,
or thorow the clefts of the valley where his sheep graze, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that the messenger stayes so long from comming to him to be
crowned King of all the Greek Ilands, or to be adopted heir to the
Macedonian Monarchy. It is an infinite love of God, that we have
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:53465:137"/>
heaven upon conditions, which we can perform with greatest di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
But truely the lives of men are generally such, that they
do things in order to heaven, things (I say) so few, so trifling, so
unworthy, that they are not proportionable to the reward of a
crown of oak, or a yellow riband, the slender reward with which
the Romans payed their souldiers for their extraordinary valour.
True it is, that heaven is not in a just sense of a commutation,
<hi>a reward,</hi> but <hi>a gift,</hi> and <hi>an infinite favour:</hi> but yet it is not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
forth but to persons disposed by the conditions of God;
which conditions when we pursue in kinde, let us be very carefull
we do not fail of <hi>the mighty price of our high calling,</hi> for want of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
degrees, and just measures, the measures of zeal and a mighty

            <p>3. It is an office of prudence so to serve God that we may at
the same time preserve our lives and our estates, our interest and
reputation for our selves, and our relatives, so farre as they can
consist together. Saint Paul in the beginning of Christianity was
careful to instruct the forwardnesse and zeal of the new Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
into good husbandry, and to catechize the men into good
trades, and the women into useful imployments, that they might <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
not be unprofitable. For Christian religion carrying us to heaven,
does it by the way of a man, and by the body it serves the soul,
as by the soul it serves God; and therefore it endeavours to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the body and its interest, that it may continue the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of a crown, and prolong the stage in which we are to run
<hi>for the mighty price of our salvation:</hi> and this is that part of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
which is the defensative and guards of a Christian in the
time of persecution; and it hath in it much of duty. He that
through an indiscreet zeal casts himself into a needlesse danger,
hath betrayed his life to tyranny and tempts the sin of an enemy,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
he loses to God the service of many yeers, and cuts off himself
from a fair opportunity of working his salvation (in the main
parts of which we shall finde a long life, and very many yeers of
reason to be little enough) he betrayes the interest of his relatives,
(which he is bound to preserve) he disables himself of making
<hi>provision for them of his own house,</hi> and he that fails in this duty
by his own fault, <hi>is worse then an infidel,</hi> and denies the faith, by
such unseasonably dying, or being undone, which by that testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
he did intend gloriously to confesse; he serves the end of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
and popular services, but not the sober ends of religion, he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
discourages the weak, and weakens the hands of the strong, and
by upbraiding their warinesse, tempts them to turn it into rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
or despair; he affrights strangers from entring into religion,
while by such imprudence, he shall represent it to be impossible
at the same time to be wise and to be religious; it turns all the
whole religion into a forwardnesse of dying or beggery, leaving
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:53465:137"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> no space for the parts and offices of a holy life, which in times of
persecution are infinitely necessary, for the advantages of the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.
But God hath provided better things for his servants:
<hi>Quem fata cogunt, ille cum veniâ est miser,</hi> He whom God by an
inevitable necessity calls to sufferance, he hath leave to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
and that ruine of his estate or losse of his life shall secure first
a providence, then a crown.</p>
            <q>
               <l>At si quis ultro se malis offert volens.</l>

            </q>
            <p>But he that invites the cruelty of a Tyrant by his own follyes or
the indiscretions of an unsignificant and impertinent zeal, suffers as a
wilful person, and enters into the portion and reward of fools.
And this is the precept of our Blessed Saviour, next after my text:
<hi>Beware of men:</hi> use your prudence to the purposes of avoiding their
snare. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Man is the most harmful of all the
wilde beasts: ye are sent as sheep among wolves, be therefore</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
               <hi>wise as serpents;</hi> when you can avoid it suffer not <hi>men to ride over
your heads,</hi> or trample you under foot; thats the wisdom of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents;
and so must we; that is by all just complyances, and tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of all indifferent changes in which a duty is not destroyed
and in which we were not active, so to preserve our selves that we
might be permitted to live, and serve God, and to do advantages
to religion; so purchasing time to do good in, by bending in all
those flexures of fortune, and condition, which we cannot help,
and which we do not set forward, and which we never did procure;
and this is the direct meaning of Saint Paul;<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 16.</note> 
               <hi>see then that ye walk</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               <hi>circumspectly, not as fools but as wise, Redeeming the time because the
dayes are evil;</hi> that is, we are fallen into times that are troublesome,
dangerous, persecuting and afflictive, purchase as much respite as
you can: Buy or <hi>redeem the time</hi> by all honest arts, by humility, by
fair carriage and sweetnesses of society, by civility, and a peaceful
conversation, by good words, and all honest offices, by <hi>praying for
your persecutors,</hi> by patient sufferance of what is unavoidable: And
when the Tyrant draws you forth from all these guards and retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and offers violence to your duty or tempts you to do a
dishonest act, or to omit an act of obligation, then come forth into
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the Theater and lay your necks down to the hangmans axe, and fear
not to die the most shamful death of the crosse or the gallows; for
so have I known angels ascending and descending upon those lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
and the Lord of glory suffered shame and purchased honour
upon the crosse.<note place="margin">Col. 4. 5.</note> Thus we are <hi>to walk in wisdom towards them that
are without redeeming the time:</hi> for so Saint Paul renewes that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
or commandment: Give them no just cause of offence;
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:53465:138"/>
with all humility and as occasion is offered represent their duty,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
and invite them sweetly to felicities and vertue, but do not in
ruder language upbraid and reproach their basenesse: and when
they are in corrigible, let them alone, lest like cats they run
mad with the smell of delicious ointments; And therefore Pothi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
Bishop of Lyons being asked by the unbaptized President,
<hi>who was the God of the Christians?</hi> answered <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; If you
be disposed with real and hearty desires of learning, what you ask
you shall quickly know; But if your purposes be in direct, I shall
not preach to you, to my hurt and your no advantage. Thus the
wisdom of the primitive Christians was careful not to prophane <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
the temples of the heathen, not to revile their false Gods, and
when they were in duty to represent the follies of their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they chose to do it, from their own writings and as rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of their own records they fled from the fury of a persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they hid themselves in caves, and wandred about in disguises,
and preached in private, and celebrated their synaxes, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions
in grots and retirements, and made it appear to all the
world, they were peaceable, and obedient, charitable, and patient,
and at this price bought their time.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

            <p>As knowing that even in this sense, <hi>time was very pretious</hi> and the
opportunitie of giving glory to God by the offices of an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
religion, was not too deare a purchase at that rate. But
then when the wolves had entred into the folds and seized upon

<hi>Saint Athanasius</hi> being overtaken by his persecutors, but
not known, and asked whether he saw Athanasius passing that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

the man is not far off; a swift foot-man will easily o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertake
him. And Saint Paul divided the councell of his Judges,
and made the Pharisees his parties by a witty insinuation of his own
belief of the resurrection, which was not the main question, but
an incident to the matter of his accusation. And when Plinius se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundus
in the face of a Tyrant court was pressed so invidiously
to give his opinion concerning a good man in banishment and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the disadvantage of an unjust sentence he diverted the snare
of Marcus Regulus by referring his answer to a competent ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
according to the laws; being prefled again, by offering
a direct answer upon a just condition, which he knew, they would
not accept; and the third time, by turning the envy upon the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
and malicious Orator, that he won great honour, the
honour of a severe honesty, and a witty man, and a prudent
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:53465:138"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> person. The thing I have noted, because it is a good pattern
to represent the arts of honest evasion, and religious, prudent
honesty: which any good man may transcribe and turn into his
own instances if an equal case should occur.</p>
            <p>For in this case the rule is easy; If we are commanded to
be wise and redeeme our time, that we serve God and religion,
we must not use unlawful arts which set us back in the accounts
of our time, no lying Subterfuges, no betraying of a truth, no
treachery to a good man, no insnaring of a brother, no secret
renouncing of any part or proposition of our religion, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to confesse the article when we are called to it. For
when the primitive Christians had got a trick to give money
for certificates, that they had sacrificed to idols, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they did not do it, but had corrupted the officers and
ministers of state, they dishonoured their religion and were
marked with the appellative of <hi>libellatici, Libellers;</hi> and were
excommunicate and cast off from the society of Christians and
the hopes of Heaven, till they had returned to God by a
severe repentance; <hi>optanduum est ut quod libenter facis diu fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
possis.</hi> It is good to have time long to doe that which wee
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ought to doe; but to pretend that, which we dare not doe,
and to say we have, when we have not, if we know we ought
not, is to dishonour the cause and the person too; it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly
against <hi>confession of Christ,</hi> of which Saint Paul saith, <hi>by
the mouth confession is made unto salvation.</hi> And our Blessed
Saviour, <hi>he that confesseth me before men. I will confesse him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
my Heavenly Father;</hi> and if here he refuseth to own me, I
will not own him hereafter: it is also expressly against Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
fortitude and noblenesse; and against the simplicity and
sincerity of our religion, and it turnes prudence into craft,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and brings the Devil to wait in the temple, and to minister
to God; and it is a lesser Kinde of <hi>apostacy:</hi> and it is well that
the man is tempted no further; for if the persecutors could
not be corrupted with money, it is ods but the complying man
would, and though he would with the money hide his shame,
yet he will not with the losse of all his estate redeeme his
religion <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

all the armies of the world (I mean) those that fight
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> in the justest causes, pretend to fight and die for their lands
and liberties: and there are too many also that will die twice
rather then be beggers once: although we all know that the
second death is intolerable. Christian prudence forbids us to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
a danger; and they were fond persons that run to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
and when the Proconsul sate on the life and death, and
made strict inquisition after Christians, went and offered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:53465:139"/>
to die; and he was a fool that being in Portugal run to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
the Priest as he elevated the host; and overthrew the mysteries
and openly defied the rites of that religion: God when he sends
a persecution will pick out such persons whom he will have to
die, and whom he will consigne to banishment, and whom to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty:

of our life as that in all the offices of our souls and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
we do honour and reputation, to the religion
we professe. For the follies and vices of the Professors give great
advantages to the adversary to speak reproachfully, and does aliene
the hearts and hinder the complyance of those undetermined per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
who are apt to be perswaded, if their understandings be not
prejudiced.</p>
            <p>But as our necessary duty is bound upon us by one ligament more
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> in order to the honour of the cause of God: so it particularly bindes
us to many circumstances adjuncts and parts of duty which have
no other commandment, but the law of prudence. There are some
sects of Christians which have some one constant indisposition,
which as a character divides them from all others, and makes them
reproved on all hands: some are so suspitious and ill natured, that if
a person of a facile nature and gentle disposition fall into their
hands he is presently sowred and made morose, unpleasant, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easy
in his conversation: Others there are that do things so like
to what themselves condemn that they are forced to take sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and labour in the mine of unsignificant distinctions, to make
themselves believe they are innocent: and in the mean time they
offend all men else, and open the mouths of their adversaries to
speak reproachful things; true, or false; (as it happens) And it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
a great wit to understand all the distinctions and devices
thought of, for legitimating the worshipping of images: And those
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:53465:140"/>
people that are liberal in their excommunications make men think <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
they have reason to say their Judges are proud, or self willed, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous,
or ill natured people. These that are the faults of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
and continued, are quickly derived upon the sect and cause
a disreputation to the whole society and institution. And who can
think that congregation to be a true branch of the Christian, who
makes it their profession to kill men to save their souls against their
will, and against their understanding? who calling themselves dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of so meek a Master, do live like bears upon prey, and spoil
and blood? It is a huge dishonour to the sincerity of a mans purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to be too busie in fingring money in the matters of religion: and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
they that are zealous for their rights and tame in their devotion,
furious against sacrilege, and a companion of drunkards; implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
against breakers of a Canon, and carelesse and patient enough
with them that break the fifth or sixth Commandments of the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,
tell all the world their private sense is to preserve their
own interest with scruple and curiosity, and leave God to take
care for his.</p>
            <p>Thus Christ reproved the Pharisees, for straining at a gnat and
swallowing a Camel; the very representation of the manner and
matter of fact discovers the vice by reproving the folly of it. They <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
that are factious to get a rich proselyte and think the poor not
worth saving dishonour their zeal and teach men to call it cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse,
and though there may be a reason of prudence to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
one more then the other, because of a bigger efficacy, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of the one may have more then the other; yet it will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be discovered if it be done by secular designe: and the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
that did not allow the preferring of a gay man before a poor
Saint in the matter of place, will not be pleased that in the matter
of souls, which are all equal, there should be a faction and designe,
and an acceptation of persons. Never let us pollute our religion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
with arts of the world, nor offer to support the arke with unhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
hands; nor mingle false propositions with true, nor make
religion a pretence to profit or preferment, nor do things which are
like a vice; neither ever speak things dishonorable of God, nor abuse
thy brother for Gods sake, nor be solicitous and over busie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
thy own little things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither alwayes think it fit to lose thy
charity by forcing thy brother to do justice; and all those things
which are the outsides and faces, the garments and most discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
parts of religion, be sure that they be dressed according to all
the circumstances of men and by all the rules of common honesty,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
and publick reputation. Is it not a sad thing that the Jew should
say, the Christians worship images? or that it should become a
proverb, that <hi>the Jew spends all in his passeover, the Moore in his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
and the Christian in his law suits?</hi> that, what the first sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to religion, and the second to publick joy, we should spend
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:53465:140"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> in malice, covetousnesse, and revenge? <hi>Pudet haec opprobria nobis
&amp; dici potuisse, &amp; non potuisse refelli.</hi> But among our selves also,
we serve the Devils ends, and minister to an eternal dis-union, by
saying and doing things which look unhandsomely. One sort of
men is superstitious, phantastical, greedy of honour, and tenaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
of propositions to fill the purse, and his religion is thought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but policy, and opinion. Another sayes he hath a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
but he is the most indifferent and cold person in the world,
either to maintain it, or to live according to it; the one dresses
the images of Saints with fine clothes, the other lets the poor go
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> naked, and disrobes the priests that minister in the religion. A third
uses God worse then all this, and sayes of him such things that are
scandalous even to an honest man, and such which would undo a
good mans reputation: And a fourth, yet endures no governour but
himself, and pretends to set up Christ and make himself his lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.
And a fifth hates all government, and from all this it comes
to passe that it is hard for a man to choose his side, and he that
chooses wisest takes that, which hath in it least hurt; but some he
must endure, or live without communion: and every Church of
one denomination is, or hath been too incurious of preventing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> or disreputation to their confessions.</p>
            <p>One thing I desire should be observed, that here the Question
being concerning prudence, and the matter of doing reputation
to our religion, it is not enough to say, we can with learning justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
all that we do, and make all whole with 3. or 4. distinctions;
for possibly the man that went to visit the <hi>Corinthian Lais,</hi> if he
had been asked why he dishonoured himself with so unhandsome
an entrance, might finde an excuse to legitimate his act, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t least
to make himself beleeve well of his own person; but he that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to do himself honour, must take care that he be not suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that he give no ocasion of reproachful language; for fame and
honour is a nice thing, tender as a womans chastity, or like the
face of the purest mirrour, which a foul breath, or an unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
air, or a watry eye can fully, and the beauty is lost although
it be not dashed in pieces. When a man or a sect is put to answer
for themselves in the matter of reputation, they with their distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
wipe the glasse, and at last can do nothing but make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
it was not broken; but their very abstersion and laborious
excuses confesse it was foul and faulty: We must know that all
sorts of men, and all sects of Christians, have not onely the mistakes
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of men and their prejudices to contest withall, but the calumnies
and aggravation of Devils: and therefore it will much ease our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
of dooms-day, if we are now so prudent that men will not
be offended here, nor the Devils furnished with a libell in the day
of our great account.</p>
            <p>To this rule appertains that we be curious in observing the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:53465:141"/>
circumstances of men, and satisfie all their reasonable expectations,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
and do things at that rate of charity and religion which they are
taught to be prescribed in the institution. There are some things
which are <hi>undecencies</hi> rather then <hi>sins,</hi> such which may become a just
Heathen, but not a holy Christian; a man of the world, but not
a man <hi>professing godlinesse.</hi> Because when the greatnesse of the man,
or the excellency of the Law, engage us upon great severity, or
an exemplar vertue, whatsoever is lesse then it renders the man
unworthy of the religion, or the religion unworthy of its fame:
Men think themselves abused, and therefore return shame for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
We never read of an Apostle that went to law; and it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
but reasonable to expect that of all men in the world Christians
should not be such fighting people, and Clergy men should not
command Armies, and Kings should not be drunk, and subjects
should not strike Princes for justice, and an old man should not
be youthfull in talk, or in his habit; and women should not swear,
and great men should not lie, and a poor man should not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse;
for besides the sin of some of them, there is an undecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

person, they asperse the religion as insufficient to keepe the
persons within the bounds of fame and common reputation.</p>
            <p>But above all things those sects of Christians whose professed
doctrine brings destruction and diminution to government, give the
most intolerable scandal, and dishonour to the institution; and it had
been impossible that Christianity should have prevailed over the
wisdom and power of the Greeks and Romans, if it had not been
humble to superiours, patient of injuries, charitable to the needy,
a great exactour of obedience to Kings, even <hi>to heathens,</hi> that
they might be won, and convinced; and <hi>to persecutours</hi> that they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
might be sweetned in their anger, or upbraided for their cruel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice:
for so doth the humble vine creep at the foot of an oak,
and leans upon its lowest base, and begs shade and protection,
and leave to grow under its branches, and to give and take mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
refreshment, and pay a friendly influence for a mighty patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,
and they grow and dwell together, and are the most remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
of friends and married pairs of all the leavie nation. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of it self is soft, easie and defenselesse, and God hath made
it grow up with empire, and to leane upon the arms of Kings,
and it cannot well grow alone; and if it shall like the <hi>Ivy</hi> suck <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
the heart of the oak upon whose body it grew and was support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
it will be pulled down from its usurped eminency, and fire
and shame shall be its portion. We cannot complain if Princes
arm against those Christians, who if they are suffered to preach
will disarm the Princes; and it will be hard to perswade that
Kings are bound to protect and nourish those that will prove mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:53465:141"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of their own exauctoration: And no Prince can have juster
reason to forbid, nor any man have greater reason to deny com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
to a family, then if they go about to destroy the power
of the one, or corrupt the duty of the other. The particulars of
this rule are very many; I shall onely instance in one more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is of great concernment to the publike interest of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>There are some persons whose religion is hugely disgraced,
because they change their propositions according as their tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
necessities or advantages do return. They that in their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and beginning cry out against all violence as against persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and from being suffered, swell up till they be prosperous, and
from thence to power, and at last to Tyranny; and then suffer
none but themselves, and trip up those feet, which they humbly
kissed, that themselves should not be trampled upon; these men
tell all the world that <hi>at first</hi> they were pusillanimous, or <hi>at last</hi>
outragious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that their doctrine at first served their fear, and at last
served their rage, and that they did not at all intend to serve God:
and then who shall believe them in any thing else? Thus some
men declaim against the faults of Governours, that themselves
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> may governe; and when the power was in their hands, what was
a fault in others, is in them <hi>necessity;</hi> as if a sin could be hallowed
for comming into their hands. Some Greeks at Florence subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
the Article of Purgatory, and condemned it in their own Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses:
And the Kings supremacy in causes Ecclesiastical, was ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly

He that means to gain a soul, must not make his Sermon an osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of his Eloquence, but the law of his own life. If a Grama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:53465:142"/>
should speak solaecismes, or a Musician sing like a bittern, he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
becomes ridiculous for offending in the faculty he professes: So it
is in them who minister to the conversion of souls: If they fail
in their own life, when they professe to instruct another, they
are defective in their proper part, and are unskilfull to all their
purposes; and the Cardinal of Crema did with ill successe tempt
the English priests to quit their chaste marriages, when himself
was deprehended in unchaste embraces. For good counsel seems
to be unhallowed, when it is reached forth by an impure hand,
and he can ill be beleeved by another, whose life so confutes his
rules, that it is plain he does not beleeve himself. Those Churches <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
that are zealous for souls, must send into their ministeries men so
innocent, that evil persons may have no excuse to be any longer
vitious. When <hi>Gorgias</hi> went about to perswade the Greeks to be
at peace, he had eloquence enough to do advantage to his cause,
and reason enough to presse it: But <hi>Melanthius</hi> was glad to put
him off, by telling him that he was not fit to perswade peace, who
could not agree at home with his wife, nor make his wife agree
with her maid; and he that could not make peace between three
single persons, was unapt to prevail for the reuniting fourteen or
fifteen Common-wealths: And this thing Saint Paul remarks by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
enjoyning that a Bishop should be chosen such a one as knew well
to rule his own house, or else he is not fit to rule the Church of
God. And when thou perswadest thy brother to be chaste, let
not him deride thee for thy intemperance; and it will ill become
thee to be severe against an idle servant, if thou thy self beest use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
to the publike; and every notorious vice is infinitely against the
spirit of government, and depresses the man to an evennesse with
common persons,</p>
            <p>—<hi>Facinus quos inquinat, aequat,</hi> to
reprove, belongs to a Superiour; and as innocence gives a man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
advantage over his brother, giving him an artificiall and adventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
authority; so the follies and scandals of a publike and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
man destroyes the efficacy of that authority that is just
and naturall. Now this is directly an office of Christian prudence,
that good offices and great authority, become not ineffective by ill
conduct.</p>
            <p>Hither also it appertains that in publike or private reproofs,
we observe circumstances of <hi>time,</hi> of <hi>place,</hi> of <hi>person,</hi> of <hi>disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
The vices of a King are not to be opened publikely; and
Princes must not be reprehended as a man reproves his servant; but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
by Categoricall propositions, by abstracted declamations, by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of a crime in its single nature, in private, with humility,
and arts of insinuation: And it is against Christian prudence not
onely to use a Prince or great Personage with common language,
but it is as great an imprudence to pretend for such a rudenesse, the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:53465:142"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> examples of the Prophets in the old Testament. For their case
was extraordinary, their calling peculiar, their commission special,
their spirit miraculous, their authority great, as to that single mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
they were like thunder or the trump of God, sent to do that
office plainly, for the doing of which in that manner, God had
given no commission to any ordinary minister: And therefore we
never finde that the Priests did use that freedom, which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
were commanded to use, whose very words being put into
their mouthes, it was not to be esteemed an humane act, or a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
manner of doing an ordinary office; neither could it become
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> a precedent to them whose authority is precarious and without
coërcion whose spirit is allayed with Christian graces and duties
of humility, whose words are not prescribed, but left to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of prudence, as it is to be advised by publike necessities, and
private circumstances, in ages where all things are so ordered, that
what was fit and pious amongst the old Jews, would be incivil and
intolerable to the latter Christians. He also that reproves a vice
should also treat the persons with honour, and civilities, and by
fair opinions, and sweet addresses place the man in the regions of
modesty, and the confines of grace, and the fringes of repentance.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> For some men are more restrained by an imperfect, feared shame,
so long as they think there is a reserve of reputation which they

he is a man, and sealed with Gods Spirit, and honoured with the
title of a Christian, and is, or ought to be reputed as a discreet
person by his friends; and a governour of a family, or a guide in
his countrey, or an example to many, and that it is huge pity so
many excellent things should be sullied, and allayed with what is
so much below all this: Then a reprover does his duty, when he
is severe against the vice, and charitable to the man, and carefull
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of his reputation, and sorry for his reall dishonour, and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant

and men will not be in love with vertue whither they are

6. It is a duty of Christian prudence not to suffer our souls to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
walk alone, unguarded, unguided, and more single then in other
actions and interests of our lives, which are of lesse concernment.
<hi>Vae soli &amp; singulari,</hi> said the Wise man, <hi>Wo to him that is alone:</hi>
and if we consider how much God hath done to secure our souls,
and after all that, how many wayes there are for a mans soul to
miscarry, we should think it very necessary to call to a spirituall
man to take us by the hand, to walk in the wayes of God, and to
lead us in all the regions of duty, and thorow the labyrinths of
danger. For God who best loves, and best knows how to value
our souls, set a price no lesse upon it then the life-blood of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
Holy Son; he hath treated it with variety of usages according as
the world had new guises, and new necessities; he abates it with
punishment to make us avoid greater; he shortned our life that we
might live for ever; he turns sicknesse into vertue; he brings good
out of evil; he turns enmities to advantages, our very sins into
repentances, and stricter walking; he defeats all the follies of men,
and all the arts of the Devil, and layes snares, and uses violence
to secure our obedience; he sends Prophets and Priests to invite
us, and to threaten us to felicities; he restrains us with lawes, and he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
bridles us with honour and shame, reputation, and society, friends,
and foes; he layes hold on us by the instruments of all the passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
he is enough to fill our love, he satisfies our hope, he affrights
us with fear, he gives us part of our reward in hand, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
all our faculties with the promises of an infinite and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
portion; he curbs our affections: he directs our wills, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structs
our understandings with Scriptures, with perpetuall Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
with good books, with frequent discourses, with particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
observations, and great experience, with accidents and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
with rare events of providence, and miracles; he sends his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
Angels to be our guard, and to place us in opportunities of vertue,
and to take us off from ill company and places of danger, to set us
neer to good example; he gives us his holy Spirit, and he becomes
to us a principle of a mighty grace, descending upon us in great
variety, and undiscerned events, besides all those parts of it
which men have reduced to a method and an art; and after all this
he forgives us infinite irregularities, and spares us every day, and
still expects, and passes by, and waits all our dayes, still watching
to do us good, and to save that soul which he knowes is so preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
one of the chiefest of the works of God, and an image of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
Now from all these arts and mercies of God, besides that
we have infinite reason to adore his goodnesse, we have also a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,
that we ought to do all that possibly we can, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
all our faculties, and watch all our opportunities, and take in
all assistances to secure the interest of our soul, for which God is
pleased to take such care, and use so many arts for its security. If
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:53465:143"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> it were not highly worth it, God would not do it. If it were not all of
it necessary, God would not do it. But if it be worth it, and all of it
be necessary, why should we not labour in order to this great end?
If it be worth so much to God it is so much more to us: for if we
perish, his felicity is undisturbed, but we are undone, infinitely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.
It is therefore worth taking in a spirituall guide, so far we are
gone.</p>
            <p>But because we are in the question of prudence, we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
whether it be necessary to do so: For every man thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
wise enough as to the conduct of his soul, and managing of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> his eternal interest; and divinity is every mans trade, and the
Scriptures speak our own language, and the commandments are
few and plain, and the laws are the measure of justice, and if I
say my prayers, and pay my debts, my duty is soon summed up,
and thus we usually make our accounts for eternity, and at this rate
onely take care for heaven; but let a man be questioned for a
portion of his estate or have his life shaken with diseases, then it
will not be enough to employ one agent, or to send for a good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to minister a potion of the juices of her country garden, but the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ablest Lawyers and the skilfullest Physitians &amp; the advice of friends
and huge caution, and diligent attendances and a curious watching
concerning all the accidents and little passages of our disease, and
truly a mans life, and health is worth all that, and much more, and
in many cases it needs it all.</p>
            <p>But then is the soul the onely safe and the onely trifling thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
us? Are not there a thousand dangers, and ten thousand dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties,
and innumerable possibilities of a misadventure? Are not
all the congregations in the world divided in their doctrines, and all
of them call their own way necessary and most of them call all the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> rest damnable? we had need of a wise instructor and a prudent
choice at our first entrance, and election of our side: and when we
are well in the matter of Faith for its object, and jnstitution; all the
evils of my self and all the evils of the Church and all the good that
happens to evil men, every day of danger, the periods of sicknesse
and the day of death are dayes of tempest and storm, and our faith
wil suffer shipwrack unlesse it be strong and supported and directed.
But who shall guide the vessel when a stormy passion or a violent
imagination transports the man? who shall awaken his reason and
charm his passion into slumber &amp; instruction? How shal a man make
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> his fears confident, and allay his confidence with fear, and make the
allay with just proportions, and steere evenly, between the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes,
or call upon his sleeping purposes or actuate his choices, or
binde him to reason in all the wandrings and ignorances, in his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and mistakes? For suppose the man of great skil and great learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the wayes of religion, yet if he be abused by accident, or by
his own will, who shall then judge his cases of conscience, and awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:53465:144"/>
his duty and renew his holy principle, and actuate his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
powers? For Physitians that prescribe to others, do not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
to themselves in cases of danger, and violent sicknesses; and
in matter of distemperature we shall not finde that books alone
will do all the work of a spiritual Physitian more then of a natural,
I will not go about to increase the dangers and difficulties of the
soul, to represent the assistance of a spiritual man to be necessary.
But of this I am sure; our not understanding, and our not consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our soul make us first to neglect, and then many times to lose it.
But is not every man an unequal judge in his own case? and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the wisdom of God and the laws hath appointed tribunals and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
Judges and arbitrators and that men are partial in the matter of
souls, it is infinitely certain, because amongst those milions of souls
that perish, not one in ten thousand but believes himself in a good
condition; and all sects of Christians think they are in the right, and
few are patient to enquire whether they be or no: then adde to this,
that the Questions of souls, being clothed with circumstances of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and particular contingency, are or may be infinite, and most
men are so infortunate, that they have so intangled their cases of
conscience, that there where they have done something good, it
may be, they have mingled half a dozen evils; and when interests <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
are confounded and governments altered, and power strives with
right, and insensibly passes into right, and duty to God would fain
be reconciled with duty to our relatives, will it not be more then
necessary that we should have some one that we may enquire of, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the way to heaven, which is now made intricate by our follies
and inevitable accidents? But by what instrument shall men alone
and in their own cases be able to discern the spirit of truth from the
spirit of illusion, just confidence from presumption, fear from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sillanimity;
are not all the things and assistances in the world little
enough to defend us against <hi>pleasure</hi> and <hi>pain,</hi> the two great foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
of temptation? is it not harder to cure a lust then to cure a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver?
and are not the deceptions and follies of men, and the arts of
the Devil and inticements of the world &amp; the deceptions of a mans
own heart, and the evils of sin more evil and more numerous then
the sicknesses and diseases of any one man? and if a man perishes
in his soul, is it not infinitely more sad then if he could rise from his
grave and die a thousand deaths over? Thus we are advanced a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
step in this prudential motive; God used many arts to secure
our souls interest; and there is infinite dangers, and infinite wayes
of miscarriage in the souls interest; and therefore there is great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
God should do all those mercies of security, and that we
should do all the under-ministeries we can in this great work.</p>
            <p>But what advantage shall we receive by a spiritual Guide? much
every way. For this is the way that God hath appointed who in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
age hath sent a succession of spiritual persons, whose office is
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:53465:144"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to minister in holy things, and to be <hi>stewards of Gods houshold, shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
of the flock, dispensers of the mysteries,</hi> under mediators, and
ministers of prayer, preachers of the law, expounders of questions,
monitors of duty, conveiances of blessings, and that which is a good
discourse in the mouth of another man is from them an ordinance
of God; and besides its natural efficacy and perswasion, it prevails
by the way of blessing, by the reverence of his person, by divine
institution, by the excellency of order, by the advantages of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and assistances of reputation, by the influence of the spirit
who is the president of such ministeries, and who is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to all Christians according to the despensation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to them; to the people in their obedience, and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the ordinance, to the Priest in his ministery and publick and
privat offices; To which also I adde this consideration, that as the
Holy Sacraments are hugely effective to spiritual purposes, not
onely because they convey a blessing to the worthy suscipients, but
because men cannot be worthy suscipients unlesse they do many
excellent acts of vertue in order to a previous disposition; so that
in the whole conjunction, and transaction of affaires there is good
done by way of proper efficacy and divine blessing; so it is in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the conduct of a spiritual man, and consulting with him in
the matter of our souls; we cannot do it unless we consider our souls
and make religion our businesse and examine our present state, and
consider concerning our danger, and watch and designe for our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
which things of themselves wil set a man much forwarder
in the way of Godlinesse; besides thath naturally every man will
lesse dare to act a sin for which he knows he shall feel a present
shame in his discoveries made to the spiritual Guide, the man that
is made the witnesse of his conversation.<note place="margin">Sophocl.</note>

Holy men ought to know all things from God, and that relate to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> God, in order to the conduct of souls: and there is nothing to be said
against this, if we do not suffer the devil in this affaire to abuse us, as
he does many people in their opinions, teaching men to suspect there
is a designe and a snake under the plantain? But so may they suspect
Kings when they command obedience, or the Levites when they
read the law of tithes, or Parents when they teach their children
temperance or Tutors when they watch their charge. However, it is
better to venture the worst of the designe, then to lose the best of
the assistance; and he that guides himself hath much work, and much
danger; but he that is under the conduct of another, his work is

great concernment that we be prudent in the choice of
him whom we are to trust in so great an interest.</p>
            <p>Concerning which it will be impossible to give characters and
significations particular enough to enable a choice without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval
assistances of prayer, experience and the Grace of God; He
that describes a man can tell you the colour of his hair, his stature
and proportions, and describe some general lines, enough to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stingush
him from a Cyclops or a Saracen, but when you chance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
to see the man you will discover figures or little features of which
the description had produced in you no Phantasme, or expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And in the exteriour significations of a sect there are more
semblances then in mens faces and greater uncertainty in the signes:
&amp; what is faulty strives so craftily to act the true and proper images
of things, and the more they are defective in circumstances, the
more curious they are in forms; and they also use such arts of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Proselytes which are of most advantage towards an effect, and
therefore such which the true Christian ought to pursue, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
actually did, and they strive to follow their patterns in arts of
perswasion, not onely because they would seem like them, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they can have none so good, so effective to their purposes;
that it follows that it is not more a duty to take care, that we be not
corrupted with false teachers, then that we be not abused with false
signes; for we as well finde a good man teaching a false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:53465:145"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> as a good cause managed by ill men, and a holy cause is not
alwayes dressed with healthful symptomes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor is there a crosse al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
set upon the doores of those congregations, who are infected
with the plague of heresy.</p>
            <p>When Saint John was to separate false teachers from true, he
took no other course but to remark the doctrine which was of God,
and that should be the mark of cognisance to distinguish right shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards
from robbers and invaders: <hi>every spirit that confesseth that
Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of God: He that denieth it is not of
God</hi> By this he bids his schollers to avoid the present sects of Ebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Cerinthus, Simon Magus and such other persons that denied
that Christ was at all before he came, or that he came really in the
flesh and a proper humanity. This is a clear note and they that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed
with Saint John or believed his doctrine were sufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
in the present Questions. But this note will signify nothing
to us; for all sects of Christians <hi>confesse Jesus Christ come in the flesh,</hi>
and the following sects did avoid that rock over which a great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
had hung out so plain a lantern.</p>
            <p>In the following ages of the Church men have been so curious to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> signifie misbelievers, that they have invented and observed some
signes, which indeed in some cases were true, real appendages of
false believers; but yet such which were also, or might be common to
them with good men, and members of the Catholick Church; some
few I shall remark and give a short account of them that by remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the uncertain, we may fix our inquiries and direct them by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
significations; lest this art of prudence turn into folly and facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
errour and secular designe.</p>
            <p>1. Some men distinguish errour from truth by calling their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
doctrine, <hi>new, and of yesterday;</hi> and certainly this is a good
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> signe if it be rightly applyed; for since all Christian doctrine is that
which Christ taught his Church, and the spirit enlarged, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
and the Apostles delivered, we are to begin the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<hi>aera</hi> for our faith and parts of religion by the period of their
preaching: our account begins then, and whatsoever is contrary to
what they taught is new and false, and whatsoever is besides,
what they taught, is no part of our religion (and then no man can be
prejudiced for believing it or not) and if it be adopted into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions
of the Church, the proposition is alwayes so uncertain, that
its not to be admitted into the faith; and therefore if it be old in
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> respect of our dayes, it is not therefore necessary to be believed: if
it be new it may be received into opinion according to its proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie,
and no sects or interest are to be divided upon such accounts.
This onely I desire to be observed, that when a truth returns from
banishment by a <hi>postliminium,</hi> if it was from the first<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though the
Holy fire hath been buried, or the river ran under ground,
yet that we do not call that new; since newnesse is not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:53465:146"/>
of by a proportion to our short lived memories, or to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
broken records and fragments of story left after the inundation of
barbarisme and war, and change of Kingdoms and corruption of
Authors; but by its relation to the fountain of our truths and the
birth of our religion under our Fathers in Christ, the holy Apostles,
and Disciples: a Camel was a new thing to them that saw it in the
fable; But yet it was created as soon as a cow or the domestick
creatures, and some people are apt to call every thing new, which
they never heard of before, as if all religion were to be measured
by the standards of their observation, or country customs. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
was not taught by Christ, or his Apostles though it came <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
in by Papias, or Dionysius, by Arius or Liberius, is certainly new
as to our account; and whatsoever is taught to us by the Doctors
of the present age if it can shew its test from the beginning of
our period for revelation, is not to be called <hi>new</hi> though it be pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with a new zeal and discoursed of by unheard of arguments;
that is, though men be ignorant and need to learn it, yet it is not
therefore new or unnecessary.</p>
            <p>2. Some would have false teachers sufficiently signified by a
name or the owning of a private Appellative as of <hi>Papist, Lutheran,
Calvenists Zuinglian, Socinian;</hi> &amp; think it is enough to denominat them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
not, of Christ if they are called by the name of a man. And indeed the
thing is in it self ill: but then if by this mark we shall esteem false
teachers sufficiently signified we must follow no man, no Church,
nor no communion: for all are by their adversaries marked with
an appellative of separation and singularity, and yet themselves
are tenacious of a good name, such as they choose or such as is
permitted to them by fame, and the people, and a natural neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of making a distinction. Thus the Donatist called themselves
<hi>the flock of God,</hi> and the Novatians called the <hi>Catholicks traditors,</hi>
and the <hi>Eustathians</hi> called themselves <hi>Catholikes</hi> and <hi>the worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
of images</hi> made <hi>Iconoclast</hi> to be a name of scorn, and men made
names as they listed, or as the fate of the market went. And if a
Doctor preaches a doctrine which another man likes not, but prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
the contradictory, he that consents and he that refuses have
each of them a teacher by whose name, if they please to wrangle,
they may be signified. It was so in the Corinthian Church with this
onely difference that they divided themselves by names which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
the same religion. <hi>I am of Paul, and I of Apollo and I am of Peter,
and I of Christ;</hi> these Apostles were ministers of Christ; and so does
every teacher new or old among the Christians pretend himself to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
be; Let that therefore be examined; if he ministers to the truth
of Christ and the religion of his master, let him be entertained as a
servant of his Lord; but if an appellative be taken from his name,
there is a faction commenced in it; and there is a fault in the men
if there be none in the doctrine; but that the doctrine be true or
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:53465:146"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> false, to be received, or to be rejected because of the name is acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental
and extrinsecall; and therefore not to be determined by this
signe.</p>
            <p>3. Amongst some men a sect is sufficiently thought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
if it subdivides and breaks into little fractions, or chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
its own opinions: indeed if it declines its own doctrine, no
man hath reason to beleeve them upon their word, or to take them
upon the stock of reputation, which (themselves being judges)
they have forfeited and renounced in the changing that which at
first they obtruded passionately. And therefore in this case there
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> is nothing to be done, but to beleeve the men so farre as they have
reason to beleeve themselves: that is, to consider when they prove
what they say: and they that are able to do so, are not persons in
danger to be seduced by a bare authority, unlesse they list them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
for others that sink under an unavoidable prejudice, God
will take care for them if they be good people; and their case shall
be considered by and by. But for the other part of the signe;
when men fall out among themselves for other interests or opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
it is no argument, that they are in an errour concerning that
doctrine, which they all unitedly teach or condemn respectively;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> but it hath in it some probability that their union is a testimony of
truth, as certainly as that their fractions are a testimony of their
zeal, or honesty, or weaknesse (as it happens): and if we Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
be too decretory in this instance, it will be hard for any of
us to keep a Jew from making use of it against the whole religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which from the dayes of the Apostles hath been rent into innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
sects, and under-sects, springing from mistake or interest,
from the arts of the Devil, or the weaknesse of man. But from
hence we may make an advantage in the way of prudence, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
sure that all <hi>that doctrine is certainly true,</hi> in which the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of Christians (who are divided in many things, yet) do
constantly agree: and that <hi>that doctrine is also sufficient</hi> since it is
certain that because in all Communions and Churches there are
some very good men, that do all their duty to the getting of truth,
God will not fail in any thing that is necessary to them that honestly
and heartily desire to obtain it: and therefore if they rest in the
heartinesse of that, and live accordingly, and superinduce nothing
to the destruction of that, they have nothing to do but to rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Gods goodnesse: and if they perish, it is certain they cannot
help it, and that is demonstration enough that they cannot perish,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> considering the justice and goodnesse of our Lord and Judge.</p>
            <p>4. Whoever break the bands of a Society, or Communion,
and go out from that Congregation is whose Confession they are
baptized, do an intolerable scandal to their doctrine and persons,
and give suspicious men reason to decline their Assemblies, and
not to choose them at all for any thing of their authority, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:53465:147"/>
circumstances: and Saint Paul bids the Romans to <hi>mark <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
them that cause divisions and offences.</hi> But the following words
make their caution prudent and practicable, <hi>[contrary to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
which ye have learned and avoid them]</hi> they that recede
from the doctrine which they have learned, they cause the offence,
and if they also obtrude this upon their congregations, they also
make the division. For it is certain, if we receive any doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to what Christ gave, and the Apostles taught, for the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of any man, then we call <hi>men Masters,</hi> and leave <hi>our Master
which is in heaven;</hi> and in that case we must separate from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
and adhere to Christ; but this is not to be done, unlesse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
the case be evident and notorious. But as it is hard, that the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
doctrine of a Chruch should be rifled, and misunderstood, and
reproved, and rejected, by any of her wilful or ignorant sons and
daughters: so it is also as hard that they should be bound, not to see
when the case is plain and evident. There may be mischiefs on both
sides; but the former sort of evils men may avoid if they will;
for they may be humble and modest, and entertain better opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of their Superiours then of themselves, and in doubtful things
give them the honour of a just opinion: and if they do not do so,
that evil will be their own private: for that it become not publike,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
the King and the Bishop are to take care: but for the latter sort of
evil it will certainly become universal; If (I say) an authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
false doctrine be imposed, and is to be accepted accordingly;
for then all men shall be bound to professe against their conscience,
that is, <hi>with their mouthes not to confesse unto salvation,</hi> what <hi>with
their hearts they believe unto righteousnesse.</hi> The best way of reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying
both the evils is, that Governours lay no burden of doctrines
or lawes but what are necessary, or very profitable: and that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours
do not contend for things unnecessary, nor call any thing
necessary that is not: till then there will be evils on both sides; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
although the Governours are to carry the Question in the point of
law, reputation, and publike government, yet as to Gods Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
they will bear the bigger load, who in his right do him an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
and by the impresses of <hi>his authority</hi> destroy <hi>his truth.</hi> But
in this case also, although separating be a suspicious thing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable,
unlesse it be when a sin is imposed, yet to separate is also
accidentall to truth: for some men separate with reason, some
men against reason; therefore here all the certainty that is <hi>in the
thing,</hi> is <hi>when the truth is secured,</hi> and all the security <hi>to the men</hi>
will be in <hi>the humility of their persons,</hi> and the heartinesse and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
of their intention, and diligence of inquiry. The Church
of England had reason to separate from the Confession and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises
of Rome in many particulars, and yet if her children sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from her they may be unreasonable and impious.</p>
            <p>5. The wayes of direction which we have from holy Scripture
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:53465:147"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to distinguish false Apostles from true, are taken from their doctrine
or their lives. That of the doctrine is the most sure way if we
can hit upon it; but that also is the thing signified, and needs to
have other signes. Saint John and Saint Paul took this way, for
they were able to do it infallibly. <hi>All that confesse Jesus incarnate
are of God</hi> said Saint John; those men that deny it are hereticks;
avoid them: and Saint Paul bids to <hi>observe them that cause divisions
and offences against the doctrine delivered.</hi> Them also avoid, that do
so. And we might do so as easily as they, if the world would one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
take their <hi>depositum,</hi> that doctrine which they delivered to all
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> men, that is, <hi>the Creed,</hi> and superinduce nothing else, but suffer
Christian faith to rest in its own perfect simplicity, unmingled with
arts, and opinions, and interests. This course is plain and easie,
and I will not intricate it with more words, but leave it directly
in its own truth and certainty, with this onely direction. That
when we are to choose our doctrine, or our side, we take that
which is in the plain unexpounded words of Scripture; for in that
onely our religion can consist. Secondly choose that which is most
advantageous to a holy life, to the proper graces of a Christian, to
humility, to charity, to forgivenesse and alms, to obedience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> complying with governments, to the honour of God and the exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of his attributes, and to the conservation and advantages of
the publike societies of men; and this last, Saint Paul directs, <hi>Let
our be carefull to maintain good works for necessary uses,</hi> for he that
heartily pursues these proportions cannot be an ill man, though
he were accidentally and in the particular applications decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>6. But because this is an act of <hi>wisdom,</hi> rather then <hi>prudence,</hi>
and supposes <hi>science</hi> or <hi>knowledge</hi> rather then <hi>experience,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it concerns the prudence of a Christian to observe the practise,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and the rules of practise, their lives, and pretences, the designes,
and colours, the arts of conduct, and gaining proselytes, which
their Doctors and Catechists do use in order to their purposes,
and in their ministery about souls. For although many signes are
uncertain, yet some are infallible and some are highly probable.</p>
            <p>7. Therefore those teachers that pretend to be guided by a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
spirit are certainly false Doctors. I remember what <hi>Simmias</hi>
in <hi>Plutarch</hi> tels concerning <hi>Socrates,</hi> that if he heard any man say
he saw a divine vision, he presently esteemed him vain and proud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but if he pretended onely to have heard a voice or the word of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> God, he listened to that religiously, and would enquire of him
with curiosity. There was some reason in his fancy; for God does
not communicate himself by the eye to men but by the ear: <hi>ye
saw no figure, but ye heard a voice,</hi> said Moses to the people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
God: and therefore if any man pretends to speak the word
of God, we will enquire concerning it; the man may the better
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:53465:148"/>
be heard, because he may be certainly reproved if he speaks amisse:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
but if he pretends to <hi>visions</hi> and <hi>revelations,</hi> to a private spirit and
a <hi>mission extraordinary,</hi> the man is proud and unlerned, vicious
and impudent. <hi>No Scripture is of private interpretation</hi> (saith S.
Peter) that is, <hi>of private emission or declaration.</hi> Gods words
were delivered indeed by single men, but such as were publikely
designed Prophets, remarked with a known character, approved
of by the high Priest, and Sanhedrim, indued with a publike spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and his doctrines were alwayes agreeable to the other Scriptures.
But if any man pretends now to the spirit, either it must be a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
or publike; if it be private, it can but be usefull to himself <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
alone, and it may cozen him too, if it be not assisted by the spirit
of a publike man. But if it be a publike spirit, it must enter in at
the publike door of ministeries, and divine ordinances, of Gods
grace, and mans endeavour, it must be subject to the Prophets, it
is discernable and judicable by them, and therefore may be reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
and then it must pretend no longer. For he that will pretend
to an extraordinary spirit, and refuses to be tried by the ordinary
wayes, must either prophecy, or work miracles, or must have a
voice from heaven to give him testimony. The Prophets in the old
Testament, and the Apostles in the New, and Christ between <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
both had no other way of extraordinary probation: and they
that pretend to any thing extraordinary, cannot, ought not to
be beleeved, unlesse they have something more then their own
word. <hi>If I bear witnesse of my self, my witnesse is not true,</hi> said
Truth it self, our Blessed Lord. But secondly, they that intend
to teach by an extraordinary spirit, if they pretend to teach accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Scripture must be examined by the measures of Scripture,
and then their extraordinary must be judged by the ordinary spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and stands or falls by the rules of every good mans religion,
and publike government; and then we are well enough. But if they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
speak any thing against Scripture it is the spirit of Antichrist, and
the spirit of the Devil; <hi>For if an Angel from heaven</hi> (he certainly
is a spirit) <hi>preach any other doctrine, let him be accursed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this pretence of a single and extraordinary spirit is nothing
else but the spirit of pride, errour, and delusion, a snare to catch
easie and credulous souls, which are willing to die for a gay word
and a distorted face; it is the parent of folly, and giddy doctrine,
impossible to be proved, and therefore uselesse to all purposes of
religion, reason, or sober counsels; it is like an invisible colour,
or musick without a sound, it is, and indeed is so intended to be, a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
direct overthrow of order, and government, and publike ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
It is bold to say any thing, and resolved to prove nothing; it
imposes upon willing people after the same manner that Oracles
and the lying Daemons did of old time, abusing men not by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
efficacy of its own, but because the men love to be abused;
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:53465:148"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> it is a great disparagement to the sufficiency of Scripture, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perses
the Divine providence for giving to so many ages of the
Church an imperfect religion, expressely against the truth of their
words who said, they <hi>had declared the whole truth of God,</hi> and <hi>told
all the will of God:</hi> and it is an affront to the Spirit of God, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of wisdom, and knowledge, of order and publike ministeries.
But the will furnishes out malice, and the understanding sends out
levity, and they marry, and produce a phantastick dream, and the
daughter sucking winde instead of the milk of the word, growes up
to madnesse and the spirit of reprobation. Besides all this, an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> spirit is extremely unnecessary, and God does not give
immissions and miracles from heaven to no purpose, and to no
necessities of his Church; for the supplying of which he hath given
<hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Evangelists, Prophets</hi> and <hi>Pastors, Bishops</hi> and <hi>Priests,</hi>
the <hi>spirit of Ordination,</hi> and <hi>the spirit of instruction, Catechists,</hi> and
<hi>Teachers, Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences, Scriptures</hi> and <hi>a constant succession of
Expositors,</hi> the testimony of Churches, and a constant line of <hi>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi>
or delivery of Apostolical Doctrine in all things necessary
to salvation. And after all this, to have a <hi>fungus</hi> arise from the
belly of mud and darknesse, and nourish a gloworm, that shall
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> challenge to out-shine the lantern of Gods word, and all the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
which God set upon a hill, and all that the Spirit hath set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the candlesticks; and all <hi>the starres in Christs right hand,</hi> is to
annull all the excellent, established, orderly, and certain effects of
the Spirit of God, and to worship the false fires of the night. He
therefore that will follow a Guide that leads him by an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
spirit, shall go an extraordinary way, and have a strange for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
and a singular religion, and a portion by himself, a great way
off from the common inheritance of the Saints, who are all led by
the Spirit of God, and have one heart, and one minde, one faith,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and one hope, the same baptisme, and the helps of the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
leading them to the common countrey, which is the por<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion of
all that are the sons of adoption, consigned by the Spirit of God,
<hi>the earnest of their inheritance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the pretence of a private spirit, for interpretation
of the confessed doctrine of God (the holy Scriptures) it will not
so easily come into this Question of choosing our spirituall Guides;
Because every person that can be Candidate in this office, that can
be chosen to guide others, must be a publike man, that is, of a
holy calling, sanctified or separate publikely to the office; and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> then to interpret is part of his calling, and imployment, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd to do
so is the work of a publike spirit; he is ordained and designed, he
is commanded and inabled to do it: and in this there is no other
caution to be interposed, but that the more publike the man is, of
the more authority his interpretation is; and he comes neerest to
a law of order, and in the matter of government is to be observed:
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:53465:149"/>
but the more holy and the more learned the man is, his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
in matter of Question is more likely to be true:
and though lesse to be pressed as to the publick confession yet it may
be more effective to a private perswasion, provided it be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
scandal, or lessening the authority, or disparagement to the more
publick person.</p>
            <p>8. Those are to be suspected for evil guides, who to get authority
among the people pretend a great zeal, and use a bold liberty in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
Princes and Governours, nobility and Prelates; for such
homilies cannot be the effects of a holy religion, which lay a snare
for authority, and undermine power, and discontent the people <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
and make them bold against Kings, and immodest in their own
stations, and trouble the government. Such men may speak a truth
or teach a true doctrine; for every such designe does not unhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the truth of God; but they take some truthes and force them
to minister to an evil end; but therefore, mingle not in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities
of such men, for they will make it a part of your religion
to prosecute that end openly which they by arts of the <hi>Tempter</hi> have
insinuated privately.</p>
            <p>But if ever you enter into the seats of those Doctors that speak
reproachfully of their Superiours, or detract from government,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
or love to curse the King in their heart, or slander him with their
mouths, or disgrace their persons, blesse your self and retire quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
for there dwells the plague, but the spirit of God is not presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of the assembly; and therefore you shall observe in all the
characters which the B. Apostles of our Lord made for describing
and avoiding societies of hereticks,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 4. 5.</note> false guides and bringers in of
strange doctrines, still they reckon <hi>treason and rebellion;</hi> so S. Paul,
<hi>In the last dayes perillous times shall come, the men shall have the form

high minded:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 10.</note> thats their characteristic <hi>note.</hi> So Saint Peter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>the Lord</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               <hi>knoweth how to deliver the Godly out of temptations and to reserve the
unjust unto the day of judgement to be punished. But chiefly them that
walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleannesse and despise government;
presumptuous are they, self willed they are not afraid to speak evil of
dignities.</hi>
               <note place="margin">vers. 8. ep. Jude.</note> The same also is recorded and observed by Saint <hi>Jude,
likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion and
speak evil of dignities.</hi> These three testimonies are but the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of one great contingency; they are the same prophesy decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by three Apostolical men, that had the gift of prophecy: and
by this character the Holy Ghost in all ages hath given us caution <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
to avoid such assemblies, where the speaking and ruling man shall
be the canker of government, and a preacher of sedition, who
shall either ungirt the Princes sword, or unloose the button of
their mantle.</p>
            <p>9. But the Apostles in all these prophecies have remarked lust to
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:53465:149"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> be the inseparable companion of these rebel prophets: <hi>they are fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
dreamers, they defile the flesh;</hi> so Saint Jude: <hi>they walk after the
flesh in the lust of uncleannesse,</hi> so Saint Peter <hi>they are lovers of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
more then lovers of God, incontinent and sensual.</hi> So Saint Paul
and by this part of the character, as the Apostles remarked the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colatians,
and Gnosticks, the Carpocratians and all their
impure branches which began in their dayes and multiplied after
their deaths, so they prophetically did foresignifie al such sects to be
avoided who to catch <hi>silly women laden with sins</hi> preach doctrines of
ease and licenciousnesse, apt to countenance and encourage vile
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> things, and not apt to restrain a passion, or mortifie a sin. Such as
those; that [God sees no sin in his children: that no sin will take us
from Gods favour; that all of such a party are elect people: that
God requires of us nothing but faith: and that faith which justifies
is nothing but a meere believing, that we are Gods chosen: that we
are not tied to the law of commandments: that the law of grace is
a law of liberty: and that liberty is to do what we list; that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorces
are to be granted upon many and slight causes: that simple
fornication is no sin: these are such doctrines, that upon the belief
of them men may doe any thing, and will do that which shall sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> their own desires and promote their interests and seduce their
shee disciples: and indeed it was not without great reason that these
three Apostles joyned <hi>lust and treason</hi> together; because the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
is so shameful a crime and renders a mans spirit naturally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
to government that if it falls upon the person of a Ruler,
it takes from him the spirit of government, and render, him <hi>diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
pusillanimous, private,</hi> and <hi>ashamed;</hi> if it happen in the person
of a subject, it makes him hate the man that shall shame him and
punish him: it hates the light and the Sun, because that opens
him, and therefore is much more against government because that
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> publishes and punishes too. One thing I desire to be observed, that
though the primitive heresies now named and all those others their
successors practised and taught horrid impurities, yet they did not
invade government at all, and therefore those sects that these A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
did signifie by prophecy, and in whom both these are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centred,
were to appear in some latter times; and the dayes of the
prophecy were not then to be fulfill'd; what they are since, every age
must judge,<note place="margin">Eloquia Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni casta eloquia</note> by its own experience, &amp; for its own interest. But Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
religion is so pure and holy that <hi>chastity</hi> is sometimes used for the
whole <hi>religion,</hi> and to do an action <hi>chastly</hi> signifies <hi>purity of inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> abstraction</hi> from the world and <hi>separation</hi> from low and secular
ends, the <hi>virginity</hi> of the soul, and its <hi>union</hi> with God; and all <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viations</hi>
and <hi>estrangements</hi> from God and adhesion to forbidden
objects is called <hi>fornication</hi> and <hi>adultery.</hi> Those sects therefore that
teach, incourage, or practise impious or unhallowed mixtures and
shameful lusts are issues of the impure spirit and most contrary to
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:53465:150"/>
God who can behold no unclean thing.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
            </p>
            <p>10. Those prophets and Pastors that pretend severity and live
loosely, or are severe in small things and give liberty in greater, or
forbid some sins with extreme rigour, and yet practise or teach
those that serve their interest or constitute their sect, are to be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
and avoided accordingly. <hi>Nihil est hominum ineptâ persuasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
falsius, nec fictâ severitate ineptius.</hi> All ages of the Church were
extremely curious to observe when any new teachers did arise, what
kinde of lives they lived: and if they pretended severely and to a
strict life, then they knew their danger doubled: for it is certain all
that teach doctrines contrary to the established religion, delivered by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
the Apostles, all they are evil men. God will not suffer a good man
to be seduced damnably, much lesse can he be a seducer of others:
and therefore you shall still observe the false Apostles to be furious
and vehement in their reproofs and severe in their animadversions
of others; but then if you watch their private, or stay till their
numbers are full, or observe their spiritual habits, you shall finde
them indulgent to themselves, or to return from their disguises, or
so spiritually wicked, that their <hi>pride,</hi> or their <hi>revenge,</hi> their <hi>envie</hi>
or their <hi>detraction,</hi> their <hi>scorn</hi> or their <hi>complacency</hi> in themselves,
their <hi>desire of preheminence</hi> and <hi>their impatience</hi> of arrival, shall place <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
them far enough in distance from a poor <hi>carnal sinner,</hi> whom they
shall load with censures and an upbraiding scorn; but themselves
are like Devils, the spirits of darknesse <hi>the spiritual wickednesses in
high places.</hi> Some sects of men are very angry against servants for
recreating and easing their labours with a lesse prudent and an unse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
refreshment; but the patron of their sect shall oppresse a
wicked man and an unbelieving person; they shall chastise a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard
and entertain murmurrers; they shall not abide an oath and yet
shal force men to break three or four. This sect is to be avoided, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
although it is good to be severe against carnal or bodily sins, yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
it is not good to mingle with them who chastise <hi>a bodily sin</hi> to make
way <hi>for a spiritual,</hi> or reprove a servant, that his Lord may sin alone,
or punish a stranger and a begger that will not approve their sins,
but will have sins of his own. Concering such persons Saint Paul
hath told us that <hi>they shall not proceed far, but their folly shall be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest.</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> said Lysias. <hi>Cito
ad naturam ficta reciderunt sua.</hi> They that dissemble their sin and
their manners, or make severity to serve loosnesse, and an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
vertue to minister to a real vice; they that <hi>abhor Idols and
would commit sacrilege:</hi> chastise a drunkard and promote sedition,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
declaime against the vanity of great persons, and then spoil them
of their goods, reform manners and engrosse estates, talk godly
and do impiously, these are teachers, which the Holy spirit of
God hath by three Apostles bid us to beware of and decline as we
would run from the hollownesse of a grave or the despaires and
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:53465:150"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> sorrows of the damned.</p>
            <p>11. The substance of al is this, that we must not chose our doctrine
by our guide; but our guide by the doctrine, &amp; if we doubt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the doctrine we may judge of that by the lives and designes of the
Teachers: <hi>By their fruits you shall know them,</hi> and by the plain words
of the scripture, by the Apostles Creed, and by the commandments,
and by the certain known and established forms of government;
These are the great <hi>indices,</hi> and so plain, apt and easy; that he that
is deceived is so because he will be so; he is betrayed into it by his
own lust and a voluntary chosen folly.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 12 Besides these premises there are other little candles, that
can help to make the judgement clearer but they are such as do
not signifie alone, but in conjunction with some of the precedent
characters which are drawn by the great lines of scripture. Such
as are 1. when the teachers of sects stir up unprofitable and uselesse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
Questions, 2. when they causelesly retire from the universal customs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
of Christendom, 3. And cancel all the memorials of the greatest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
mysteries of our redemption, 4. When their confessions and Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chismes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
and their whole religion consist <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> in speculations and

outward guises and material solemnities and imperfect formes
drawing the heart of the vine forth into leaves and irregular fruitless
suckers, turning the substance into circumstances, and the love of
God into gestures, and the effect of the spirit into the impertinent
offices of a burdensom ceremonial: For by these two particulars
the Apostles reproved the Jews and the Gnostics, or those that
from the school of Pythagoras pretended conversation with Angels
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and great knowledge of the secrets of the spirit; chosing tutelar
Angels and assigning them offices and charges,<note place="margin">Colos. 2</note> as in the Church of

upon his proper grounds, but if he refuses that, refuse his conduct
sure enough, 7. You may also watch whether they do not chose
their proselyts amongst the rich and vitious; that they m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

suppletories to excuse an evil man and yet to reconcile his
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:53465:151"/>
bad life with the hopes of heaven, you have reason to suspect the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
whole and to reject these parts of errour and designe which in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are so unhandsom alwayes, and somtimes criminal. He that
shal observe the Church of Rome so implacably fierce for purgatory
and the Popes supremacy, from clerical immunities, and the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority
of the Ecclesiastical persons to secular, for indulgencies and
precious and costly pardons, and then so full of devises to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
an evil life with heaven, requiring onely contrition, even at the
last for the abolition of eternal guilt; and having a thousand wayes
to commute and take off the temporal; will see he hath reason to
be jealous that interest is in these bigger then the religion, and yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
that the danger of the soul is greater then that interest; and therefore
the man is to do accordingly.</p>
            <p>Here indeed is the great necessity that we should have the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and discretion, the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of serpents,</p>

               <l>—ut cernamus acutum</l>
               <l>Quam aut aquila aut serpens Epidaurius.</l>
            </q>
            <p>For so serpents as they are curious to preserve their heads from
contrition or a bruise, so also to safeguard themselves that they be
not charmed with sweet and enticing words of false prophets; who
charm not <hi>wisely,</hi> but <hi>cunningly,</hi> leading aside <hi>unstable souls;</hi> against <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
these we must stop our ears or lend our attention according to the
foregoing measures and significations; but here also I am to insert
two or three cautions.</p>
            <p>1. We cannot expect that by these or any other signes we shall
be inabled to discover concerning <hi>all men</hi> whether they teach an
errour or no. Neither can a man by these reprove a Lutheran, or a
Zuinglian, a Dominican or a Franciscan, a Russian or a Greek, a
Muscovite or a Georgian, because those which are certain signes of
false teachers, do signifie such men, who destroy an article of
faith or a commandment; God was careful to secure us from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
death by removing the Lepers from the camp, and giving certain
notices of distinction, and putting a term between the living and the
dead: but he was not pleased to secure every man from innocent
and harmlesse errors, from the mistakes of men, and the failings of
mortality. The signes which can distinguish a living man from a
dead, will not also distinguish a black man from a brown, or a
pale from a white: It is enough that we decline those guides that
lead us to hell, but not to think that we are inticed to death by the
weaknesses of every disagreeing brother.</p>
            <p>2. In all discerning of sects, we must be careful to distinguish the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
faults of men from the evils of their doctrine; for some there are
that say very well, and do very ill, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Multos Thyrsigeros, paucos est cernere Bacchos:</hi> Many men of <hi>holy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
and <hi>holy religion</hi> that are of <hi>unholy lives; homines ignavâ operâ
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:53465:151"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Philosophâ sententiâ:</hi> But these must be separated from the instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
and the evil of the men is onely to be noted, as that such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
be not taken to our single conduct, and personal ministery;
I will be of the mans religion if it be good, though he be not; but
I will not make him my confessor <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. If he
be not wise for himself, I will not sit down at his feet lest we
mingle filthinesse instead of being cleansed and instructed.</p>
            <p>3. Let us make one separation more &amp; then we may consider and act
according to the premises: If we espie a designe or an evil mark up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one doctrine let us divide it from the other that are not so spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> for indeed the publick communions of men are at this day so
ordered, that they are as fond of their errours as of their truthes,
and somtimes moct zealous for what they have least reason to be
so: and if we can by any arts of prudence separate from an evil
proposition and communicate in all the good, then we may love
colleges of religious persons, though we do not worship images,
and we may obey our Prelates, though we do no injury to prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and we may be zealous against a crime, though we be not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious
over mens persons, and we may be diligent in the conduct
of souls though we be not rapacious of estates, and we may be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> exactors of Obedience to human laws though we do not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense
with the breach of the divine; and the Clergy may represent
their calling necessary though their persons be full of modesty and
humility, and we may preserve our rights and not lose our charity.
For this is the meaning of the Apostle, <hi>Try all things and retain that
which is good:</hi> from every sect and communitie of Christians take
any thing that is good, that advances holy religion, and the Divine
honour; For one hath a better government, a second a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
a third hath excellent spiritual arts for the conduct of souls,
a fourth hath fewer errours, and by what instrument soever a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> life is advantaged use that though thou grindest thy spears and
arrows at the forges of the Philistines; knowing thou hast no Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
but Christ, no religion but the Christian, no rule but the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
and the laws and right reason, other things that are helps, are
to be used accordingly.</p>
            <p>These are the general rules of Christian prudence which I have
chosen to insist upon; there are many others more particular indeed,
but yet worth not onely the enumerating, but observing also, and
that they be reduced to practise. For the prudence of a Christian does
oblige and direct respectively all the children of the institution;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>* that we be careful to decline a danger, * watchful against a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
* alwayes choosing that that is safe, and fitted to all circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
* that we be wise in choosing our company * reserved and wary
in our friendships, * and communicative in our charity, * that we
be silent and retentive of what we hear and what we think, * not
credulous, * not unconstant, * that we be deliberate in our election
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:53465:152"/>
* and vigorous in our prosecutions, that we suffer not good nature to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
discompose our duty but that we separate images from substances,
and the pleasing of a present company from our religion to God, and
our eternal interest: for sometimes that which is counselled to us
by <hi>Christian prudence</hi> is accounted folly by <hi>humane prudence,</hi> and
so it is ever accounted when our duty leads us into a persecution.
* Hither also appertain; that we never do a thing that we know
we must repent of, * that we do not admire too many things, nor
anything too much, * that we be even in prosperity * and patient
in adversity; but transported with neither into the regions of des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
or levity, pusillanimity or Tyranny, dejection or Garishnesse, * al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
to look upon the sear we have impressed upon our flesh, and
no more to handle dangers and knives, to abstain from ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and vexatious suits, not to contend with a mighty man, * ever to
listen to him (who according to the proverb) <hi>hath four ears, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
Religion, wisdom</hi> and <hi>experience,</hi> * rather to lose a benefit then to
suffer a detriment and an evil, * to stop the beginnings of evil,
* to pardon and not to observe all the faults of friends or
enemies; * of evils to choose the least, * and of goods to
choose the greatest, if it be also safest; * not to be insolent in
successe, but to proceed according to the probability of humane <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
causes and contingencies, * ever to be thankful for benefits, * and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
to others and useful in all that we can, * to watch the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and circumstances of actions, * to do that willingly which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be avoided, lest the necessity serve anothers appetite, and it
be lost to all our purposes, <hi>Insignis enim est prudentiae, ut quod non
facere non possis, id facere ut libenter fecisse videaris,</hi> * not to pursue dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
uncertain and obscure things with violence and passion. These
if we observe we shall do advantage to our selves and to the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and avoid those evils which fools and unwary people suffer for
nothing, dying or bleeding without cause and without pity. I end <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

Martial's character of a good man: a wary and cautious inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
a harmlesse providence, and provision: <hi>Verâ simplicitate

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> his castles and strong forts, but takes away his swords,
and spears, or else his anger and his malice, his peevishnesse and
spite. But such is the misery, and such is the iniquity of mankinde,
that craft hath invaded all the contracts and entercourses of men,
and made simplicity so weak a thing, that it is grown into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,

and when the innocency of the old simple Romans in Junius Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
time, in Fabritius, and Camillus began to degenerate, and to
need the Aquilian law to force men to deal honestly, quickly the
mischief increased, till the Aquilian law grew as much out of
power, as honesty was out of countenance. And there, and every
where else men thought they got a purchase, when they met with
an honest man, and <gap reason="foreign">

a simplicity which onely wanted craft, or deceit, but wanted no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
prudence or caution, and that is truly <hi>Christian simplicity,</hi> or the
sincerity of an honest; and ingenious, and a fearlesse person; and
it is a rare band, not onely of societies, and contracts, but also of
friendships, and advantages of mankinde.</p>
            <p>We do not live in an age in which there is so much need to bid
men be wary, as to take care that they be innocent: Indeed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
we are usually too loose, and ungirt, exposing our selves to
temptation, and others to offence, and our name to dishonour, and
the cause it self to reproach, and we are open and ready to every
evil but persecution: from that we are close enough, and that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
alone we call prudence; but in the matter of interest we are wary
as serpents, subtil as foxes vigilant as the birds of the night, rapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
as Kites, tenacious as grapling hooks and the weightiest
anchors, and above all, false and hypocritical as a thin crust of
ice, spread upon the face of a deep, smooth, and dissembling pit;
if you set your foot, your foot slips, or the ice breaks, and you
sink into death, and are wound in a sheet of water, descending in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
mischief or your grave; suffering a great fall, or a sudden
death by your confidence and unsuspecting foot. There is an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
crust of hypocrisie, that covers the face of the greatest part <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
of mankinde. Their religion consists in forms and outsides, and
serves reputation or a designe, but does not serve God: Their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
are but fair language, and the civilities of the Piazzas or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes,
and disband and unty like the air that beat upon their
teeth, when they spake the delicious and hopefull words. Their
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:53465:153"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> oaths are snares to catch men, and make them confident: Their
contracts are arts and stratagems to deceive, measured by profit
and possibility; and every thing is lawfull that is gainfull; and
their friendships are trades of getting; and their kindnesse of watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a dying friend, is but the office of a vulture, the gaping for a
legacy, the spoil of the carcasse; and their sicknesses are many
times policies of state, sometimes a designe to shew the riches of
our bed-chamber; and their funeral tears are but the paranymphs
and pious solicitors of a second Bride; and every thing that is ugly
must be hid, and every thing that is handsome must be seen, and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that will make a fair cover for a huge deformity; and therefore
it is (as they think) necessary that men should alwayes have some
pretences and forms, some faces of religion, or sweetnesse of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
confident affirmatives, or bold oaths, protracted treaties,
or multitude of words, affected silence, or grave deportment, a
good name, or a good cause, a fair relation, or a worthy calling,
great power, or a pleasant wit; any thing that can be fair, or that
can be usefull, any thing that can do good, or be thought good,
we use it to abuse our brother, or promote our interests. <hi>Leporina</hi>

resolved to die with her that had so great a kindnesse for him as
not to out-live the best of her husbands fortune. It was agreed
and she temperd the poyson, and drank the face of the unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
goblet, but the weighty poyson sunke to the bottome, and
the easie man drank it all off, and died, and the woman carried
him forth to funeral, and after a little illnesse which she soon re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>covered,
she enterd upon the inheritance and a second marriage.</p>

and discover the contrary vice, by the several parts of its
proportion.</p>
            <p>1. The first office of Christian simplicity consists in our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and manners: that they be open and honest, publike and
justifiable, the same at home and abroad; for besides the ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity
and honesty of this, there is an indispensable, and infinite ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
it should be so, because whoever is a hypocrite in his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
mocks God, presenting to him the outside, and reserving <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
the inward for his enemy: which is either a denying God to be the
searcher of our hearts, or else an open defiance of his omniscience,
and of his justice: To provoke God that we may deceive men, to
defie his Almightinesse, that we may abuse our brother, is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
all that is Sacred, all that is prudent, it is an open hostility
to all things humane and divine, a breaking from all the bands
of all relations, and uses God so cheaply as if he were to be trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
or could be cozened like a weak man, and an undiscerning

we may reasonably think, that if the colours of religion so well
do advantage to us, the substance and reality would do it much

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of both the worlds if we serve in the offices of religion de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>voutly
and charitably, before men and before God: if we ask of
God things honest in the sight of men, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (as Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras
gave in precept) praying to God with a free heart and a
publike prayer, and doing before men things that are truly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to God, turning our heart outward and our face inwards, that
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:53465:155"/>
is, conversing with men as in the presence of God, and in our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
towards God, being as holy and devout, as if we prayed in
publike, and in the corners of the streets. Pliny praising of Ariston,
gave him the title of an honest and hearty religion. <hi>Ornat hunc ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitudo
animi quae nihil ad ostentationem, omnia ad conscientiam re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fert:
rectèque facti, non ex populi sermone mercedem, sed ex facto
petit.</hi> And this does well state the question of a sincere religion, and
an ingenuous goodnesse; It requires that we do nothing for osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
but every thing for conscience; and we may be obliged in
conscience to publish our manner of lives, but then it must be, not
that we may have a popular noise for a reward, but that God may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
be glorified by our publike worshippings, and others edified by
our good examples.</p>
            <p>Neither doth the sincerity of our religion require that we should
not conceal our sins, for he that sins and dares to own them pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
may become impudent: and so long as in modesty we desire
our shame should be hid, and men to think better of us then we
deserve, I say for no other reason, but either because we would
not derive the ill examples to others, or the shame to our selves,
we are within the protection of one of vertues sisters, and we are
not far from the gates of the kingdom of heaven; easie and apt to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
be invited in, and not very unworthy to enter.</p>
            <p>But if any other principle draws the vail, if we conceal our vices
because we would be honoured for sanctity, or because we would
not be hindered in our designes, we serve the interest of pride and
ambition, covetousnesse, or vanity; if an innocent purpose hides
the ulcer, it does half heal it; but if it retires into the secrecy of
sin and darknesse, it turns into a plague, and infects the heart, and
it dies infallibly of a double exulceration. The Macedonian boy
that kept the coal in his flesh, and would not shake his arm, lest

in danger of discovery, payed the price of a bold hypocrisie; that
is, the dissimulation reproveable in matter of manners, which

Lucian notes it of his Philosophical hypocrites, dissemblers in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

enter into the vaults of harlots, and are not ashamed to see a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>

A mighty wrastler, that had won a crown at Olympus, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending

we finde that the Nicene faith prevailed upon all the world though
some Arian Bishops went from Ariminum to Nice, and there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
their own articles, and called it, <hi>the faith read at Nice,</hi> and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
all arts and all violence, and all lying, and all diligence to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance
it, yet it could not be, it was the truth of God and
therefore it was stronger then all the gates of hell, then all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of darknesse: and he that tells a lie for his religion or goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
by fraud and imposture to gain proselytes, either dares not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
trust his cause or dare not trust God. True religion is open in its
articles, honest in its prosecutions, just in its conduct, inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
when it is accused, ignorant of falsehood, sure in its truth, sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in its sayings: and (as Julius Capitolinus said of the <hi>Emperour
Verus) it is morum simplicium &amp; quae adumbrare nihil possit: it covers</hi>
indeed <hi>a multitude of sins</hi> by curing them, and obtaining par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
for them, but it can dissemble nothing of it self, it cannot tell or
do a lie: but it can become a sacrifice; a good man can quit his
life but never his integrity. Thats the first duty; the sum of which
is that which Aquilius said concerning fraud and craft, <hi>bona fides</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
the honesty of a mans faith and religion is destroyed <hi>cum aliud si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulatum
aliud actum sit,</hi> when either we conceale what we ought to
publish, or do not act what we pretend.</p>
            <p>2. Christian simplicity or the innocence of prudence relates to
laws both in their sanction and execution; that they be decreed
with equity and proportioned to the capacity and profit of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
and that they be applied to practise with remissions and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
interpretations agreeable to the sence of the words and
the minde of the lawgiver; but laws are not to be cosened and abused
by contradictory glosses, and phantastick elusions as knowing that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
if the majesty and sacrednesse of them be once abused and subjected
to contempt and unreasonable and easy resolutions, their girdle is
unloosed and they suffer the shame of prostitution and contempt
When Saul made a law, that he that eat before night should die,
the people perswaded him directly to rescind it, in the case of Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan,
because it was unequal and unjust that he who had wrought
their deliverance, and in that working it, was absent from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation
of the law should suffer for breaking it, in a case of
violent necessity and of which he heard nothing upon so faire and
probable a cause: and it had been well that the Persian had been so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
rescued who against the laws of his country killed a Lion to save
the life of his Prince; in such cases it is fit the law be rescinded and
dispensed with all, as to certain particulars, so it be done ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
with competent authority, in great necessity, and without
partiality: But that which I intend here is, that in the rescission or
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:53465:156"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> dispensation of the law the processe be open and free, and such as
shall preserve the law and its sacrednesse as well as the person and
his interest. The laws of Sparta forbad any man to be twice Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
but when their affaires required it, they made Araeus titular
and Lysander supravisor of him, and Admiral to all real and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
purposes; this wanted ingenuity and laid a way open for
them to despise the law which was made patient of such a weak
evasion; The Lacedemonian Embassador perswaded Pericles to
turn the tables of the law, which were forbidden to be removed,
and an other ordained in a certain case that the laws should sleep
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 24. hours; A third decreed that June should be called May, because
the time of an election appointed by the law was elapsed; these arts
are against the ingenuity and simplicitie of laws, and lawgivers; and
teach the people to cheat in their obedience, when their Judges are
so fraudulent in the administration of their laws. Every law should
be made plain, open, honest, &amp; significant, and he that makes a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
and intricates it on purpose, or by inconsideration, layes a
snare or leaves one there, and is either an imprudent person, and
therefore unfit to govern, or else he is a Tyrant and a vul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ur. It is
too much that a man can make a law by an arbitrary power. But
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> when he shall also leave the law so that every of the ministers of
Justice and the Judges shall have power to rule by a loose, by an
arbitrary, by a contradictory interpretation, it is intolerable. They
that rule by prudence, should above all things see that the patrons
and Advocates of innocence should be harmlesse and without an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
sting.</p>
            <p>3. Christian simplicity relates to promises and acts of grace and
favour; and its caution is, that all promises be simple, ingenuous,
agreeable to the intention of the promiser, truly and effectually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
and never going lesse in the performance, then in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and words of the expression: concerning which the cases are
several. 1. First all promises in which a third or a second person hath
no interest, that is the promises of kindnesse and civilities, are tied
to passe into performance, <hi>secundum aequum &amp; bonum:</hi> and though
they may oblige to some small inconvenience, yet never to a great
one: and I will visit you to morrow morning, because I promised
you, and therefore. I will come <hi>etiamsi non concoxero,</hi> although I
have not slept my full sleep, but <hi>Si febricitavcro</hi> if I be in a feaver
or have reason to fear one, I am disobliged. For the nature of such
promises bears upon them no bigger burthen, then can be expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> by reasonable civilities and the common expectation of kinde,
and the ordinary performances of just men, who do excuse and
are excused respectively, by all rules of reason proportionably to
such small entercourses: and therefore although such conditions
be not expressed in making promises, yet to perform or rescind
them by such laws is not against Christian simplicity. 2. Promises
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:53465:157"/>
in matters of justice or in matters of grace as from a superiour to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
an inferiour must be so singly and ingenuously expressed, intended
and performed accordingly, that no condition is to be reserved or
supposed in them to warrant their non-performance, but impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
or that which is next to it, an intolerable inconvenience; in
which cases we have a natural liberty to commute our promises, but
so that we pay to the interested person a good, at least equal to that
which we first promised. And to this purpose it may be added that
it is not against Christian simplicity to expresse our promises in such
words which we know the interested man will understand to other
purposes then I intend so it be not lesse that I mean, then that he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
hopes for. When our Blessed Saviour told his disciples, that <hi>they
should sit upon twelve thrones,</hi> they presently thought they had his
bond for a kingdom, and dreamt of wealth, and honour, power
and a splendid court: and Christ knew they did, but did not disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle
his promise from the enfolded and intricate sence of which
his words were naturally capable; but he performed his promise,
to better purposes, then they hoped for; they were presidents in
the conduct of souls, Princes of Gods people, the chief in suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
stood neerest to the crosse, had an elder brothers portion in the
Kingdom of grace, were the founders of Churches, and dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
of the mysteries of the kingdom and ministers of the spirit of
God and chanels of mighty blessings, under mediators in the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of their Lord and <hi>their names were written in heaven;</hi> and this
was infinitely better, then to groan and wake under a head
pressed with a golden crown and pungent cares, and to eat alone,
and to walk in a croud and to be vexed with all the publick and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the private evils of the people, which is the sum Total of
an earthly Kingdom.</p>
            <p>When God promised to the obedient that they should live long
in the land, which he would give them, he meant it of the land of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
Canaan, but yet reserved to himself the liberty of taking them quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from that land and carrying them to a better. He that promises to
lend me a staffe to walk withal, and instead of that gives me a horse
to carry me, hath not broken his promise, nor dealt deceitfully. And
this is Gods dealing with mankinde; he promises more then we
could hope for; and when he hath done that, he gives us more
then he hath promised. God hath promised to give to them that
fear him all that they need, food and raiment; but he addes out of
the treasures of his mercy; variety of food and changes of raiment;
some to get strength and some to refresh, something for them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
that are in health and some for the sick. And though that skins of
buls and stagges and foxes and bears could have drawn a vail thick
enough to hide the apertures of sin and natural shame and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
us from heat and cold, yet when he addeth the fleeces of
sheep and beavers, and the spoiles of silk worms, he hath proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:53465:157"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that although his promises are the bounds of our certain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
yet they are not the limits of his loving kindnesse; and if
he does more then he hath promised, no man can complain that he
did otherwise, and did greater things then he said: thus God
does, but therefore so also must we; imitating that example, and
transcribing that copy of divine truth, alwayes remembring that
his promises are yea and Amen And although God often goes
more, yet he never goes lesse; and therefore we must never go
from ur promises, unlesse we be thrust from thence by disabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
or let go by leave, or called up higher by a greater intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and increase of kindnesse: And therefore when Solyman
had sworn to Ibrahim-Bassa that he would never kill him so long
as he were alive, he quitted himself but ill, when he sent an Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch
to cut his throat when he slept, because the Priest told him
that sleep was death. His act was false and deceitful as his great
prophet.</p>
            <p>But in this part of simplicity <hi>we Christians</hi> have a most especiall
obligation, for our religion being ennobled by the most and the
greatest promises, and our faith made confident by the veracity
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of our Lord, and his word made certain by miracles and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies,
and voices from heaven, and all the testimony of God
himself, and that truth it self is bound upon us by the efficacy of
great endearments and so many precepts; if we shall suffer the faith
of a Christian to be an instrument to deceive our brother, and
that he must either be incredulous or deceived, uncharitable
or deluded like a fool, we dishonour the sacrednesse of the
institution and become strangers to the spirit of truth, and
to the eternall word of God. Our Blessed Lord would not
have his disciples to swear at all (no not in publick Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> if the necessities of the world would permit him to
be obeyed: If Christians will live according to the religion,
the word of a Christian were sufficient instrument to give
testimony and to make promises, to secure a faith, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that supposition oathes were uselesse, and therefore forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
because there could be no necessity to invoke Gods name
in promises or affirmations if men were indeed Christians: and
therefore in that case would be a taking it in vain; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
many are not and they that are in name oftentimes are
so in nothing else, it became necessary that man should swear
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> in judgment and in publick courts; but consider who it was
that invented and made the necessitie of oaths, of bonds, of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curities,
of statutes, extents, judgements and all the artifices of
humane diffidence and dishonesty; These things were indeed
found out by men; but the necessity of these was from him
that is the father of lies, from him that hath made many faire
promises but never kept any, or if he did, it was to do a
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:53465:158"/>
bigger mischief, to cozen the more: for so does the Devil: He <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
promises rich harvests and blasts the corn in the spring, he tells
his servants they shall be rich, and fills them with beggerly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
makes them base and indigent, greedy and penurious, and
they that serve him intirely, as witches and such miserable persons
never can be rich: if he promises health, then men grow confident
and intemperate and do such things whereby they shall die the
sooner, and die longer they shall die eternally. He deceives men
in their trust, and frustrates their hopes, and eludes their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and his promises have a period set, beyond which they
cannot be true; For wicked men shall enjoy a faire fortune but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
till their appointed time, and then it ends imperfect and most
accomplished misery: and therefore even in this performance he
deceives them most of all, promising and performing coloured
stones, and glasse-gems that he may cozen them of their glorious
inheritance. All fraudulent breakers of promises dresse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by his glasse whose best imagery, is deformity and
lies.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

Contracts, and matters of buying and selling, covenants,
associations, and all such entercourses, which suppose
an equality of persons as to the matter of right and justice in the

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> was the old Attick law: and nothing
is more contrary to Christian religion, then that the entercourses
of justice be direct snares, and that we should deal with men,
as men deal with foxes, and wolves, and vermin; do all violence,
and when that cannot be, use all craft and every thing whereby
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> they can be made miserable.</p>

            <p>There are men in the world who love to smile, but that smile
is more dangerous then the furrows of a contracted brow, or a
storm in Adria; for their purpose is onely to deceive; they easily
speak what they never mean, they heap up many arguments to
perswade that to others, which themselves beleeve not; they praise
that vehemently which they deride in their hearts, they declaim
against a thing which themselves covet, they beg passionately for
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that which they value not, and run from an object which they
would fain have to follow and overtake them, they excuse a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
dexterously, where the man is beloved, and watch to surprize
him where he is unguarded; they praise that they may sell, and
disgrace that they may keep. And these hypocrisies are so inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven
and imbroidered with their whole designe; that some nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
refuse to contract till their arts are taken off by the society of
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:53465:159"/>
banquets, and the good natured kindnesses of festivall chalices, for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
so Tacitus observes concerning the old Germans, <hi>[De asciscendis
principibus de pace &amp; bello in conviviis consultant, tanquam nullo
magis tempore ad simplices cogitationes pateat animus, aut ad ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnas
incalescat:</hi> as if then they were more simple when they were
most valiant, and were least deceitfull, when they were least
themselves.</p>
            <p>But it is an evil condition that a mans honesty shall be owing to his
wine, and vertue must live at the charge and will of a vice. The <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
band</hi> of societies and contracts is, <hi>justice and necessities, religion</hi>
and <hi>the laws; the measures</hi> of it are <hi>equitie</hi> and <hi>our selves</hi> and <hi>our own</hi>

of the exchange and <hi>conveyance</hi> of the whole entercourse
is, <hi>words and actions,</hi> as they are expounded by custome, consent, or
the understanding of the interested person; in which if simplicitie
be not severely preserved, it is impossible that humane society can
subsist, but men shall be forced to snatch at what they have bought,
and take securities that men swear truly, and exact an oath, that such
is the meaning of the word, and no man shall think himself secure,
but shall fear he is robbed if he has not possession first; and it shall
be disputed who shall trust the other, and neither of them shall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
have cause to be confident upon bands or oaths, or witnesses, or
promises, or all the honour of men, or all the ingagements of
religion,<note place="margin">Lib. 8. instit.</note>

said Cyrus in Xenophon. A man though he
desires it, yet cannot be confident of the man that pretends truth
yet tells a lye and is deprehended to have made use of the sacred
name of friendship or religion, honesty or reputation to deceive his
brother.</p>
            <p>But because a man may be deceived by deeds and open actions as
well as words; therefore it concerns their duty, that no man by an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
action on purpose done to make his brother believe a lie abuse his
persuasion and his interest, When <hi>Pythius</hi> the <hi>Sicilian</hi> had a minde
to sell his garden to <hi>Cannius</hi> he invited him thither, and caused
fisherman (as if by custom) to fish in the chanell by which the
gardens stood, and they threw a great store of fish into their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and made <hi>Cannius</hi> believe it was so every day, and the man
grew greedy of that place of pleasure, and gave Pythius a double
price, and the next day perceived himself abused. Actions of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
and simulation are like snares laid, into which the beasts fall
though you pursue them not, but walk in the inquiry for their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
provisions; and if a man fall into a snare that you have laid,
it is no excuse to say you did not tempt him thither: to lay a snare
is against the ingenuity of a good man and a Christian, and from
thence he ought to be drawn, and therefore it is not fit we should
place a danger which our selves are therefore bound to hinder, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:53465:159"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> from thence we are obliged to rescue him. <hi>Vir bonus est, qui
prodest quibus potest, nocet nemini,</hi> when we do all the good we can,
and do an evil to no man, then onely we are accounted good men.
But this pretence of an action signifying otherwise then it looks for,
is onely forbidden in matter of contract, and the material interest
of a second person. But when actions are of a double signification,
or when a man is not abused or defeated of his right by an uncertain
signe, it is lawfull to do a thing to other purposes then is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
understood. Flight is a signe of fear; but it is lawfull to fly
when a man fears not. Circumcision was the seal of the Jewish re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and yet Saint Paul circumcised Timothy though he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
he should live like the Gentile Christians, and not as do the
Jews. But because that rite did signifie more things beside that one,
he onely did it to represent that he was no enemy of Moses law,
but would use it when there was just reason, which was one part
of the things which the using of circumcision could signifie: So
our blessed Saviour pretended that he would passe forth beyond
Emaus, but if he intended not to do it, yet he did no injury to the
two disciples, for whose good it was that he intended to make
this offer: and neither did he prevaricate the strictnesse of simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and sincerity, because they were persons with whom he had
made no contracts, to whom he had passed no obligation, and in
the nature of the thing it is <hi>proper and natural,</hi> by an offer to give
an occasion to another to do a good action; and in case it succeeds
not, then to do what we intended not, and so the offer was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional.
But in all cases of bargaining, although the actions of
themselves may receive naturally another sense, yet I am bound
to follow that signification which may not abuse my brother, or
pollute my own honesty, or snatch, or rifle his interest: Because
it can be no ingredient into the commutation, if I exchange a thing
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> which he understands not, and is by errour lead into this mistake,
and I hold forth the fire, and delude him, and amuse his eye: for
by me he is made worse.</p>
            <p>But secondly, as our actions must be of a sincere and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
signification in contracts, so must our words: in which the
rule of the old Roman honesty was this: <hi>Vter<expan>

and changeable; and we shall seldom see a man so s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iffned
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> with impiety, as to speak little and seldome, and pertinaciously
adhere to a single sense, and yet that at first, and all the way after
shall be a lie. Men use to go about, when they tell a lie, and devise
circumstances, and stand off at distance, and cast a cloud of words,
and intricate the whole affair, and cozen themselves first, and then
cozen their brother, while they have minced the case of conscience
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:53465:160"/>
into little particles, and swallowed the lie by crumbs, so that no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
one passage of it should rush against the conscience, nor do hurt,
until it is all got into the belly, and unites in the effect; for by that
time, two men are abused, the Merchant in his soul, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractor
in his interest; and this is the certain effect of much talking
and little honesty: but he that means honestly, must speak but
once, that is, one truth, and hath leave to vary within the degrees
of just prices, and fair conditions, which because they have a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
may be enlarged, or restrained according as the Merchant
please, save onely he must never prevaricate the measures of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and the proportions of reputation, and the publike. But in all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
the parts of this traffick let our words be the significations of our
thoughts, and our thoughts designe nothing, but the advantages of
a permitted exchange. In this case, the severity is so great, so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act,
and so without variety of case, that it is not lawfull for a man
to tell a <hi>truth,</hi> with a collateral designe to cozen and abuse; and
therefore at no hand can it be permitted to lie or equivocate, to
speak craftily, or to deceive by smoothnesse, or intricacy, or long
discourses.</p>
            <p>But this precept of simplicity in matter of contract hath one
step of severity beyond this: In matter of contract it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
so much as to conceal the secret and undiscernable faults of
the merchandize; but we must acknowledge them, or else affix
prices made diminute and lessened to such proportions and abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
as that fault should make. <hi>Caveat emptor</hi> is a good caution
for him that buyes, and it secures the seller in publike Judicature,
but not in court of conscience; and the old lawes of the Romans
were as nice in this affair, as the conscience of a Christian. <hi>Titus
Claudius Centimalus</hi> was commanded by the <hi>Augures</hi> to pull down
his house in the <hi>Coelian mountain,</hi> because it hindred their observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the flight of birds; he exposes his house to sale, <hi>Publius</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               <hi>Calpurnius</hi> buyes it, and is forced to pluck it down; But com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
to the Judges had remedy, because <hi>Claudius</hi> did not tell
him the true state of the inconvenience. He that sels a house in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with the plague, or haunted with evil spirits, sels that which
is not worth such a price which it might be put to if it were in
health and peace: and therefore cannot demand it but openly and
upon publication of the evil. To which also this is to be added,
that in some great faults and such as have danger, (as in the cases
now specified) no diminution of the price is sufficient to make the
Merchant just and sincere, unlesse he tels the appendant mischief; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
because to some persons in many cases, and to all persons in some
cases, it is not at all valuable, and they would not possesse it if they
might for nothing. <hi>Marcus Gratidianus</hi> bought a house of <hi>Sergius
Orata,</hi> which himself had sold before; But because <hi>Sergius</hi> did not
declare the appendant vassalage and service, he was recompenced
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:53465:160"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> by the Judges; for although it was certain that <hi>Gratidianus</hi> knew
it, because it had been his own, yet <hi>Oportuit ex bonâ fide denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciari</hi>
said the law; it concerned the ingenuity of a good man to
have spoken it openly. In all cases it must be confessed in the price,
or in the words; But when the evil may be personal, and more
then matter of interest and money, it ought to be confessed, and
then the goods prescribed, lest by my act I do my neighbour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
and I receive profit by his dammage. Certain it is, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity
is the sweetest and easiest way, there is no difficulty or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of conscience in that, and it can have no objection in it but that
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> possibly sometimes we lose a little advantage, which it may be
we may lawfully acquire, but still we secure a quiet conscience: and
if the merchandise be not worth so much to me, then neither is it
to him; if it be to him, it is also to me; and therefore I have no
losse, no hurt to keep it if it be refused: but he that secures his own
profit, and regards not the interest of another, is more greedy of
a full purse then of a holy conscience, and prefers gain before
justice, and the wealth of his private, before the necessity of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
society and commerce, being a son of earth whose centre is it
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> self, without relation to heaven that moves upon anothers point,
and produces flowers, for others, and sends influence upon all the
world, and receives nothing in return, but a cloud of perfume, or
the smell of a fat sacrifice.</p>
            <p>God sent justice into the world, that all conditions in their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
proportions should be equall; and he that receives a good,
should pay one, and he whom I serve is obliged to feed and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
me in the same proportions as I serve; and justice is a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
terme, and supposes two persons obliged, and though fortunes
are unequal, and estates are in majority and subordination, and men
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> are wise or foolish, honoured or despised; yet in the entercourses
of justice God hath made that there is no difference, and therefore
it was esteemed ignoble to dismisse a servant when corn was dear,
in dangers of shipwrack to throw out an unprofitable boy and keep
a fair horse; or for <hi>a wise man</hi> to snatch a plank from a drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>fool,</hi> or if the Master of the ship should challenge the board up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which his passenger swims for his life, or to obtrude false mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys
upon others, which we first took for true, but at last discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to be false; or not to discover the gold which the merchant
sold for alchimy: The reason of all these is, because the collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> advantages are not at all to be considered in matter of rights;
and though I am dearest to my self, as my neighbour is to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
yet it is necessary that I permit him to his own advantages,
as I desire to be permitted to mine. Now therefore simplicity and
ingenuity in all contracts is perfectly and exactly necessary, because
its contrary destroys that equality which justice hath placed in the
affaires of men, and makes all things private, and makes a man
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:53465:161"/>
dearer to himself, and to be preferred before Kings, and repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
and Churches; it destroyes society, and it makes multitudes of
men to be but like heards of beasts, without proper instruments of
exchange, and securities of possession, without faith and without
propriety, concerning all which there is no other account to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
but that the rewards of craft are but a little money and a great
deal of dishonour and much suspicion: and proportionable scorn;
watches and guards, spies and jealousies are his portion; But the
crown of justice is a fair life and a clear reputation, &amp; an inheritance
there where justice dwells since she left the earth, even <hi>in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the just,</hi> who shall call us to <hi>judgement for every word, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
render to every man according to his works:</hi> and what is the hope
of the hypocrite though he hath gained, when the Lord taketh away
his soul, <hi>Tollendum esse ex rebus contrahendis omne mendacium.</hi> That's
the sum of this rule:<note place="margin">Cicero.</note> no falshod or deceit is to be endured in any
contract.</p>
            <p>5. Christian simplicity hath also its necessity and passes obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon us towards enemies in questions of law or war. Plutarch
commends Lysander and Philopaemen for their craft and subtilty
in war; but commends it not as an ornament to their manners, but
that which had influence into prosperous events; just as Ammianus <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
affirms, <hi>nullo discrimine virtutis ac doli prosperos omnes laudari debere
bellorum eventus:</hi> whatsoever in war is prosperous, men use to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend:
But he that is a good souldier is not alwayes a good man.
Callicratidas was a good man and followed the old way of down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
hostility, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: But Lysander was
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a crafty man, full of

and the simplicity and noblenesse of his own heart <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>.
The good old man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
Chiron was my Tutor, and he taught me to use simplicity and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty
in all my manners. It was well and noble; But yet some
wise men do not condemn all souldiers that use to get victories by
deceit:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Quae.</hi> 10. super Joshuam lib. 1. de sacerdotio.</note> Saint Austin allows it to be lawful; and Saint Chrysostome
commends it. These Good men supposed that a crafty victory was
better then a bloody war; and certainly so it is, if the power got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by craft be not exercised in blood: But this businesse (as to the
case of conscience) will quickly be determined. Enemies are no
persons bound by contract and society, and therefore are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to open hostilities and ingenuous prosecutions of the war; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
and if it be lawful to take by violence, it is not unjust to
take the same thing by craft. But this is so to be understood, that
where there is an obligation either by the law of nations or by
special contracts, No man dare to violate his faith or honour, but
in these things deal with an ingenuity equal to the truth of peaec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:53465:161"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> promises, and acts of favour and endearment to our relatives.
Josephus tells of the sons of Herod, that in their enmities with
their Vncle Pherora and Salome they had disagreeing manners of
prosecution, as they had disagreeing hearts; some railed openly,
and thought their enmity the more honest, because it was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed,
but by their ignorance and rude, untutor'd malice lay open
to the close designes of the elder brood of foxes.<note place="margin">Hist l. 16. <hi>cap.</hi> 6</note> In this because it
was a particular and private quarrel, there is no rule of conscience
but that it be wholly laid aside, and appeased with charity; for the
opennesse of the quarrel was but the rage and indiscretion of the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> malice: and the close designe was but the craft and advantage of the
malice: But in just wars on that side where a competent authority
and a just cause warrants the arms and turns the active opposition
into the excuse and licence of defence, there is no restraint upon
the actions and words of men in the matter of sincerity, but that the
laws of nations be strictly pursued and all parties; promises, andcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
observed religiously &amp; by the proportion of a private &amp; Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
ingenuity. We finde it by wise and good men mentioned with
honour, that the Romans threw bread from the besieged Capitol
into the stations of the Gauls, that they might think them full of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> corn: and that Agesilaus discouraged the enemies by causing his
own men to wear crowns in token of a Navall victory gotten by
Pisander who yet was at that time destroyed by Conon, and that
Flaccus said the city was taken by Emilius, or that Joshua dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
a flight at Ai, and the Consul Quinctius told aloud that the
left wing of the enemies was fled, and that made the right wing fly;
or that Valerius Levinus bragged prudently that he had killed Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus,
and that others use the ensigns of enemies colours and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
concerning which sort of actions and words Agesilaus, in
Plutarch said <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               <hi>It is just and pleasant, profitable and glorious,</hi> but to call a parley
and fall in upon the men that treat; to swear a peace and watch
advantage; to entertain Heralds and then to torment them, to get
from them notices of their party; these are such which
are dishonorable and unjust, condemned by the laws of nations
and essential justice, &amp; by all the world and the Hungarian army was
destroyed by a divine judgement at the prayer &amp; appeal of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humet
an enemy for their violating their faith and honour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning
the name of Christ by using it in a solemn oath to deceive
their enemies, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: that is to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> God when men first sware by him, and then violate their
oathes or leagues, their treaties or promises. In other cases liberty
hath been taken by all men and it is reproved by no man, since the
first simplicity of fighting &amp; down right blows did cease by the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
instructed people of the world: which was as is usually compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
about the end of the second Carthaginian war; since that time,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:53465:162"/>
some few persons have been found so noble as to scorn to steal a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
victory, but had rather have the glory of a sharp sword, then of
a sharp wit; But their fighting gallantry is extrinsecal to the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of lawful or unlawful</p>
            <p>6. Thus we see how far the laws of ingenuity and Christian
simplicity have put fetters upon our words and actions and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them in the paths of truth and noblenesse, and the first degrees
of permission of <hi>simulation</hi> is in the arts of war, and the cases of just
hostility. But here it is usually inquired whether it be lawful to
tell a lie, or dissemble to save a good mans life, or to do him a
great benefit? a Question which Saint Austine was much troubled <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
withal, affirming it to be of the greatest difficulty: for he saw gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
all the Doctors before his time allowed it; and of all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
no man is noted to have reproved it but Saint Austin alone,
and he also (as his manner is) with some variety: those which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him are to be accounted upon his score: and it relies upon
such precedents which are not lightly to be disallowed; for so Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
and Isaac told a lie in the case of their own danger to Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech;
so did the Israelitish midwives to Pharaoh and Rachab con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cering
the spies, and David to the King of Gath, and the prophet
that anointed Saul, and Elisha to Hazael, and Solomon in the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
of the stolen childe; concerning which Irenaeus hath given us a
rule that those whose actions the Scripture hath remarked, &amp; yet not
chastised or censured, we are not without great reason and certain
rule to condemn: but whether his rule can extend to this case is now
to be enquired.</p>
            <p>1. It is certain that children may be cozned into goodnesse, and
sick men to health, and passengers in a storm into fafety; and the
reason of these is, because not onely the end is fair and charitable
and just, but the means are such which do no injury to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
which are to receive benefit: Because these are persons who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
are either naturally or accidentally ignorant and incompetent
judges of affaires: and if they be also wilful as such persons most
commonly are, there is in art and nature left no wayes to deal
with them but with innocent, charitable, and artificial deceptions;
they are not capable of reason and solid discourses, and therefore
either must be exposed to all harms like Lions whelps when their
nurse and sire are taken in a toile, or else be provided for in wages
proportionable to their capacitie.</p>
            <p>2. Sinners may not be treated with the liberty we take to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and sick persons, because they must serve God with choice <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
and election; and therefore although a sick man may be cozened
into his health, yet a man must not be cozened into his duty, which
is no duty at all or pleasing to God, unlesse it be voluntary and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen:
and therefore they are to be treated with arguments proper
to move their wills by the instrument of understanding specially,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:53465:162"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> being persons of perfect faculties and apt to be moved by the wayes
of health and of a man. It is an argument of infirmity that in some
cases it is necessary to make pretences; but those pretences are not
made legitimate, unlesse it be the infirmity of the interested man
with whom we do comply. My infirmity can not make it lawful
to make colours and images of things: But the infirmity of him
with whom I deal, may be such, that he can be defended or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
no other way: But sinners that offend God by choice
must have their choice corrected, and their understandings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
or else their evill is not cured nor their state amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 2. For it is here very observable, that in entercourses of this
nature we are to regard a double duty; the matter of justice, and the
rights of charity: that is, that good be done by lawful instruments;
for it is certain it is not lawful to abuse a mans understanding, with
a purpose to gain him 6. d. it is not fit to do evil for a good end, or
to abuse one man to preserve or do advantage to another: and
therefore it is not sufficient that I intend to do good to my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
for I may not therefore tell a lie and abuse his credulity; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his understanding hath a right as certain as his will hath, or as
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> his money; and his right to truth is no more to be cozened and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded,
then his right unto his money; and therefore such arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
entercourses are no wayes to be permitted, but to such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
over whose understandings we have power and authority. Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
said it was lawful for Kings and Governours to dissemble, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there is great necessity for them so to do: but it was but crude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
said, so nakedly to deliver the doctrine for in such things which the
people cannot understand and yet ought to obey, there is a liberty
to use them as we use children, who are of no other condition or
capacities then children; but in all things where they can and ought
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to choose, because their understanding is onely a servant to God,
no man hath power to abuse their credulity and reason, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
their estates, and peace. But because Children and mad peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and diseased, are such whose underdandings are in minority
and under Tuition, they are to be governed by their proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
and proportions; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> said Proclus,
a good turn is to be preferred before a true saying, it is onely true
to such persons who cannot value truth, and prefer an intellectual
before a material interest. It is better for children to have warm
clothes then a true proposition, and therefore in all senses they and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> their like may be so treated: But other persons who have distinct
capacities have an injury done them by being abused into advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages;
and although those advantages make them recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
yet he that is tied to make a man recompence, hath done
him injury and committed a sin, by which he was obliged to restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
&amp; therefore the man ought not to be cozened for his own good</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="310" facs="tcp:53465:163"/>
4. And now upon the grounds of this discourse, we may more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
easily determine concerning saving the life of a man by telling a lie
in judgement <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> said Pericles of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
when his friend desired him to swear on his side; I will as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
my friend so far as I may not dishonour God, and to lie in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is directly against the being of government, the honour of
Tribunals and the commandement of God, and therefore by no
accident can be hallowed; it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as Aristotle said
of a lie, it is a thing evil in it self, that is, it is evil in the whole kinde,
ever since it came to be forbidden by God: and therefore all those
instances of crafty and delusive answers which are recorded in scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
were extra judicial and had not this load upon them to be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
of authority in those things where they had right to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
or inquire, &amp; either were <hi>before</hi> or <hi>besides</hi> the commandment,
<hi>not at all against</hi> it: and since the law of Moses forbad lying in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
onely, by that law we are to judge of those actions in the old
testament which were committed after its publication: and because
in the sermons of the prophets and especially in the new testament
Christ hath superadded or enlarged the law of <hi>ingenuity</hi> &amp; hearty <hi>sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity,</hi>
we are to leave the old scripture precedents upon the ground
of their own permissions, and finish our duty by the rules of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
which hath so restrained our words, that they must alwayes
be just and alwayes charitable, and there is no leave given to preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricate,
but to such persons where there can be no obligation, persons
that have no right, such with whom no contract can be made;
such as children and fools and infirm persons, whose faculties are
hindred or depraved. I remember that Secundus extremely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
Arria for deluding her husbands fears concerning the death
of his beloved boy, and wiped her eyes and came in confidently and
sate by her husbands bed-side, and when she could no longer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to weep, her husbands sicknesse was excuse enough to legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
that sorrow, or else she could retire; but so long she forbore
to confess the boy's death til Caecinna Paetus had so far recovered that
he could go forth to see the boy and need not fear with sorrow to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to his disease. It was indeed a great kindnesse and a rare pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
as their affaires and laws were ordered; but we have better
means to cure our sick; our religion can charme the passion and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
the spirit to entertain and master a sorrow; and when we have
such rare supplies out of the store-houses of reason and religion we
have lesse reason to use these arts and little deviees, which are argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of an infirmity as great as is the charity: and therefore we are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
to keep our selves strictly to the foregoing measures; <hi>Let every man
speak the truth to his neighbour, putting away lying, for we are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
one of another:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 25.</note> and <hi>be as harmlesse as doves</hi> saith our <hi>blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi>
in my text: which contain the whole duty concerning the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of truth and sincerity; in both which places truth and simplicity
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:53465:163"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> are founded upon justice and charity: and therefore wherever a
lie is in any sense against justice, and wrongs any thing of a man,
his judgement and his reason, his right or his liberty, it is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forbidden in the Christian religion: what cases we can truly
suppose to be besides these, the law forbids not and therefore it is
lawful to say that to my self which I believe not, for what inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
purpose I please and to all those over whose understanding I
have or ought to have right.</p>
            <p>These cases are intricate enough, and therefore I shall return plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to presse the doctrine of simplicity which ought to be so sacred
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that a man ought to do nothing indirectly which it is not lawful to
own; to receive no advantage by the sin of another, which I should
account dishonest if the action were my own; for whatsoever dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
may be concerning the lawfulnesse of pretending craftily
in some rare and contingent cases, yet it is on all hands condemned
that my craft should do injury to my brother. I remember that
when some greedy and indigent people forged a will of Lucius Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius
Basilius and joyned M. Crassus, and Q. Hortensius in the
inheritance that their power for their own interest might secure
the others share, they suspecting the thing to be a forgery, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> not principals and actors in the contrivance <hi>alieni facinoris mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
culum non repudiaverunt,</hi> refused not to receive a present made
them by anothers crime; but so they entred upon a moiety of the
estate and the biggest share of the dishonour: we must not be crafty
to anothers injury so much as by giving countenance to the wrong;
for Tortoises and the Estrich hatch their egges with their looks one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and some have designes which a dissembling face or an acted
gesture can produce; but as a man may commit adultery with his eye
so with his eye also he may tell a lie, and steal with one finger and
do injury collaterally and yet designe it with a direct intuition upon
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> which he looks with his face over his shoulder: and by whatsoever
instrument my neighbour may be abused, by the same instrument
I sin if I do designe it antecedently, or fal upon it together with some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else, or rejoyce in it when it is done.</p>
            <p>7. One thing more I am to adde, that it is not lawful to tell a lie
in jest. It was a vertue noted in Aristides and Epaminondes that they
would not lie <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>AN having destroyed that which God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
in, that is, the beauty of his soul, fell
into an evil portion, and being seized upon
by the divine justice, grew miserable, and
condemned to an incurable sorrow. Poor
Adam being banished and undone, went and
lived a sad life in the mountains of <hi>India,</hi>
and turned his face and his prayers towards
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Paradise; thither he sent his sighes, to that
place he directed his devotions; there was his heart now, and his
felicity sometimes had been; but he knew not how to return thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for God was his enemy, and by many of his attributes op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
himself against him. <hi>Gods power</hi> was armed against him;
and <hi>poor man,</hi> whom a fly, or a fish could kill, was assaulted and
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:53465:165"/>
beaten with a sword of fire in the hand of a Cherubim. <hi>Gods eye</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
watched him, <hi>his omniscience</hi> was mans accuser, <hi>his severity</hi> was
the Judge, <hi>his justice</hi> the executioner. It was a mighty calamity
that man was to undergo, when he that made him, armed himself
against his creature, which would have died or turned to nothing,
if he had but withdrawn the miracles and the Almightinesse of his
power. If God had taken his arm from under him, man had pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished;
but it was therefore a greater evil when God laid his arm
upon him and against him, and seemed to support him that he
might be longer killing him. In the midst of these sadnesses God
remembered his own creature, and pitied it, and by his <hi>mercy</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
him from <hi>the hand of his power,</hi> and <hi>the sword of his justice,</hi>
and <hi>the guilt of his punishment,</hi> and <hi>the disorder of his sin,</hi> and
placed him in that order of good things where he ought to have
stood: It was <hi>mercy</hi> that preserved the noblest of Gods creatures
here below; he who stood condemned and undone under all the
other attributes of God, was onely saved and rescued by his <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:</hi>
that it may be evident that <hi>Gods mercy is above all his works,</hi>
and above <hi>all ours,</hi> greater then the creation, and greater then our
sins; <hi>as is his Majesty, so is his mercy,</hi> that is, without measures,
and without rules, sitting in heaven and filling all the world, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
for a duty that he may give a blessing, making man that he
may save him, punishing him that he may preserve him: and Gods
<hi>justice</hi> bowed down to his <hi>mercy,</hi> and all his <hi>power</hi> passed into
<hi>mercy,</hi> and his <hi>omniscience</hi> converted into <hi>care and watchfulnesse,</hi>
into <hi>providence,</hi> and <hi>observation</hi> for mans avail, and Heaven gave
its influence for man, and rained showers for our food and drink,
and the Attributes and Acts of God <hi>sat at the foot of mercy,</hi> and <hi>all
that mercy descended upon the head of man:</hi> For so the light of the
world in the morning of the creation was spread abroad like a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and dwelt no where, but filled the <hi>expansum</hi> with a dissemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
great as the unfoldings of the airs looser garment, or the
wilder fringes of the fire, without knots, or order or combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but God gathered the beams in his hand, and united them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a globe of fire, and all the light of the world became the body
of the Sun, and he lent some to his weaker sister that walks in the
night, and guides a traveller and teaches him to distinguish a house
from a river, or a rock from a plain field; so is the mercy of God; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
a vast <hi>expansum</hi> and a huge Ocean, from eternall ages it dwelt
round about the throne of God, and it filled all that infinite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
and space, that hath no measures but the will of God; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
God desiring to communicate that excellency and make it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative,
<hi>created Angels,</hi> that he might have persons capable of huge
gifts, <hi>and man,</hi> who he knew would need forgivenesse; for so the
Angels our elder Brothers dwelt for ever in the house of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and never brake his commandements; but we the younger
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:53465:165"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> like prodigals, forsook our fathers house, and went into a strange
countrey, and followed stranger courses, and spent the portion of
our nature, and forfeited all our title to the family, and came to
need another portion: for ever since the fall of Adam, who like an
unfortunate man spent all that a wretched man could need, or a
happy man could have, <hi>our life is repentance,</hi> and <hi>forgivenesse is
all our portion:</hi> and though Angels were objects of Gods <hi>bounty,</hi>
yet man onely is (in proper speaking) the object of his <hi>mercy.</hi>
And the mercy which dwelt in an infinite circle, became confin'd
to a little ring, and dwelt here below, and here shall dwell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> till it hath carried all Gods portion up to heaven, where
it shall reigne and glory upon our crowned heads for ever and
ever.</p>
            <p>But for him that considers Gods mercies, and dwels a while in
that depth, it is hard not to talk wildly and without art, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of discoursings: Saint Peter talked he knew not what, when
he entered into a cloud with Jesus upon mount Tabor, though it
passed over him like the little curtains that ride upon the North-winde,
and passe between the Sun and us: And when we converse
with a light greater then the Sun, and tast a sweetnesse more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> then the dew of heaven, and in our thoughts entertain
the ravishments and harmony of that atonement which reconciles
God to man, and man to felicity, it will be more easily pardoned,
if we should be like persons that admire much, and say but little:
and indeed we can best confesse the glories of the Lord by dazeled
eyes and a stammering tongue, and a heart overcharged with the
miracles of this infinity; For so those little drops that <hi>run over,</hi>
though they be not much in themselves, yet they tell that the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
was full, and could expresse the greatnesse of the shower no
otherwise, but by spilling, and inartificiall expressions and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> over. But because I have undertaken to tell the drops of the
Ocean, and to span the measures of eternity, I must do it by the
great lines of revelation, and experience, and tell concerning Gods
mercy as we do concerning God himself, that he is that great
fountain of which we all drink, and the great rock of which we
all eat, and on which we all dwell, and under whose shadow we
all are refreshed. Gods mercy is all this, and we can onely draw
great lines of it, and reckon the constellations of our hemisphere
instead of telling the number of the stars: we onely can reckon what
we feel, and what we live by; And though there be in every one of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> these lines of life enough to ingage us for ever to do God service,
and to give him praises, yet it is certain there are very many mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of God <hi>upon us, and toward us, and concerning us,</hi> which we
neither feel, nor see, nor understand as yet; but yet we are bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by them, and are preserved and secured; and we shall then
know them, when we come to give God thanks in the festivities
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:53465:166"/>
of an eternall sabbath. But that I may confine my discourse into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
order, since the subject of it cannot, I consider;</p>
            <p>1. That mercy being an emanation of the Divine goodnesse
upon us, and supposes us, and found us miserable; In this account
concerning the mercies of God, I must not reckon the miracles
and graces of the creation, or any thing of the nature of man; nor
tell how great an endearment God passed upon us that he made us
men, capable of felicity, apted with rare instruments of discourse,
and reason, passions, and desires, notices of sense, and reflections <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
upon that sense, that we have not the deformity of a Crocodile,
nor the motion of a Worm, nor the hunger of a Wolf, nor the
wildenesse of a Tigre, nor the birth of Vipers, nor the life of flies,
nor the death of serpents.</p>
            <p>Our excellent bodies, and usefull faculties, the upright moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the tenacious hand, the fair appetites, and proportioned
satisfactions, our speech and our perceptions, our acts of life, the
rare invention of letters, and the use of writing, and speaking at
distance, the intervals of rest and labour, (either of which if they
were perpetual would be intolerable) the needs of nature, and the
provisions of providence, sleep, and businesse, refreshments of the
body, and entertainment of the soul; these are to be reckoned as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
acts of bounty rather then mercy; God gave us these when he
made us, and before we needed mercy; these were portions of
our nature, or provided to supply our consequent necessities; but
when we forfeited all Gods favour by our sins, then that they were
continued, or restored to us, became a mercy, and therefore ought
to be reckoned upon this new account; for it was a rare mercy
that we were suffered to live at all, or that the Anger of God did
permit to us one blessing; that he did punish us so gently: But
when the <hi>rack</hi> is changed into an <hi>ax,</hi> and the <hi>ax</hi> into an <hi>imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and the <hi>imprisonment</hi> changed into an <hi>enlargement,</hi> and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               <hi>enlargement</hi> into an <hi>entertainment</hi> in the family, and this <hi>entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
passes on to an <hi>adoption,</hi> these are steps of a mighty favour,
and perfect redemption from our sin: and the returning back our
own goods is <hi>a gift,</hi> and a perfect donative, sweetned by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
of the calamity, from whence every lesser punishment
began to free us; and thus it was, that God punished us and visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the sin of Adam upon his posterity. He threatned we should
die, and so we did, but not so as we deserved; we waited for
death and stood sentenced, and are daily summoned by sicknesses
and uneasinesse; and every day is a new reprieve, and brings a new <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
favour, certain as the revolution of the Sun upon that day, and at
last when we must die by the irreversible decree, <hi>that death,</hi> is
changed into <hi>a sleep,</hi> and <hi>that sleep is in the bosom of Christ,</hi> and
<hi>there</hi> dwels <hi>all peace</hi> and <hi>security,</hi> and it shall passe forth into <hi>glories</hi>
and <hi>felicities.</hi> We looked for <hi>a Judge,</hi> and behold <hi>a Saviour;</hi> we
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:53465:166"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> feared <hi>an accuser,</hi> and behold <hi>an Advocate;</hi> we sate down in sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
and rise in joy; we leaned upon Rhubarb and Aloes, and
our aprons were made of the sharp leaves of Indian fig-trees, and
so we fed, and so were clothed: But the Rhubarb proved me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal,
and the rough leaf of the tree brought its fruit wrapped
up in its foldings; and round about our dwellings was planted a
hedge of thornes, and bundles of thistles, <hi>the Aconite,</hi> and <hi>the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony,
the Night-shade,</hi> and <hi>the Poppy,</hi> and at the root of these grew
the healing <hi>Plantain,</hi> which rising up into a talnesse, by the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
invitation of a heavenly influence, turn'd about <hi>the tree of the</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
               <hi>crosse;</hi> and cured the wounds of the thorns, and the curse of the
thistles, and the malediction of man, and the wrath of God. <hi>Si
sio irascitur, quomodo convivatur?</hi> If God be thus kinde when he
is Angry, what is he when he feasts us with caresses of his more
tender Kindnesse? All that God restored to us after the forfeiture
of Adam grew to be a double Kindnesse; for it became the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of a bounty which knew not how to repent, a gracious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
that was not to be altered, though we were, and that was it
which we needed. That's the first generall: all the <hi>bounties</hi> of the
creation became <hi>mercies</hi> to us, when God continued them to us
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and restored them after they were forfeit.</p>
            <p>2. But as a circle begins every where, and ends no where,
so do the mercies of God: after all this huge progresse, now it
began anew: God is good and gracious, and God is ready to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give.
Now that he had once more made us capable of mercies
God had what he desired, and what he could rejoyce in, something
upon which he might pour forth his mercies; and by the way,
this I shall observe, (for I cannot but speak without art, when I
speak of that which hath no measure) God made us capable of
one sort of his mercies, and we made our selves capable of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               <hi>God is good and gracious,</hi> that is, desirous to give great gifts;
and of this, God made us receptive, first by giving us naturall
possibilities, that is, by giving those gifts he made us capable of
more; and next, by restoring us to his favour, that he might not
by our provocations be hindered from raining down his mercies.
But <hi>God is</hi> also <hi>ready to forgive]</hi> and of this kinde of mercy we
made our selves capable, even by not deserving it; Our sin made
way for his grace, and our infirmities called upon his pity; and
because we sinned, we became miserable, and because we were
miserable, we became pitiable, and this opened the other trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of his mercy; that because our <hi>sin abounds, his grace may su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabound.</hi>
In this method we must confine our thoughts;</p>

               <item>1. Giving,</item>
               <item>2. Forgiving,

            <p>3. Gods mercies, or the mercies of his <hi>giving,</hi> came first upon
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:53465:167"/>
us by mending of our nature: For the ignorance we fell into is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
instructed and better learned in spirituall notices then Adams
morning knowledge in Paradise, our appetites are made subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
to the spirit, and the liberty of our wills is improved, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>the liberty of the sons of God,</hi> and Christ hath done us more
grace and advantage then we lost in Adam; and as man lost <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise</hi>
and got <hi>Heaven,</hi> so he lost the <hi>integrity</hi> of the <hi>first,</hi> and got
the <hi>perfection</hi> of the <hi>second Adam:</hi> his <hi>living soul</hi> is changed into
<hi>a quickning spirit;</hi> our discerning faculties are filled with the spirit
of faith, and our passions and desires are entertained with hope,
and our election is sanctified with charity; and his first life of a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
temporall possession is passed into a better, a life of spirituall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations;
and though our first parent was forbidden it, yet we
live of the fruits of <hi>the tree of life.</hi> But I instance in two great
things in which humane nature is greatly advanced, and passed
on to greater perfections; The first is, that besides body and soul,
which was the summe totall of Adams constitution, God hath su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded
to us a third principle, the beginner of a better life; I
mean,<note place="margin">Vide Serm. II.</note> 
               <hi>the Spirit;</hi> so that now, man hath a spiritual and celestial
nature breathed into him, and the old man, that is, the old consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
is the least part and in its proper operations is dead, or dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
but the new man is that which gives denomination, life, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and proper actions to a Christian, and that is <hi>renewed in us
day by day.</hi> But secondly, Humane nature is so highly exalted,
and mended by that mercy which God sent immediately upon
the fall of Adam, the promise of Christ, that when he did come,
and actuate the purposes of this mission, and ascended up into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
he carried humane nature above the seats of Angels; to the place
whither <hi>Lucifer the son of the morning</hi> aspir'd to ascend, but in his
attempt fell into hell. For (so said the Prophet) <hi>the son of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
said, I will ascend into heaven, and sit in the sides of the North,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
that is, the throne of Jesus seated in the East, called the sides, or
obliquity of the North: and as the seating of his humane nature
in that glorious seat brought to him all adoration, and the Majesty
of God, and the greatest of his exaltation: So it was so great an
advancement to us, that all the Angels of heaven take notice of it,
and feel a change in the appendage of their condition: not that
they are lessened, but that we, who in nature are lesse then An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
have <hi>a relative dignity greater,</hi> and <hi>an equall honour</hi> of being
fellow-servants. This mystery is plain in Scripture, and the reall
effect of it we read in both the Testaments.<note place="margin">Judges 13.</note> When Manoah the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
father of Sampson saw an Angel, he worshipped him; and in the
old Testament it was esteemed lawfull; for they were the lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
of God, sent with the impresses of his Majesty, and took in
his Name the homage from us, who then were so much their infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours.
But when the man Christ Jesus was exalted, and made the
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:53465:167"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Lord of all the Angels, then they became our fellow servants, and
might not receive worship from any of the servants of Jesus, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
from Prophets and Martyrs and those that are ministers of <hi>the
testimony of Jesus.</hi> And therefore when an Angel appeared to Saint
John, and he according to the Custom of the Jews fell down and
worshipped him, as not yet knowing or not considering any thing to
the contrary,<note place="margin">John Revel. 22. 9. <hi>de bono patien<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiae</hi>
               </note> the Angell reproved him, saying, <hi>see thou do it not,
I am thy fellow servant and of thy brethren the prophets and of them
which keep the sayings of this book: worship God;</hi> or as Saint Cyprian
reads it, <hi>worship Jesus. God</hi> and <hi>man</hi> are now onely capable of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> but no Angel; God essentially; Man in the person of Christ
and in the exaltation of our great Redeemer; but Angels not so
high, and therefore not capable of any religious worship: and this
dignity of man Saint Gregory explicates fully.<note place="margin">Homil. 8. in E<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vange.</note> 
               <hi>Quid est quod ante
Redemptoris adventum adorantur ab hominibus [Angeli] &amp; tacent,

worshippings and were silent, but in the new testament decline it

they any more despise the weaknesse which themselves worship
in the King of heaven. The same also is the sense of the Glosse,
of Saint <hi>Ambrose, Ansbertus, Haymo, Rupertus</hi> and others of old;
and <hi>Ribera, Salmeron,</hi> and <hi>Lewis of Granada</hi> of late; which being
so plainly consonant to the words of the Angel and consigned by
the testimony of such men, I the rather note, that those who
worship Angels and make religious addresses to them, may see
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> what priviledge themselves lose and how they part with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of Christ who in his nature relative to us, is exalted far above
all thrones and principalities and dominions. I need not adde lustre
to this; It is like the Sun the biggest body of light and nothing can
describe it so well as its own beams: and there is not in nature or
the advantages of honour any thing greater then that we have the
issues of that mercy which makes us fellow servants with Angels;
too much honoured to pay them a religious worship, whose Lord
is a man, and he that is <hi>their King</hi> is <hi>our Brother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. To this for the likenesse of the matter I adde, that the divine
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> mercy hath so prosecuted us with the enlargement of his favours,
that we are not onely fellow ministers and servants with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
and in our nature in the person of Christ exalted above them,
but we also shall be their Judges; and if this be not an honour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
that of Joseph or Mordecai, an honour beyond all the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of a man, then there is in honour no degrees no priority or
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:53465:168"/>
distances, or characters of fame and noblenesse. Christ is the great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
Judge of all the world, his humane nature shall then triumph o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
evil men and evil spirits, then shall the Devils, those Angels
that fel from their first originals be brought in their chains from their
dark prisons and once be allowed to see the light, that light that
shall confound them; <hi>while all that follow the lamb,</hi> and that are <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
worthy of that resurrection</hi> shall be assessors in the judgment.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 3.</note>
               <hi>Know ye not,</hi> (saith, S. Paul) <hi>that ye shall judge Angels?</hi> And Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian
speaking concerning Devils and accursed spirits <hi>[de cultu foemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narum]</hi>
saith, <hi>Hi sunt Angeli quos judicaturi sumus, Hi sunt Angeli qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
in lavacro renunciavimus.</hi> Those Angels which we renounced <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
in baptisme those we shall judge in the day of the Lords Glory, in
the great day of recompences: And that the honour may be yet
greater the same day of sentence that condemns the evil Angels shal
also reward the good, and increase their glory: which because they
derive from their Lord and ours, from their King and our elder
Brother, the King of glories, whose glorious hands shall put the
crown upon all our heads, we who shall be servants of that judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and some way or other assist in it, have a part of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
to be judges of all Angels, and of all the world. The effect of
these things ought to be this, that we do not by base actions dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
that nature that sits upon the throne of God, that reigns o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Angels, that shall sit in judgement upon all the world. It is a great
undecency that the son of a King should bear water upon his head,
and dresse vineyards among the slaves; or to see a wise man and
the guide of his country drink-drunk among the meanest of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;
but when members of Christ shall be made members of an
harlot, and that which rides above a rain-bow stoopes to an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
whorish woman, when the soul that is sister to the Lord of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
shall degenerate into the foolishnesse or rage of a beast,
being drowned with the blood of the grape, or made mad with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
passion, or ridiculous with weaker follies, we shall but strip our
selves of that robe of honour with which Christ hath invested, and
adorned our nature, and carry that portion of humanity
which is our own, and which God had honoured in some ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities
above Angels, into a portion of an eternal shame, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
lesse in all senses, and equally disgraced with Devils. The
shame and sting of this change shall be, that we turned the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the Divine mercy into the basenesse of ingratitude and
the amazement of suffering the Divine vengeance. But I passe
on.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
            </p>
            <p>5. The next order of Divine mercies that I shall remark is
also an improvement of our nature or an appendage to it: for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
our constitution is weak, our souls apt to diminution and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite
faculties, our bodies to mutilation and imperfection, to blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and crookednesse, to stammering and sorrows, to baldnesse
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:53465:168"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and deformity to evil conditions and accidents of body, and to pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and sadnesse of spirit, God hath in his infinite mercy provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for every condition rare suppletories of comfort and useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to make recompence and sometimes with an overrunning
proportion for those natural defects which were apt to make our
persons otherwise contemptible and our conditions intolerable;
God gives to blinde men better memories. For upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it is, that Rufinus makes mention of Didymus of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,
who being blinde, was blessed with a rare attention and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
memory, and by prayer, and hearing, and meditating, and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> discoursing, came to be one of the most excellent Divines of that
whole age. And it was more remarkable in Nicasius Machlinien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,
who being blockish at his book in his first childhood fell into
accidental blindnesse, and from thence continually grew to so quick
an apprehension and so tenacious a memory, that he became the
wonder of his contemporaries, and was chosen Rector of the
College at Mechlin, and was made licentiate of Theology at Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaine,
and Doctor of both the laws, at Colein, living and dying in
great reputation for his rare parts and excellent learning. At the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> same rate also God deals with men in other instances; want
of children he recompences with freedom from care, and whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
evil happens to the body is therefore most commonly single
and unaccompanied, because God accepts that evil as the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the sin of the man, or the instrument of his vertue, or his
security, and is reckoned as a sufficient cure, or a sufficient Antidote.

better then the prosperity of a great and tempting fortune?
does not wisdom dwell in a mean estate and a low spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> retired
thoughts and under a sad roof? and is it not generally true that
sicknesse it self is appayed with religion and holy thoughts with pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
resolutions and penitential prayers, with returns to God and
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:53465:169"/>
to sober councels? and if this be true, that God sends sorrow to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
cure sin, and affliction be the hand-maid to grace, it is also certain
that every sad contingency in nature is doubly recompenced with
the advantages of religion, besides those intervening refreshments
which support the spirit, and refresh its instruments. I shall need to
instance but once more in this particular.</p>
            <p>God hath sent no greater evil into the world, then that <hi>in the
sweat of our brows we shall eat our bread,</hi> and in the difficulty and
agony, in the sorrows and contention of our souls we shall <hi>work
out our salvation.</hi> But see how in the first of these God hath
out done his own anger and defeated the purposes of his <hi>wrath</hi> by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
the inundation of his <hi>mercy;</hi> for this labour and sweat of our brows
is so far from being a curse that without it our very bread would
not be so great a blessing. It is not labour that makes the Garlick
and the pulse, the Sycamore and the Cresses, the cheese of the Goats
and the butter of the sheep to be savoury and pleasant, as the flesh
of the Roe-buck or the milk of the Kine, the marrow of Oxen or
the thighs of birds? If it were not for labour, men neither could
eat so much, nor relish so pleasantly, nor sleep so soundly nor be
so healthful, nor so useful, so strong nor so patient, so noble, or
so untempted, and as God hath made us beholding to labour for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
the purchase of many good things, so the thing it self ows to labour,
many degrees of its worth and value: and therefore I need not reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that besides these advantages, the mercies of God have found
out proper and natural remedies for labour; Nights to cure the
sweat of the day, sleep to ease our watchfulnesse, rest to alleviate
our burdens, and dayes of religion to procure our rest: and things
are so ordered that labour is become a duty, and an act of many
vertues, and is not so apt to turne into a sin as is its contrary, and
is therefore necessary, not onely because we need it, for making
provisions of our life, but even to ease the labour of our rest; there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
being no greater tediousnesse of spirit in the world then want of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
and an unactive life: and the lasie man is not onely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable,
but also accursed, and he groans under the load of his
time, which yet passes over the active man light, as a dreame or
the feathers of a bird, while the disimployed, is a desease, and
like a long sleeplesse night to himself, and a load unto his country:
And therefore although in this particular God hath been so merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in this infliction that from the sharpnesse of the curse a very
great part of mankinde are freed, and there are myriads of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
good and bad, who do not <hi>eat their bread in the sweat of their</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
               <hi>brows,</hi> yet this is but an overrunning and an excesse of the divine
mercy; God did more for us then we did absolutely need; for he
hath disposed of the circumstances of this curse, that mans af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
are so reconciled to it, that <hi>they desire it, and are delighted
in it;</hi> and so the Anger of God is ended in loving Kindnesse, and
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:53465:169"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the drop of water is lost in the full chalice of the wine, and the curse
is gone out into a multiplied blessing.</p>
            <p>But then for the other part of the severe law and laborious impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
that we must work out our spiritual interest with the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
of our spirit, seems to most men to be so intolerable, that
rather then passe under it they quit their hopes of heaven, and passe
into the portion of Devils; and what can there be to alleviate this
sorrow, that a man shall be perpetually sollicited with an impure
tempter, and shall carry a flame within him, and all the world is on
fire round about him, and every thing brings fuel to the flame, and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> full tables are a snare, and empty tables are collateral servants to a
lust, and help to blow the fire and kindle the heap of prepared
temptations, and yet a man must not at all tast of the forbidden
fruit, and he must not desire what he cannot choose but desire, and
he must not enjoy whatsoever he does violently covet, and must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
satisfy his appetite in the most violent importunities, but must
therefore deny himself, because to do so is extremely troublesome;
this seems to be an art of torture and a devise to punish man with
the spirit of agony, and a restlesse vexation. But this also hath
in it a great ingredient of mercy, or rather is nothing else but a
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> heap of mercy in its intire constitution: For if it were not for this
we had nothing of our own to present to God, nothing proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to the great rewards of heaven, but either all men or no man
must go thither; for nothing can distinguish man from man in
order to beatitude but <hi>choice and election,</hi> and nothing can enoble
the <hi>choice</hi> but <hi>love,</hi> and nothing can exercise <hi>love</hi> but <hi>difficulty,</hi> and
nothing can make that <hi>difficulty</hi> but the <hi>contradiction of our appetite</hi>
and the crossing of our natural affections; and therefore whenever
any of you is tempted violently or grow weary in your spirits
with resisting the petulancy of temptation, you may be cured if you
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> will please but to remember and rejoyce, that now you have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of your own to give to God; something that he will be
pleased to accept, something that he hath given thee that thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
give it him: for our mony and our time, our dayes of feasting
and our dayes of sorrow, our discourse and our acts of praise, our
prayers and our songs, our vows and our offerings, our worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings
and prostrations, and whatsoever else can be accounted in
the sum of our religion, are onely accepted according as they bear
along with them portions of our wil and choice of love and appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
difficulty.</p>
            <q>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Laetius est quoties magno tibi constat honestum.</q>
            <p>So that whoever can complain that he serves God with pains
and mortifications, he is troubled because there is a distinction of
things such as we call vertue and vice, reward and punishment,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:53465:170"/>
and if he will not suffer God to distinguish the first he will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
confound the latter; and his portion shall be blacknesse without
variety and punishment shall be his reward.</p>
            <p>6. As an appendage to this instance of <hi>divine mercy,</hi> we are to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
that not onely in nature; but in contingency and emergent
events of providence, God makes compensation to us, for all
the evils of chance, and hostilities of accident &amp; <hi>brings good out of
evil,</hi> which is that solemn triumph which mercy makes over justice,
when it rides upon a cloud and crowns its darknesse with a robe of
glorious light. God indeed suffered Joseph to be sold a bondslave
into Egypt, but then it was that God intended to crown and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
his chastity; for by that means he brought him to a fair con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of dwelling and there gave him a noble trial; he had a brave
contention and he was a conqueror: Then God sent him to prison,
but still that was <hi>mercy,</hi> it was to make way to bring him to Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs
court; and God brought famine upon Canaan, and troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
all the souls of Jacobs family, and there was a plot laid for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mercy; this was to bring them to see and partake of Josephs
glory: and then God brought a great evil upon their posterity
and they groaned under task-masters, but this God changed into
<hi>the miracles of his mercy,</hi> and suffered them to be afflicted that he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
might do ten miracles for their sakes, and proclaim to all the world
how dear they were to God. And was not the greatest good to
mankinde brought forth from the greatest treason that ever was
committed; the redemption of the world from the fact of Judas,
God loving to defeat the malice of man and the arts of the Devil by
rare emergencies and stratagems of mercy? It is a sad calamity to
see a kingdom spoiled, and a church afflicted, the Priests slain with
the sword, and the blood of Nobles mingled with cheaper sand, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
made a cause of trouble, and the best men most cruelly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted,
Government confounded, and laws ashamed, Judges de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
causes in fear and covetousnesse, and the ministers of holy
things setting themselves against all that is sacred, and setting fire up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the fields, and turning in little foxes on purpose to destroy the
vineyards; and what shall make recompence for this heap of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,
when ever God shall send such swords of fire? even <hi>the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of God</hi> which then will be made publick, when we shall hear
such afflicted people sing <hi>Inconvertendo captivitatem Sion</hi> with the
voice of joy and festival eucharist, <hi>among such as keep holy day;</hi> and
when peace shall become sweeter and dwell the longer; and in
the mean time it serves religion, and the affliction shall try the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
of God, and God shall crown them, and men shall grow wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser,
and more holy, and leave their petty interstes, and take
sanctuary in holy living and be taught temperance by their want,
and patience by their suffering, and charity by their persecution,
and shall better understand the duty of their relations, and at last
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:53465:170"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the secret worm that lay at the root of the plant, shall be drawn
forth and quite extinguished. For so have I known a luxuriant
Vine swell into irregular twigs, and bold excrescencies, and spend
it self in leaves and little rings, and affoord but trifling clusters to
the wine-presse, and a faint return to his heart which longed to
be refreshed with a full vintage: But when the Lord of the vine
had caused the dressers to cut the wilder plant and made it bleed,
it grew temperate in its vain expense of uselesse leaves, and knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into fair and juicy bunches, and made accounts of that losse
of blood by the return of fruit: So is an afflicted Province, cured
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of its surfets, and punished for its sins, and bleeds for its long riot,
and is left ungoverned for its disobedience, and chastised for its
wantonnesse, and when the sword hath let forth the corrupted
blood, and the fire hath purged the rest, then it enters into the
double joyes of restitution, and gives God thanks for his rod, and
confesses the mercies of the Lord in making the smoke be changed
into fire, and the cloud into a perfume, the sword into a staffe,
and his anger into mercy.</p>
            <p>Had not David suffered more if he had suffered lesse, and had
he not been miserable unlesse he had been afflicted? he understood
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> it well when he said. <hi>It is good for me that I have been afflicted.</hi>
He that was rival to <hi>Crassus,</hi> when he stood candidate to command
the Legions in the <hi>Parthians</hi> warre was much troubled that he mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the dignity, but he saw himself blessed that he scaped the
death, and the dishonour of the overthrow, by that time the sad
news arrived at Rome. The Gentleman at <hi>Marseilles</hi> cursed his
starres that he was absent when the ship set sail to sea, having long
waited for a winde, and missed it; but he gave thanks to the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that blest him with the crosse, when he knew that the ship
perished in the voyage, and all the men were drowned: And
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> even those virgins and barren women in Jerusalem, that longed
to become glad mothers, and for want of children would not be
comforted, yet when Titus sacked the City, found the words of
Jesus true <hi>Blessed is the womb that never bare, and the paps that
never gave suck.</hi> And the world being governed with a rare va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety,
and changes of accidents, and providence; that which is a
misfortune in the particular, in the whole order of things becomes
a blessing bigger then we hoped for, then when we were angry
with God for hindring us, to perish in pleasant wayes, or when
he was contriving to pour upon thy head a mighty blessing. Do
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> not think the Judge condemns you when he chides you, nor think
to read thy own finall sentence by the first half of his words;
<hi>Stand still</hi> and see how it will be in the whole event of things; let
God speak his minde out; for it may be, this sad beginning is but
an art to bring in, or to make thee to esteem, and entertain, and
understand the blessing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="326" facs="tcp:53465:171"/>
They that love to talk of the mercies of the Lord, and to recount <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
his good things, cannot but have observed that God delights to be
called by such Appellatives which relate to miserable and afflicted
persons: <hi>He is the Father of the fatherlesse,</hi> and an <hi>avenger of the
widowes cause, he standeth at the right hand of the poor to save his
soul from unrighteous Judges,</hi> and <hi>he is with us in tribulation:</hi> And
upon this ground, let us account whether <hi>mercy</hi> be not the greater
ingredient in that death and deprivation, when I lose a man and
get God to be my Father; and when my weak arm of flesh is cut <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
from my shoulder, and God makes me to lean upon him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
my Patron and my Guide, my Advocate and Defender: and
if in our greatest misery Gods mercy is so conspicuous, what can
we suppose him to be in the endearment of his loving Kindnesse?
If his vail be so transparent, well may we know that upon his face
dwels glory, and from his eyes light, and perpetuall comforts run
in channels, larger then the returns of the Sea, when it is driven and
forced faster into its naturall course, by the violence of a tempest
from the North. The summe is this, God intends every accident
should minister to vertue, and every vertue is the mother and the
nurse of joy, and both of them daughters of the Divine goodnesse,
and therefore, if our sorrows do not passe into comforts, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
Gods intention; it is because we will not comply with the act
of that mercy which would save us by all means, and all varieties,
by health and by sicknesse, by the life and by the death of our dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
friends, by what we choose and by what we fear; that as Gods
providence rules over all chances of things, and all designes of men,
so his mercy may rule over all his providence.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

of nature and contingencies, he represents himself to
be our Father, which is the great <hi>endearment,</hi> and <hi>tye,</hi>
and <hi>expression,</hi> of <hi>a naturall, unalterable,</hi> and <hi>essentiall kindnesse,</hi>
he next makes provisions for us to supply all those necessities which
himself hath made. For even <hi>to make necessities,</hi> was a great cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance
of the mercy, and all the relishes of wine, and the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourinesse
of meat, the sweet and the fat, the pleasure and the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
the restitution of spirits, and the strengthening of the heart,
are not owing to the liver of the vine, or the <hi>kidneys of wheat,</hi> to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the blood of the grape, or the strength of the corne, but to the
appetite, or the necessity; and therefore it is, that he that sits at a
full table and does not recreate his stomack with fasting, and let
his digestion rest, and place himself in the advantages of natures
intervals, he loses the blessing of his daily bread, and leans upon
his table as a sick man upon his bed, or the lion in the grasse,
which he cannot feed on; but he that wants it, and sits down
when nature gives the signe, rejoyces in the health of his hunger,
and the taste of his meat, and the strengthening of his spirit, and
gives God thanks while his bones and his flesh rejoyce in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of nature, and the blessing of God. Are not the imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of infancy, and the decayes of old age, the evils of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
because respectively they want desire, and they want gust
and relish, and reflections upon their acts of sense? and <hi>when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire

and extraordinary, by foresight and contingency, according <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
to necessity, and up unto conveniency, until we arrive at abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,

and richer then the trees of <hi>Eden,</hi> which were permitted to feed
our miserable father: Is not all the earth our orchard, and our

a place for fish to feed us, and to serve some other collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

of one kinde, and with variety no greater, then the changes of day
and night, one devouring the other, or sitting down with his draught
of blood, or walking upon his portion of grasse: But man hath
all the food of beasts, and all the beasts themselves that are fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

food; and <hi>the food of Angels, and the dew of heaven, and the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the earth;</hi> and every part of his body hath a provision made
for it, and the smoothnesse of the olive, and the juice of the vine
refresh the heart and make the face cheerfull, and serve the ends
of joy, and the festivity of man, and are not onely to cure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
or to allay thirst, but to appease a passion, and allay a sorrow.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
It is an infinite variety of meat with which God furnishes out the
table of mankinde; and in the covering our sin, and clothing our
nakednesse, God passed from sig-leaves to the skins of beasts, from
aprons to long-robes, from leather to wool, and from thence to
the warmth of furres, and the coolnesse of silks, he hath dressed not
onely our needs, but hath fitted the severall portions of the yeer,
and made us to go dressed like our mother; leaving off the winter
sables when the florid spring appears, and assoon as the Tulip
fades we put on the robe of Summer, and then shear our sheep for
Winter; and God uses us as Joseph did his brother <hi>Benjamin,</hi> we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
have many changes of raiment, and our messe is five times bigger
then the provision made for our brothers of the Creation. But the
providence and mercies of God are to be estimated also according
as these provisions are dispensed to every single person. For that
I may not remark the bounties of God, running over the tables
of the rich, God hath also made provisions for the poorest person:
so that if they can but rule their desires they shall have their tables
furnished; and this is secured and provided for by one promise
and two duties, by our <hi>Own labour,</hi> and <hi>our Brothers charity;</hi> and
our faith in this affair is confirmed by all our own, and by all the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
experience of other men. Are not all the men and the women of
the world provided for, and fed and clothed till they die? and was
it not alwayes so from the first morning of the creatures? and that
a man is starved to death, is a violence and a rare contingency,
happening almost as seldom as for a man to have but one eye:
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:53465:172"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and if our being provided for be as certain as for a man to have two
eyes, we have reason to adore the wisdom, and admire the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of our Almighty Father. But these things are evident. Is it not
a great thing that God hath made such strange provisions for our
health? such infinite differences of Plants, and hath discovered the
secrets of their nature by meer chance, or by inspiration? either of
which is the miracle of providence, secret to us, but ordered by
certain and regular decrees of heaven. It was a huge diligence and
care of the divine mercy that discovered to man, the secrets of
Spagyrick medicines, of stones, of spirits, and the results of 7. or
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 8. decoctions, and the strange effects of accidental mixtures, which
the art of man could not suspect, being bound up in the secret san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary
of hidden causes, and secret natures, and being laid open by
the concourse of 20, or 30. little accidents, all which were orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by God, as certainly as are the first principles of nature, or the
descent of sons from fathers in the most noble families.</p>
            <p>But that which I shall observe in this whole affair is, that there
are both for the provision of our tables, and the relief of our sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
so many miracles of providence that they give plain demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
what relation we bear to heaven: and the poor man need
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> not be troubled that he is to expect his daily portion after the Sun
is up: for he hath found to this day he was not deceived, and then
he may rejoyce because he sees by an effective probation that in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
a decree was made, every day to send him provisions of meat
and drink; and that is a mighty mercy, when the circles of heaven
are bowed down to wrap us in a bosome of care, and nourishment,
and the wisdom of God is daily busied to serve his mercy, as his
mercy serves our necessities. Does not God plant remedies there
where the diseases are most popular, and every Countrey is best
provided against its own evils? Is not the Rhubarb found where
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the Sun most corrupts the liver, and the Scabious by the shore of
the Sea, that God might cure as soon as he wounds, and the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
may see their remedy against the leprosie, and the scurvy,
before they feel their sicknesse? And then to this we may adde,
Natures commons and open fields, the shores of rivers, and the
strand of the Sea, the unconfined air, the wildernesse that hath no
hedge, and that in these every man may hunt, and fowl and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>sh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively;
and that God sends some miracles and extraordinary
blessings so for the publike good, that he will not endure they
should be inclosed and made severall: Thus he is pleased <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> face
of the indigent, as the Sun scatters his beams over the bosome of
the whole earth, did so order that as long as every man was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:53465:173"/>
to partake, the bosome of heaven was open; but when man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
gathered them into single handfulls, and made them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> impropriate,
God gathered his hand into his bosome, and bound the heavens
with ribs of brasse, and the earth with decrees of iron, and the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
reverted to him that gave it, since they might not receive it, to
whom it was sent. And in general, this is the excellency of this
mercy, that all our needs are certainly supplied, and secured by a
promise which God cannot break, but he that cannot breake the
lawes of his own promises, can break the lawes of nature, that he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
may perform his promise, and he will do a miracle rather then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
thee in thy needs: So that our security and the relative mercy,
is bound upon us by all the power and the truth of God.</p>
            <p>8. But because such is the bounty of God, that he hath provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a better life for the inheritance of man, if God is so merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in making fair provisions for our lesse noble part, in order to
the transition toward our Countrey, we may expect that the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of God hath rare arts to secure to us his designed bounty, in
order to our inheritance, to that which ought to be our portion
for ever. And here I consider, that it is an infinite mercy of the
Almighty Father of mercies that he hath appointed to us such a
religion that leads us to a huge felicity, through pleasant wayes.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
For the felicity that is designed to us is so above our present ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities
and conceptions, that while we are so ignorant as not
to understand it, we are also so foolish as not to desire it with
passions great enough to perform the little conditions of its pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase;
God therefore knowing how great an interest it is, and how
apt we would be to neglect it, hath found out such conditions of
acquiring it which are eases and satisfaction to our present appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites.
God hath bound our salvation upon us by the endearment
of temporall prosperities; and because we love this world so well,
God hath so ordered it, that even this world may secure the other.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
And of this, God in old time made open profession, for when he
had secretly designed to bring his people to a glorious immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in another world, he told them nothing of that, it being a thing
bigger then the capacity of their thoughts, or of their Theology,
but told them that which would tempt them most, and endear
obedience: <hi>If you will obey, ye shall eat the good things of the land:</hi>
Ye shall possesse a rich countrey, ye shall triumph over your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
ye shall have numerous families, blessed children, rich gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries,
over-running wine-presses; for God knew the cognation
of most of them was so dear, between their affections and the good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
things of this world, that if they did not obey in hope of that they
did need, and fancy, and love, and see, and feel, it was not to be
expected they should quit their affections for a secret in another
world, whither before they come they must die, and lose all desire
and all capacities of enjoyment. But this designe of God which
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:53465:173"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> was bare-faced in the dayes of the law, is now in the Gospel inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven
secretly (but yet plain enough to be discovered by an eye
of faith and reason) into every vertue, and temporal advantage
is a great ingredient in the constitution of every Christian grace for
so the richest tissue dazles the beholders eye when the Sun reflects
upon the mettal, the silver and the gold weaved into phantasti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
imagery, or a wealthy plainnesse, but the rich wire and shining fila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are wrought upon cheaper silk, the spoil of worms and flies:
so is the imbroidery of our vertue; the glories of the spirit
dwell upon the face and vestment, upon the fringes and the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> borders; and there we see the Beril and the Onyx, the Jasper and
the sardyx, order and perfection, love and peace and joy, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
of the passions and ravishment of the will, adherencies to
God and imitation of Christ, reception and entertainment of the
Holy Ghost and longings after heaven, humility, and chastity, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,
and sobriety; these make the frame of the garment, the
cloaths of the soul that it may not be found naked in the day of the
Lords visitation; but through these rich materials a thrid of silk is
drawn, some compliance with worms and weaker creatures, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that shall please our bowels, and make the lower man t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they are wrought upon secular content, and material sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions,
and now we cannot be happy unlesse we be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ious, and
the religion of a Christian is the greatest security and the most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
instrument of making a man <hi>rich,</hi> and <hi>pleased,</hi> and <hi>healthful</hi> and
<hi>wise</hi> and <hi>beloved</hi> in the whole world.<note place="margin">Life of H. Je<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sus. part 3 Disc. 14.</note> I shall now remark onely two
or three instances; for the main body of this truth I have other
where represented.</p>
            <p>1. The whole religion of a Christian as it relates to others is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but justice and mercy, certain parents of peace and benefit:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and upon this supposition what evil can come to a just and a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
to a necessary and useful person? For the first permission of
evil was upon the stock of injustice: He that kills may be killed,
and he that does injury may be mischieved; he that invades ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mans right, must venture the losse of his own; and when I put
my Brother to his defence he may chance drive the evil so far from
himself, that it may reach me; Laws and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>udges, private &amp; publick
judicatures, wars and tribunals, axes and wheels were made, not for
the righteous, but for the unjust; and all that whole order of
things and persons would be uselesse, if men did do as they would
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> willingly suffer. 2. And because there is no evil that can befal a
just man unlesse it comes by <hi>injury</hi> and <hi>violence,</hi> our religion hath
also made as good provisions against that too, as the nature of the
thing will suffer; for by patience we are reconciled to the suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and by hope and faith we see a certain consequent reward;
and by praying for the persecuting man we are oured of all the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
of the minde, the envy and the fretfulnesse that uses to gall the
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:53465:174"/>
troubled and resisting man; and when we turn all the passion into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
charity, and God turns all the suffering into reward, there remains
nothing that is very formidable. So that our religion obliges us to
such duties which prevent all evils that happen justly to men, (and
in our religion no man can suffer as a malefactor, if he follows the
religion truely) and for the evils that are unavoidable and come
by violence, the graces of this discipline turne them into vertues
and rewards, and make them that in their event they are desirable
and in the suffering they are very tolerable. 3. But then when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that the religion of a Christian consists in doing good to all
men, that it is made up of mercies and friendships, of friendly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
and assemblies of Saints, that all are to <hi>do good works for
necessary uses,</hi> that is to be able to be beneficial to the publick and
not to be burthensome to any, where it can be avoided, what can
be wished to man in relation to others, and what can be more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial
to themselves then that they be such whom other men will
value for their interest, such whom the publick does need, such
whom Princes and Nobles ought to esteem, and all men can make
use of according to their several conditions; that they are so
well provided for that unlesse a persecution disables them they
cannot onely maintain themselves, but oblige others to their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
charity.</p>
            <p>This is a temporal good which all wise men reckon as part of
that felicity which recompences all the labours of their day, and
sweetens the sleep of their night, and places them in that circle
of neighbour-hood and amity where men are most valued and most
secure. 4. To this we may adde this material consideration. That
al those graces which oblige us to do good to others are nothing else
but certain instruments of doing advantage to our selves. It is a
huge noblenesse of charity to give alms not onely to our Brother,
but for him, It is the Christian sacrifice, like that of Job who made <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
oblations for his sons when they feasted each other, fearing lest
they had sinned against God; and if I give almes and fast and pray
in behalf of my prince, or my Patron, my friend or my children,
I do a combination of holy actions, which are of all things that
I can do, the most effectual intercession for him, whom I so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend;
but then observe the art of this, and what a plot is
laid by the divine mercy to secure blessing to to our selves.
That I am a person fit to intercede and pray for him must sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
me a gracious person, one whom God rather will accept; so
that before I be fit to pray and interpose for him; I must first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
dear to God, and my charity can do him no good, for whose
interest I gave it, but by making me first acceptable to God, that
so he may the rather hear me; and when I fast, it is first an act of
repentance for my self before it can be an instrument of impetrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for him. And thus I do my Brother a single benefit, by doing my
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:53465:174"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> self a double one, and it is also so ordered that when I pray for a
person for whom God will not hear me, yet then he will hear me
for my self though I say nothing in my own behalf, and our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
are like Jonathans arrows, if they fall short, yet they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
my friend or my friendship to me; or if they go home, they
secure him whom they pray for, and I have not onely the comfort
of rejoycing with him but the honour and the reward of procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him a joy; and certain it is that a charitable prayer for another,
can never want what it asks, or instead of it, a greater blessing.
The good man that saw his poor brother troubled because he
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> had nothing to present for an offering at the Holy communion
(when all knew themselves obliged to do kindnesse for Christs
poor members with which themselves were incorporated with so
mysterious union) and gave him mony that he might present for
the good of his soul as other Christians did, had not onely the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of almes but of religion too; and that offering was well hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded,
for it did benefit to two souls; for as I sin when I make
another sin: so if I help him to do a good, I am a sharer in the gains
of his talent, and he shall not have the lesse but I shall be rewarded
upon his stock. And this was it which David rejoyced in, <hi>Partic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ps</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
               <hi>sum omnium timentium te; I am a partner, a companion of all them
that fear thee,</hi> I share in their profits. If I do but rejoyce at every
grace of God which I see in my Brother, I shall be rewarded <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or
that grace; and we need not envy the excellency of another; It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
mine as well as his: and if I do rejoyce, I shall have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ause
to rejoyce; so excellent, so full, so artificial is the mercy of God
in making and seeking and finding all occasions to do us good.
5. The very charity and love and mercy that is commanded in
our religion is in it self a great excellency, not onely in order to
heaven, but to the comforts of the earth too, &amp; such without which
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> a man is not capable of a blessing or a comfort; &amp; he that sent charity
and friendships into the world, intended charity to be as relative as
justice, &amp; to do its effect both upon the loving and the beloved per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
It is a reward and a blessing to a kinde Father, when his children
do well, and every degree of prudent love which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> bears to
them is an endearment of his joy; and he that loves them not,
but looks upon them as burdens of necessity, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oads to his
fortune, loses those many rejoycings, and the pleas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>es of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
which they feast withal who love to divide their fortunes,
amongst them, because they have already divided out large and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> equal portions of their heart. I have instanced in this relation; but
it is true in all the excellency of friendship; and every man rejoyces
twice when he hath a partner of his joy; A friend shares my sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and makes it but a moi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ty; but he swells my joy and makes
it double. For so two chanels divide the river and lessen it into
rivulets, and make it foordable and apt to be drunk up at the first
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:53465:175"/>
revels of the Sirian star; but two torches do not divide but increase <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
the flame; and though my tears are the sooner dryed up, when they
run upon my friends cheeks in the furrows of compassion, yet when
my flame hath kindled his lamp, we unite the glories and make
them radiant like the golden Candle-sticks that burn before the
throne of God, because they shine by numbers, by unions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federations
of light and joy.</p>
            <p>And now upon this account which is already so great I need not
reckon concerning the collateral issues, and little streams of comfort
which God hath made to issue from that religion to which God
hath obliged us; such as are <hi>mutual comforts, visiting sick people, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
               <hi>the ignorant</hi> and so becoming better <hi>instructed</hi> and <hi>forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi>
and <hi>comforted</hi> our selves by the instruments of our Brothers
ease and advantages; <hi>the glories of converting souls, of rescuing a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
from hell,</hi> of a miserable man from the grave <hi>the honour and
noblenesse of being a good man,</hi> the noble confidence, and the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of innocence, the ease of patience, the quiet of contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
the rest of peacefulnesse, the worthinesse of forgiving others,
the greatnesse of spirit that is in despising riches, and the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of spirit that is in meeknesse and humility; these are Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<hi>graces</hi> in every sense; favours of God and issues of his bounty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
&amp; his mercy; but al that Ishal now observe further concerning them,
is this, that God hath made these necessary; he hath obliged us to have
them under pain of damnation, he hath made it so sure to us to
become happy even in this world, that if we will not, he hath threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened
to destroy us, which is, not a desire or aptnesse to do us an
evil, but an art to make it impossible that we should For God hath
so ordered it that we cannot perish unlesse we desire it our selves,
and unlesse we will do our selves a mischief on purpose to get hell,
we are secured of heaven, and there is not in the nature of things, any
way that can more infallibly do the work of felicity upon creatures <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
that can choose, then to make that which they should naturally
choose, be spiritually their duty, and that he will make them hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
hereafter, if they will suffer him to make them happy here; But
hardly stand another throng of mercies that must be considered by
us, and God must be glorified in them, for they are such as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to preserve to us all this felicity.</p>
            <p>9. God that he might secure our duty and our present and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
felicity hath tied us with golden chaines and bound us not
onely with the bracelets of love, and the deliciousnesse of hope,
but with the ruder cords of fear and reverence, even with all the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
innumerable parts of a <hi>restraining grace.</hi> For it is a huge aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of humane calamity to consider that after a man hath been
instructed in the love and advantages of his Religion, and knows
it to be the way of honour and felicity, and that to prevaricate
his holy sanctions is certain death and disgrace to eternal ages,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:53465:175"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> yet that some men shall despise their religion, others shall be very
weary of its laws, and cal the commandments a burden, and too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
with a perfect choice shall delight in death, and the wayes that
lead thither, and they choose mony infinitely, and to rule over their
Brother by al means, &amp; to be revenged extremely, and to prevail by
wrong and to do all that they can, and please themselves in all that
they desire, and love it fondly, and be restlesse in all things but
where they perish; if God should not interpose by the arts of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
and merciful grace, and put a bridle in the mouth of our
lusts, and chastise the sea of our follies by some heaps of sand or
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the walls of a rock, we should perish in the deluge of sin uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
as the old world did in that storm of the divine anger, <hi>the
flood of water.</hi> But thus God suffers but few adulteries in the
world in respect of what would be if all men that desire to be a dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers
had power &amp; opportunity; and yet some men and very many
women are by modesty and natural shamefacednesse chastised in
their too forward appetites: or the laws of man or publick repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
or the undecency and unhandsome circumstances of sin check
the desire and make it that it cannot arrive at act: for so have I seen
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> a busie flame sitting upon a sullen cole turn its point to all the angles
and portions of its neighbour-hood and reach at a heap of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
straw, which like a bold temptation called it to a restlesse mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and activity, but either it was at too big a distance or a gentle
breath from heaven diverted the speare and the ray of the fire to
the other side, and so prevented the violence of the burning, till the
flame expired in a weak consumption, and dyed turning into smoak
and the coolnesse of death and the harmlesnesse of a Cinder: and
when a mans desires are winged with sailes and a lusty wind of pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and passe on in a smooth chanel of opportunity, God often
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> times hinders the lust and the impatient desire from passing on to
its port, and entring into action, by a suddain thought, by a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of a word, by a fancy, by a sudden disability, by unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
and unlikely fears, by the suddain intervening of company,
by the very wearinesse of the passion, by curiosity, by want of health,
by the too great violence of the desire, bursting it self with its
fulnesse into dissolution &amp; a remisse easinesse, by a sentence of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
by the reverence of a good man, or else by the proper inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
of the spirit of grace chastising the crime and representing
its <hi>appendant</hi> mischiefs and its <hi>constituent</hi> disorder and irregularity;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and after all this, the very anguish and trouble of being defeated
in the purpose hath rolled it self into so much uneasinesse and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
reflections, that the man is grown ashamed and vexed into
more sober counsels.</p>
            <p>And the mercy of God is not lesse then infinite in separating men
from the occasions of their sin, from the neighbour-hood and
temptation; for if the <hi>Hyaena</hi> and a dog should be thrust into the
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:53465:176"/>
same Kennel, one of them would soon finde a grave, and it may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
be both of them their death; so infallible is the ruine of most men,
if they be shewed a temptation: Nitre and resin, Naphtha and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumen,
sulphur and pitch are their constitution, and the fire passes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them infinitely, and there is none to rescue them. But God by
removing our sins far from us, <hi>as far as the East is from the West</hi>
not onely putting away the guilt, but setting the occasion far from
us, extremely far; so far that sometimes we <hi>cannot sin</hi> and many
times, <hi>not easily,</hi> hath magnified his mercy, by giving us safety in
all those measures in which we are untempted, It would be the
matter of new discourses, if I should consider concerning the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
of Gods grace, his preventing and accompanying, his invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and corroborating grace; his assisting us to will, his enabling us
to do, his sending Angels to watch us, to remove us from evil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
to drive us with swords of fire from forbidden instances, to
carry us by unobserved opportunities into holy company, to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
occasions of holy discourses, to make it by some means or
other necessary to do a holy action, to make us in love with ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
because they have mingled that vertue with a just and a fair
interest, to some men by making religion that thing they live upon,
to others, the means of their reputation, and the securities of their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
honour, and thousands of wayes more, which every prudent man
that watches the wayes of God cannot but have observed. But I
must also observe other great conjugations of mercy, for he that
is to passe through an infinite must not dwell upon everie little
line of life.</p>
            <p>10. The next order of mercies is such, which is of so pure, and
unmingled constitution, that it hath at first no regard to the capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and disposition of the receivers, and afterwards when it hath, it
relates onely to such conditions, which it self creates and produces
in the suscipient, I mean the mercies of the <hi>divine predestination.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
For was it not an infinite mercy that God should predestinate all
mankinde to salvation by Jesus Christ, even when he had no other
reason to move him to do it but because man was miserable and nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his pity? But I shall instance onely in the intermediall part of
this mysterious mercy. Why should God cause us to be born of
Christian parents, and not to be circumcised by the impure hands
of a Turkish Priest? What distinguished me from another, that
my Father was severe in his discipline and carefull to <hi>bring me up
in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,</hi> and I was not exposed
to the carelesnesse of an irreligious guardian, and taught to steal,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
and lie, and to make sport with my infant vices, and beginnings of
iniquity? Who was it that discerned our persons from the lot of
dying Chrysomes, whose portion must be among those who never
glorified God with a free obedience? What had you done of good,
or towards it, that you was not condemned to the stupid ignorance
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:53465:176"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> which makes the souls of most men but a little higher then beasts,
and who understand nothing of religion and noble principles, of
parables and wise sayings of old men. And not onely in our cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles,
but in our schools, and in our colledges, in our friendships,
and in our marriages, in our enmities, and in all our conversation,
in our vertues and in our vices, where all things in us were equal,
or else we were the inferiour, there is none of us but have felt the
mercies of many differencies. Or it may be my brother and I
were intemperate, and drunk, and quarelsome, and he kill'd a man,
but God did not suffer me to do so: He fell down and died with a
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> little disorder, I was a beast and yet was permitted to live, and not
yet to die in my sins: He did amisse once and was surprized in that
disadvantage: I sin daily and am still invited to repentance; he
would fain have lived and amended; I neglect the grace, but am
allowed the time. And when God sends the Angel of his wrath
to execute his anger upon a sinfull people we are encompassed
with funerals, and yet the Angel hath not smitten us: what or who
makes the difference? We shall then see, when in the separations
of eternity, <hi>we sitting in glory,</hi> shall see some of the partners of our
sins carried into despair and the portions of the left hand, and roaring
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in the seats of the reprobate; we shall then perceive that it is even that
mercy which hath no cause but it self, no measure of its emanation
but our misery, no natural limit but eternity, no beginning but God,
no object but man, no reason but an essential and an unalterable
goodnesse, no variety but our necessity and capacity, no change but
new instances of its own nature, no ending or repentance, but our
absolute and obstinate refusall to entertain it.</p>
            <p>11. Lastly, All the mercies of God are concentred in that
which is all the felicity of man; and God is so great a lover of
souls that he provides securities and fair conditions for them, even
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> against all our reason and hopes, our expectations, and weak dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursings.
The particulars I shall remark are these. 1. Gods
mercy prevails over the malice and ignorances, the weaknesse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and
follies of men, so that in the convention and assemblies of hereticks
(as the word is usually understood for erring and mistaken people)
although their doctrines are such that if men should live according
to their proper and naturall consequences, they would live impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
yet in every one of these there are persons so innocently
and invincibly mistaken, and who mean nothing but truth, while
in the simplicity of their heart they talk nothing but error, that in
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the defiance and contradiction of their own doctrines, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ve ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to its contradictory. He that beleeves contrition alone
with confession to a Priest, is enough to expiate ten thousand sins,
is furnished with an excuse easie enough to quit himself from the
troubles of a holy life; and he that hath a great many cheap wayes
of buying off his penances for a little money, even for the greatest
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:53465:177"/>
sins, is taught a way not to fear the doing of an act, for which he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
must repent; since repentance is a duty so <hi>soon,</hi> so <hi>certainly,</hi> and
so <hi>easily</hi> performed: But these are not<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ious doctrines in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church, and yet God so loves the souls of his creatures that
many men who trust to these doctrines in their discourses, dare not
rely upon them in their lives. But while they talk as if they did
not need to live strictly, many of them live so strictly as if they
did not beleeve so foolishly. He that tels, that antecedently God
hath to all humane choice decreed man to heaven or to hell, takes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
away from man all care of the way, because they beleeve that he
that infallibly decreed that end, hath unalterably appointed the
means, and some men that talk thus wildly live soberly, and are
over-wrought in their understanding by some secret art of God,
that man may not perish in his ignorance, but be assisted in his
choice, and saved by the Divine mercies. And there is no sect of
men but are furnished with antidotes and little excuses to cure the
venom of their doctrine; and therefore although the adherent and
constituent poison is notorious and therefore to be declined, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is collaterally cured and over-poured by the torrent and
wisdom of Gods mercies, the men are to be taken into the Quire
that we may all joyn in giving of God praise for the operation of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
his hands. 2. I said formerly that there are many secret and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discerned
mercies by which men live, and of which men can give
no account till they come to give God thanks at their publication;
and of this sort, is that mercy which God reserves for the souls of
many millions of men and women concerning whom we have no
hopes, if we account concerning them by the usuall proportions
of revelation and Christian commandements, and yet we are taught
to hope some strange good things concerning them by the analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
and generall rules of the Divine mercy. For what shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of ignorant Christians, people that live in wildnesses and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
places more desert then a primitive hermitage, people that are
baptized, and taught to go to Church, it may be once a yeer, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that can get no more knowledge, they know not where to have
it, nor how to desire it; and yet that an eternity of pains shall be
consequent to such an ignorance is unlike the mercy of God,
and yet that they should be in any dispositions towards an eternity
of intellectuall joyes is no where set down in the leaves of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;
and when the Jews grew rebellious, or a silly woman of
the daughters of Abraham was tempted, and sinned, and punished
with death, we usually talk as if that death passed on to a worse; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
but yet we may arrest our thoughts upon the Divine mercies, and
consider that it is reasonable to expect from the Divine goodnesse,
that no greater forfeiture be taken upon a law, then was expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in its sanction and publication. He that makes a law and bindes
it with the penalty of stripes, we say he intends not to afflict the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:53465:177"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> with scorpions and axes; and it had been hugely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
that God had scar'd the Jews from their sins by threatning
the pains of hell to them that disobeyed, if he intended to inflict
it; for although many men would have ventured the future, since
they are not affrighted with the present and visible evil, yet some
persons would have had more Philosophical and spiritual appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
then others, and have been infallibly cured in all their
temptations with the fear of an eternall pain; and however,
whether they had or no, yet since it cannot be understood how it
consists with the Divine justice to exact a pain bigger then he
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> threatned, greater then he gave warning of; so we are sure it is a
great way off from Gods mercy to do so. He that usually impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
lesse, and is loth to inflict any and very often forgives it all, is
hugely distant from exacting an eternall punishment, when the most
that he threatned and gave notice of, was but a temporall. The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of this consideration I would have to be this, that we may pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
worship this mercy of God which is kept in secret and that
we be not too forward in sentencing all Heathens, and prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Jews to the eternall pains of hell, but hope that they have a
portion in the secrets of the Divine mercy, where also unlesse ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of us have some little portions deposited, our condition will be
very uncertain, and sometimes most miserable. God knows best
how intolerably accursed a thing it is to perish in the eternall flames
of hell, and therefore he is not easie to inflict it: and if the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oyes
of heaven be too great to be expected upon too easie termes, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the pains of the damned are infinitely too big to passe
lightly upon persons who cannot help themselves, and who i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> they
were helped with clearer revelations would have avoided it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But
as in these things we must not pry into the secrets of the Divine
Oeconomy, being sure whether it be so or no, it is most just, even
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> as it is; so we may expect to see the glories of the Divine mercy
made publike in unexpected instances at the great day of manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station:
And indeed our dead many times go forth from our hands
very strangely and carelesly, without prayers, without Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
without consideration, without counsel, and without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort;
and to dresse the souls of our dear people to so sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a parting
is an imployment, we therefore omit, not alwayes because we are
negligent, but because the work is sad and allay the affections of
the world, with those melancholy circumstances; but i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> God did
not in his mercies make secret and equivalent provisions for them,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and take care of his redeemed ones we might unhappily meet them
in a sad eternity, and without remedy weep together and groan
for ever. But <hi>God hath provided better things for them, that they

            <p>THere are <hi>very many more</hi> orders and conjugations of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

or causes, is as undiscerned as the head of <hi>Nilus,</hi> or a sudden re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of a long neglected and forgotten proposition. 1. But
upon this account it is, that good men have observed, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God is so great a provider for holy living, and does so
certainly minister to religion, that nature and chance, the order of
the world, and the influences of heaven are taught to serve the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
ends of <hi>the Spirit of God,</hi> and <hi>the spirit of a man.</hi> I do not speak
of the miracles that God hath in the severall periods of the world
wrought for the establishing his lawes, and confirming his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and securing our obedience; though that was all the way the
overflowing and miracles of <hi>mercy</hi> as well as <hi>power:</hi> but that which
I consider is, that besides the extraordinary emanations of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
power upon the first and most solemn occasions of an instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and the first beginnings of a religion, such as were, the wonders
God did in Egypt and in the wildernesse, preparatory to the sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that law, and <hi>the first covenant;</hi> and the miracles wrought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
by Christ and his Apostles, for the founding and the building up
the religion of the Gospel, and <hi>the new covenant:</hi> God does also
do things wonderfull and miraculous, for the promoting the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
and lesse solemn actions of our piety, and to assist and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
them in a constant and regular succession. It was a strange
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:53465:178"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> variety of naturall efficacies, that Manna should s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nk in 24. hours
if gathered upon Wednesday and Thursday, and that it should
last till 48. hours if gathered upon the Even of the Sabbath; and
that it should last many hundreds of yeers when placed in the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary
by the ministery of the high Priest; but so it was in the Jews
religion; and Manna pleased every palate, and it filled all appetites,
and the same measure was a different proportion; it was much
and it was little; as if nature, that it might serve religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had been
taught some measures of infinity, which is every where and no
where, filling all things, and circumscribed with nothing, measured
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> by one Omer, and doing the work of two; like the crowns of
Kings, fitting the browes of Nimrod and the most mighty Warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
and yet not too large for the temples of an infant Prince. And
not onely is it thus in nature, but in contingencies and acts depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the choice of men; for God having commanded the sons
of Israel to go up to Jerusalem to worship thrice every yeer, and to
leave their borders to be guarded by women, and children, and
sick persons, in the neighbourhood of diligent and spitefull ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
yet God so disposed of their hearts and opportunities, that
they never entered the land when the people were at their solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> untill they desecrated their rites, by doing at their Passeover
the greatest sin and treason in the world; till at Easter they crucified
the Lord of life and glory, they were secure in Jerusalem and in
their borders; but when they had destroyed religion by this act,
God took away their security, and Titus besieged the City at the
feast of Easter, that the more might perish in the deluge of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
indignation.</p>
            <p>To this observation the Jews adde, that in Jerusalem no man
ever had a fall that came thither to worship; that at their solemn
festivals there was reception in the Town for all the inhabitants of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the land; concerning which although I cannot affirm any thing,
yet this is certain, that no godly person among all the tribes of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
was ever <hi>a begger,</hi> but all the variety of humane chances, were
over-ruled to the purposes of providence, and providence was mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
by the ends of the religion, and the religion which promised
them plenty, performed the promise till the Nation and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
too began to decline, that it might give place to a better
ministery, and a more excellent dispensation of the things of the
world.</p>
            <p>But when Christian religion was <hi>planted and had taken root, and</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
               <hi>had filled all lands,</hi> then all the nature of things, <hi>the whole creation</hi>
became servant to the kingdom of grace, and <hi>the Head of the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
is also the Head of the creatures, and ministers all the things
of the world in order to the Spirit of grace: and now <hi>Angels are
ministring spirits,</hi> sent forth to minister for the good of them that
fear the Lord, and all the violences of men, and things of nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="342" facs="tcp:53465:179"/>
and choice, are forced into subjection and lowest ministeries, and to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
cooperate as with an united designe to verifie all the promises of
the Gospel, and to secure and advantage all the children of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and now he that is made poor by chance, or persecution, is
made rich by religion, and he that hath nothing, yet possesses all
things, and sorrow it self is the greatest comfort, not only because
it ministers to vertue, but because <hi>it self is one,</hi> as in the case of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;
and <hi>death</hi> ministers to <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>bondage</hi> is <hi>freedom,</hi> and
<hi>losse is gain,</hi> and our <hi>enemies</hi> are our <hi>friends,</hi> and every thing turns <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
into religion, and religion turns into felicity, and all manner of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages.
But that I may not need to enumerate any more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
in this observation certain it is that Angels of light and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
all the influences of heaven, and the fruits and productions
of the earth, the stars, and the elements, the secret things that lie in
the bowels of the Sea, and the entrails of the earth, the single ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of all efficients, and the conjunction of all causes, all events
foreseen, and all rare contingencies, every thing of chance, and
every thing of choice, is so much a servant to him whose greatest
desire, and great interest, is by all means to save our souls, that we
are thereby made sure, that all the whole creation shall be made
to bend in all the flexures of its nature and accidents, that it may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
minister to religion, to the good of the Catholike Church, and every
person within its bosom, who are the body of him that rules over
all the world, and commands them as he chooses.</p>
            <p>2. But that which is next to this, and not much unlike the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
of this wonderfull mercy, is, that all the actions of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
though mingled with circumstances of differing and sometimes
of contradictory relations are so concentred in God their proper
centre, and conducted in such certain and pure channels of <hi>reason</hi>
and <hi>rule,</hi> that no one duty does contradict another; and it can never
be necessary for any man in any case to sin. They that bound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
by an oath to kill Paul were not environed with the sad ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
of murder on one side and vow-breach on the other, so
that if they did murder him they were man-slayers, if they did
not they were perjured; for God had made provision for this case,
that no unlawful oath should passe an obligation. He that hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
his faith in unlawfull confederation against his Prince, is not
girded with a fatall necessity of breach of trust on one side, or
breach of allegeance on the other; for in this also God hath se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
the case of conscience, by forbidding any man to make an
unlawfull promise, and upon a stronger degree of the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
by forbidding him to keep it in case he hath made it. He
that doubts whether it be lawfull to keep the Sunday holy, must
not do it during that doubt, because <hi>whatsoever is not of faith is
sin;</hi> But yet Gods mercy hath taken care to break this snare in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
so that he may neither sin against the commandement, nor
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:53465:179"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> against his conscience; for he is bound to lay aside his errour and
be better instructed; till when, the scene of his sin lies in some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that hath influence upon his understanding, not in the omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the fact; <hi>No man can serve two Masters,</hi> but therefore <hi>he must
hate the one and cleave to the other.</hi> But then if we consider what
infinite contradiction there is in sin, and that the great long suffering
of God is expressed in this, that God <hi>suffered the contradiction of
sinners,</hi> we shall feel the mercy of God in the peace of our consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
and the unity of religion, so long as we do the work of God.
It is a huge affront to a covetous man that he is the further off from
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> fulnesse by having great heaps &amp; vast revenues; and that his thirst
increases by having that which should quench it; and that the
more he shall need to be satisfied, the lesse he shall dare to do it;
and that he shall refuse to drink because he is dry; that he dyes if
he tasts, and languishes if he does not; and at the same time he
is full and empty, bursting with a plethory, and consumed with
hunger, drowned with rivers of oyle and wine and yet dry as the
Arabian sands; but then the contradiction is multiplyed and the
labyrinths more amazed, when prodigality waits, upon another
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> curse, and covetousnesse heaps up, that prodigality may scatter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad;
then distractions are infinite, and a man hath two Devils to
serve of contradictory designes and both of them exact<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>g obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
more unreasonably then the Egyptian task-masters then there
is no rest, no end of labours, no satisfaction of purposes, no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of things, but they begin where they should end, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
again, and never passe forth to content or reason, or quietnesse,
or possession. But the duty of a Christian is easie in a persecution,
it is clear under a Tyranny, it is evident in despite of heresy,
it is one in the midst of schisme, it is determined amongst infinite
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> disputes, being like a rock in the sea which is beaten with the tide
and washed with retiring waters, and encompassed with mists, and
appears in several figures, but it alwayes dips its foot in the same
bottom and remaines the same in calms and storms, and survives
the revolution of ten thousand tides, and there shall dwell till time
and tides shall be no more: so is our duty, uniform and constant,
open and notorious, variously represented, but in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
exacted; and in the interest of our souls God hath not exposed
us to uncertainty or the variety of any thing that can change, and
it is by the grace and mercy of God put into the power of every
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Christian to do that which God through Jesus Christ will accept to
salvation; and neither men nor Devils shall hinder it unlesse we list
our selves.</p>
            <p>3. After all this we may sit down and reckon by great sums
and conjugations of his gracious gifts, and tell the minuts of eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
by the number of the Divine mercies: God hath given
<hi>his laws</hi> to rule us, <hi>his word</hi> to instruct us, <hi>his spirit</hi> to guide us, <hi>his
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:53465:180"/>
Angels</hi> to protect us, <hi>his ministers</hi> to exhort us; he <hi>revealed</hi> all our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
and he hath <hi>concealed</hi> whatsoever can hinder us, he hath <hi>affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
our follies with feare of death and engaged our watchfulnesse
by its secret coming; he hath exercised our faith by keeping private
the state of souls departed, and yet hath confirmed our faith by a
promise of a resurrection and entertained our hope by some gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
significations of the state of interval: His mercies make contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
means instrumental to great purposes, and a small herb the
remedy of the greatest diseases; he impedes the Devils rage and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuates,
his counsels, he diverts his malice, and defeats his purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
he bindes him in the chaine of darknesse and gives him no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
over the children of light; he suffers him to walk in solitary places
and yet fetters him that he cannot disturb the sleep of a childe; he
hath given him mighty power &amp; yet a young maiden that resists him
shall make him flee away; he hath given him a vast knowledge
and yet an ignorant man can confute him with the twelve articles
of his creed, he gave him power over the winds and made him
Prince of the air and yet the breath of a holy prayer can drive him
as far as the utmost sea; and he hath so restrained him, that (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it be by faith) we know not whether there be any Devils yea,
or no: for we never heard his noises, nor have seen his affrighting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
shapes.] This is that great Principle of all the felicity we hope for,
and of all the means thither, and of all the skill and all the strengths
we haue to use those means he hath made great variety of condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and yet hath made all necessary, and all mutual helpers, and by
some instruments and in some respects they are all equal in order
to felicity, to content and final and intermedial satisfactions: He
gave us part of our reward in hand that he might enable us to
work for more; he taught the world arts for use, arts for enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of all our faculties, and all our dispositions; he gives eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
gifts for temporal services and gives us whatsoever we want,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               <hi>for asking,</hi> and commands us to ask, and theatens us if we will not
ask, and punishes us for refusing to be happy. This is that glorious
attribute that hath made <hi>order,</hi> and <hi>health,</hi> and <hi>harmony</hi> and <hi>hope,
restitutions</hi> and <hi>variety,</hi> the joyes of direct possession, and the joyes,
the artificial joyes of contrariety and comparison; he comforts the
poor, and he brings down the rich, that they may be safe in their
humility and sorrow, from the transportations of an unhappy and
uninstructed prosperity; he gives necessaries to all, and scatters the
extraordinary provisions so, that every nation may traffick in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and commute for pleasures; He was the <hi>Lord of hosts,</hi> and he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
is stil what he was, but he loves to be called <hi>the God of peace,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was terrible in that, but he is delighted in this. His mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
is his glory, and his glory is the light of heaven; his mercy is
the life of the creation, and it fills all the earth, and his mercy is
a sea too; and it fills all the abysses of the deep; it hath given us
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:53465:180"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> promises for supply of whatsoever we need and relieves us in all
our fears, and in all the evils that we suffer; his mercies are more
then we can tell, and they are more then we can feel; for all the
world in the abysse of the Divine mercies is like a man diving into
the bottom of the sea, over whose head the waters run insensibly,
and unperceived, and yet the weight is vast and the sum of them is
unmeasurable, and the man is not pressed with the burden, nor
confounded with numbers; and no observation is able to recount,
no sense sufficient to perceive, no memory large enough to retain,
no understanding great enough to apprehend this infinity, but
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> we must <hi>admire</hi> and <hi>love</hi> and <hi>worship,</hi> and <hi>magnify</hi> this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
for ever and ever; that we we may dwell in what we feel, and
be comprehended by that which is equal to God, and the parent
of all felicity.</p>
            <p>And yet this is but the one half. The mercies of <hi>giving</hi> I have
now told of, but those of forgiving are greater, though not more.
<hi>[He is ready to forgive]</hi> and upon this stock thrives the interest
of our great hope, the hopes of a blessed immortality; for if the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of giving have not made our expectations big enough to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the confidences of heaven; yet when we think of the gracious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and readinesse of <hi>forgiving,</hi> we may with more readinesse
hope to escape hell, and then we cannot <hi>but</hi> be blessed by an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
consequence: we have but small opinion of the Divine mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
if we dare not believe concerning it, that it is <hi>desirous</hi> and <hi>able</hi>
and <hi>watchful</hi> and <hi>passionate</hi> to keep us or rescue us respectively from
such a condemnation <hi>the pain</hi> of which is insupportable, and <hi>the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
is eternal, and <hi>the extension</hi> is misery upon all our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
and the intension is great beyond patience or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
or supernatural abilities, and <hi>the state</hi> is a state of darknesse,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and despair, of confusion and amazement, of cursing and roaring,
anguish of spirit, and gnashing of teeth, misery universal, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and irremediable. From this it is which Gods mercies would
so fain preserve us: This is a state that God provides for his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
not for them that love him, that endeavour to obey though
they do it but in weaknesse, that weep truely for their sins though
but with a shower no bigger then the drops of pitty, that wait
for his coming with a holy and pure flame, though their lamps
are no brighter then a poor mans candle, though their strengths are
no greater then a contrite reed or a strained arme, and their fires
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> have no more warmth then the smok of kindling flax; if our
<hi>faith be pure</hi> and <hi>our love unfained,</hi> if the degree of it be great
God will accept it into glory: if it be little he will accept it into
grace, and make it bigger. For that is the first instance of Gods
readinesse to forgive: he will upon any termes, that are not unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
and that do not suppose a remanent affection to sin keep us
from the intolerable paines of hell. And indeed if we consider the
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:53465:181"/>
constitution of the conditions which God requires, we shall soon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
perceive God intends heaven to us as a meer gift, and that the duties
on our part are but little entertainments and exercises of our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and our love that the Devil might not seize upon that portion
which to eternal ages shall be the instrument of our happinesse.
For in all the parts of our duty it may be there is but one instance
in which we are to do violence to our natural and first desires. For
those men have very ill natures to whom vertue is so contrary that
they are inclined naturally to <hi>lust,</hi> to <hi>drunkennesse</hi> and <hi>anger,</hi> and
<hi>pride</hi> and <hi>covetousnesse,</hi> and <hi>unthankefulnesse</hi> and <hi>disobedience:</hi> Most
men that are tempted with lust, could easily enough entertain the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
sobrieties of other counsels, as of temperance, and justice, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
if it would indulge to them but that one passion of lust,
&amp; persons that are greedy of mony are not fond of amorous vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
nor care they to sit long at the wine and one vice destroyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
and when one vice is consequent to another, it is by way
of punishment and dereliction of the man, unlesse where vices
have cognation, and seem but like several degrees of one another;
and it is evil custome and superinduced habits that make artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
appetites in most men to most sins; But many times their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
temper vexes them into uneasie dispositions and aptnesses one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
to some one unhandsome sort of action; that one thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is it in which God demands of thee <hi>mortification</hi> and <hi>self de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certain it is; There are very many men in the world that would
fain commute their severity in al other instances for a licence in their
one appetite; they would not refuse long prayers after a drunken
meeting, or <hi>great almes</hi> to gether with one great <hi>lust;</hi> but then consider
how easie it is for them to go to heaven; God demands of them for
his sake &amp; their own to crucifie but one natural lust, or one evil habit,
(for all the rest they are easie enough to do themselves) &amp; God will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
give them heaven, where the joy is more then one, and I said it is but
one mortification God requires of most men; for if those persons
would extirp but that one thing in which they are principally
tempted it is not easily imaginable that any lesse evill to which the
temptation is trifling should interpose between them and their great
interest. If Saul had not spared Agag, the people could not have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
mercy; and our little and inferiour appetites that rather
come to us by intimation and consequent adherences, then by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
violence, must not dwell with him who hath crossed the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
of his distempered nature in a beloved instance; since <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
therefore this is the state of most men and God in effect demands
of them but one thing, and in exchange for that will give them all
good things, it gives demonstration of his huge easinesse to redeem
us from that intolerable evil that is equally consequent to the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
to one or to twenty sinful habits.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="347" facs="tcp:53465:181"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 2. Gods readinesse to pardon appears in this, that he pardons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we ask, for he that bids us alk for pardon hath in designe
and purpose done the thing already: for what is wanting on his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
part <hi>in whose onely power</hi> it is to give pardon, and <hi>in whose desire</hi> it
is that we should be pardoned, and <hi>who commands</hi> us to lay hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the offer; he hath done all that belongs to God; that is all that
concerns the pardon: there it lies ready, it is recorded in the book
of life, it wants nothing, but being exemplified and taken forth,
and the Holy spirit stands ready to consigne and passe the privy sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,
that we may exhibit it to devils and evil men when they tempt
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> us to despair or sin.</p>
            <p>3. Nay God is so ready in his mercy that he did pardon us even <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
before he redeemed us: for what is the secret of the mysterie, that
the eternal Son of God should take upon him our nature, and die
our death and suffer for our sins and do our work, and enable us
to do our own? he that did this is God: he who <hi>thought it no rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery
to be equal with God:</hi> he came to satisfie himself, to pay to
himself the price for his own creature: and when he did this for
us that he might pardon us, was he at that instant angry with us?
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> was this an effect of his anger or of his love that God sent his Son
to work our pardon and salvation? Indeed we were angry with
God, at enmity with the the Prince of life: but he was recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
to us so far, as that he then did the greatest thing in the world
for us: for nothing could be greater then that <hi>God, the Son of God,</hi>
should die for us: here was reconciliation before pardon: and
God that came to die for us did love us first before he came this
was hasty love. But it went further yet.</p>
            <p>4. God pardoned us before we sinned; and when he foresaw our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
sin, even mine and yours, he sent his son to die for us; ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> was wrought and effected by Christs death above 1600 years
ago; and for the sins of to morrow, and the infirmities of the next
day Christ is already dead, already risen from the dead, and does
now make intercession and atonement. And this is not onely a
favour to us who were born in the due time of the Gospel, but to
all mankinde since Adam; For God who is infinitely patient in his
justice, was not at all patient in his mercy; he forbears to strike
and punish us, but he would not forbear to provide cure for us and
remedy; for as if God could not stay from redeeming us, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
the <hi>Redeemer</hi> to Adam, in the beginning of the worlds sin; &amp;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Christ was <hi>the lamb slain from the begining of the world;</hi> and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of the Gospel though it was not made with man yet it was
from the beginning performed by God as to his part, as to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of pardon; The seed of the woman was set up against the
dragon as soon as ever the Tempter had won his first battle; and
though God laid his hand, and drew a vail of types and secresy
before the manifestation of his mercies, yet he did the work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:53465:182"/>
and saved us by the covenant of faith, and the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
of believing, and the mercies of repentance, the graces
of pardon, and the blood of the slain lamb, even from the
fall of Adam to this very day, and will do, till Christs second
coming.</p>
            <p>Adam fell by his folly and did not perform <hi>the covenant of one
little work,</hi> a work of a single abstinence; but he was restored by
faith in the seed of the woman; and of this righteousnesse Noah
was a preacher; and <hi>by faith</hi> Enoch was traslated, and <hi>by faith</hi> a
remnant was saved at the flood: and to Abraham <hi>this was imputed
for righteousnesse</hi> and to all the Patriarks, and to all the righteous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
judges, and holy Prophets, and Saints of the old Testament, even
while they were obliged (so far as the words of their covenant were
expressed) to the law of works, their pardon was sealed &amp; kept with
in the vail within the curtains of the sanctuary, and they saw it not
then, but they feel it ever since; and this was a great excellency of the
Divine mercy unto them: God had mercy on all mankinde before
Christs manifestation, even beyond the mercies of their covenant: &amp;
they were saved as we are, by the <hi>seed of the woman</hi> by <hi>God incarnate</hi>
by <hi>the lamb slain from the beginning of the world;</hi> not by works, for
we all failed of them; that is, not by an exact obedience, but <hi>by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
faith working by love,</hi> by sincere, hearty endeavours &amp; believing God
and relying upon his infinite mercy, revealed in part, and now ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
manifest by the great instrument and means of that mercy <hi>Jesus
Christ.</hi> So that here is pardon before we asked it; pardon before
Christs coming, pardon before redemption, and pardon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we sinned: what greater readinesse to forgive us can be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?
yes: there is one degree more yet; and that will prevent a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
in this.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. For God so pardoned us once, that we should need no
more pardon; he pardons us <hi>by turning every one of us away</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               <hi>from our iniquities;</hi> thats the purpose of Christ, that he might
safely pardon us before we sinned; and we might not sin upon the
confidence of pardon, he pardoned us not onely upon condition we
would sin no more, but he took away our sin, cured our cursed
inclinations, instructed our understanding, rectified our will, forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
us against temptations, and now every man whom he pardons
he also sanctifies, and <hi>he is born of God,</hi> and he <hi>must not, will not,
cannot sin,</hi> so long as <hi>the seed of God remains within him,</hi> so long as
his pardon continues. This is the consummation of pardon. For if
God had so pardoned us, as onely to take away our evils which are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
past, we should have needed a second Saviour, and a redeemer for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
month, and new pardons perpetually. But our blessed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
hath taken away our sin not onely the guilt of our old, but
our inclinations to new sins: he makes us like himself and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
us to live so, that we shall not need a second pardon, that is,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:53465:182"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> a second state of pardon: for we are but once baptized into Christs
death, and that death was one, and our redemption but one, and
our covenant the same, and as long as we continue within the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
we are still within the power and comprehensions of the first
pardon.</p>
            <p>6. And yet there is a necessity of having one degree of pardon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
more beyond all this. For although we do not abjure our cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and renounce Christ and extinguish the spirit, yet we resist
him, and we grieve him: and we go off from the holinesse of the
covenant, and return again, and very often step aside, and need
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> this great pardon to be perpetually applyed and renewed: and to
this purpose: that we may not have a possible need without a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
remedy, the Holy Jesus, <hi>the Author, and finisher of our faith</hi>
and pardon, sits in heaven in a perpetual advocation for us, that
this pardon once wrought may be for ever applyed to every emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
need, and every tumor of pride, and every broken heart, and
every disturbed conscience, and upon every true and sincere return
of a hearty repentance: And now <hi>upon this title</hi> no more degrees
can be added: it is already greater, and was before all our needs,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and was greater then the old covenaut, and beyond the revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and did in Adams youth antidate the Gospel, turning the <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
miseries</hi> by <hi>secret grace,</hi> into <hi>eternall glories.</hi> But now upon
other circumstances it is remarkable and excellent, and swels
like an hydropick cloud when it is fed with the breath of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
tide, till it fills the bosome of heaven, and descends in dews and
gentle showers, to water and refresh the earth.</p>
            <p>7. God is so ready to forgive that himself works our dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
towards it, and either must in some degree pardon us before
we are capable of pardon, by his grace making way for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> or else we can never hope for pardon. For unlesse God by
his preventing grace should first work the first part of our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
even without any dispositions of our own to receive it, we
could not desire a pardon, nor hope for it, nor work towards it,
nor ask it, nor receive it; This giving of <hi>preventing grace,</hi> is a
mercy of forgivenesse contrary to that severity by which some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
persons are given over to a reprobate sense; that is, a lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of men to themselves, so that they cannot pray effectually,
nor desire holily, nor repent truly, nor receive any of those mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
which God designed so plenteously, and the Son of God pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> so dearly for us. When God sends a plague of warre up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a land, in all the accounts of religion, and expectations of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
the way to obtain our peace is to leave our sins, for which
the warre was sent upon us, as the messenger of wrath: and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this, we are like to perish in the judgement. But then consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what a sad condition we are in, warre mends but few, but
spoils multitudes; it legitimates rapine, and authorizes murder,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:53465:183"/>
and these crimes must be ministred to by their lesser relatives, by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
covetousnesse, and anger, and pride, and revenge, and heats of
blood, and wilder liberty, and all the evil that can be supposed
to come from, or run to, such cursed causes of mischief. But then
if the punishment increases the sin, by what instrument can the
punishment be removed? How shall we be pardoned and eased,
when our remedies are converted into causes of the sicknesse, and
our antidotes are poison? Here there is a plain necessity of Gods
<hi>preventing grace;</hi> and <hi>if there be but a necessity of it, that is enough
to ascertain us we shall have it:</hi> But unlesse God should begin to
pardon us first, for nothing, and against our own dispositions,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
we see there is no help in us, nor for us. If we be not smitten
we are undone, if we are smitten we perish: and as young Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marchus
said of his Love, when he was made master of his wish;
<hi>Salvus sum quia pereo, si non peream plane inteream,</hi> we may say of
some of Gods judgements: We perish when we are safe, because
our sins are not smitten, and if they be, then we are worse undone;
because we grow worse for being miserable; but we can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
onely by a free mercy; for <hi>pardon is the way to pardon:</hi>
and when God gives us our peny, then we can work for another,
and a gift is the way to a grace, and all that we can do towards <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
it, is but to take it in Gods method; and this must needs be a great
forwardnesse of forgivenesse, when Gods mercy gives <hi>the pardon,</hi>
and <hi>the way</hi> to finde it, and <hi>the hand</hi> to receive it, and <hi>the eye</hi> to
search it, and <hi>the heart</hi> to desire it; being busie and effective as
Elijah's fire, which intending to convert the sacrifice into its own
more spirituall nature of flames and purified substances; stood in
the neighbourhood of the fuell, and called forth all its enemies,
and licked up the hindering moisture, and the water of the trench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
and made the Altar send forth a phantastick smoke before the
sacrifice was enkindled: So is the preventing grace of God, it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
does all the work of our souls, and makes its own way, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites
it self, and prepares its own lodging, and makes its own
entertainment, it gives us precepts and makes us able to keep
them; it enables our faculties and excites our desires, it provokes
us to pray, and sanctifies our heart in prayer, and makes our
prayer go forth to act, and the act does make the desire valid,
and the desire does make the act certain, and persevering; and
both of them are the works of God: for more is received into
the soul from without the soul, then does proceed from within
the soul: It is more for the soul to be moved and disposed, then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
to work when that is done: as the passage from death to life is
greater then from life to action, especially since the action is owing
to that cause that put in the first principle of life.</p>
            <p>These are the great degrees of Gods forwardnesse and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to forgive, for the expression of which no language is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:53465:183"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> but Gods own words describing mercy in all those dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
which can signifie to us its greatnesse and infinity. His mercy
<hi>is great,</hi> his mercies <hi>are many,</hi> his <hi>mercy reacheth unto the heavens,</hi>
it <hi>fils heaven and earth,</hi> it is <hi>above all his works, it endureth for
ever, God pitieth as a Father doth his children;</hi> nay he is our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the same also is <hi>the Father of mercy,</hi> and <hi>the God of all
comfort:</hi> So that mercy and we have the same relation; and well
it may be so, for we live and die together; for as to man onely,
God shews the mercy of forgivenesse, so if God takes away his
mercy, man shall be no more, no more capable of felicity, or of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> any thing that is perfective of his condition, or his person. But
as God preserves man by his mercy, so his mercy hath all its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
upon man, and returns to its own centre and incircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
and infinity, unlesse it issues forth upon us. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
besides the former great lines of the mercy of forgivenesse,
there is another chain, which but to produce and tell its links, is
to open a cabinet of Jewels, where every stone is as bright as a
star, and every star is great as the Sun, and shines for ever, unlesse
we shut our eyes, or draw the vail of obstinate and finall sins.</p>
            <p>1. God is long-suffering, that is, long before he be angry, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> yet <hi>God is provoked every day,</hi> by the obstinacy of the Jews, and the
folly of the Heathens, and the rudenesse and infidelity of the Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans,
and the negligence and vices of Christians; and he that can
behold no impurity is received in all places with perfumes of mush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romes,
and <hi>garments spotted with the flesh,</hi> and stained souls, and
the actions and issues of misbelief, and an evil conscience, and with
accursed sins that he hates, upon pretence of religion which he
loves; and he is made a party against himself by our voluntary
mistakes, and men continue ten yeers, and 20. and 30. and 50. in
a course of sinning, and they grow old with the vices of their
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> youth; and yet God forbears to kill them, and to consigne them
over to an eternity of horrid pains, still expecting that they should
repent and be saved.</p>
            <p>2. Besides this long-sufferance and for-bearing with an unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
patience, God also excuses a sinner oftentimes and takes a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
thing for an excuse, so far as to move him to intermediall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
first; and from thence to a finall pardon. He passes by the
sins of our youth with a huge easinesse to pardon, if he be intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and reconciled by the effective repentance of a vigorous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood;
he takes ignorance for an excuse, and in every degree of its
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> being inevitable, or innocent in its proper cause, it is also inculpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and innocent in its proper effects, though in their own natures
criminal. <hi>But I found mercy of the Lord because I did it in ignorance,</hi>
saith S. Paul; he pities our infirmities and strikes off much of the
account upon that stock; the violence of a temptation and rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesnesse
of its motion, the perpetuity of its sollicitation, the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinesse
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:53465:184"/>
of a mans spirit, the state of sicknesse, the necessity of secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
affairs, the publike customs of a people have all of them a power
of pleading and prevailing towards some degrees of pardon and
diminution before the throne of God.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. When God perceives himself forced to strike, yet then he
takes off his hand and repents him of the evil; It is as if it were
against him, that any of his creatures should fall under the strokes
of an exterminating fury.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. When he is forced to proceed, he yet makes an end before
he hath half done; and is as glad of a pretence to pardon us, or to
strike lesse, as if he himself had the deliverance and not we<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
Ahab had but humbled himself at the word of the Lord, God was
glad of it and went with the message to the Prophet <hi>himself,</hi> saying,
<hi>Seest thou not how Ahab humbles himself?</hi> What was the event of it?
<hi>I will not bring the evil in his dayes,</hi> but in his sons dayes the evil
shall come upon his house.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5 God forgets our sin and puts it out of his remembrance, that
is, he makes it as though it had never been; he makes penitence to
be as pure as innocence to all the effects of pardon and glory: the
memory of the sins shall not be upon record, to be used to any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
act of disadvantage, and never shall return unlesse we force <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
them out of their secret places by ingratitude and a new state of
sinning.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 6. God sometimes gives pardon beyond all his revelations
and declared will, and provides suppletories of repentance, even
then when he cuts a man off from the time of repentance, accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a temporal death instead of an eternal: that although the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
anger might interrupt the growing of the fruits, yet in some
cases, and to some persons, the death and the very cutting off shall
go no further, but be instead of explicite and long repentances.
Thus it happened to Uzzah, who was smitten for his zeal, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
died in severity for prevaricating the letter, by earnestnesse of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
to serve the whole religion. Thus it was also in the case of the
Corinthians that died a temporal death for their undecent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
in receiving the holy Sacrament. Saint Paul who used it
for an argument to threaten them into reverence, went no further,
nor pressed the argument to a sadder issue then to die temporally.</p>
            <p>But these suppletories are but seldom, and they are also great
troubles, and ever without comfort, and dispensed irregularly, and
that not in the case of habituall sins that we know of, or very
great sins, but in single actions, or instances of a lesse malignity; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
and they are not to be relied upon, because there is no rule concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them; but when they do happen they magnifie the infinitenesse
of Gods mercy which is commensurate to all our needs, and is not
to be circumscribed by the limits of his own revelations.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> 7. God pardons the greatest sinners, and hath left them upon
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:53465:184"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> record: and there is no instance in Scripture of the Divine for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenesse,
but in such instances, the misery of which was a fit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
to speak aloud the glories of Gods mercies, and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and readinesse to forgive: Such were S. Paul a persecutor,
and S. Peter that forswore his Master, Mary Magdalene, with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Devils, the thief upon the crosse, Manasses an Idolater, David
a murderer and adulterer, the Corinthian for incest, the children of
Israel for ten times rebelling against the Lord in the wildernesse,
with murmuring, and infidelity, and rebellion, and schisme, and a
golden calf, and open disobedience; and above all, I shall instance
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> in the Pharisees among the Jews, who had sinned against the Holy
Ghost, as our Blessed Saviour intimates, and tels the particular, viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
in saying that the Spirit of God by which Christ did work was an
evil spirit; and afterward they crucified Christ, so that two of the
Persons of the most Holy Trinity were openly and solemnly defied,
and God had sent out a decree that they should be cut off; yet 40.
yeers time (after all this) was left for their repentance, and they
were called upon by arguments more perswasive and more excel
lent in that 40. yeers, then all the Nation had heard from their Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phets,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> even from <hi>Samuel</hi> to <hi>Zecharias:</hi> And Jonas thought he had
reason on his side, to refuse to go to threaten Nineveh; he knew
Gods tendernesse in destroying his creatures, and he should be
thought to be but a false Prophet; and so it came to passe accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his belief.<note place="margin">Jonah 4. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Jonah prayed unto the Lord and said, I pra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Miscrator &amp; misericors Deus. The Lord,

            </p>
            <p>You see the largenesse of this treasure; but we can see no end,
for we have not yet looked upon the rare arts of conversion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> nor
that God leaves the naturall habit of vertues, even after the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
is interrupted; nor his working extraregular miracles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the sufficiencie of Moses and the Prophets, and the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
and thousands more which we cannot consider now.</p>
            <p>But this we can, when God sent an Angel to pour plagues upon
the earth, there were in their hands <hi>Phialae aureae, golden phials:</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> for the death of men <hi>is precious</hi> and <hi>costly,</hi> and it is an expence
that God delights not in; but they were <hi>Phials,</hi> that is, such vessels
as out of them no great evil could come at once; but it comes out
with difficulty, sobbing and troubled as it passes forth; it comes
thorow a narrow neck, and the parts of it croud at the port to
get forth, and are stifled by each others neighbourhood; and all
strive to get out, but few can passe, as if God did nothing but threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:53465:185"/>
and draw his judgements to the mouth of the <hi>Phial</hi> with a full <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
body, and there made it stop it self.</p>
            <p>The result of this consideration is, that as we fear the Divine
judgements, so that we adore and love his goodnesse, and let the
golden chains of the Divine mercy tie us to a noble prosecution of
our duty and the interests of religion; For he is the worst of men
whom Kindnesse cannot soften, nor endearments oblige, whom
gratitude cannot tie faster then the bands of life and death: He is
an ill natur'd sinner if he will not comply with the sweetnesses of
heaven, and be civill to his Angel guardian, or observant of his
<hi>Patron God,</hi> who made him, and feeds him, and keeps all his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
and takes care of him, and endures his follies, and waits
on him more tenderly then a Nurse, more diligently then a Client,
who hath greater care of him then his father, and whose bowels
yern over him with more compassion then a mother; who is boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
beyond our needs, and mercifull beyond our hopes, and makes
capacities in us to receive more. <hi>Fear</hi> is stronger then <hi>death,</hi> and
<hi>Love</hi> is more prevalent then <hi>Fear,</hi> and <hi>kindnesse</hi> is the greatest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearment
of <hi>Love;</hi> and yet to an ingenuous person <hi>gratitude</hi> is
greater then all these, and obliges to a solemn duty when <hi>love</hi> fails,
and <hi>fear</hi> is dull and unactive, and <hi>death</hi> it self is despised: but the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
man who is hardened against kindnesse, and whose duty is not made
alive with gratitude, must be used like a slave, and driven like an
ox, and inticed with goads and whips, but must never enter into
the inheritance of sons: <hi>Let us take heed:</hi> for Mercy is like a rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowe,
which God set in the clouds to remember mankinde; it
shines here as long as it is not hindered; but we must never look
for it after it is night, and it shines not in the other world; if we
refuse mercy here, we shall have justice to eternity.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

of Heaven: and we are fallen from our privilege, and are retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the condition, of beast, and buildings, and common <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
things: And we see Temples defiled unto the ground, and they
die by Sacrilege: and great Empires die by their own plenty and
ease, full humors, and factious Subjects: and huge buildings fall by
their own weight, and the violence of many winters eating and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming

die like the meanest of their Servants: and every thing findes a grave

fate and period of flesh, and last longer then a flower: But if all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
these can hold us and tie us to conditions, then we must lay our
heads down upon a turfe and entertain creeping things in the cells
and little chambers of our eyes, and dwell with worms till time and
death shall be no more. <hi>We must needs die]</hi> That's our sentence.
But that's not all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain]</hi>
Stay. 1. We are as water, weak and of no consistence, alwaies
descending, abiding in no certain place, unlesse where we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
with violence: and every little breath of winde makes
us rough and tempestuous, and troubles our faces: every trifling <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
accident discomposes us; and as the face of the waters wafting in
a storm so wrinkles it self that it makes upon its fore-head fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
deep and hollow like a grave: so do our great and little cares
and trifles, first make the wrinkles of old age, and then they dig
a grave for us: And there is in nature nothing so contemptible,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:53465:187"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> but it may meet with us in such circumstances, that it may be too
hard for us in our weaknesses: and the sting of a Bee is a weapon
sharp enough to pierce the finger of a childe, or the lip of a man:
and those creatures which nature hath left without weapons, yet
they are armed sufficiently to vex those parts of men which are left
defenselesse and obnoxious to a sun beam, to the roughnesse of a
sower grape, to the unevennesse of a gravel-stone, to the dust of a
wheel, or the unwholesome breath of a star looking awry upon a
sinner.</p>
               <p>2. But besides the weaknesses and natural decayings of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> if chances and contingencies be innumerable, then no man
can reckon our dangers, and the praeternatural causes of our deaths.
So that he is a vain person whose hopes of life are too confidently
increased by reason of his health: and he is too unreasonably ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous,
who thinks his hopes at an end when he dwels in sickness.
For men die without rule; and with, and without occasions; and
no man suspecting or foreseeing any of deaths addresses, and no
man in his whole condition is weaker then another. A man in a
long Consumption is fallen under one of the solemnities and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
to death: but at the same instant the most healthful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> is as neer death, upon a more fatal, and a more sudden, but a
lesse discerned cause. There are but few persons upon whose
foreheads every man can read the sentence of death written in the
lines of a lingring sicknesse, but they (sometimes) hear the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
bell ring for stronger men, even long before their own knell
calls at the house of their mother to open her womb and make
a bed for them. No man is surer of to morrow then the weakest
of his brethren: and when <hi>Lepidus</hi> and <hi>Ausidius</hi> stumbled at the thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shold
of the Senate and fell down and died, the blow came from
heaven in a cloud but it struck more suddenly then upon the poor
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> slave that made sport upon the Theatre with a praemeditated and
foredescribed death: <hi>Quod quisque vitet, nunquam homini satis cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
est in horas.</hi> There are sicknesses that walk in darknesse, and
there are exterminating Angels that fly wrapt up in the curtains of
immateriality and an uncommunicating nature; whom we cannot
see, but we feel their force and sink under their sword, and from
heaven the vail descends that wraps our heads in the fatal sentence.
There is no age of man but it hath proper to it self some posterns
and outlets for death, besides those infinite and open ports out of
which myriads of men and women every day passe into the dark
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and the land of forgetfulnesse. <hi>Infancie</hi> hath life but <hi>in effigie,</hi> or
like a spark dwelling in a pile of wood: the candle is so newly light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that every little shaking of the taper, and every ruder breath
of air, puts it out, and it dies. <hi>Childhood</hi> is so tender, and yet so
unwary; so soft to all the impressions of chance, and yet so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to run into them, that God knew there could be no security
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:53465:188"/>
without the care and vigilance of an Angel-keeper: and the eyes of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
Parents and the arms of Nurses, the provisions of art, and all the
effects of Humane love and Providence are not sufficient to keep
one childe from horrid mischiefs, from strange and early calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and deaths, unlesse a messenger be sent from heaven to stand
sentinel, and watch the very playings and the sleepings, the eatings
and the drinkings of the children; and it is a long time before na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
makes them capable of help: for there are many deaths, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
many diseases to which poor babes are exposed; but they have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
but very few capacities of physick; to shew, that infancy is as liable
to death as old age, and equally exposed to danger, and equally
uncapable of a remedy: with this onely difference, that old age hath
diseases incurable by nature, and the diseases of child-hood
are incurable by art; and both the states are the next heirs of
death.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. But all the middle way <hi>the case is altered.</hi> Nature is strong,
and art is apt to give ease and remedy: but still, there is no secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
and there, the case is not altered. 1 For there are so many
diseases in men that are not understood. 2 So many new ones eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
year. 3 The old ones are so changed in circumstance, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled
with so many collateral complications. 4 The Symptoms <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
are oftentimes so alike. 5 Sometimes so hidden and fallacious.
6 Somtimes none at all (as in the most sudden and the most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
imposthumations.) 7 And then, the diseases in the inward
parts of the body, are oftentimes such, to which no application
can be made. 8 They are so far off, that the effects of all medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
can no otherwise come to them, then the effect and juices
of all meats, that is, not till after two or three alterations, and
decoctions, which change the very species of the medicament.
9 And after all this, very many principles in the art of Physick
are so uncertain, that after they have been believed seven or eight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
and that upon them much of the practise hath been establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
they come to be considered by a witty man, and others establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in their stead; by which, men must practise, and by which
three or four generations of men more (as happens) must live or
die. 10. And all this while the men are sick, and they take things
that certainly make them sicker for the present, and very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
restore health for the future: that it may appear of what a
large extent is humane calamity; when Gods providence hath not
onely made it weak and miserable upon the certain stock of a vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
nature, and upon the accidents of an infinite contingency; but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
even from the remedies which are appointed, our dangers and our
troubles are certainly increased: so that we may well be likened
to water; our nature is no stronger, our aboad no more certain;
If the sluces be opened, <hi>it falls away and runneth apace;</hi> if its cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
be stopped, it swells and grows troublesome, and spils over
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:53465:188"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> with a greater diffusion; If it be made to stand still it putrefies:
and all this we do. For,</p>
               <p>4. In all the processe of our health we are running to our grave:
we open our own sluces by vitiousnesse, and unworthy actions;
we pour in drink, and let out life; we increase diseases and know
not how to bear them; we strangle our selves with our own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance;
we suffer the feavers and the inflammations of lust, and
we quench our souls with drunkennesse; we bury our understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in loads of meat and surfets: and then we lie down upon our
beds and roar with pain and disquietnesse of our souls: Nay, we
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> kill one anothers souls and bodies with violence and folly, with the
effects of pride and uncharitablenesse; we live and die like fools,
and bring a <hi>new mortality</hi> upon our selves; wars and vexatious
cares, and private duels, and publike disorders, and every thing that
is unreasonable, and every thing that is violent: so that now we
may adde this fourth gate to the grave: Besides <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Chance,</hi>
and <hi>the mistakes of art,</hi> men die with their <hi>own sins,</hi> and then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the grave in haste and passion, and pull the heavy stone of
the monument upon their own heads. And thus we make our
selves like water spilt on the ground: we throw away our lives as
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> if they were unprofitable, (and indeed most men make them so) we
let our years slip through our fingers like water; and nothing is to
be seen, but like a showr of tears upon a spot of ground; there is a
grave digged, and a solemn mourning, and a great talk in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood,
and when the dayes are finished, they shall be, and they
shall be remembred no more: And that's like water too, when it
is spilt, <hi>it cannot be gathered up again.</hi>
There is no redemption from the grave.
<q>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Men live in their course and by turns: their light burns a while,
and then it burns blew and faint, and men go to converse with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and then they reach the taper to another; and as the hours of
yesterday can never return again, so neither can the man whose
hours they were, and who lived them over once, he shall never come
to live them again, and live them better. When <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and the
widows son of Naim, and <hi>Tabitha,</hi> and the Saints that appeared in
Jerusalem at the resurrection of our blessed Lord, arose; they came
into this world, some as strangers onely to make a visit, and all of
them to manifest a glory: but none came upon the stock of a new
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> life, or entred upon the stage as at first, or to perform the course
of a new nature: and therefore it is observable that we never
read of any wicked person that was raised from the dead: <hi>Dives</hi>
would fain have returned to his brothers house; but neither he, nor
any from him could be sent: but all the rest in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(one onely excepted) were expressed to have been holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:53465:189"/>
or else by their age were declared innocent. <hi>Lazarus</hi> was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
beloved of Christ: those souls that appeared at the resurrection
were the souls of Saints: <hi>Tabitha</hi> raised by Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
and a holy Christian: and the maiden of twelve years old,
raised by our blessed Saviour, had not entred into the regions of
choice and sinfulnesse: and the onely exception of the widows son,
is indeed none at all; for in it the Scripture is wholly silent; and
therefore it is very probable that the same processe was used, God
in all other instances having chosen to exemplifie his miracles of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
nature to purposes of the Spirit, and in spirituall capacities. So
that although the Lord of nature did break the bands of nature in
some instances, to manifest his glory to succeeding, great and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
failing purposes; yet (besides that this shall be no more) it was
also instanced in such persons who were holy and innocent, and
within the verge and comprehensions of the eternall mercy. We
never read that a wicked person felt such a miracle, or was raised
from the grave to try the second time for a Crown; but where he
fell there he lay down dead, and saw the light no more.</p>
               <p>This consideration I intend to you as a severe Monitor, and an
advice of carefulnesse, that you order your affairs so that you may
be partakers of the first resurrection, that is, from sin to grace,
from the death of vitious habits, to the vigour, life and efficacy of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
an habituall righteousnesse: For (as it hapned to those persons in
the New Testament now mentioned, to them (I say) in the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
sense) <hi>Blessed are they that have part in the first resurrection, upon
them the second death shall have no power:</hi> meaning that they who
by the power of Christ and his holy Spirit were raised to life again,
were holy and blessed souls, and such who were written in the book
of God; and that this grace happened to no wicked and vitious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
so it is most true in the spirituall and intended sense: You one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that serve God in a holy life; you who are not dead in trespasses <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
and sins; you who serve God with an early diligence and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied
industry, and a holy religion, you, and you onely shall come
to life eternall, you onely shall be called from death to life; the rest
of mankind shall never live again but passe from death to death;
from one death to another, to a worse; from the death of the body,
to the eternall death of body and soul: and therefore in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
Creed there is no mention made of the resurrection of wicked
persons: but of <hi>the resurrection of the body to everlasting life.</hi> The
wicked indeed shall be haled forth from their graves, from their
everlasting prisons, where in chains of darknesse they are kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
the judgement of the great day: But this therefore cannot be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>in sensu favoris,</hi> a resurrection, but the solennities of the eternall
death; It is nothing but a new capacity of dying again; such a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as cannot signifie rest; but where death means nothing but an
intolerable and never ceasing calamity: and therefore these words
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:53465:189"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of my Text are otherwise to be understood of the wicked, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
of the godly: The wicked are spilt like water and shall never
be gathered up again; no not in the gatherings of eternity; They
shall be put into vessels of wrath and set upon the flames of hell;
but that is not <hi>a gathering,</hi> but a scattering from the face and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of God. But the godly also come under the sense of these
words. They descend into their graves, and shall no more be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
among the living; they have no concernment in all that is done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Sun. <hi>Agamemnon</hi> hath no more to do with the Turks armies
invading and possessing that part of Greece where he reigned, then
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> had the Hippocentaur, who never had a beeing: and <hi>Cicero</hi> hath
no more interest in the present evils of Christendome, then we
have to do with his boasted discovery of <hi>Catilines</hi> conspiracie.
What is it to me that Rome was taken by the Gauls? and what
is it now to <hi>Camillus</hi> if different religions be tolerated amongst
us? These things that now happen concern the living, and they
are made the scenes of our duty or danger respectively: and when
our wives are dead and sleep in charnel houses, they are not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
when we laugh loudly at the songs sung at the next marriage
feast; nor do they envy when another snatches away the gleanings
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of their husbands passion.</p>
               <p>It is true they envy not, and they lie in a bosome where there
can be no murmure, and they that are consigned to Kingdoms, and
to the feast of the marriage-supper of the Lamb, the glorious and
eternall Bride-groom of holy souls, they cannot think our marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
here, our lighter laughings, and vain rejoycings considerable
as to them. And yet <hi>there is a relation continued still. Aristotle</hi> said,
that to affirm the dead take no thought for the good of the living
is a disparagement to the laws of that friendship which in their
state of separation they cannot be tempted to rescind. And the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Church hath taught in generall that they pray for us, they recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
to God the state of all their Relatives, in the union of the
intercession that our blessed Lord makes for them and us: and Saint
<hi>Ambrose</hi> gave some things in charge to his dying brother <hi>Satyrus,</hi>
that he should do for him in the other world: he gave it him (I say)
when he was dying, not when he was dead. And certain it is that
though our dead friends affection to us is not to be estimated accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to our low conceptions, yet it is not lesse, but much more then
ever it was; it is greater in degree, and of another kind.</p>
               <p>But then we should do well also to remember, that in this world
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> we are something besides flesh and blood; that we may not without
violent necessities run into new relations, but preserve the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
we bear to our dead when they were alive: We must not so
live as if they were perished, but so as pressing forward to the most
intimate participation of the communion of Saints. And we also
have some wayes to expresse this relation, and to bear a part in this
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:53465:190"/>
communion, by actions of intercourse with them, and yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
to our state: such as are strictly performing the will of the
dead, providing for, and tenderly and wisely educating their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
paying their debts, imitating their good example, preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their memories privately, and publikely keeping their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials,
and desiring of God with hearty and constant prayer that
God would give them a joyfull resurrection, and a mercifull judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
(for so S. <hi>Paul</hi> prayed in behalf of <hi>Onesiphorus)</hi> that <hi>God
would shew them</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>mercy in that day,</hi> that fearfull, and yet much to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
be desired day, in which the most righteous person hath need of
much mercy and pity, and shall find it. Now these instances of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
shew that the relation remains still; and though the Relict of a
man or woman hath liberty to contract new relations; yet I do
not finde they have liberty to cast off the old; as if there were no
such thing as immortality of souls. Remember that we shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
together again: let us therefore never do any thing of refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to them which we shall be ashamed of in the day when all se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
shall be discovered, and that we shall meet again in the presence
of God: In the mean time, God watcheth concerning all their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
and he will in his time both discover and recompense. For
though, as to us, they are like water spilt yet to God, they are as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
water fallen into the sea, safe and united in his comprehension, and
inclosures.</p>
               <p>But we are not yet passed the consideration of the sentence:
This descending to the grave is the lot of all men. <hi>[neither doth
God respect the person of any man]</hi> The rich is not protected for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
nor the poor for pity, the old man is not reverenced for his
age, nor the infant regarded for his tendernesse; youth and beauty,
learning and prudence, wit and strength lie down equally in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shonours
of the grave. All men, and all natures, and all persons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
the addresses and solennities of death, and strive to preserve a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
miserable and an unpleasant life; and yet they all sink down and die.
For so have I seen the pillars of a building assisted with artificiall
props bending under the pressure of a roof, and pertinaciously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
the infallible and prepared ruine,
<q>
                     <l>Donec certa dies omni compage solutâ</l>
                     <l>Ipsum cum rebus subruat auxilium,</l>
                  </q>
till the determined day comes, and then the burden sunk upon the
pillars, and disordered the aids and auxiliary rafters into a common
ruine and a ruder grave: so are the desires and weak arts of man,
with little aids and assistances of care and physick we strive to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
our decaying bodies, and to put off the evil day; but quickly
that day will come, and then neither Angels nor men can rescue
us from our grave; but the roof sinks down upon the walls, and
the walls descend to the foundation; and the beauty of the face,
and the dishonours of the belly, the discerning head and the servile
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:53465:190"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> feet, the thinking heart, and the working hand, the eyes and the
guts together shall be crush'd into the confusion of a heap, and
dwell with creatures of an equivocall production, with worms
and serpents, the sons and daughters of our own bones, in a house
of durt and darknesse.</p>
               <p>Let not us think to be excepted or deferred. If beauty, or wit,
or youth, or Noblenesse, or wealth, or vertue could have been
a defence, and an excuse from the grave, we had not met here to
day to mourn upon the hearse of an excellent Lady; and God one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
knows for which of us next the mourners shall go about the

               <p>We have lived so many years; and every day and every minute
we make an escape from those thousands of dangers and deaths that
encompasse us round about: and such escapings we must reckon to
be an extraordinary fortune, and therefore that it cannot last long.
Vain are the thoughts of Man, who when he is young or health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
thinks he hath a long threed of life to run over, and that it is
violent and strange for young persons to die; and naturall and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> proper onely for the aged. It is as naturall for a man to die by
drowning as by a fever: And what greater violence or more unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
thing is it, that the horse threw his Rider into the river, then
that a drunken meeting cast him into a fever; and the strengths of
youth are as soon broken by the strong sicknesses of youth, and
the stronger intemperance, as the weaknesse of old age by a
cough, or an asthma, or a continuall rheume: Nay, it is <hi>more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall</hi>
for young Men and Women to die, then for old; because
that is <hi>more naturall</hi> which hath more naturall causes; and that
is more naturall which is most common: but to die with age is an
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> extreme rare thing; and there are more persons carried forth to
buriall before the five and thirtieth year of their age, then after it.
And therefore let no vain confidence make you hope for long life.
If you have lived but little, and are still in youth, remember that
now you are in your biggest throng of dangers both of body and
soul; and the proper sins of youth to which they rush infinitely
and without consideration, are also the proper and immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
of death. But if you be old you have escaped long and
wonderfully, and the time of your escaping is out: you must not
for ever think to live upon wonders, or that God will work mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to satisfie your longing follies, and unreasonable desires of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
longer to sin and to the world. Go home and think to die, and
what you would choose to be doing when you die, that do daily:
for you will all come to that passe, to rejoyce that you did so, or
wish that you had: that will be the condition of every one of us;
for <hi>God regardeth no mans person.</hi>

Well! but all this you will think is but a sad story. What? we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
must die, and go to darknesse and dishonour; and we must die
quickly, and we must quit all our delights, and all our sins, or do
worse, infinitely worse; and this is the condition of us all from
which none can be excepted; every man shall be spilt and fall into
the ground, and <hi>be gathered no more.</hi> Is there no comfort after
all this? <hi>shall we go from hence, and be no more seen,</hi> and have no

more desirable then all the riches and all the pleasures, and all
the vanities, and all the Kingdoms of this world.</p>
               <p>I will not venture to determine what are the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the aboad of Holy Souls in their separate dwellings;
and yet possibly that might be easier then to tell what or how the
soul is and works in this world, where it is in the body <hi>tanquam</hi>

                  <hi>in alienâ domo,</hi> as in a prison, in fetters and restraints: for here
the soul is discomposed and hindered, it is not as it shall be, as
it ought to be, as it was intended to be; it is not permitted to its own
freedom, and proper operation; so that all that we can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
of it here, is that it is so incommodated with a troubled and
abated instrument, that the <hi>object</hi> we are to consider cannot be
offered to us in a right line, in just and equal propositions or if
it could, yet because we are to understand the soul by the soul, it
becomes not onely a troubled and <hi>abused object,</hi> but a <hi>crooked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument;</hi>
and we here can consider it, just as a weak eye can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

makes a refraction, and the storm doubles the refraction, and
the water of the eye doubles the species, and there is nothing right
in the thing, the object is out of its just place, and the medium is
troubled, and the organ is impotent: <hi>At cum exierit &amp; in liberum
coelum quasi in domum suam venerit,</hi> when the soul is entred into
her own house, into the free regions of the rest and the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of heavenly joyes, then its operations are more spiritual,
proper, and proportioned to its being; and though we cannot
see at such a distance, yet the objects is more fitted if we had a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> understanding; it is in it self in a more excellent and free
condition.</p>
               <p>Certain it is, that the body does hinder many actions of the soul:
it is an imperfect body, and a diseased brain, or a violent passion
that makes fools: no man hath a foolish soul; and the reasonings
of men have infinite difference and degrees by reason of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
constitution. Among beasts which have no reason, there is a
greater likenesse then between men, who have: &amp; as by faces it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier
to know a man from a man, then a sparrow from a sparrow, or
a squirrel from a squirrel: so the difference is very great in our
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> souls; which difference because it is not originally in the soul (and
indeed cannot be in simple and spiritual substances of the same spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
or kind) it must needs drive wholly from the body, from its
accidents and circumstances: from whence it follows, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the body casts fetters and restraints, hindrances and impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon the soul, that the soul is much freer in the state of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration;
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:53465:192"/>
and if it hath any any act of life, it is much more noble and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
expedite.</p>
               <p>That the soul is alive after our death, S. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms <hi>[Christ
died for us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Thes. 5. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>that whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with
him.]</hi> Now it were strange that we should be alive, and live with
<hi>Christ,</hi> and yet do no act of life: the body when it is asleep does
many: and if the soul does none, the principle is lesse active then
the instrument; but if it does any act at all in separation, it must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
be an act or effect of understanding; there is nothing else
it can do. But this it can. For it is but a weak and an unlearned
proposition to say, That the Soul can do nothing of it self, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
without the phantasmes and provisions of the body. For 1.
In this life the soul hath one principle clearly separate, abstracted &amp;
immaterial, I mean, <hi>the Spirit of grace,</hi> which is a principle of life and
action and in many instances does not all at communicate with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as in the infusion, superinduction and the creation of spiritual
graces. 2. As nutrition, generation, eating and drinking are actions
proper to the body and its state: so, extasies, visions, raptures, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitive
knowledge, and consideration of its self, acts of volition,
and reflex acts of understanding are proper to the soul. 3. And
therefore it is observable that S. <hi>Paul</hi> said that <hi>he knew not whether</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
                  <hi>his visions and raptures were in or out of the body:</hi> for by that we
see his judgement of the thing, that one was as likely as the other,
neither of them impossible or unreasonable; and therefore that the
soul is as capable of action alone as in conjunction. 4. If in the state
of blessednesse there are some actions of the soul which doe
not passe through the body, such as contemplation of God,
and conversing with spirits, and receiving those influences and
rare immissions which coming from the Holy and mysterious Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
make up the crown of glory; it follows that the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the bodies ministery is but during the state of this life, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
as long as it converses with fire and water, and lives with corn
and flesh, and is fed by the satisfaction of material appetits;
which necessity and manner of conversation when it ceases, it
can be no longer necessary for the soul to be served by phantasmes
and material representations. 5. And therefore when the body
shall be re-united, it shall be so ordered that then the body shall
confesse it gives not any thing, but receives all its being and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
its manner and abode from the soul, and that then it comes
not to serve a necessity, but to partake a glory. For as the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the soul in this life, begin in the body, and by it the object is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
transmitted to the soul: so then they shall begin in the soul and pass
to the body; and as <hi>the operations of the soul</hi> by reason of its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence
on the body are <hi>animal, natural and material:</hi> so in the
resurrection, <hi>the body</hi> shall be <hi>spiritual</hi> by reason of the preeminence,
influence, and prime operation of the soul. Now between these
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:53465:192"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> two states, stands the state of separation, in which the operations
of the soul are of a middle nature, that is, not so spirituall as in the
resurrection, and not so animal and natural as in the state of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction.</p>
               <p>To all which I adde this consideration. That our souls have the
same condition that Christs soul had in the state of separation;
because he took on him all our nature, and all our condition;
and it is certain, Christs soul in the three dayes of his separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
did exercise acts of life, of joy and triumph, and did
not sleep, but visited the souls of the Fathers, trampled upon the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> pride of Devils, and satisfied those longing souls which were <hi>Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of hope;</hi> and from all this we may conclude that the souls of all
the servants of Christ are alive, and therfore do the actions of life,
and proper to their state; and therefore it is highly probable that the
soul works clearer, and understands brighter, and discourses wiser,
and rejoyces louder, and loves noblier, and desires purer, and hopes
stronger then it can do here.</p>
               <p>But if these arguments should fail, yet the felicity of Gods Saints
cannot fail. For suppose, the body to be a necessary instrument but
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> out of tune, and discomposed by sin and anger, by accident and
chance, by defect and imperfections, yet, that it is better then none
at all; and that if the soul works imperfectly with an imperfect bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
that then she works not at all when she hath none; and suppose
also that the soul should be as much without sense or perception in
death, as it is in a deep sleep which is the image and shadow of death,
yet then God devises other means that his banished be not expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
from him. For,</p>
               <p>2. God will restore the soul to the body, and raise the body
to such a perfection, that it shall be an Organ fitt to praise him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> it shall be made spiritual to minister to the soul, when the soul
is turned into a Spirit, then the soul shall be brought forth by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
from her incomparable and easie bed, from her rest in Christs
Holy Bosome, and be made perfect in her being, and in all her
operations; And this shall first appear by that perfection which
the soul shall receive as instrumental to the last judgement: for
then she shall see clearly all the Records of this world, all the
Register of her own memory. For all that we did in this life, is laid
up in our memories: and though dust and forgetfulnesse be drawn
upon them, yet when God shall lift us from our dust, then shall
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> appear clearly all that we have done, written in the Tables of our
conscience, which is the souls memory. We see many times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
in many instances, that a great memory is hindered and put out,
and we thirty years after come to think of something that lay so
long under a curtain; we think of it suddenly and without a line
of deduction, or proper consequence: And all those famous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories,
of <hi>Simonides</hi> and <hi>Theodectes,</hi> of <hi>Hortensins</hi> and <hi>Seneca,</hi> of
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:53465:193"/>
                  <hi>Sceptius Metrodorus</hi> and <hi>Carneades,</hi> of <hi>Cyneas</hi> the Embassadour of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
                  <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> are onely the Records better kept, and lesse disturbed
by accident and desease. For even the memory of <hi>Herods</hi> son of
Athens, of <hi>Bathyllus</hi> and the dullest person now alive is so great,
and by God made so sure a record of all that ever he did, that assoon
as ever God shall but tune our instrument, and draw the curtains,
and but light up the candle of immortality, there we shal finde it all,
there we shall see all, and all the world shall see all; then we shall
be made fit to converse with God after the manner of Spirits, we
shall be like to Angels.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, although upon the perswasion of the former <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
discourse it be highly probable that the souls of Gods servants
do live in a state of present blessednesse; and in the exceeding
joyes of a certain expectation of the revelation of the day of the
Lord, and the coming of Jesus yet it will concern us onely to secure
our state by holy living, and leave the event to God; that (as
S. <hi>Paul</hi> said) whether present or absent, whether sleeping or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
whether perceiving or perceiving not, we may be accepted of
him: that when we are banished this world, and from the light of the
sun, we may not be expelled from God, and from the light of his
countenance, but that from our beds of sorrows, our souls may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
passe into the bosome of Christ, and from thence to his right hand
in the day of sentence: For we must all appear before the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
seat of Christ, &amp; then if we have done wel in the body, we shal
never be expelled from the beatifical presence of God, but be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticks
of his family, and heires of his Kingdom, and partakers of
his glory. <hi>Amen</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Have now done with my Text, but yet am to make you ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Sermon. I have told you the necessity and the state of death;
it may be too largely for such a sad story; I shal therefore now <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
with a better compendium teach you how to live by telling you a
plain narrative of a life, which if you imitate and write after the
copy, it will make, that death shall not be an evil, but a thing to be
desired, and to be reckoned amongst the purchases and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of your fortune. When <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> went to weep over <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
the grave of their brother, Christ met them there and preached
a Funeral Sermon, discoursing of the resurrection, and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the purposes of faith, and confession of Christ, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of God: We have no other, we can have no better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
to follow: and now that we are come to weep over the
grave of our Dear Sister, this rare personage, we cannot chuse
but have many vertues to learn, many to imitate, and some to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise.</p>
               <p>I chose, not to declare her extraction and genealogy. It was indeed
fair and Honorable; but having the blessing to be descended from
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:53465:193"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> worthy and Honoured Ancestors, and her self to be adopted and
ingraffed into a more Noble family, yet she felt such outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendages
to be none of hers, because not of her choice, but the
purchase of the vertues of others, which although they did ingage
her to do noble things, yet they would upbraid all degenerate and
lesse honourable lives then were those which began and increased
the honour of the families. She did not love her fortune for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
her noble; but thought it would be a dishonour to her if she
did not continue her Noblenesse and excellency of vertue fit to be
owned by persons relating to such Ancestors. It is fit for all us to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> honour the Noblenesse of a family: but it is also fit for them that are
Noble to despise it and to establish their honour upon the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of doing excellent things, and suffering in good causes, and
despising dishonourable actions, and in communicating good
things to others. For this is the rule in Nature: Those creatures are
most Honourable which have the greatest power and do the greatest
good: And accordingly my self have been a witnesse of it, how this
excellent Lady would by an act of humility, and Christian abstracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
strip her self of all that fair appendage of exteriour honour which
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> decked her person and her fortune; and desired to be owned by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what was her own, that she might onely be esteemed Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
according to that which is the honour of a Christian,
and a wise person.</p>
               <p>2. She had a strict and severe education, and it was one of Gods
graces and favours to her. For being the Heiresse of a great fortune,
and living amongst the throng of persons in the sight of vanities
and empty temptations, that is, in that part of the Kingdom where
greatnesse is too often expressed in great follies, and great vices, God
had provided a severe and angry education to chastise the forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of a young spirit, and a fair fortune; that she might for ever
be so far distant from a vice, that she might onely see it and loath
it, but never tast of it, so much as to be put to her choice whether
she would be vertuous or no. God intending to secure this soul to
himself, would not suffer the follies of the world to seize upon her
by way of too neer a trial, or busie temptation.</p>
               <p>3. She was married young; and besides her businesses of religion
seemed to be ordained in the providence of God to bring to this
Honourable family a part of a fair fortune, and to leave behinde her
a fairer issue worth ten thousand times her portion: and as if this had
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> been all the publick businesse of her life; when she had so far served
Gods ends, God in mercy would also serve hers, and take her
to an early blessednesse.</p>
               <p>4. In passing through which line of providence, she had the art
to secure her eternal interest, by turning her condition into duty &amp;

and rare affection, that hath been known in any example. I will not
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:53465:194"/>
give her so low a testimony, as to say onely that she was chast; She <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
was a person of that severity, modesty, and close religion (as to
that particular) that she was not capable of uncivil temptation; and
you might as well have suspected the sun to smell of the poppy
that he looks on, as that she could have been a person apt to be sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed
by the breath of a foul question.</p>
               <p>5. But that which I shall note in her, is that which I would have
exemplar to all Ladies, and to all women. She had a love so great
for her Lord, so intirely given up to a dear affection, that she thought
the same things and loved the same loves, and hated according to
the same enmities, and breathed in his soul, and lived in his presence,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
and languished in his absence: and all that she was or did, was onely
for and to her Dearest Lord,</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Si gaudet, si flet, si tacit, hunc loquitur.</l>

               <p>
                  <hi>Naevius est:</hi>—and although this was a great enamel to the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of her soul, yet it might in some degrees be also a reward to the
vertue of her Lord: For she would often discourse it to them that
conversed with her; that he would improve that interest
which he had in her affection to the advantages of God, and
of religion: and she would delight to say, that he called her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
to her devotions, he encouraged her good inclinations he
directed her piety, he invited her with good books: and then
she loved religion, which she saw was not onely pleasing to God,
and an act or state of duty, but pleasing to her Lord, and an act also
of affection and conjugal obedience; and what at first she loved the
more forwardly for his sake; in the using of religion left such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishes
upon her spirit, that she found in it amability enough, to make
her love it for its own. So God usually brings us to him by instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of nature and affections, and then incorporates us into his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,
by the more immediate relishes of Heaven, and the secret <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
things of the Spirit. He only was (under God) the light of her eyes,
and the cordiall of her spirits, and the guide of her actions, and the
measure of her affections, till her affections swelled up into a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and then it could go no higher, but was confederate with those
other duties which made her dear to God. Which rare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination
of duty and religion, I choose to expresse in the words
of <hi>Solomon:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>7.</note> 
                  <hi>She forsook not the guide of her youth, nor brake the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of her God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. As she was a rare wife: so she was an excellent Mother. For
in so tender a constitution of spirit as hers was, and in so great a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
kindnesse towards her children, there hath seldom been seen a
stricter and more curious care of their persons, their deportment,
their nature, their disposition, their learning and their customs:
And if ever kindnesse and care did contest, and make parties in her,
yet her care and her severity was ever victorious; and she knew
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:53465:194"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> not how to do an ill turn to their severer part, by her more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and forward kindnesse. And as her custome was, she turned
this also into love to her Lord. For she was not onely diligent to
have them bred nobly and religiously, but also was carefull and soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous,
that they should be taught to observe all the circumstances &amp;
inclinations, the desires and wishes of their Father; as thinking, that
vertue to have no good circumstances which was not dressed by
his copy, and ruled by his lines, and his affections: And her pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in the managing her children was so singular and rare, that
when ever you mean to blesse this family, and pray a hearty and a
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> profitable prayer for it, beg of God, that the children may have
those excellent things which she designed to them, and provided
for them in her heart and wishes, that they may live by her purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and may grow thither, whither she would fain have brought
them. All these were great parts of an excellent religion as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
her greatest temporal relations.</p>
               <p>7. But if we examine how she demeaned her self towards God,
there also you will finde her, not of a common, but of an exemplar
piety. She was a great reader of Scripture, confining her self to
great portions every day; which she read, not to the purposes
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of vanity, and impertinent curiosities, not to seem knowing, or to
become talking, not to expound and Rule, but to teach her all her
duty, to instruct her in the knowledge and love of God and of her
Neighbours; to make her more humble, and to teach her to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
the world, and all its gilded vanities; and that she might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
passions wholly in designe and order to heaven. I have seen
a female religion that wholly dwelt upon the face and tongue;
that like a wanton and an undressed tree spends all its juice in suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
and irregular branches, in leafs and gumme, and after all such
goodly outsides you should never eat an apple, or be delighted with
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the beauties, or the perfumes of a hopefull blossome. But the
religion of this excellent Lady was of another constitution; It
took root downward in humility, and brought forth fruit upward
in the substantiall graces of a Christian, in charity and justice, in
chastity and modesty, in fair friendships and sweetnesse of society<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
She had not very much of the forms and outsides of godlinesse; but
she was hugely carefull for the power of it, for the morall, essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall,
and usefull parts; such which would make her be, not seem
to be religious.</p>
               <p>8. She was a very constant person at her prayers, and spent all
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> her time which Nature did permit to her choice, in her devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and reading and meditating and the necessary offices of hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
government, every one of which is an action of religion, some
by nature, some by adoption. To these also God gave her <hi>a very
great love to hear the word of God preached;</hi> in which because I had
sometimes the honour to minister to her, I can give this certain te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:53465:195"/>
that she was a diligent, watchfull and attentive hearer: and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
to this had so excellent a judgement, that if ever I saw a woman
whose judgement was to be revered, it was hers alone: and I
have sometimes thought that the eminency of her discerning facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
did reward a pious discourse, and placed it in the regions of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and usefulnesse, and gathered it up from the ground, where
commonly such homilies are spilt, or scattered in neglect and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.
But her appetite was not soon satisfied with what was
usefull to her soul: she was also <hi>a constant Reader of Sermons,</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
seldome missed to read one every day; and that she might be full
of instruction and holy principles, she had lately designed to have a
large Book in which she purposed to have a stock of Religion tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d
in such assistances as she would chuse, that she might be <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
furnished and instructed to every good work,</hi> But God preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that, and hath filled her desires not out of cisterns and little aquae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts,
but hath carried her to the fountain, where <hi>she drinks of the
pleasures of the river,</hi> and is full of God.</p>
               <p>9. She alwayes lived a life of much Innocence, free from the
violences of great sins: her person, her breeding, her modesty, her
honour, her religion, her early marriage, the Guide of her soul, and
the Guide of her youth, were as so many fountains of restraining <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
grace to her, to keep her from the dishonours of a crime. <hi>Bonum est
portare jugum ab adolescentî:</hi> it is good to bear the yoak of the Lord
from our youth; and though she did so, being guarded by a mighty
providence, and a great favour and grace of God from staining her
fair soul with the spots of hell, yet she had strange fears and early
cares upon her; but these were not onely for her self, but in order
to others, to her neerest Relatives. For she was so great a lover of
this Honourable family of which now she was a Mother, that she
desired to become a chanel of great blessings to it unto future ages,
and was extremely jealous lest any thing should be done, or lest any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
thing had been done, though an age or two since, which should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail
a curse upon the innocent posterity; and therefore (although
I do not know that ever she was tempted with an offer of the crime)
yet she did infinitely remove all sacrilege <hi>from her thoughts,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
to see her estate of a clear and disintangled interest: she
would have no mingled rights with it; she would not receive any
thing from the Church, but religion and a blessing: and she never
thought a curse and a sin far enough off, but would desire it to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
distant; and that as to this family God had given much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and a wise head to govern it, so he would also for ever give ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
more blessings: And because she knew that the sins of Parents de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
upon Children, she endeavoured by justice and religion, by
charity and honour to secure that her chanel should convey nothing
but health, and a fair example, and a blessing.</p>
               <p>10. And though her accounts to God was made up of nothing
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:53465:195"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> but small parcels, little passions, and angry words, and trifling dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents,
which are the allayes of the piety of the most holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
yet she was early at her repentance; and toward the latter end
of her dayes, grew so fast in religion as if she had had a revelation
of her approaching end; and therefore that she must go a great way
in a little time: her discourses more full of religion, her prayers
more frequent, her charity increasing, her forgiveness more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
her friendships more communicative, her passion more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
discipline, and so she trimm'd her lamp, not thinking her night
was so neer, but that it might shine also in the day time, in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and before the Altar of incense.</p>
               <p>But in this course of hers there were some circumstances, and
some appendages of substance, which were highly remarkable.</p>
               <p>1. In all her Religion, and in all her actions of relation towards
God, she had a strange evennesse and untroubled passage, sliding
toward her Ocean of God and of infinity with a certain and silent
motion. So have I seen a river deep and smooth passing with a
still foot and a sober face, and paying to the <hi>Fiscus,</hi> the great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer
of the Sea, the Prince of all the watry bodies, a tribute
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> large and full: and hard by it a little brook skipping and making
a noise upon its unequall and neighbour bottom; and after all its
talking and bragged motion, it payed to its common Audit no more
then the revenues of a little cloud, or a contemptible vessel: So
have I sometimes compar'd the issues of her religion to the solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
and fam'd outsides of anothers piety. It dwelt upon her spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and was incorporated with the periodicall work of every day:
she did not beleeve that religion was intended to minister to fame
and reputation, but to pardon of sins, to the pleasure of God, and
the salvation of souls. For religion is like the breath of Heaven;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> if it goes abroad into the open air, it scatters and dissolves like cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyre:
but if it enters into a secret hollownesse, into a close con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance,
it is strong and mighty, and comes forth with vigour and
great effect at the other end, at the other side of this life, in the dayes
of death and judgement.</p>
               <p>2. The other appendage of her religion, which also was a great
ornament to all the parts of her life, was a rare modesty and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
of spirit, a confident despising and undervaluing of her self.
For though she had the greatest judgement, and the greatest expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of things and persons that I ever yet knew in a person of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> her youth, and sex, and circumstances; yet as if she knew nothing
of it she had the meanest opinion of her self; and like a fair taper
when she shined to all the room, yet round about her own station
she had cast a shadow and a cloud, and she shined to every body
but her self. But the perfectnesse of her prudence and excellent
parts could not be hid; and all her humility, and arts of conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
made the vertues more amiable and illustrious. For as pride
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:53465:196"/>
sullies the beauty of the fairest vertues, and makes our understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
but like the craft and learning of a Devil: so humility is the
greatest eminency, and art of publication in the whole world; and
she in all her arts of secrecy and hiding her worthy things, was
but <hi>like one that hideth the winde, and covers the oyntment of her
right hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know not by what instrument it hapned; but when death drew
neer, befor it made any shew upon her body, or revealed it self by
a naturall signification, it was conveyed to her spirit: she had a
strange secret perswasion that the bringing this Childe should be her
last scene of life: and we have known, that the soul when she is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
about to disrobe her self of her upper garment, sometimes speaks
rarely <hi>Magnifica verba: mors propè admota excutit;</hi> sometimes it is
prophetical; sometimes God by a superinduced perswasion wrought
by instruments, or accidents of his own, serves the ends of his own
providence and the salvation of the soul: But so it was, that the
thought of death dwelt long with her, and grew from the first steps
of fancy and fear, to a consent, from thence to a strange credulity,
and expectation of it; and without the violence of sicknesse she
died, as if she had done it voluntarily, and by designe, and for fear
her expectation should have been deceived, or that she should <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
seem to have had an unreasonable fear, or apprehension; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(as one said of <hi>Cato) sic abiit è vitâ ut causam moriendi nactam
se esse gauderet,</hi> she died, as if she had been glad of the opportunity.</p>
               <p>And in this I cannot but adore the providence and admire the
wisdom and infinite mercies of God. For having a tender and soft,
a delicate and fine constitution and breeding, she was tender to
pain and apprehensive of it as a childs shoulder is of a load and
burden: <hi>Grave est tenerae cervici jugum;</hi> and in her often discourses
of death, which she would renew willingly and frequently, she
would tell, that she feared not death, but she feared the sharp pains <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
of death: <hi>Emori nolo, me esse mortuam non curo:</hi> The being dead,
and being freed from the troubles and dangers of this world, she
hoped would be for her advantage; and therefore that was no
part of her fear: But she believing the pangs of death were great,
and the use and aids of reason little, had reason to fear lest they
should do violence to her spirit and the decency of her resolution.
But God that knew her fears, and her jealousie concerning her self,
fitted her with a death so easie, so harmlesse, so painlesse, that it
did not put her patience to a severe trial. It was not (in all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance)
of so much trouble, as two fits of a common ague; so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
was God to remonstrate to all that stood in that sad attendance,
that this soul was dear to him: and that since she had done so
much of her duty towards it, he that began would also finish her
redemption, by an act of a rare providence, and a singular mercy.
<hi>Blessed he that goodnesse of God, who does so careful actions of mercy
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:53465:196"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> for the ease and security of his servants.</hi> But this one instance was
a great demonstration that the apprehension of death is worse then
the pains of death: and that God loves to reprove the unreasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of our fears, by the mightiness, and by the arts of his mercy.</p>
               <p>She had in her sickness (if I may so cal it, or rather in the solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and graver preparations towards death) some curious and well-becoming
fears, concerning the final state of her soul. But from
thence she passed into a <hi>deliquium,</hi> or a kinde of trance, and as soon
as she came forth of it, as if it had been a vision, or that she had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed
with an Angel, and from his hand had received a label or
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> scroll of the <hi>book of life,</hi> and there seen her <hi>name</hi> enrolled, she cried
out aloud, <hi>[Glory be to God on high: Now I am sure I shall be saved.]</hi>
Concerning which manner of discoursing we are wholy ignorant,
what judgement can be made: but certainly there are strange things
in the other world; and so there are in all the immediate preparation
to it; and a little glimps of heaven, a minutes conversing with an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,
any ray of God, any communication extraordinary from the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of comfort which God gives to his servants in strange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
manners, are infinitely far from illusions; and they shall then
be understood by us, when we feel them, and when our new and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> strange needs shall be refreshed by such unusual visitation.</p>
               <p>But I must be forced to use summaries and arts of abbreviature in
the enumerating those things in which this rare Personage was dear
to God and to all her Relatives.</p>
               <p>If we consider her Person, she was in the flower of her age, <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum
cum aetas florida ver ageret;</hi> of a temperate, plain and natural
diet, without curiosity or an intemperate palate; she spent lesse time
in dressing, then many servants; her recreations were little and
seldom, her prayers often, her reading much: she was of a most
noble and charitable soul; a great lover of honourable actions and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> as great a despiser of base things; hugely loving to oblige others,
and very unwilling to be in arrear to any upon the stock of cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesies
and liberality; so free in all acts of favour, that she would
not stay to hear her self thanked, as being unwilling that what good
went from her to a needful or an obliged person should ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to her again; she was an excellent friend, and hugely dear to
very many, especially to the best and most discerning persons, to
all that conversed with her, and could understand her great worth
and sweetnesse: she was of an Honourable, a nice and tender repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
and of the pleasures of this world which were laid before
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> her in heaps she took a very small and inconsiderable share, as not
loving to glut her self with vanity, or to take her portion of good
things here below.</p>
               <p>If we look on her as a Wife, she was chast and loving, fruitful and
discreet humble and pleasant, witty and complyant, rich and fair, &amp;
wanted nothing to the making her a principal and a precedent to the
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:53465:197"/>
best Wives of the world, but a long life, and a full age.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
               </p>
               <p>If we remember her as a Mother, she was kinde and severe, careful
and prudent, very tender, &amp; not at al fond, a greater lover of her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens
souls, then of their bodies, and one that would value them
more by the strict rules of honour and proper worth, then by their
relation to her self.</p>
               <p>Her servants found her prudent, and fit to Govern, and yet open-handed
and apt to reward; a just Exactor of their duty and a great
Rewarder of their diligence.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
               </p>
               <p>She was in her house a comfort to her dearest Lord, a guide to her
children, a Rule to her Servants an example to all.</p>
               <p>But as she related to God in the offices of Religion, she was even
and constant, silent and devout, prudent and material: she loved what
she now enjoyes, and she feared what she never felt, and God did
for her what she never did expect. Her fears went beyond all her e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil;
and yet the good which she hath received was, and is, and ever
shall be beyond all her hopes.</p>
               <p>She lived as we al should live, and she died as I fain would die—
<q>
                     <l>Et cum supremos Lachesis perneverit annos,</l>
                     <l>Non aliter cineres mando jacere meos.</l>
                  </q>
I pray God I may feel those mercies on my death-bed that she felt,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
and that I may feel the same effect of my repentance which she feels
of the many degrees of her innocence. Such was her death that she
did not die too soon; and her life was so useful and so excellent
that she could not have lived too long. <hi>Nemo parum diu vixit qui vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutis
perfectae perfecto functus est munere:</hi> and as now in the grave it
shall not be enquired concerning her, how long she lived, but how
well? so to us who live after her to suffer a longer calamity, it may
be some ease to our sorrows, and some guide to our lives, and some
securitie to our conditions, to consider that God hath brought the
piety of a yong Lady to the early rewards of a never ceasing, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
never dying eternity of glory. And we also if we live as she did,
shall partake of the same glories; not onely having the honour of a
good name and a dear and honoured memory, but the glories of
these glories, the end of all excellent labours, and all prudent coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
and all holy religion, even the salvation of our souls in that
day, when all the Saints, and amongst them this excellent Woman
shall be shown to all the world to have done more, and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
things then we know of or can describe. <hi>Mors illos consecrat,
quorum exitum &amp; qui timent, laudant:</hi> Death consecrates and makes
sacred that person whose excellency was such, that they that are not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
displeased at the death, cannot dispraise the life; but they that mourn
sadly, think they can never commend sufficiently.</p>
