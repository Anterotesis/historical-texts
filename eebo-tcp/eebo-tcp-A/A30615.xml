         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>IT was the ſaying of a Servant of Chriſt,</hi> Every day a Chriſtian ſpends on Earth, is a day loſt in heaven; <hi>ſure he meant it of the</hi> Place, <hi>not the</hi> Company, <hi>For what makes Heaven, but <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion and Communion with God in Jeſus Chriſt? Now this being attainable in this life what hinders but a Chriſtian may live in heaven whilſt he lives upon earth?</hi> Truly our Fellowſhip is with the Father, &amp; with his Son Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 13. And our Converſation is in Heaven <hi>(ſaith another Apoſtle)</hi> Phil. 3. 20. And I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me, and the life which I now live in the fleſh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>Theſe were men on earth, ſubject to ſuch infirmities as theſe are, yet lived in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and there are yet in this declining, wanton, Chriſt-denying age, a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration upon earth thus living, whoſe lives and graces, though hidden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a mean out ſide, under many reproaches and infirmities, yet ſhine inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the glory of Chriſt upon them, who though they be in the world, yet follow the Lord with a Spirit differing from the ſpirit of the world; and amongſt theſe hidden ones of the Lord, this bleſſed man (the preacher of theſe Sermons, of whom the world was not worthy) was ſuch a one, who whilſt he was upon earth, lived in Heaven; and as thou maieſt eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, the end and ſcope of theſe Sermons is, to winde up thy heart to the like frame and poſture;</hi> viz. <hi>To take it off from periſhing vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to ſet it upon that which is the real and durable ſubſtance: We ſee upon what weak ſhoulders the fair neck of all worldly pomp and glory now ſtands, and how the Lord is winding up, and putting an end to the glories of the Kingdoms of men, who have not contributed their ſtrength and power to the advancing, but contrariwiſe, to the pulling down and ecclypſing of the glory of the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt: Beſides what the World tells us, never had any age by the works of providence, more examples laid before them of the worlds vanity, than in our daies; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our hearts ſhould ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Divinityy of</hi>

               <hi>this holy mans ſpirit did much appear in this, that having much of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that Earth could afford him, he ſtill looked upon all Creatures Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with the eyes of a ſtranger, and on order to the raiſing up of his ſoul to a more holy, humble, ſerviceable, ſelf denying walking with God. For him that injoyes little or nothing in the world, to ſpeak much of the worlds vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and emptyneſſe and of taking the heart off that, the ſweetneſs whereof he never poſſeſſed, is not ſo much, as when a man is ſurrounded with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of Creature-comforts, then by a Divine ſpirit to tread upon the neck of theſe things, and to be caught up into the third Heaven, bathing, ſolacing and ſatisfying it ſelf with ſweet and higher injoyments, with the more ſavory and cordial apprehenſions it hath of Jeſus Chriſt; this is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like him that is made partaker of the Divine Nature, and that lives above the world in the injoyment of the world; ſo that now Reader thou haſt theſe Sermons twice printed, once in the practice of this holy man, and now again in theſe papers which we preſent to thee in this preaching ſtile (though we confeſs things might have been more contracted) becauſe we find this way more deſired, more acceptable to his hearers, and if we miſtake not, more working upon the affections, and more profitable to the greateſt part of Chriſtians. The Lord Jeſus be with thy Spirit, and go along with theſe and all other his precious labors, to the furtherance of the joy of thy Faith, build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee up in the inner man, and directing thee in the way to thine eternal reſt.</hi>

                  </note> is the ſame word, only here the Participle, and there in the Verb, but the meaning is the ſame, as they that are after the Earth, mind Earthly things: ſo they that are after the fleſh ſavours fleſhly things: the firſt part of this point, is the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription of wicked men, that are enemies to the croſſe of Chriſt, and to the waies of godlineſs, and they are men that mind Earthly things, the more groſſe of them are deſcribed before, To have their bellies to be their god, ſome of them are very ſenſual, druken, unclean, and altogether given to ſatisfie the fleſh in fleſhly luſts: But there are others that do not appear to be ſo brutiſh, yet they are men of earthly minds, ſavour only of earthly things, and theſe are the men that are ſecret enemies to the croſſe of Chriſt, yea, and wil many times appear ſo to be, it will break out at length: Such a man whoſe ſpirit hath been earthly for a long time, will appear at length to be an enemy to Chriſts croſſe. Now in the handling of this point, I will propound theſe Five things to treat of.</p>
               <p>Firſt. <hi>What it is to mind earthly things in a ſinfull way:</hi> or thus, <hi>When a man may be ſaid to be an Earthly-minded man, that we may know when a man is an Earthly-minded man, what it is to mind Earthly things, that the Apoſtle here deſcribes a wicked man by. Without the opening of this, al that I ſhall ſay afterwards will be but to little purpoſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly. <hi>The great evil that there is in minding of Earthly things: and I ſhall diſcover to you a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter evil in it than you are aware of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:30201:13"/>
Thirdly. <hi>Lay down ſome Convincements whereby thoſe men and women that (it may be) think they are cleer from this ſin, yet may have it diſcovered unto their conſciences, that they are the men and women that do mind Earthly things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly. <hi>I ſhall ſearch into the Reaſon, Why it is that the hearts of men and women are ſo much after Earthly things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly. <hi>I ſhall labour to take off your hearts from Earthly things. Theſe are the Five things that are to be done in the firſt part of the point, Namely, the Character of wicked men here laid down,</hi> Who mind Earthly things.</p>
               <p>For the firſt. <hi>Who they are, that mind Earthly things.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, they are not all thoſe that enjoy earthly things; all men that do make uſe of earthly things, muſt not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for minding earthly things. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf in this very Epiſtle, where he wrote to theſe Philippians, chap. 4. verſ. 12. Though he knew how <hi>to want,</hi> yet he knew how <hi>to abound:</hi> he could tell how to make uſe of earthly things, yea, and he gives charge, That all thoſe that are inſtructed ſhould make ſuch as had inſtructed them partakers of all their goods. It may be, they would have ſaid, is not this, To mind Earthly things? To require thoſe that are inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, to make thoſe that did inſtruct them partakers of all their goods: <hi>Paul</hi> doth charge this. Yea, and Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, even in that Scripture where he does labor moſt to take the thoughts of men off from the earth; as not to take any thought, what they ſhould eat, or drink, yet ſaith he, <hi>Your heavenly Father knows that yea have need of theſe things</hi> in the 6. of <hi>Matthew:</hi> and <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 6. <hi>Let him that is taught in the Word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things:</hi> and if there be any pretence againſt it, yet ſaith he, <hi>be not deceived, God is not mocked; for whatſoever a man ſoweth, that ſhall he alſo reap.</hi> Thus therefore it is not here charged, as a note of an
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:30201:13"/>
evil man, to have earthly things, and doth juſtly require what is due unto him, as here <hi>Paul</hi> doth; and the <hi>Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> could not charge him, as breaking his own Rule which he wrote to the <hi>Philppians;</hi> and therefore we muſt enquire out ſomwhat elſe that's here means, by minding earthly things. When a man or woman doth mind earthly things in a ſinful way, And for that there are theſe ſeveral parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars conſiderable.</p>

               <p>THE firſt is this, <hi>When a man looks upon earthly things as the greateſt things of all, when he hath a high eſteem of earthly things, as</hi> THE <hi>things:</hi> as thus, Oh if I had ſuch and ſuch things as others have, Oh how happy ſhould I be, how happy are ſuch and ſuch men that do enjoy ſuch earthly things at their will, in their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, their furniture, their comings in, Oh theſe are the brave things, theſe are the delightful things, theſe are THE things wherein felicity and happineſs doth conſiſt. When men ſhall promiſe to themſelves felicity in any earthly things, then they mind earthly things. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber golden mouth'd <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> hath a ſpeech of a covetous man, That he looks upon his Money, and he ſees more beauty in his Money than in the very Sun it ſelf that ſhines in the Firmament: When men look upon the things of the earth as the moſt beautiful things in their eyes: Certainly that man is in a diſtemper, when he puts ſuch a high eſteem upon any earthly things, this eſteem is not according to what God and his Saints do put upon earthly things, God never puts any great eminencie on any earthly thing; he never made any earthly things to be any great Conduit,

You ſhall find there <hi>Iſaac</hi> bleſſing of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> he bleſſes them both: but now, what I would obſerve is this, the difference in the placing of them, you ſhall obſerve, the bleſſing of <hi>Jacob</hi> in the 28. verſe, therefore God giveth of the dew of Heaven, and the fatneſs of the earth, and plenty of Corn and Wine, that<hi>'s Jacob's</hi> bleſſing: Now look to <hi>Eſau's</hi> bleſſing, for the bleſſing was ſutable to their diſpoſition, and <hi>Jacob's</hi> father anſwered and ſaid unto him, behold thy dwelling ſhall be of the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the earth, and of the dew of Heaven from above: mark, <hi>Iſaac</hi> bleſſes them both with the <hi>dew of Heaven</hi> and fatneſs of the earth; but now, in <hi>Jacob's</hi> bleſſing the dew of Heaven is firſt, and the fatneſs of the earth is in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place; but in <hi>Eſau's</hi> bleſſing the fatneſs of the earth is firſt, and then the dew of Heaven: noting this, That a godly man indeed, doth ſtand in need of the things of the earth, as Chriſt ſaith, your father knows you ſtand in need of this things; I but the great thing in the firſt place that a godly heart doth mind, it ts, <hi>The dew of Heaven,</hi> and then in the ſecond place, <hi>The bleſſing of the erath;</hi> But now, a carnal heart doth think it hath ſome need of the things of Heaven, it will acknowledge that: I but in the firſt place it's the fatneſs of the earth they deſire: and ſecondly the dew of Heaven, So that that's the firſt thing: Earthly min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded men look upon theſe things as the high and chief things, and hence it is that the choiſe of the thoughts of an earthly-minded man is carried out on worldly objects.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>When the Cream and choiſe of the thoughts of men and women are buſied about earthly things then they mind earthly things in a ſinful manner:</hi> You may know what your hearts are by your thoughts as much as any thing, the thoughts
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:30201:14"/>
are the immediate ebulitions or riſings up of the heart (as I may ſo call them) that is the bubbles that come from the heart immediately; a man cannot know what is in his heart ſo much by words and actions, as by the thoughts, becauſe the thoughts immediately ſpring from the heart, as thus, I can tell what the water is in ſuch a fountain bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from that that bubbles up immediatly from the fountain-head, than I can tell by the water that runs in the ſtream a mile or two off, for there may many things intervene in the ſtream a mile or two off that never came from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-head, but that that immediately bubbles from the fountain-head, that diſcovers of what nature the fountain is: So the thoughts are as it were the firſt born of the heart, and therefore the heart may be known what it is by the thoughts, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 7. ſaith the holy Ghoſt there, <hi>As he thinketh in his heart, ſo is he;</hi> That which is here ſpoken in a particular caſe may be applied in the general, As a man thinks in his heart ſo is he, as his thoughts are ſo is he: So is the heart as the thoughts of the mind are, Men may keep in words and actions out of by-reſpects, I but if you could know what the heart is, and look into the haunts of it in ſecret, that would diſcover to your ſelves what you are: as now, Many of your ſervants, when they are in your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence before you or before others they may out of divers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects carry themſelves fairly, but if you would find them out, labour to know what they do when they are alone in their private haunts: So, would you know your own hearts? do not ſo much look at them, and take a ſcantling of them by how you behave your ſelves in words and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before others, but what they are in your private cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, what they are in the inward thoughts of the mind, there the heart comes to be diſcovered moſt; And by theſe thoughts I do not mean every kind of injection, or ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for ſometimes the Devil may caſt in evil thoughts into the moſt holy; but I mean ſuch thoughts as are ſweet to the ſoul, whereby the ſoul comes to ſuck out ſweetneſs, and contentment, for that's the <hi>minding earthly things,</hi> when
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:30201:15"/>
you find the ſtrength of your thoughts to be upon the things of the earth: and they are more ſutable to your hearts than any other: It is not when through weakneſs the mind may be wandring this way or that way, or through ſuggeſtions or temptations; but now, when men or women are moſt themſelves when alone and free, then for to examine what are the moſt ſutable thoughts to their hearts, Can you ſay when you are alone, Oh the very thoughts of God are ſweet to me, immediate in his Law day and night, and ſuck out ſweetneſs there as from an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny comb? But an unclean wretch will ſuck out ſweetneſs of his unclean thoughts when he is alone; and ſo the earthly minded man will ſuck out the ſweetneſs of his earthly thoughts, and ſo the Ambitious man the ſweetneſs of his pride when he is alone, and theſe are the moſt contentful thoughts to him, he can run along if it be two or three hours together and take delight and pleaſure in them: here's Earthly-mindedneſs.</p>
               <p>The third thing is this, An Earthly-minded man, <hi>is one whoſe heart cleaves to the earth:</hi> for ſo I told you the word was, not only to <hi>mind,</hi> but to <hi>ſavour</hi> the things of the earth: his heart doth cleave to the earth: The Pſalmiſt in a far differing caſe ſaid, that his ſoul did cleave to the duſt: but it's true of many men in this caſe that I am ſpeaking of, their very ſouls do cleave to the duſt, their ſpirits are mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the earth, and therefore they are droſſie: Though it may be they have ſome good common gifts, ſome good natural parts, and ſome workings of the holy Ghoſt upon them, yet their ſpirits are droſſie: becauſe they are mixt with the earth: diſcourſe never ſo much to theſe men of the vanity of the things of the earth, they will give you the hearing, but when you have done all, their ſouls do cleave to the earth: and diſcourſe never ſo much to them of the excellency of heavenly things, they will hear you, but when you have done all, their ſouls ſtil cleaves to the earth: As a man whoſe ſoul cleaves in love to a woman, (As it is ſaid of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> his ſoul did cleave to <hi>Dalilab)</hi> talk what
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:30201:15"/>
you will againſt that women, or of the excellency of any other woman, yet his ſoul cleaves to that woman: ſo 'tis in an earthly minded man, let what will be ſaid againſt the things of the earth, or what can be ſaid for the ſetting forth of the excellency of the things of Heaven, yet his ſoul cleaves to the earth: as the Serpents belly did to the duſt of the ground. That's an earthly minded man.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, An earthly minded man, it on, whoſe heart is filled with diſtracting cares about the earth: what he ſhall eat and drink, and what he ſhall put on, how he ſhall provide for himſelf and his family, and what ſhall become of him at ſuch a time, Though he be well now yet what may become of him afterwards: when the heart is filled with diſtracting cares about the things of the earth; ſo far as the heart hath theſe prevailing over it, ſo far ſuch a man may be judged to be earthly.</p>
               <p>There are two things that do cauſe diſtrating cares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout anie buſineſſe</p>
               <p>The firſt is, An apprehenſion of ſome verie great evil In caſe I ſhould be diſappointed, I look upon my diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment in ſuch a thing as a moſt intolerable evil to me, If I ſhould be diſappointed I know not what in the world to do That's the firſt</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, An uncertaintie in the means for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventment of this diſappointment: when as I look upon diſappointment as a very great evil, ſo thoſe means that ſhould prevent and help me againſt diſappointment I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not truſt to: I look upon them as too weak to help me, notwithſtanding al ſuch means I may yet be deſappointed, this cauſes diſtracting thoughts; ſo, tis in the things of the earth, an earthly minded man or woman hath his thoughts fil'd with diſtracting cares about the world. That is thus</p>
               <p>Firſt, They looking upon the things of the world as ſuch great things, they conceive if they ſhould be diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed they ſhould be undone; they look upon it as ſuch a fearful unſufferable evil to be depriv'd of their eſtate and outward comforts in this world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:30201:16"/>
Secondly, They don't look upon the means of proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for themſelves and families as having anie certaintie in it, which is a main thing to be conſidered of: As for out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things in the world, they find by experience there is uncertainty in them. And then for any promſe that there is in Scripture that God will provide for them and their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, alas that they dare not truſt to, that's a thing that of all means they think to be the weakeſt, Lord have mercy upon them (ſay they) if they have nothing elſe to truſt to, but only a word in Scripture, they think themſelves moſt miſerable and wretched. But now, it would be otherwiſe with the ſoul if it were not earthly minded, it would not be at any great pauſe how things do fall out here in the matters of the world, it's true, perhaps I may miſcarry in ſuch a buſineſſe, and my eſtate may be taken from me by the <hi>Caldeans</hi> or <hi>Sabeans</hi> as <hi>Jobs</hi> was, but I ſhall not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, my happineſs is not gone, I ſhall have that that will comfort me when all that is gone; ſuppoſe the worſt, yet this will not undo me, Indeed a man that ſends abroad in a venture all his whole eſtate, he is very ſolicitous becauſe if there be ill news about it he is undone; but another man that hath a great deal of riches, houſe, and Lands, and a ſtock at home to maintain him and his family, If there comes ſuch ill news, I have a ſtock to live on he thinks, therefore he is not ſo much ſolicitous: So a worldly man, all his ſtock is in the earth, there's his only portion, and if he miſcarries there he is undone; But a godly man, though he hath the things of the earth, yet he hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, treaſures in Heaven to reſt upon beſides the earth, and therefore he is not ſo ſolicitous.</p>
               <p>And then for the ſecond, <hi>The uncertainty of means and help:</hi> if a godly man looks upon outward cauſes, he ſees all is uncertain, but he hath a promiſe to reſt upon, <hi>I will never leave you nor forſake you:</hi> caſt your care upon me for I care for you; and this he looks upon as a certain means and help, whatſoever fals out, here's a promiſe that he can build upon, and therefore this takes off his ſolicitous
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:30201:16"/>
cares: But an earthly minded man or woman whoſe heart is fild with diſtracting cares, becauſe he look upon himſelf as undone if he miſcarries here, and hath nothing to reſt upon for his proviſion in this world, more than the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, An earthly minded man or woman, is one whoſe great buſineſs of his heart and endeavours of his life are about the things of the earth: he makes it his great bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and the ſtrong endeavours of his ſpirit are exerciſed in the things of the earth: He eagerly and greedily works with the ſtrongeſt intention about theſe things, his whole Soul, the whole man is laid out about the world, it is the adequate object of his ſoul.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, Other men they are buſie in their callings as well as theſe that you account earthly minded men, I but mark, they are buſie about their callings in obedience to God; and for outward things ſet aſide their obedience to God, then (I ſay) all the things that they buſie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about in the world, were it not under that conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they were obeying God in it they would not be adequate objects for their ſouls. I mean by an adequate object, that that Is ſufficient to take up the whole ſtrength of the ſoul to lay it out fully: I'le give you this ſimilitude to expreſs my mind further, to ſhew you what I mean by an adequate object, You have a little child, he is playing at ſports, now this ſport it hath as much in it as there is in his ſpirit, there is a kind of equality between his ſpirit and ſuch a ſport, there is benefit enough a child conceives in ſuch a ſport as it's worth the laying out of all his ſtrength and might upon it: Now it may be, ſometimes a man or woman will play with their child, they will do as the child doth to play with it, but this ſport it's not an adde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quat object, that's thus, a man or woman for the while would pleaſe themſelves with the child, but not ſo as if there were as much good in this as would fill their ſouls, ſo as they would lay out all their mind and might upon this thing as that is fully adequate to the deſires of their
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:30201:17"/>
ſoul; But ſport is fully adequat to the deſires of the ſoul of the child, but though a man or woman doth ſport ſo with the child, yet theſe things are not fully adequat to the deſires of a man or woman, and they have other matters in their heads than theſe, and buſineſſes of a higher nature: and ſo it is in thoſe that are not earthly minded, though they may be buſied about the things of this world, yet they uſe the world as if they uſed it not, the things of the world are not objects adequat to their hearts, a ſpiritual heart reſerves the chief ſtrength of it for higher things, I follow theſe things in the world but ſo, as I reſerve the chief ſtrength for a more deſirable good: As a man now, if he hath divers friends to come to him, perhaps he hath ſome of an ordinary rank, they come firſt, he makes ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie proviſion for them, but if he hath anie choiſe things for entertainment he reſerves them for ſome choiſe friends that are coming to him: ſo a man that is not of the world though he may be buſie in earthly things, yet the choiſe of his heart he both reſerve for things of a higher nature. I remember <hi>Tertullian</hi> hath a ſpeech of the Chriſtians how they eat, and drank; when they ſup'd, <hi>they eat and drank</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſo as they remembred they were to pray that night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſlept:</hi> So a gracious ſpiritual heart follows his out ward buſineſs in the world, but ſo as he remembers he is to converſe with God that night before de ſleeps, ſo that he reſerves the ſtrength of his ſpirit for communion with God; but now the other laies out all his ſtrength as having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do afterwards: ſo that in this an earthly, and a ſpiritual heart are quite contrary; The Apoſtle you know would have godly men to uſe the world as if they uſed it not; ſo on the contrary, an earthly-minded man uſes ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things as if he uſed them not; look how an earthly minded mans heart is in ſpiritual things, ſo a ſpiritual mind is in earthly things: An earthly minded man wil do ſome things that are ſpiritual, he will come and hear the word, perhaps he wil pray in his familie, and reade a chapter, I but his heart is not much there, he doth it as
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:30201:17"/>
he did it not, comes and hears as if he heard not, and praies as if he prayed not, he makes it not his buſineſs to pray or hear; ſo a ſpiritual minded man he doth the things of the world but as if he did them not, I mean in compariſon of his being buſie in ſpiritual things, there he doth it with all his might; An earthly minded man is like to <hi>Corab, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> we reade of them that they were ſwallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed up of the earth: and ſo the truth is, the things of the earth, Contentments, proviſion for themſelves and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies in earthly things, doth as it were open and ſwallow up the very hearts of earthly-minded men: and that's the fift thing for the diſcription of earthly mindedneſs.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, But ſuppoſe a man doth not ſeem to be ſo ſtrongly intent, to lay out his whole ſtrength and heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout earthly things, yet when anie man or woman ſhall ſeek anie earthlie thing for it ſelf (obſerve it) and not in ſubordination to ſome higher good, this is an earthly-minded man ſo for as this prevailes; in the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 18. our Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks there of the things that are ſeen that are but temporal, <hi>While we look not at the things that are ſeen, for the things that are ſeen are earthly and temporal:</hi> the word is <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> as much as to ſay, while we do not look as our ſcope upon temporal and earthly things that are ſeen, we do not make them our end, but we ſeek them in ſubordination, there is ſomewhat elſe that we look at higher in all theſe things, as for inſtance, a man that is godly, he follows his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as other men do, but what is it that he would have? It's this, I ſhew my obedience to God, and I would provide thoſe things that may be helpful to me to ſerve God in my generation; that's my end, I can appeal to God in this, that even in the following my buſineſs and all outward things, it is that I might follow God in the uſe of means for the providing of ſuch things as may enable me to ſerve him the more in my generation: this is my ſcope in what I do. But now on the other ſide, an earthly-minded man makes his ſcope this, he will follow his buſineſs and look about the buſineſs of his calling that he might gain, he
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:30201:18"/>
would get that he might get, he would have more that he might have more, and that he and his children might be ſomebodie in the world, and it may be that he might have enough to have his will, and luſts, therefore he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows his buſineſs very intent, meerly that he may get to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the fleſh, yea, indeed all the good things that he doth he brings them in ſubordination to earthly things. You may take it thus, a ſpiritual man doth not ſeek earthly things for himſelf, but an earthly man doth; or thus more fully, (you may mak it a diſtinct head if you will,) An earthly man is earthly in all he doth do, both in earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſpiritual things, and a ſpiritual minded man is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual in all he doth, both in ſpiritual and in earthly things; an earthly man when he is in earthly things he is altogether earthly, he looks not at obedience to God in what he doth, as thus, I'le follow my calling becauſe God hath required it, but an earthly man thinketh, I'le follow it becauſe I ſee gain come in by it, this is earth; though the things be lawful, and it's your duty to follow your calling, but to follow it meerly for gain, this is earthly: but becauſe it is your duty and the place God hath ſet you in, that's ſpiritualneſs in earthly things: An earthly man is earthly in earthly things, and he is more earthly in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things: when he performes ſpiritual duties he hath an earthly end in it, either to get eſteem from men, or to cover ſome evil, or meerly for form and faſhion, he doth it in an earthly way, and it may be at the moſt that that he doth do, it is but meerly for his own quiet, and to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his own conſcience, he is earthly in ſpiritual things. But now, a ſpiritual man, is ſpiritual in earthly things. one of a ſpiritual mind, is more heavenly and ſpiritual when he is about his calling though the meaneſt, as hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and ditching, or when he is pulling his ropes and lines, or uſing his Ax or hammer, he is more ſpiritual I ſay then, than an earthly man is, when he is praying, or hearing, or receiving Sacraments; certainly it is ſo, and it will be found to be ſo at the great day of Judgment,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:30201:18"/>
when the ſecrets of all hearts ſhall be diſcloſed: that's the ſixt thing, when a man ſeeks earthly things for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>And that that we may add as a ſeventh is, <hi>That he is earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſpiritual things.</hi> I grant that the beſt of the Saints may have ſome earthlineſſe in ſpirtual things; but I ſpeak of the predominancie, it's that that doth rule in the heart, ſo that in the performance of ſpiritual things, his very ends are but earthly, and the frame of his heart is but earthly in ſpiritual performances.</p>
               <p>The eight thing wherein we may find an earthly min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded man is this, That <hi>he paſſes through many and great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in matters of the earth, and they are very little to him;</hi> and though he hath a great deal of toyl for the matters of the earth, yet he is never weary with it, becauſe he is in his proper element; and therefore let there be what difficulties there will be, which to another man would be very great, he makes of them as nothing, and though there be much toyl and labour yet he is not weary, why? becauſe he is in his own element: The fiſh is not weary with ſwimming, but a man is quickly weary, I but the fiſh is in it's element and a man is not; ſo, I beſeech you obſerve this, when a mans ſpirit is in this kind of temper, let him but be buſied about earthly things, wherein earthly advantage comes in, no difficulties will hinder him, no wind or weather, he will riſe in cold mornings and go abroad, do any thing in the world. Oh! what difficulties will men endure In ſtorms at Sea, and hazards there, and troubles at land ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waies for things of the earth, and ſit up late, and riſe early, and toyl themſelves, and complain of no wearineſſe nor no difficulties But now, let them come but to ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things, to ſoul-buſineſſes that concern God and their ſpiritual eſtates, every little difficulty puts them aſide and diſcourages them, every mole-hill is a mountain in their way, I would do ſo and ſo indeed, but 'tis ſo hard, and 'tis tedious to riſe in a morning, eſpecially in cold winters morning; it is very hard and difficult to reade and pray
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:30201:19"/>
and ſo he is complaining of the difficulty of theſe things: And to watch over the heart, it's a mighty difficulty: to an earthly man any ſpiritual thing is difficult, and the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties doth diſcourage him, and in ſpiritual things, Oh how weary are they! as they in the 1. of <hi>Micha,</hi> 13. they cryed out, <hi>What a wearineſs is it:</hi> But in the buſineſſe of the world they can follow it, from morning to night they are never tired, they can work (as we ſay ſometimes of men) like a horſe and yet never out of breath: Oh I would but deſire you try your hearts once, but to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſpend one Sabbath exctly, and ſee what a weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that would be to you, reſolve but one Sabbath to riſe early in the morning, &amp; to have your thoughts ſpiritual &amp; heavenly as much as you can, and then get up &amp; pray alone in your cloſet, then reade, and hear, and meditate, and mark what you hear; and when you go home think of it, and confer about it, and when you come again attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the word, and ſo ſpend the whole day in hearing, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, meditating, and conference about good things, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling your family to account, and praying again, and ſee how tireſom this will be unto your hearts if they be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. But now a ſpiritual heart will call the Sabbath a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light unto it: And the Sabbath unto ſuch an one is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than that type and fore runner of that eternal day of reſt it ſhall enjoy in the kingdom of heaven: one that is ſpiritual accounts the Sabbath to be a day of reſt, but an earthly man is quickly tired in ſpiritual things, he will give over his work and not go through it: we reade in the 4. of <hi>Nehe.</hi> 6. verſe <hi>Nehemiah</hi> having ſpoken of the great difficulties that they met withal in their work, and yet (ſaith he) the work went on, <hi>for they bad a mind to it.</hi> So, look how a mans mind is, ſo he will be able to go through his work; If a man be an earthly-minded man, ſuch a man will go through ſtich with his work, If he take up buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for the world he will go through with it, for he hath a mind to it, he is a man of an earthly mind; But let him take in hand a ſpiritual work, and he will lay it aſide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:30201:19"/>
it be half done, he will ſeldom bring to perfection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſpiritual work, why? becauſe he hath no mind to it, whereas were the heart ſpiritual, and there were any ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual work undertaken, ſuch a one would go through with it till all was finiſhed.</p>
               <p>Another note about the diſcription of an earthly-minded man, is this: An earthly-minded man, is one <hi>that doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of the moſt heavenly Truths that are revealed in the Word in an earthly way, according to his mind, his genious, and diſpoſition of his own heart:</hi> And I verily think this is in a ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner meant in this place, for the Apoſtle is ſpeaking of thoſe that did oppoſe him in his Miniſtery, and that were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Croſſe of Chriſt: Now (ſaith he) Theſe <hi>mind earthly things,</hi> their mindes are of an earthly temper, and therefore no marvell (as if he ſhould ſay) though they do not ſavour thoſe Heavenly and Spiritual Truths that we bring to them, for their minds being earthly, they only apprehend thoſe things after an earthly manner: As now, what was the great Truth that the Apoſtle did bring to the <hi>Philippians?</hi> It was the way of reconciling the world to God, of making our peace with God, and of our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through Jeſus Chriſt. Now there is no point of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion more Spiritual, Heavenly, and Divine, than the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of Reconciliation, and of Juſtification by Jeſus Chriſt. So that, one that is of an earthly diſpoſition, though he may be convinc'd of a neceſſity of pardon of ſin, and peace with God, yet he apprehends the making of his peace with God, and obtaining pardon of his ſin, but in an earthly manner, he hath carnal thoughts and apprehenſions about his peace with God, and about obtaining pardon of ſin, he thinks it is the ſame way that one man obtains peace with another when he is fallen out, and of getting pardon from another man that he hath offended, he conceives it in an earthly way, he looks upon his making peace with God, by ſome thing that he himſelf muſt perform; but for the point of Free juſtification by the grace of God in Chriſt, it's too Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, Spiritual and Heavenly for an earthly-minded man
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:30201:20"/>
to apprehend in the Spiritualneſſe of it; an earthly-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man, his apprehenſions of God are but in a carnal, earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way; as the Prophet ſpeaks in the 1 of <hi>Iſa. The Ox knows his owner, and the Aſs his maſters crib:</hi> Even after that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner doth an earthly-minded man know God; as an Ox his owner, and the Aſs his maſters crib: as thus, the ox knows his owner becauſe he brings him fodder daily, ſo an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-minded man hath no other apprehenſions of God but this, he thinks God gives him good things in this world, God makes his corn to grow, or Proſpers his voyage. An earthly-minded man may riſe ſo high to have apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God as bringing good things unto him here on earth: But one that is ſpiritual and heavenly doth appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend God as God, doth not look upon God meerly as good in reſpect of the benefit he receives from God here, but he looks upon God as he is in himſelf, he ſees the face of God: as there's a great deal of difference between a man that knows another man, and a beaſt that knows a man, The ox knows his owner, the ox knows the man that brings hay or provender to him, but a man knows a man in another way, knows what the nature of a man is, knows what it is to be a rational creature, ſo one that is ſpiritual, knows what God is in himſelf, he ſees the face of God, and underſtands what God is in another way than others do: the difference between the knowledge of God that a ſpiritual ſoul hath, one that is pure in heart, and the knowledge of God that an earthly heart hath, is juſt ſo much difference as comes to this, As the ox knows the man that drives him to fat paſtures, ſo doth an earthly man know God that gives him good things: but a ſpiritual heart knows God as one man knows another, not in his full excellency, I mean not ſo, but there is ſuch a kind of difference in ſome degree, between the apprehenſions of God in a ſpiritual heart, and the apprehenſions of God in an earthly heart: And ſo we might mention in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spiritual and Divine Truths, that an earthly mind doth apprehend but in an earthly way; conſider of Heaven
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:30201:20"/>
its ſelf, how doth an earthly mind apprehend that? he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends that he ſhall be delivered from pain, and ſhall have ſome kind of glory, but knows not what it is, conceives it according to the way of the earth, ſome pompous, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious thing, that he ſhall live in pleaſures and not in pain; and ſo apprehends all the glory of Heaven but in ſenſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; whereas a ſpiritual heart looks at Heaven in another kind of notion, he looks upon the enjoyment of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God and Jeſus Chriſt in Heaven, and living of the life of God in Heaven; that's a thing that an earthly heart hath no skill at all in, neither doth ſuch an heart ſo much as ſavour it. Thus I have in theſe ſeveral particulars diſcovered what an earthly-minded man is, Oh that you would lay your hands upon your hearts, and every one conſider how far theſe things do reach you. But I have beſides theſe, divers other convincements, to convince the conſciences of men and women that yet there is much earthlineſſe in them: but of them we ſhall treat of in their order afterwards.</p>
               <p>The Second head to conſider is this. The great evill that there is in earthly-mindedneſs, <hi>They mind earthly things.</hi> Is that any ſuch great matter (you will ſay) indeed we cannot imagine the tranſcendency of the evil that there is in this, We think there's a great deal of evil in ſwearing, whoring, drinking, and ſuch kind of ſcandalous ſins, and indeed there is, But to have an earthly mind we do not think this to be ſo exceeding evil; yet you will find that the Scripture doth ſpeak moſt dreadful things againſt this, and if God pleaſe to ſet them home upon your hearts, I hope there is much glory may come to God by it, and much good unto you in particular.</p>

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:30201:21"/>
is Earthly-mindedneſſe, but Covetouſneſſe, which is <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itry?</hi> A man, or woman is an Idolater that is of an Earthly mind: Now Idolatry which is a worſhiping of ſtocks and ſtones, you all account to be a great ſin; but do you, and al others take heed of another Idolatry that may be as bad that is, To have your hearts to make the god of this world to be your God, the curſed Mammon of unrighteouſneſſe, to make the things of the earth to be your Chriſt, to fall down and worſhip the golden-Calfe of the world. It's certain, that that thing a mans heart is moſt taken with, and ſet upon, that's his God: and therefore here in this verſe out of which my Text is, it's ſaid, They made earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things (their bellies) their God: The Voluptuous, and Drunkard makes their Belly their God; and the Unclean perſon, makes his Strumpet to be his goddeſſe and worſhp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth that; whatſoever thy heart is moſt upon, that's thy God: therefore, that you muſt know to be the meaning of the Commandement, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods before me:</hi> That is, thou ſhalt give me the ſtrength of thy ſoul, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe: So, I am a God to my Creature when I have its ſtrength exerciſed about me, to lift up me as the higheſt good; but if there be any thing elſe that thy ſoul is ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as thy higheſt good, that's thy God, and it's worſe than bowing the knee, thou boweſt thy ſoul to that thing: now the meaner any thing is that we make a God of to our ſelves, the more vile is the Idolatry: as when the <hi>Egyptians</hi> worſhiped divers ſorts of gods, they were accounted the moſt vile Idolaters; whereas other Heathens worſhipped more excellent things, the Sun, Moon, and Stars; the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> worſhiped Dogs, Cats, Onions, and vile things; and therefore their Idolatry was vile. So, the viler any thing is that a man or woman ſets their hearts upon, the more vile is their Idolatry; as for a man that ſhould ſet his heart up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unclean luſts, now to make that to be a god, the ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe luſts, that's abominable, and to make any earthly thing to be a god to us, that's moſt vile; for of all the things of the works of creation that God hath made, the

Earth is the meaneſt, 'tis the baſeſt and loweſt thing, and hath the leaſt beauty in it in it's ſelf, and it is the moſt dul and meaneſt element of all; and to make earthly things to be a God to you, this is moſt vile.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is Two particulars to open the Evil of <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi> or Earthly-mindedneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt. The Evil of your Idolatry, it is in this. <hi>You do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from God;</hi> in letting out of your hearts to theſe things, you do (as it were) go off from God, and renounce the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of God, the goodneſſe and mercy of God, you leave it all by this: In the 4. chap. of <hi>Hofea,</hi> 12. verſe. They are ſaid, <hi>To go a whoring from under their God.</hi> It's a notable phraſe; that is, by going to Idols they did go off from the protection of God; whereas, while they were worſhiping the true God, they then were under the protection of God; but when they went to Idols, they went from under their God, from under his protection: So when thou ſetteſt thy heart upon God, and lifteſt up the infinite Firſt being of all things as the chief good to thy ſoul, thou art under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of this Grace and Mercy: but when thou doeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from him, and makeſt other things to be thy Cheef good, thou goeſt from under his protection, and from his good and mercy.</p>
                  <p>Secondly: God is ſlighted and contemn'd in this, <hi>When thou chooſeſt rather to make the earth to be thy God than the infinit bleſſed firſt-being of all things;</hi> As a man that doth diſpiſe his wife, and it were abominable ſin, if he ſhould chooſe to go to a Queen though the moſt beautifulleſt woman in the world, and forſake his wife; but to leave a Queen, or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs that were the beautifulleſt woman upon the earth, and to have the heart cleave to a baſe dunghil-raker, were not this a great contempt to the Queen that were ſo beautiful? Yet ſo it is when thou doeſt forſake the bleſſed eternal God as thy chief good, and chooſeſt the things of the earth: for the truth is, the earth is the fink of all the creatures of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:30201:22"/>
Gods making, and for thee to leave the moſt bleſſed and Eternal One, and to make that thy god it muſt needs be a very vile and abominable thing; and therefore the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in ſpeaking of this Idolatry, he cals the Heavens and the Earth to be amazed at it. <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> 2. 12. <hi>Be aſtoniſhed O ye Heavens at this, and be horrible afraid, be ye very deſolate ſaith the Lord,</hi> Why? what's the matter? <hi>For my people have committed two evils, They have forſaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out Ciſterns, broken Ciſterns that can hold no water.</hi> So 'tis here; thou forſakeſt the fountain of living waters, the bleſſed God, and thy heart cleaves to the duſt, and ſeekeſt thy contentment and happineſſe in ciſterns that can hold no water; let the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens be aſtoniſhed at this horrible wickedneſs.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Earthly-mindedneſs it's enmity againſt God.</hi> Thou wouldſt be loth to be found an enemy againſt God; certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it's a truth, and it will be found another day, That an earthly-minded man, or woman is an enemy to God: yea the Scripture makes it to be <hi>enmity</hi> in the very <hi>Abſtract, James,</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Know ye not that the love of the world is enmity to God?</hi> Obſerve this, for there's very much in it, if God would be pleaſed to make us to lay it to heart, you will find it by experience, that earthly-mindedneſſe doth make men to be enemies to that that is ſpiritually good, therefore well might the holy-Ghoſt ſay, 'tis enmity to God, for whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is enmity to any thing that is ſpiritually good, it is enmity to God; ſo much as my heart, or any of your hearts are againſt any thing that is ſpiritual, ſo much mine or any of your hearts are enemies to God. Now here in the very Text, theſe earthly-minded men are made enemies to the Croſſe of Chriſt: that is, enemies to the ſpiritual preaching of Chriſt, and holding forth Chriſt: Indeed, If they would have mixt Chriſt and Circumciſion together, then they would have been content with it; but now this
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:30201:23"/>
ſpiritual way of preaching Chriſt, and being juſtified by faith alone, and Chriſtian Religion in the purity of it, was that that was not ſutable to their carnal hearts, and therefore they were enemies to it. Oh! earthly-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe doth make us enemies to ſpiritual things; where have you greater enemies unto the things of God, unto ſpiritual things, unto the Miniſtry of the word (as we had occaſion to hint) and to the work of Gods grace upon the hearts of men and women, no greater enemies unto theſe things than earthly minded men, men that ſavour the things of the earth, that can go up and down and care not if they can but load themſelves with thick clay, grow rich in the world and fare deliciouſly every day with <hi>Dives,</hi> make proviſion for the fleſh to fulfill the luſts thereof, there is an antipathy in their ſpirits againſt Jeſus Chriſt and al goodneſſe.</p>

                     <hi>The Fourth</hi> EVILL.</head>
                  <p>Then Fourthly; There is ſcarce any diſpoſition more oppoſite, more contrary to the work of grace, to the work of godlineſſe in a mans own heart than earthly-minded<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe, 'tis ſo exceeding croſſe to the nature of grace, that it may as well put men or women to be at a ſtand, and put them upon examination whether there be any grace or no in their hearts if earthly-mindedneſſe prevail, as almoſt any other thing; if God ſhould ſuffer your corruptions to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail over you, ſo as you ſhould break forth into ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward notorious ſins, then it may be you would begin to think, can this ſtand with grace? and how can that ſtand with ſuch workings as I have had before? have not I cauſe to fear that I am but an Hypocrite, a rotten profeſſor? But now, this earthly-mindedneſſe hath as much oppoſition to the nature of grace, and the power of godlineſſe in the heart as almoſt any ſin that you can name. It is ſo quite contrary to the very beginning of the work of grace, not contrary to the degrees only, but to the very begining. The main work of God at the very firſt, in working grace in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:30201:23"/>
the ſoul, is to diſingage the ſoul from the creature, it is to take it off from the Earth, and from all creatures here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: for naturally 'tis true, That as we are of the earth, ſo we are earthly, and have our ſpirits ingaged to the things of this earth; but then comes the work of grace upon the ſoul, and takes it off, and diſcharges the heart from the earth: and therefore you find that Chriſt laies in this as the firſt leſſon, <hi>That he that will be my Diſciple, muſt deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs and follow me:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, never think of being a Chriſtian except you will deny your ſelves. <hi>Self:</hi> what's that? all natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, natural-ſelf, and ſinful-ſelf, to be emptied wholly of your ſelves, and creature-comforts, and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and take up my Croſs, to be willing to ſuffer any thing in regard of earthly comforts, to be willing to lay down all at my feet, and to give up your intereſt in all, and to take up my Croſs; this is the very firſt beginning of Chriſts bringing Diſciples to himſelf. Then (ſaith the ſoul) let me have my ſin pardoned, and farewel earth, it's Heaven, Holineſs, renewing of the Image of God, communion, and union with God, and living to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal praiſe of his Name in Chriſt that my heart is upon; I ſay, this in the beginning of Gods working the heart to himſelf. The work of Grace when it is firſt wrought, it hath the name of <hi>Vocation:</hi> Calling, what is it for a man to be called? give diligence to make your <hi>calling &amp; election ſure:</hi> To be called, is this, and whereas before thou wert altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther digging and dolving in the earth, and ſeeking for thy happineſs in the world, now it pleaſes God to make thee to hear a voice behind thee, calling thee, and telling thee, O poor ſoul, thy happineſs is not here, there are other things in which thy chief good conſiſts, thou art made for higher and better things than theſe, God hath nobler thoughts about man-kind than meerly to let him have a few contentments here in the earth, Oh ſoul! come away and look after higher things; here's the firſt work of grace: and the ſoul anſwers unto this call of God and ſaith, Lord,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:30201:24"/>
I come, and ſo gives up it's ſelf to God to diſpoſe of it, and this is in the beginning of the work of Grace: Now, how contrary is earthly-mindedneſſe to the work of God in bringing grace into the heart? Conceive it in theſe three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The very work of converſion, it is ſet out in Scripture by Gods calling the ſoul out of the world, <hi>Whom he hath predeſtinated; him he hath called.</hi> When God effectually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to work upon the heart of a ſinner, he does cauſe a voice to be heard in the ſoul, Oh ſoul, thou haſt been buſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy ſelf about many things, but there is one thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſeary, Oh come out of that way of thine that thou art in, thou canſt never be happy elſe, thou wilt be undone in it; the Lord calls the ſoul out of the world; and that (I ſay) is the very work of converſion, the ſouls anſwearing to Gods call: Now for one ſtil to be earthly, and to have a heart cleaving to theſe things, ſurely ſuch a one is not as yet ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually called out of the world.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And then from thence follows, <hi>upon the ſouls anſwer to this call;</hi> the Lord difingages the heart from all creature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforts, and teacheth, the firſt leſſon to deny himſelf, and to take up Chriſts Croſſe: now what's more oppoſite to ſelf-denial and the taking up of the Croſſe of Chriſt than earthly-mindedneſſe? the text ſaith here, <hi>They are enemies to the Croſs of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then a third thing in converſion it is, <hi>The reſigning up of the ſoul to God as the chief good;</hi> the ſoul upon the call of God, it learns the leſſon of Self-denial, and taking up the Croſſe, and ſo being diſingaged from the creature, now it reſigns up it ſelf to God as an infinite ſoul ſatisfying good for ever: now you cannot but in the naming of this ſee how oppoſite earthly-mindedneſſe is to it.</p>
                  <p>And then for the work of grace upon the heart, after the heart is converted and turned to God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Grace brings a new light into the ſoul:</hi> A Spiritual and Divine light is ſet up in the ſoul upon the converſion of a ſinner to God; but now, the earth you know, it's
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:30201:24"/>
the dark part of the world, and earthly mindedneſſe it cauſeth darkneſſe to be upon the ſpirit, as the interpoſition of the earth between us &amp; the Sun, it doth hinder the ſight of the Sun from us; And ſo the interpoſition that there is of earthlineſſe in the ſoul of man between God and it, doth hinder the ſight of God from the ſoul; there is a Divine light ſet up in the ſoul, and when as God works grace that doth diſcover things of a higher and more excellent and glorious nature, than thoſe things were that before the heart did ſo much cleave unto.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place: the Scirpture ſets forth the work of grace by the <hi>New creature.</hi> In the ſoul all things are made new, old things are Paſt, he that is in Crhiſt is a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Now earthly-mindedneſſe is oppoſite to the new creation in the ſoul, it's the old man that is of the earth, <hi>the firſt man is of the earth earthly;</hi> and ſo it is apparant that thou art ſtill only in the ſtock of the firſt man, of the earth earthly who art an earthly-minded man. But the ſecond man is, <hi>the Lord from Heaven:</hi> But now, thou that art an earthly-minded man or woman art yet but a child of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> of the firſt man, and ſo art of the earth earthly, this is oppoſite to grace, grace works a new creation in the ſoul.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And grace is of an <hi>Elevating nature,</hi> raiſes the heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove its ſelf, and above the creature, yea, above the world, in ſome reſpect above Angels themſelves, above Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Powers, above all created things, grace is of a raiſing nature; but an earthly-minded man ſinks down to low and baſe things.</p>
                  <p>And grace (fourthly) is of an <hi>Enlarging nature;</hi> it enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the heart, ſo that it cannot be ſatisfied with any earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing, though God ſhould give the whole world to a heart that hath grace, this would not ſatisfie that heart, why? becauſe it is ſo Enlarged by the work of grace, the work of grace it is the Divine nature, the Image of God in the ſoul, and therefore works the ſoul like to God: and it's ſaid of God in the 40. of <hi>Iſa.</hi> that all the nations of the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:30201:25"/>
earth are to him, but <hi>as the drop of the bucket, and as the ſmal duſt in the ballance.</hi> Now grace makes the ſoul to be like God, to accout all the things of the earth to be as the drop of a bucket, and the duſt of the ballance, to be nothing, leſs than nothing.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And then, <hi>Grace ſanctifies the ſoul:</hi> Now what is it to ſanctifie, but to take off from all common uſes, and to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to God as the higheſt act of all things?

There's dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous temptations in following after the things of the earth, and there is a ſnare in them that you do not think of, for you think only of the bravery of the things of the earth, how ſumptuouſly you ſhould live, and how fine you ſhould be, in your houſe, and cloaths, and what table you may keep, you only think of theſe things that may give the fleſh contentment; but you do not think of the temptation, and the ſnare that is in them; and thoſe whoſe hearts are ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe things, they fall into the ſnare, nay, temptation; thoſe that are earthly-minded, have great temptations, to ſhift up and down, to ſtrain their conſciences for the things of the earth; for ſo it is, that while we live in this world God hath made the things of the earth to be as thorns, and ſo they are compared in Scripture, and it's hard for one to meddle with thorns without pricking his fingers; they are as briars, &amp; its hard for the ſheep ro get among them but ſhe wil loſe ſome of her wool: and ſo it's hard for the heart to be buſie about the things of the earth, but it will be prickt and loſe ſome of its fleece, in will fall into temptation and a ſnare, and be catch'd: Oh! how many men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that have enlightened conſciences, &amp; they think ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that they would not for all the world do any thing againſt their conſciences, though they might gain all the glory and riches under Heaven: Well, but yet their hearts being earthly, when it comes to ſome particular, how rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy are they? at leaſt, to ſtrain conſcience, and not to attend to the voice of conſcience, and are willing that conſcience ſhould have its mouth ſtop'd for the time: Indeed, If their conſciences did plainly tell them, that this thing is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ſin againſt God, perhaps they would not do it, but that were not the ſnare, for tis no ſnare when I ſee the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger before me, here's a deep pit, and if I ſtep a ſtep further I fall into it, this is no ſnare. But now, there are ſome that are not catch'd ſo, by a pit that's open; but the Devil doth
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:30201:26"/>
lay upon the pit (it may) ſome green graſs, ſo that they ſhall not perceive, or very hardly perceive the danger; thus ſuch as have earthly hearts they fall into a ſnare and temptation, they are put upon ſtraining of conſcience, and wringing it as much as may be, and many ſhifts that they are put too, Oh! a man when once he is got into an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly buſineſs he knows not how in the world to bear it if he be croſt in it, It may be I have gone thus far, and I have very great hopes that I ſhall ſucceed in it, only there is one ſtop, now for him to think that for this one ſtop I am like to loſe all, Oh it goes to his heart: Oh but now, if you would but ſtrain conſcience a little you may get over it preſently; an earthly-man will ſtrain hard but he will get over it; whereas now, were the heart taken off from the earth, though ſuch a man had gone on never ſo far in a buſineſs, if there comes a ſtop in a matter of conſcience, yea, if it were but a doubt that ſuch a thing were ſin; it's e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſtop him, a meer doubt leſt he ſhould ſin would be enough for to make him ſay, let the buſineſs fall if it will, there may be a ſnare in this, and I ſee ſome cauſe to doubt: now if the heart were ſpiritual it would be taken off; but an earthly mind will go through very many dreadful things and doth not much trouble himſelf, and ſo doth inſnare himſelf exceedingly, that he may get an eſtate, or preſerve it when once he hath got it: That's the fifth thing.</p>

the world, full of droſſe with you, no marvel though you do not ſee thoſe ſpiritual and heavenly things that are in the Word, when as there is ſo much droſſe in your eyes; you know travellors in the ſummer time, travelling in the midſt of duſt and in company, they have not that freedome of their eyes to ſee things as at another time: Oh! many men com to the word with their thik clay, &amp; a great deal of filth that doth clam up their very eyes, and dead their hearts in the hearing of the Word; you know what Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Martha,</hi> when <hi>Mary</hi> was ſitting at Chriſts feet, and hearing his word, but <hi>Martha</hi> was cumbred with many things; ſo 'tis many times with thoſe that come to hear the Word, though they are in the preſence of Chriſt, and have the ſound of the Word in their ears, yet their hearts are cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred about many things, there's a great noiſe in their hearts, they are buſied in the world even while they are hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Word, as you find it in the 33. of <hi>Ezek.</hi> 31. ver. there is an notable diſcription, I fear it may be of many of you: <hi>And they come unto thee</hi> (ſaith the Lord to the Prophet) <hi>as the people cometh, and they ſit before thee as my people, and they hear thy words; but they will not do them, for with their mouth they ſhew much love, but their heart goeth after thir Covetouſneſs:</hi> They ſit befor thee as my people, and they hear thy words, (mark) and they ſhew much love with their mouth; they will commend the Sermon; it may be they will ſay, He is an excellent Preacher, it's a very good Sermon that we heard this day; they wil ſhew love with their mouth; but yet their hearts go after their covetouſneſſe for all that; they heard a man ſpeak fine things, and brought excellent expreſſions for to ſet forth his matter that he had in hand; but yet their hearts are after the things of the earth, and after their Covetouſneſs, they had carnal, earthly, droſſie hearts, and hence it was, that there was no good came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them by the Miniſtry of the Word: And that famous place which we have for this, which ſhews it cleerly in the 13. of <hi>Matt.</hi> 22. ver. you know the ſeveral ſorts of ground that had the ſeed of the Word ſown into them, but there
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:30201:27"/>
was but one of them that was good and faithfull, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others there was the thorny ground; He alſo that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſeed among the thorns, is he that heareth the word, and the care of this world, and the deceitfulneſſe of riches choaks the Word and it becometh unfruitful. I beſeech you obſerve it, theſe that our Saviour ſpeaks of here in this parable that get no benefit by the Word are not men that live lewdly, your drunkards, ſwearers and whoremaſters, but thoſe that have earthly hearts; it's ſaid, the <hi>deceitfulneſs of riches;</hi> the things of the earth do not hinder in an open way, for thouſands of men that have earthly hearts, they do not know that they have earthly hearts, no, it is the deceitfulneſſe of riches, and it choaks the Word, it may be juſt when they are in hearing of the Word it doth affect them, Oh they think it's ſweet, and they will remember it, but the deceitfulneſſe of riches, and the cares of this world choaks the word, when they come, they have buſineſſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the world, and their houſes, and gardens, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings in, and full tables, and all the delights that they have in the world, comes and poſſeſſes the heart that the word is choakt, it cannot get down into the ſoul to ſink in there, and ſo to prevail in the ſoul to bring forth fruit, Oh the word is choakt; Oh many of you come here three times on the Lords day, and have precious ſeed ſown all thoſe times, and yet, Oh! how it is choakt through the cares of this world, and through the deceitfulneſſe of the things of this world! You bring with you, and keep with you, and carry along with you earthly minds, and hence it is that the Word prevails not with your hearts: Oh! what do you looſe through this earthlineſſe? you loſe the fruit of the Word that ſhould ſave your ſouls; a ſpiritual heart having received ſome one truth into it, afterwards bleſſes God for it, and would not for ten thouſand worlds but he had had that truth preached unto his heart at ſuch a time, Oh he hath cauſe to bleſſe God for ſuch a morning, for ſuch a day that he hath had ſuch a goodly pearl of great price preſented to him, and taking root in his heart,

(I ſay) it's more than if God had given them thouſands of worlds to poſſeſs. But now, many of you, having your thoughts and hearts about ſome petty thing of this world, all thoſe bleſſed Truths, that you hear from time to time, that the very Angels deſire to pry into, they are all choak'd and come to be unfruitful. What was the reaſon when the young man came to Chriſt, to know what he ſhould do to the Eternal life that he got no good? the Text ſaith, <hi>That he had great poſſeſſions.</hi> A man (no queſtion) may be a rich man, and yet a godly man, a holy man: but when the heart is in the eſtate, mixed with the earth, Oh! this it was that hindred the young man from imbracing of Jeſus Chriſt even when he came to him. Young men for the moſt part are rather guilty of fleſhlineſſe, than ſeeking after the riches of the world; yet ſometimes it hath been the bain of ſome young men, at their firſt ſetting up; they were very forward when they were ſervants, Oh! how precious was the Word unto them, but when they were got into the world, and found the ſweetneſs of it coming in, Oh then the Word hath been choak'd to them; and they have loſt the ſavour they had in the Word, they have loſt the reliſh of the Word, it is not now ſweet to them as formerly it hath been, Oh many examples there hath been this way: That's the great evil of Earthly-mindedneſſe, that it doth hinder the great benefit of the Word, and there is much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill in this; If you had hearts to receive what is delivered your hearts would tremble at the thought of this, Oh Lord, what ſhall I be hindred from profiting by this word? 'tis the great bleſſing of God to the world, it's that that muſt ſave my ſoul, there's more worth in it than ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand worlds, whatſoever ſhould hinder my profiting by thy Word I had need take heed of it; take heed of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-mindedneſſe, many of your conſciences cannot but tell you this, ſometimes any buſineſſe will keep an earthly-minded man from coming to the Word, and when he doth come there is earth in his heart and ears that keeps him from attending upon the Word: and when thy thoughts
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:30201:28"/>
are about earthly things in the hearing of a Sermon, it may be there is ſome truth paſſes by thy ſoul that might have ſav'd thee eternally, and thou haſt loſt that opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which perhaps thou ſhalt never have again.</p>

                  <p>Further, In the ſeventh place, <hi>Earthly-mindedneſs, it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes many fooliſh luſts in the heart,</hi> that's a great evil; and for that you have the ſame Scripture that was before, for the temptations and ſnare, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 9. <hi>But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a ſnare, and into many fooliſh and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full luſts:</hi> luſts that are very fooliſh and ſimple.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As for inſtance; <hi>It cauſes men to follow after things that are very vile and mean,</hi> it cauſes men to beſtow the ſtrength of their immortal ſouls about things that have no worth at all in them: that's a fooliſh luſt, to beſtow the ſtrength of an immortal ſoul about vanities: If you ſhould ſee men that are of excellent parts for to ſpend their time about tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles and toyes, as about catching of flies, and following of feathers, you would ſay, ſurely they begin to be beſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: ſo for the ſoul of man, that is capable of ſuch excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency as it is, of communion with God, with the Father, Son and holy Ghoſt, for ſuch a ſoul to have the ſtrength of it ſpent about ſuch poor trifling things that cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit in the evil day, Oh this is a fooliſh luſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Fooliſh luſts, for earthly-mindedneſs, <hi>cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes thee to be a ſervant to thy ſervants:</hi> you would account that man a fool that ſhould be a ſervant to his ſervants: So God hath made the things of the earth to be a ſervant to thee, and yet thou wilt come and put thy neck under thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants yoke, and art a ſervant to thy ſervant: yea, were it not a great deal of folly for a man to expect all his honour and reſpect to come from his ſervant rather than from any excellency in himſelf; as thus, Suppoſe a man were travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, &amp; indeed there is reſpect given to him, but it's for his ſervants ſake rather than his own; If he ſhould come to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:30201:28"/>
know this, this he would account a great diſhonor to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: But an earthly heart (I ſay) puts himſelf into ſuch a condition, as indeed he makes it to be his greateſt honour to have honour from his eſtate and riches: So that men do not reſpect rich men for any worth that there is in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or for any excellency of their own, but only for their riches, as much as to ſay, a man is not reſpected for himſelf but for his ſervant. Take ſome men that have had eſtates, but now they are deprived of them, and are become as poor as any Almes-men or Beggars amongſt us; who doth regard them then? But now, let a man have grace and holineſſe, if he were turned out of all and made as poor as <hi>Job,</hi> yet he were one that the Angels of Heaven would look upon with honour, and would glory in atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon him; this is the difference between the carnal earthly heart, and the ſpiritual heart. It's a fooliſh luſt to make himſelf to be a ſervant to his ſervant.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It brings into fooliſh luſts, <hi>For a man might have as much (it may be) more of the earth if he did not mind it ſo much as he doth.</hi> Now for a man to mind the earth and to indanger himſelf in the minding of it, when as he might have it as well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo much minding, ſurely, this is a fooliſh thing: For a man to beſtow a great deal of labour about a thing when as he might have it with leſſe labour, he is a fool ſurely. Certainly if you be ſuch as belongs to God, eſpecially you may rather expect God to bleſs you if you kept your hearts more ſpiritual, you might expect that God would grant to you more of the good things of this world if you were leſſe earthly-minded than you are, and it's your earthly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindedneſſe that makes God cut you ſhort of theſe things; I am verily perſwaded there are many men that have ill ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe in their earthly affairs, and it's a fruit of Gods diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure upon them becauſe their hearts are ſo much upon worldly buſineſſes, did you go on in your imployment in obedience to God, and commit it to God for ſucceſſe, you might be crowned with more ſucceſſe than you have been: now what a fooliſh thing is this?</p>

4. Yea further: <hi>It's a great deal of folly, for any of you to go and buy a thing and to pay a greater price for it than it's worth:</hi> If you ſend a ſervant to buy you commodities, and when he comes home you ask him what it coſt, and he tells you it coſt ſuch a price which is ten times more than it's worth, you will ſay, Thus it is to ſend a fool to Market: ſo an earthly - minded man manifeſts himſelf to God, and his Angels and all the Saints to be a fool, for why? thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweſt that upon this world, that is a thouſand times more worth than the things of the world, for thou beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt that upon the world that might bring thee to heaven; I may ſay to an earthly-minded man, thoſe thoughts, and cares, and affections, and endeavours that thou doeſt ſpend upon the things of the world, If they had been ſpent about the things of God might have ſav'd thy ſoul to all eternity, thou mighteſt have got Chriſt and Heaven, and Eternity, the Lord would have gone along with thee; and thou mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt come hereafter to ſee it at the great day when all things ſhall be opened before men and Angels: had I but ſpent thoſe thoughts and cares, and endeavours, about under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the waies and things of God and eternal life, my ſoul might have bin ſav'd for ever: Not that our works wil do it, but that God would have gone along together with you in ſuch waies as thoſe are; now for you to ſpend thoughts and cares about that that perhaps you ſhall not have, for many men and women ſpend their ſouls about the things of the world and never have them, this is a ſad thing; Oh! wil not this be folly? will not you curſe your ſelves hereafter for your folly? Oh that I ſhould ſpend my ſelf and be ſpent about that that I have not got neither, and I muſt be damn'd for that, whereas had I ſpent time about things that concern'd my ſoul and eternal life it would have been more like that I ſhould have gotten thoſe things; for God doth not fail men ſo in ſpiritual things as he doth in earthly things, a man may be as diligent as it's poſſible for any man to be in buſineſs of the earth, and yet he may miſcarry; but give me any man or woman that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:30201:29"/>
ever was diligent in ſeeking the things of God and eternal life that ever did miſcarry; I verily beleeve at the day of Judgment there will not be one man found, that ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſay, Lord, I did improve what talents thou dideſt give me to the uttermoſt to ſave my ſoul, but Lord, becauſe I was not able to do any more, without thy grace, thou dideſt deny thy grace to me, and therefore now I muſt be damn'd: I beleeve there will not be any ſoul that will be able to ſay ſo; but in the matters of the world men do ſay ſo, that they have done what they could, nad labour'd and toyl'd, and yet for all that they miſcarry. Oh what a fooliſh thing is this then, for thee to toyl and labour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that which is ſo uncertain: for were it not a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh thing for a man to beſtow all his eſtate about buying of pibble ſtones, and that that will afford him no kind of benefit at all: This folly is in the heart of man: I'le but put this care to you, If two of you ſhould go to the <hi>Indies,</hi> where precious ſtones are, and one ſhould purchaſe a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of precious ſtones and other rich commodities, and the other that carried as much money with him, he laies out all his money about baubles and trifles, and they both come home laden, Both went out with the ſame ſtock, both come home laden, and one comes home with precious ſtones that makes him rich, and his poſterity to be great men; the other brings home nothing but a company of pibble ſtones which makes him ſcorn'd and jeer'd at by all his Neighbours; Oh! how would he be ready to tear his fleſh for his folly in this kind: This will be the difference between men and women at the day of Judgment, for the truth is, what is this world but a ſea-fare? we are here ſailing in this world, and here we have the market of pearls, or elſe of that hath no worth at all in it: when you live in the times of the Goſpel I ſay there is a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket for pearls, for thoſe things that may enrich you to all eternity; now there's one man, he beſtows the ſtrength of his thoughts and heart about thoſe things that he ſhall be bleſſing of God in the higheſt heavens to all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:30201:30"/>
for, and the other man beſtows his thoughts and heart but upon the things of the earth, and lades himſelf with thick clay (as the Scripture phraſe is;) and now at the day of Judgment when it ſhall appear, here's a man or woman that ſhall be to all eternity bleſſed, that ſhall joyn with Angels and Saints in the higheſt heavens to magnifie the free grace of God in Chriſt: and here's another had that he beſtowed but his thoughts, and heart about the ſame things he might have been ſo bleſſed for ever, but he minding the things of the earth is a curſed fool, and is the ſcorn and contempt of men and Angels to all eternity; earthly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindedneſſe brings men into fooliſh luſts (the Scipture ſpeaks:) Oh! though men of earthly minds think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the only bleſſed men, I applaud my ſelf at home, let men talk what they will; but the holy Ghoſt ſaith, that thoſe Iuſts that are cauſed by earthly-mindedneſſe are foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh luſts.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>That's folly for a man to do that that he muſt undo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</hi> Now eſpecially thoſe earthly-minded men that have this earthlineſſe ſo to prevail with them as to get any thing of the earth by falſe waies; they muſt certainly undo all they have done: you have got ſo much of the earth in ſome cunning cheating way, and you bleſſe your ſelves that you have found out ſuch a myſtery of iniquity; this is a fooliſh luſt: Fooliſh, Why? it muſt be done again, either you muſt be eternally damn'd, or elſe you muſt reſtore as <hi>Zacheus</hi> did if you be able, though it be to the impoveriſhing of your ſelves, yet it muſt out again, all the ſorrow and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance that can be will not be ſufficient, thou canſt not be pardoned upon all thy ſorrow and repentance if thou doſt not reſtore if thou beeſt able, what thou haſt ill gotten; I do not know that there was ever any Miniſter of the Goſpel upon the face of the earth but held this, that it was of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity to ſalvation to reſtore, and this one reaſon cannot but ſatisfie any mans conſcience, <hi>That a man cannot truly repent of a ſin, and yet wilfully to continue in it.</hi> Now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you do reſtore, you do wilfully continue in it; for
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:30201:30"/>
why? you do not only wrong the man the firſt hour, but ſo long as you keep any thing that is his you do wrong him: and if you be able to reſtore and do not, becauſe you are loth to part with ſo much mony, or ſo many goods, you do wilfully continue in the ſin: now, no man or woman can truly repent of a ſin and yet wilfully perſiſt in that ſin: what a fooliſh luſt is this, for a man or woman to go and get the things of this world in ſuch a way as he muſt undo all again though it be to his ſhame; Oh! conſider what a fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is. You deceitful ſervants, that ſpend away that upon your luſts, that you cheat and coſen your maſter of; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards when you come to ſet up for your ſelves, you muſt reſtore what you have purloind, and it may be a great part of your eſtate muſt be repaid in way of reſtitution, it muſt be done, there's no gain-ſaying of it; and therefore what a fooliſh luſt it is, to be ſet upon the things of the earth ſo as to get them in an earthly way.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And then fooliſh, (obſerve this one note) By <hi>Earthly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindedneſſe, they do loſe the comfort of earthly things before they have them.</hi> I make it out thus, A man or woman that hath carking thoughts about the things of the earth, and it may be by their inordinate thoughts, and cares, and affections after ſome earthly things, they contract much guiltineſſe upon their own ſpirits, yet after this perhaps God doth give them that earthly thing; now when they have got it, if they have any light in their conſciences, their convinced conſciences will then reflect thus upon them, I have got this indeed, Oh! but have I it with the bleſſing of God? I have it in my coſtody, but I got it dearly, it coſt me ſuch thoughts and cares, and affections before I had it, and now I have it, I cannot ſay it comes out of Gods love, I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fear that God hath given it me in his wrath becauſe I got it in ſuch a way; now all the comfort is gone and loſt, whereas had it come in the way of God, and hadſt thou gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up thy ſelf to God, and then providence had brought ſuch a comfort to thee, thou mighteſt have enjoyed much of God in it, &amp; bleſſ'd God for it, the Lord hath bleſſ'd me

in my trading, Oh! I have it from the Love of God. But now, when thy heart was earthly before it came, when it doth come thou haſt no comfort in it, the comfort of all is loſt before it comes, thou haſt ſpent ſo much upon it; as if a man hath got a thing, &amp; after he hath gotten it, he thinks thus, What hath this coſt me; it hath coſt me a great deal more than it's worth; now the comfort of it is vaniſhed.</p>

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:30201:31"/>
and would not forſake him: But when <hi>Paul</hi> begins to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and <hi>Demas</hi> thought, that there's no thriving for me, if I ſhould follow this perſecuted Apoſtle; <hi>Demas</hi> now would have no more of <hi>Paul,</hi> he thanks him for his company and fairly departs from him: <hi>He hath forſaken me:</hi> and what's the root of it? <hi>He had imbraced this preſent world.</hi> And that's another note, that though he was a forward Proffeſſor, yet the heart of <hi>Paul</hi> was not ſo much for him, for ſaith he, <hi>Luke the Beloved Phiſitian and</hi> Demas <hi>great you;</hi> He doth not ſay, the Beloved <hi>Demas;</hi> it's true, <hi>Demas</hi> was a forward Proffeſſor, and did ſeem to wear a cloak of Religion; yet <hi>Paul</hi> was directed by the holy-Ghoſt only to ſpeak of him as a Proffeſſor; but in that the holy-Ghoſt directs him to ſpeek of two together that were two companions, and gives one an Epethite, <hi>Beloved,</hi> and the other only his name. By this we may gather, that thoſe that have diſcerning ſpirits, may ſhew ſome kind of ſign in thoſe that are earthly, at leaſt to darken their eſteem of them, and to make them ſomwhat jealous of them: as now, ther's two men, and both very forward, and two companions together; yet thoſe that are godly, old Diſciples can ſavour one more than the other; Indeed they are both Proffeſſors, and both have excellant parts and gifts, and yet there's more ſpiritualneſs, and greater experiences in one than in the other, ſo it appears there was in <hi>Luke</hi> rather than in <hi>Demas,</hi> and indeed, your earthly-minded men, afterwards prove to be Apoſtates, uſually before their grand Apoſtaſy do manifeſt ſome dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and waywardneſs of ſpirit to that that's good. yea, their ſpirits before diſcover themſelves to be earthly ſpirits, they ſmell of the earth. As a man before he dies, his breath will ſmell very earthly; you will ſay: Oh! ſuch a one cannot live, his breath is ſo earthly; ſo it is with thoſe that are very great proffeſſors of Religion; that thoſe that have intimate acquaintance with them before they do Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatiſe they ſmell their breath to be earthly in their duties, in their conferences: Oh take heed of earthly-mindedneſs, leaſt it be the root of Apoſtaſie; This may be written upon

many an Apoſtates grave, <hi>This was an earthly minded man or woman in the mideſt of their profeſſion.</hi> And hence it is that they fell off from the truth in times of danger, when they were brought to the tryal, they were baſe back ſliders from God and his truth.</p>

Truly, this earthly-mindedneſſe comes from diſtemper of ſpirit, and the things of the earth they cleave to the hearts of men and women that are earthly, as the inward gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould cleave to a ſore on a mans body; and now when afflictions or death comes to take the things of the earth from them, or them from the things of the earth, Oh it's painful to them, it's grievous to them and for one that hath an earthly ſpirit, a hundred to one if he hath any light of conſcience left in him, but his conſcience will trouble him in time of ſickneſſe and then tell him how he hath ſpent his time and ſtrength of his ſpirit about the things of of the earth, whereas they ſhould have bin ſpent about more excellent things, and when he comes to die then his ſpirit will be troubled, I am now to leave all theſe things that I have ſpent my care and thoughts upon and let out my heart about, and what good is it to me now that I ſhall leave ſo much more than my neighbor doth, what great content is this to me when I am upon my ſick and death bed? what comfort can I have in all the good things I have enjoyed? yes, (it may be) through the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of my ſpirit, I have enjoyed but little of them, but I have had carking thoughts about them; But now, death is like to be to me as a Strainer, that ſtrains out the good and leaves the droſſe and the dirt behind it.

Now, what ſhould be the life of a Chriſtian, but a continual preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for death? Many of the Heathens ſaid of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> that it was but a preparation for death. A ſpecial excellency of Chriſtianity conſiſts in this, that it is a Preparative for death; and therefore you ſhould let out your hearts to the things of this world ſo, as to be continually thinking of death, that when God cals you to depart from theſe things, that you may do it with eaſe, with as much eaſe as a man when he is going to bed caſts off his cloaths that are looſe about him; for ſo the grave is as a bed to the Saints where they fall aſleep when they die, and ſo they may lay down all things and go to their ſleep with eaſe and peace.

                  </p>
                  <p>And for preparation I will lay down this.</p>
                  <p>Firſt. <hi>That a man or woman may be earthly minded, and yet little think of it themſelves, not know that they are ſo:</hi> Yea, and it may be even periſheternally through their earthly-min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedneſſe, and not know of it themſelves.</p>

                  <head>Six things may be wrought in a man, and yet Earthly minded.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. A man may have his judgment convinc'd that there is a vanity in all things in this world, and yet be an earthly-minded man for all this: many think they are not earthly-minded, why? Becauſe they are convinc'd that all theſe things are vanity; come and ſpeak to them about the things of this world, and they will acknowledg there's a vanity in all theſe things, that they are vanity of vanities, al is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>A man may have ſome kind of contentment in his eſtate, and yet have an earthly mind;</hi> at the 33. of <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. verſe, <hi>Eſau</hi> that was one of the earth, yet he ſaid he had enough, yet certainly one of an earthly ſpirit, and his portion was in the earth: how many of you come ſo far as <hi>Eſau</hi> did? to ſay for your eſtates, you have enough: Oh 'tis a ſhame for thoſe that are profeſſors of Religion, and would ſeem to be of the ſeed of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and yet they can never ſay they have enough, when as an <hi>Eſau</hi> can ſay, he hath enough: <hi>I have enough my brother.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>Men and women may ſpeak very great words about the vanity of all the things of this world:</hi> When you come to diſcourſe, you may (I ſay) diſcourſe much about them, and yet have a very earthly ſpirit.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>A man may be free from getting any thing of this world by falſe waies, by deceit, by injuſtice, &amp;c. and yet be earthly for all that.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Through ſome predominate luſt ſome other way, A man may ſeem to deſpiſe ſome earthly thing:</hi> As manie men that have a luſt of Ambition, will ſeem to deſpiſe money; that hath a luſt to ſhew themſelves to be generous; and thoſe that have a luſt of ſenſualitie will ſeem to deſpiſe the things of the world? manie a man through one luſt will ſeem as if he would hate the other, though the truth is, he doth not hate it as a ſin, but for the practice of it his heart is againſt it, not (I ſay) from the diſlike of it as a ſin againſt God,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:30201:37"/>
but becauſe it is oppoſite to ſome other luſt that he hath; as your Prodigals, your Young Spendthrifts, they will ſpeak againſt covetouſneſs as if they hated that ſin, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the truth is, no wicked man hates any ſin any further than one ſin croſſes another, ſo much he may hate it but not as a ſin, in the 13. of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 17. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>I will ſtir up the</hi> Medes <hi>againſt them, which ſhall not regard ſilver, and as for gold they ſhall not delight in it:</hi> the <hi>Medes</hi> they were Heathen wicked people that had no grace in them at all, and yet (the text ſaith) they ſhall not regard ſilver, and for gold they ſhall not delight in it; ſome men they think it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:30201:38"/>
may go far in ſeeming to be above earthly things in reſpect of the ſin of covetouſneſſe and yet ſtill have earthlie minde; wherefore to give you convicements, beſides things that have been hinted.</p>
                  <p>As how a man doth value himſelf and value others, is it not becauſe that others, or your ſelves have much of the things of the earth? can you value a poor man that is god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly above the richeſt man that is wicked? and ſo, can you value your ſelves for the leaſt work of grace upon your hearts to make you more excellent tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the greateſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mings<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in of your eſtates? (but theſe things we have hinted)</p>
                  <p>And then, where lies the chief Joy and chief Sorrow of mens hearts? what's that that doth moſt trouble your hearts? is it the loſſe of the light of the face of God, or the loſſe of an eſtate, the loſſe of a voyage, or the commiſſion of a ſin? So, what's your chief Joy, your profitting by the word, or gaining by your bargains? you have come to the word, and there ſomtimes God hath reveal'd ſome truth to you, and you have profited; can you go away rejoycing becauſe God hath made you to know his Law, the Lord hath darted ſome truth into my ſoul this morning, Oh! I go away rejoycing, and having my heart fil'd with more joy than ever I have had upon any bargain wherein I have got never ſo much of the world: Theſe be two convince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we hinted not before.</p>

                     <hi>Nine</hi> CONVINCEMENTS <hi>of Earthly-mindedneſs.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Conv.</hi> For the further Convincement of an Earthly-minded man, ſeriouſly conſider this: <hi>When a man ſhall reſt upon earthly props, upon worldly helps for the good that he doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect; If he can have thoſe things, then his heart ſeems to be upon the wing, very pleaſant; but there's nothing elſe can revive his heart, it's not a promiſe that can keep his ſpirit.</hi> Now that that a man or woman moſt truſts unto, that certainly they make to be their God: for that properly belongs to God to put our truſt in Him; then we make God to be our God, when
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:30201:38"/>
we roul our ſelves upon Him. Now to truſt in earthly things though it be but for the comforts of your life, you will ſay, I cannot truſt in earthly things to bring me to God; nay, but to truſt in them for the comforts of your life, while you are herein this world; that's an Argument of an earthly ſpirit: for the truth is, the comfort of a mans life conſiſts not in any earthly thing he doth enjoy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> You will ſay, <hi>Do not theſe comfort our lives?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, ſo far as God is pleaſed to let out Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf through them, but if thy heart doth reſt upon theſe for comfort, and doth not look higher than theſe for comfort, even for thy outward ſupport: certainlie thou haſt an earthlie heart. And ſo, when thou art about any buſineſſe, thou haſt ſome earthlie means to further thee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> You wil ſay, <hi>God would have us take all outward means to help us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I, but not to truſt in any thing; <hi>If riches encreaſe, ſet not your hearts upon them:</hi> ſo, if friends encreaſe, ſet not your hearts upon them, but truſt in the living God, let it be the living God that you reſt on even for all outward things in this world.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Conv.</hi> A Second Convincement, is this: <hi>When men make moſt proviſion for the things of this world, both for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and for their children.</hi> Are not theſe your thoughts? I do not know what I may want hereafter, and I ſee many that have lived finely when they have been young, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they have lived very miſerably, and therefore I muſt make proviſion for after-times. Thus for the earth.</p>
                  <p>But now, Do you reaſon thus for the things of Heaven? do not I ſee many that have made a great blaze of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and yet afterwards they have come to nothing, they have gone out in a ſnuffe as men that God hath forſaken, and they have died in horror of Conſcience; and therfore let me lay up proviſion now againſt an evil time, that I may not miſcarrie in the matters of my ſoul ſo as others have done; this were a ſign your minds were not earthly. And for your children, God hath ſent you children, and Oh!
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:30201:39"/>
how you toile and labour, and your thoughts run in the night, and as ſoon as you awake in the morning, about what you ſhall get for their portions, and for an eſtate for them: Now I appeal to your conſcience before God (the ſearcher of all hearts) Have your cares been to provide in a ſutable way for their ſouls, for their ſpiritual and eternal eſtates? No queſtion but it's lawful for parents to provide in a Providential way for their children, and they that do not are worſe than Infidels; but what is your chief provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for? are your thoughts more ſolicitous to provide por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for them, than that they ſhould have inſtruction in the fear of God, an intereſt in Chriſt, than that they ſhould have grace wrought in their hearts? You are loth to die be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you can bring your eſtate ſo clear as you may leave it to your children:! Oh are you not loth die before ſuch time as you ſee ſome work of grace wrought in the hearts of your children? Oh! theſe would your thoughts be if you were ſpiritual: Oh! could I diſcern but ſome ſeeds of grace ſown before I was diſolved I could rejoyce abundantlie. As ti's repeated of <hi>Auſten's</hi> Mother, that the great thing that ſhe deſired to live for, was to ſee her ſon Converted; and God did grant her deſire, and then ſhe found her ſelf wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to die. There's nothing wil make the ſpiritual heart of a father or mother more willing to depart from this world, than to find grace wrought in their children; Oh! that I may ſee before I die my child left under the promiſe in Covenant with God: I, this were ſomwhat-like indeed: But thoſe whoſe cares &amp; thoughts are moſt for theſe earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie things, in providing for themſelves and children, that's a Convincement that their hearts are earthly.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Conv.</hi> A Third Convincement which is very notable (and I beſeech you all to lay this to heart and conſider ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly of it) for this evill of earthly-mindedneſs <hi>is a very ſecret and cloſe ſin,</hi> therefore I am the larger in this point: the convincement is this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That man that can be content with a ſlight aſſurance in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Heaven, but for the matters of earth he never thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:30201:39"/>
ſure enough, but is very careful to make all things ſo infalla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as there can be no way that he can be decived in, but he may ſurely build upon what he hath in the things of this earth.</hi> This is an argument of an earthly mind, Come to men that are earthly, and diſcourſe with them concerning matters that concern their ſouls, What aſſurance have you that you are gone beyond any formal profeſſor, that you are better than the ſtony or thorny grounds that we reade of in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? What evidence have you that the ſaving work of grace is wrought in you? that you have ſhot the gulf? that you are tranſlated out of the kingdom of darkneſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt? and that your ſins are pardoned, and your ſouls juſtified? that you are at peace with God? what evidences have you of peace made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and your ſouls: This anſwer would be given: I hope I am converted, I truſt in Gods mercy, ſure I have grace, I ſhall be ſav'd, God is merciful. But what eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces can you ſhew? They know not ſcarce what belongs to that, nay, you ſhall have many of them, becauſe they know not what aſſurance means, therefore they, will think no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy can be aſſured; we may hope well but we cannot come to be aſſured of it: No, a heart that is truly gracious and godly would be loth that ſhould be true for a thouſand worlds, they would not loſe their parts in the bleſſing of that, if God would make them Kings or Queens of the earth. But thou haſt an earthlie droſſie heart, and doeſt not much look after aſſurance for matters of thy ſoul and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal eſtate, thou wilt venture thoſe matters and put them upon a peradventure; but when it comes to the matters of the earth there thou wilt make all ſure, and go from this Lawyer to another Lawyer to ask council, &amp; to ſee whether the things are good, and will inrole them; and if there can be any thing done to make more ſure (if it be any great ſum upon which your eſtates lies) you will do it. I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to you, If you could but hear of any of your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors what they had done to make ſuch a thing more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain than you have done; you would ſcarce be at reſt till
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:30201:40"/>
you had done ſo as they have done: is it ſo in matters of your eternal eſtate? do not you hear of many Saints of God that walk comfortably in the midſt of all afflictions upon the aſſurance of Gods love? you ſhall have ſome will be able to ſay, I, and it's this Scripture I build upon, and through Gods mercie ſuch and ſuch hath the work of God been upon my ſoul in revealing himſelf to me, and ſuch a promiſe I have ſuck't abundance of honie from. But now generally, come to people upon their ſick beds, all that they ſay is this, They hope in Gods mercie. But for the ground of their hope, for ſhewing how God hath been pleaſed to bring their hearts and the word together, and what real effects there hath been upon their ſpirits by the word, that they can ſhew nothing of: thou haſt not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore got that aſſurance for thy ſoul and eternal eſtate as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have got, and yet thou canſt go on quietly, Oh! it concerns thee that art ſo buſie in making all ſure for thy outward eſtate, to ſpend more thoughts and care in the matters of thy ſoul and eternal eſtate than ever thou haſt done, here's an earthly-minded man that can be contented with ſlight aſſurance for the matters of his ſoul, and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with no kind of aſſurance in the matters of the world, but would fain make thoſe things more and more ſure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Conv.</hi> Further, An earthly-minded man may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of his earthlineſſe in this, <hi>He is content with a little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Sanctification, but for the matters of the world, ſtill he would fain have more and more.</hi> He looks at thoſe that are the moſt eminent that are in his rank, and he would fain get up as high as they in the things of this life, but in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion he looks at the loweſt Chriſtians, and is content to be as low as they; take an earthly-minded man that is of ſuch a trade, if there be any of his profeſſion or calling that had as little to begin as he, and thrive better, he would fain get up as high as he, and is troubled that he is not ſo rich as he is; thus it is in the world. But now, take them in matters of God, there's ſuch men that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:30201:40"/>
began ſince you began, and had as little means for the good of their ſouls as you have had, they are thriven and got beyond you abundantly in the matters of God, and doth this trouble you? and are your thoughts ſolicitous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this? Oh! that I could attain to that degree of grace as ſuch a one hath got, ſuch an one hath a ſpiritual mind, and full of the joy of the holy Ghoſt, and full of faith, he is able to depend upon God in the want of all outward comforts, and certainly injoyes much communion with God; but I am far beneath ſuch and ſuch: do theſe thoughts trouble you? it is ordinary for earthly ſpirits, if they look but at any one that makes profeſſion of Religion that is low in his profeſſion, I did as ſuch a one doth; and I have as much as they have, and that ſatisfies them, they look upon the meaneſt Chriſtans, and are ſatisfied that they are like them; but for the matters of the world they look upon the higheſt, and are not ſatified except they come and attain to what they attain to: and that's a fourth evidence.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Conv.</hi> Then a Fift is this, <hi>Earthly-minded men are very wiſe in matters of the world, but in matters that are ſpiritual there they are very weak and Simple.</hi> You ſhall have many men, (which I have wondered at ſometimes to ſee) that in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters concerning Religion there they are very ignorant, if they do but ſpeak in points of ſaving knowledge they ſpeak like children, ſo that one would wonder where their underſtandings were; now turn ſuch men to the matters of the world, Oh! how wiſe are they in their generation, Oh! how ſubtile, and crafty are they, they can ſee an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecton there and know how to anſwer it, they can diſcern any thing that will let them in their profit, many miles off, and can prevent whereas others cannot; but now in thoſe things that hinder their ſouls, they cannot foreſee things there, they are wiſe in their generation, and they have me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories for the matters of the world, they can underſtand things, and remember things, and they can meditate there, but put them to meditate on a point of Religion, they are preſently at a ſtand: Let me appeal to you, do not your
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:30201:41"/>
conſciences tell you, that in the matter, of the world when you are walking from hence to <hi>London,</hi> you can run in your thoughts upon one buſineſs all the way that you walk, you can plot this, and contrive the other way, and foreſee this and the other objection, and anſwer it thus in your own thoughts; but I do but put this to you, when you walk over the fields, ſettle but upon one meditation concerning Chriſt, and ſee whether you are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to draw out that meditation the while you walk over one field, whereas you can ſpin out an earthly meditation if it were divers miles; when you awake in the night ſeaſon preſently your thoughts are upon the things of the world, and you can draw them out, and work there underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly; but now in the things of God, Oh! how bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, and ſimple, and weak are you there! there's ſcarce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one can over-reach you in the things of the world, but in the matters of Religion you are over-reach't preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, every ſlight temptation overcomes you there.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Conv.</hi> And beſides, you may know it by the diſcourſe and words of men; 1. <hi>John,</hi> 4. 5. <hi>They are of the world; therefore ſpeak they of the world, and the world heareth them:</hi> Their breath is earthly, Oh! it's an ill ſign that (you uſe to ſay of your friends ſometimes) when you come to their bed ſide, Oh! I am afraid they will die their breath ſmels ſo earthly, it's a ſimptom of the death of the bodie: So your hearts do ſmel ſo earthly, and it were ſomewhat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable if it were on other daies when your callings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it to diſcourſe of buſineſſe, but even that time that God hath ſet apart for himſelf, you are ſometimes diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in your own thoughts concerning the buſineſſes of the world when you are praying, and hearing: whereas the communication and diſcourſes of men ſhould reliſh of what they have heard out of the world, not preſently to go and talk about ſome earthly exchange occurrances, and ſo looſe all, Oh! it's this that hath loſt many precious truths, it may be when you have been hearing, God hath darted in ſome beam of Goſpel-light into your ſouls, and you have
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:30201:41"/>
loſt is before you have got home, and ſo have come to looſe the impreſſion of the truth that you have heard, Oh! what a ſeemly thing were it in thoſe that come to hear the word when they depart that there ſhould be no diſcourſe but tending that way? Oh! how often are you in company and never leave any thing to refreſh one anothers ſpirits, or to further one another in the way to eternal life; though God gives you allowance to ſpeak about your buſineſs, yet ſtill if you be ſpiritual and heavenly, he would have you to have ſomething about heaven or eternal life before you do depart.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Conv</hi> A. further Convincement is this, <hi>When Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things muſt give way to Earthlyneſs upon every little buſineſs:</hi> Prayer muſt pay for it, if I have any buſineſſe, I will take it out of the time of Paayer, or converſe in the Word the leſs, or hear the leſſe; when as I ſay, that earthly things are ſo high as ſpiritual things muſt give way, Heaven muſt ſtand by (as ir were) til Earth be ſerved; this is an evil ſign of an earthly ſpirit: whereas were the ſpirit Heavenly, the very firſt thing that thou would do when thou awakeſt in the morning, or ariſeſt, ſhould be to ſeaſon thy heart with ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that were ſpiritual: in <hi>Pſal</hi> 139. 17. <hi>How precious al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo are thy thoughts unto me O God! how great is the ſum of them? If I count them, they are more in number than the ſand: when I awake I am ſtill with thee.</hi> Oh! that were an argument of a ſpiritual mind, that upon the awaking preſently to be with God: When I awake I am ſtill with thee. But now, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to you, Who are you withal when you awake? Can you ſay, Lord, when I awake I am ſtill with thee, I find an inclination in my ſpirit to be upon the matters of Heaven, and when I am up, I had rather my worldly buſineſs ſhould give way than ſpiritual duties.</p>

And ſo it may be an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of very great comfort to you in theſe dangerous times; If our conſciences tell us this, that God that knowes all things, knowes that the great thing my heart was ſolicitous about in theſe evill dayes, it was, <hi>What ſhall become of thy great Name:</hi> Lord, what ſhall become of Religion: what ſhall become of thy Goſpel: Lord theſe were the things that took up my heart, not ſo much what ſhould become of my eſtate and outward accommodations and relations in this world: Oh! exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine your hearts in this, Whether the care of your ſpirts be more for the furtherance of the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt or for the furtherance of your Eſtates? but for that man or woman that is moſt ſolicitous about buſineſſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns their outward eſtates, and do not much care how Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion goes, how the way of the Kingdom of Chriſt is maintai'd, God at this time doth ſpeak to that ſoul; Thou art an Earthly-minded man or woman, and therefore take heed leſt what hath been ſpoken concerning the great evil that there is in earthly-mindedneſſe, leſt it befals thee, and eſpecially the laſt of all, <hi>Whoſe end is deſtruction, who art drown'd in perdition;</hi> leſt hereafter this be the thing that thou ſhalt lie crying out of, and curſing thy ſelf for, Oh! I had a baſe and earthly heart, and ſought the things of the earth, and made my portion there, and in the mean time the bleſſed God hath been forſaken; and I have loſt my Portion in the Holy Land, for I had my portion in <hi>Egypt</hi> among the <hi>Egyptians</hi> accoding as I did chooſe to my ſelf.</p>

That the more ſpiritual any truth is that is reveal'd, the leſs doth it take with his heart:</hi> Some truths of Religion perhaps he is moved with, but theſe are as by-words to him, he minds them not at at all. The more ſpiritual an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is that is delivered, the leſſe is his ſpirit moved with it; if indeed he comes to the Word and there be mingled ſome earthly natural excellencie, (for ſo I may call it) as natural parts, wiſdom, wit, and eloquence, and learning, that he is mov'd withal, it may be ſome fine ſtory is more pleaſing to him, than the goodly pearls of truth that are revealed in the word; as now, ſuch truths as theſe, The enjoyment of communion with God, the longing after Jeſus Chriſts coming; the living by faith upon a bare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, the excellencie that there is in ſuffering for Jeſus Chriſt: Theſe truths now are ſpiritual, The mortifying of the inward luſts, Self-denial, Theſe things are little ſavored by an earthly-minded man; tell him of the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the Saints, the myſteries of the Goſpel, any thing that is ſpiritual it is but as a notion to him; As 'tis with men that are upon the earth, they look up to Heaven and ſee the things of Heaven but little; why is it that the Stars ſeem ſo ſmal to us here, but becauſe we are upon the earth, the earth ſeems a vaſt bodie to us, but the Stars ſeem but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to us though they are far bigger than the earth: were we in Heaven, then the heavenly bodies would ſeem vaſt to us, and the earthly bodies would ſcarce be diſcerned by us; were mens hearts heavenly, all the things of the earth would ſeem little to them; but becauſe they are earthly, therefore the things of heaven, and ſpiritual myſteries are very ſmall in their eyes.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Seven Reaſons of mens</hi> Earthly-mindedneſs.</head>
               <p>I Shall now proceed unto the Reaſons of the Point, <hi>Why is it that mens hearts are ſo much ſet upon the earth, to mind earthly things.</hi> I give you briefly theſe Reaſons for it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>The things of the earth appear real to them, but ſpiritual and heavenly things be but a notion:</hi> Now that that hath reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in it, takes with the heart moſt; though men are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in this, for the Scripture ſpeaks of ſpiritual things as the only real things, and earthly things as that that hath no being at all; in <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 15. <hi>Wilt thou ſet thine eyes upon that which is not,</hi> (ſpeaking of the riches of the world) it hath no reality at all in it. But in the 8. <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 21. <hi>I lead in the way of righteouſneſs, in the midſt of the paths of Judgment: That I may cauſe thoſe that love me to inherit ſubſtance;</hi> to inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that which is, that which hath a being, othert hings they are not, the honors of the earth are but a fantaſie and vain ſhew; you have read of <hi>Bernice</hi> and <hi>Agrippa,</hi> They <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts,</hi> 23. 25. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> came with much Pomp, with great <hi>Fanſie,</hi> ſo the original is: but to an earthly man theſe earthly things are real things, and therefore he minds them: and wiſdom is a lye unto a fool.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Theſe things they look upon as the preſent neceſſary things, though the Scripture tels us, <hi>but of one thing that is neceſſiary,</hi> but yet they think that theſe are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent now, they may have need of heavenly things hereafter: They may have need of reconciliation with God, pardon of ſin, peace of conſcience, and ſuch things, they may have need of them, that is, when they depart out of this life. Oh! the infinite folly of moſt hearts to think, that there is no preſent neceſſity of ſpiritual and heavenly things, whereas indeed, our life conſiſts in them for the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:30201:43"/>
preſent, <hi>This is eternal life:</hi> we may come here in this world to enjoy eternal life; but the generality of people they look upon all ſpiritual things only as our good for the future, when we go from hence and are ſeen no more.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Theſe things are moſt ſutable to mens hearts.</hi> It's no wonder that they mind earthly things; They are of the earth, and from the earth, they have nothing but the <note place="margin">terrae fillii.</note> firſt <hi>Adam</hi> in them; now the firſt man was from the earth earthly. The truth is, the happineſs of mans eſtate even in innocency in the morning of the day of his creation in compariſon of the things that are now reveal'd by the Goſpel, was but earthly: take man when he was in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, that Paradice was but earthly: but then take man in his fallen and corrupt eſtate then he muſt needs be earthly, and every thing cloſes with that that is ſutable to it: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, it doth not come ſo much from the goodneſs of a thing but from the ſutablneſs of the object with the facultie. Now the things of the earth, they are ſutable to men that are of the earth, and therefore they mind them: the heart will abundantly run out upon that which is ſutable to it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Theſe things of the earth have a very fair ſhew in the fleſh, they have a kind of goodly appearance in the eye of ſence, yea, and in the eye of that reaſon that is now corrupted by ſin; we have a moſt elegant expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe earthly things, and earthly minded men ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their hearts ſet upon theſe things, it is in the 6. to the <hi>Gal.</hi> 12. verſe, <hi>As many as deſire to make a fair ſhew in the fleſh</hi> ſaith the Scripture, the words are to ſignifie when a man looks ſmug and neat, as you ſhall have ſome men dreſſe themſelves curiouſly, and having handſom bodys they look ſo trim, fine, handſom, and very brave to the eye of all that do behold them. So ſaith he, theſe men that are the falſe teachers, they deſire to make a fair ſhew in the fleſh, that is, they look upon the things of the fleſh as thoſe things that are very brave to the eye, and they love to have all things ſo compleat about them, that they may look ſmug, and carry themſelves with ſuch beauty before the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:30201:44"/>
world; Oh! this is their happineſs, this they take content in, they ſeem to have fine eſtates, and to have brave cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and all curious things about them, this looks ſo brave in the eyes of the world, and therefore it is that their hearts are upon them, they are here enemies to the Croſſe of Chriſt, they think ſuffering for Chriſt, poverty, diſgrace looks but untowardly. But now, thoſe that deſire to make a fair ſhew in the fleſh, that would have their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances well waſh'd, fair, and beautiful whereſoever they come, and be as ſombody in the world, theſe do thus and thus, theſe forſake the truths of God, and ſeek to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for themſelves in the things of the fleſh.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, Men naturally never knew better things than the things of the earth: and therefore no marvel though they mind earthly things ſo much: Children that are born in a dungeon and never knew any better place, they can play up and down in the dungeon: So it is with men that never knew what the things of heaven and eternal life meant, they can mind earthly things better than thoſe: but when once the Lord opens the eyes of their underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings to ſee into the reality, excellency, and glory of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things, they then wonder at their former blindneſs in minding ſuch poor, low, mean fooliſh rattles, as the things of the earth are.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, There are earthly principles continually dropt into men by converſe with other men that are men of the earth: 49. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11. and 13. <hi>Their inward thoughts is, that their houſes ſhall continue for ever, and their dwelling place to all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, they call their lands after their own names.</hi> Their hearts are ſet upon theſe things, then in the 13. verſe, <hi>This their way is their folly, yet their poſterity approve their ſayings.</hi> They are applauded by men, they ſee that every body do applaud them in theſe waies, and when they converſe one with another, they do converſe about the things of the earth, and the common example of men, they ſee every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy following the things of the earth, and are greedy after theſe toyes, and that likewiſe doth incline their minds to the things of the earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:30201:44"/>
Laſtly, The ſenſible experience they have had of the ſweetneſſe that there is in the things of the earth: This is that that takes off their minds from ſpiritual things, and makes them to mind the things of the earth.</p>
               <p>But though theſe be the reaſons why men do thus mind the things of the earth, and an earthly-minded man bleſſes himſelf in his way, and thinks he hath good reaſon for what he doth, and thinks all men fools that do not grovel in the ground like a mole with himſelf, and looks upon the matter of Religion but as meer words and talk, let them do what they will, I find contentment here: yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly at length it will prove folly, this their way, as the holy Ghoſt ſaith in the 49 <hi>Pſal. This their way it is but their folly,</hi> and in the end the wiſe men of the earth, thoſe that have ſought the things of the earth, and bleſſe themſelves in their way, they will prove to be the greateſt fools, the holy Ghoſt accounts them ſo: In the 17. of <hi>Jere.</hi> 11. verſe, <hi>As the Partridge ſitteth on eggs and hatcheth them not, ſo he that getteth riches and not by right, ſhall leave them in the midſt of his daies, and at his end ſhall be a fool.</hi> He applauds himſelf for the preſent in what he hath got, but at the end he ſhall be a fool.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, Conſider this, <hi>That all the things of the earth that thy mind and heart is upon, if thou couldſt poſſeſs them all as thine own, yet there is not ſo much good in them as to countervail the evil of the leaſt ſin, not of the leaſt ſin of thought; thy heart is mudling upon the things of the earth, and thinkeſt that thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt be bleſt if thou badſt thus and thus as others have.</hi> Let me tell thee, if thou haſt but one ſinful thought, there is more evil in that than there's good in all that ever thou ſhalt get all the daies of thy life in the world; and if this be ſo, that there is more evil in the leaſt fin than there is good in all the things of the earth, it concerns thee rather to have thy mind how to avoid ſin, or how to get the evil of ſin to be remov'd, and how to get thy ſin to be mortified, that concerns thee more than the minding and plodding about the things of the earth: that's one conſideration.</p>

                     <head>A Second Conſideration.</head>
                     <p>A ſecond is this that may take off the hearts of men from the things of the earth, <hi>That the chief things that are in the earth yea, name what terrene excellency poſſibly a man may be crowned with under Heaven, hath been the portion of Reprobates heretofore, and is to this day, and ſhall be the portion of multitudes whom God hates, and hath ſet apart to glorifie his infinite Juſtice upon eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.</hi> Shall thy mind and heart be ſet upon ſuch things as are the portion of Reprobates? will a Reprobates porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on content thee? will it ſerve thee? art thou ſatisfied with dogs meat? If it will not content thee, why is it that thy mind is ſo much upon the things of the earth? It may be thou that art poor and mean in the world; thy mind is upon ſome little matter: thou canſt never expect to have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great things in the world, and yet thou mindeſt them as if that there were thy portion, and thy happineſs, ſome

ſmall pittance to furniſh thy houſe, to provide for thy ſelf and thy poor family; Oh friend! if it were poſſible for thee to get the Empire of the whol world under thy foot, yet thou ſhouldeſt get no more than hath been the portion of ſuch as God hath hated; and if ſo be that Kingdoms and Empires have been the portion of Reprobates, why doeſt thou mind things that are lower abundantly, and let the ſtrength of thine heart flow out upon ſuch things as theſe are?</p>

                  <div n="3" type="consideration">
                     <head>A Third Conſideration.</head>
                     <p>A third conſideration is this, <hi>Surely God hath made man for higher things than the things of this earth.</hi> Oh! if thou hadſt but thy thoughts often working this way, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do I think in my conſcience hath God made the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men, for what end? why hath he ſent them hither into the world? Of all the creatures that God hath here upon the earth, he hath none capable to know him the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Firſt being of all things but only the children of men, &amp; God hath given them ſuch a nature as is capable of ſome converſe with him, ſurely then there be other things that God made man for than to have meat, and drink, and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>athes, and here to live a while only to enjoy creatures. Do not we reade often, That Jeſus Chriſt was God and Man, took mans nature upon him, and died for man? Surely there muſt be ſome other manner of things that are the fruit of the purchaſe of the blood of Chriſt than the things of the earth; Oh my brethren! had you but this ſetled upon you, that certainly God hath great, glorious, high, and wonderful thoughts about man-kind, this would be a mighty means to take off your hearts from the things of this earth, when thou haſt thy heart grovelling here: Oh but are theſe the things that God made man for? had not God higher thoughts in making of the children of men? do not I find in the word that when man was made there was a kind of Divine conſultation with the Trinity,

                        <hi>Come, let <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s make man</hi> according to our own Image? God had other thoughts of man than of other things. And if man were made for nothing elſe but meerly to dig in the earth, Certainly, the thoughts of God about man have been but very low and mean (as I may ſo ſpeak with holy reverence) for theſe are but low and mean things here that men enjoy in the earth.</p>

                  <div n="4" type="consideration">
                     <head>The Fourth Conſideration.</head>
                     <p>As God hath higher thoughts concerning man; <hi>ſo the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of mans Nature, the rational ſoul of man is of too high a birth for to have the ſtrength of it ſpent about the things of the earth.</hi> God breathed into man his ſoul: It's (I may ſay) a kind of a Divine ſpark, the ſoul of man it is of the ſame nature with Angels, a ſpirit as Angels are: the thoughts of the minds, the Faculties and Powers of the ſoul are more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious things than to be powred out as water upon the ground. If a man have a Golden Mill, he would not uſe it only to grind dirt, ſtraws, and rotten ſticks in. The mind of man, the thinking faculty is too high to be exerciſed in the things of this earth; the mind of man it is of a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent capacious Nature: it is fit to converſe, not only with Angels, but with the eternal God Himſelf, with Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; and to beſtow the ſtrength of ſuch a faculty that God hath put into the ſoul of man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch dirtie, droſſie, low, baſe, mean things, as earthly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded men and women do beſtow it upon, this muſt needs be a great evil. Know, the dignity of your Nature, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of your Mind, the Soul of man it is of a tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent being. Put all the world into the Ballance, with it it's nothing. Therefore you know what Chriſt ſaith, <hi>What ſhall it profit a man, to gain the whol world, and loſe his ſoul?</hi> The ſoul of the meaneſt gally-ſlave is more precious than Heaven and Earth, Sun, Moon, Stars, and all the hoſt of them: Let me add then, all the Silver and Golden mines under ground; and al the unſearchable Riches of the great
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:30201:46"/>
and wide Sea, yea put all theſe together; and the Soul of the moſt contemptible beggar that cries for a cruſt of bread at thy door, is unexpreſſibly more worth than all theſe: Now, if mans ſoul be of ſuch an high-born Nature, if God hath put ſuch a Spirit which is a ſpark of Heaven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the boſom, for man of him to imploy it in no other uſe and ſervice, but meerly to be an earth-worm to creep in and upon the ground: this muſt needs be a very great evil.</p>

                     <head>The fifth Conſideration.</head>
                     <p>The fifth Conſideration is, <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertainty of all theſe things, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertain Riches.</hi> How may any Cauſuality come and take away from thee al the things of the earth that thy mind is upon? God ſends but a little too much heat into the body, and puts thee into a feavour, and where's thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light then? thy body being either too much heated, or too much coold, what's become of all thy comfort here in this earth? Thou goeſt abroad, and art dangerouſly wounded by an enemy, what refreſhing then doeſt thou receive from all theſe things? Let me tell thee, thou art in the midſt of a thouſand thoſand Caſualities here, every moment ready to take away all the Comforts of the earth; and uſually at that time (obſerve it) when the minds of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are moſt fixed upon the earth, that's the time that God hath to ſtrike them in thoſe things, they be then neereſt to be depriv'd of the Comforts of the earth, when their thoughts and minds be moſt ſet upon them. As you know it was with the Rich man in the Goſpel, when he was bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf, and crying to his ſoul, Soul Soul, take thine eaſe, thou haſt goods laid up for many years; even that night (the text ſaith) this meſſage came so him, <hi>Thou fool, this night ſhall thy ſoul be taken away from thee, and then, whoſe ſhall al theſe things be?</hi> And at that time that <hi>Nebuchadnezzer</hi> was bleſſing himſelf in the pallace that he had built for His Honor, then there comes a meſſage to him from Heaven, ſo that he was preſently outed of all his Court-vanities to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:30201:47"/>
graze among the beaſts of the field. So you may find it in your own experience, that God hath many times then moſt croſt you in the things of the earth, when your minds and hearts have been moſt glued to them: and it may be in mercy, yea, it's a greater mercy to be croſt of theſe things at ſuch a time, than to proſper in the midſt of them; for it may be a good argument that God intends good to a ſoul, to croſſe him at that time when he is moſt earthly. Oh! many that have been godly indeed, but yet have bin earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minded, and have found God coming at ſuch a time and croſſing them in ſome earthly Contentment have ſeen cauſe to bleſſe God for thus dealing with them. Whither was I going? I was going altogether to the earth, and minding ſuch things, my heart was ſet upon them, and God came in in a ſeaſonable time, to ſhew me the vanity of my heart, and of thoſe things that my mind was buſied about; Oh it was a happy croſſe that I had at ſuch a ſeaſon, there was much of Chriſt that did hang upon it. And that's the fift Conſideration.</p>

                     <p>Conſider further, <hi>How ſhort thy time is that thou haſt here in this world.</hi> That's the argument of the Apoſtle, becauſe the time is ſhort, therefore <hi>let us uſe the world as if we uſed it not,</hi> therefore let our hearts be taken off from theſe things; we have but a little time, and a great deal of work, we have in this ſhort winter day of life to provide for eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, now conſidering the great weight of the work that doth depend upon us here in this world, it may be a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie reaſon for us to bid adue to all the things of this world; indeed if we had time enough for our work, and were ſure of our time then we might ſpend it about trifles. If a man comes into the Citie to do buſineſs, of great weight and conſequence, and hath but a little time to ſpend about it, he never minds any thing he ſees in the Citie, never minds any body that comes by him, or any ſhews in ſhops, what braverie there is there, but goes up and down the ſtreets minding only his own buſineſs. Oh! ſo it ſhould be with us my brethren; conſider the great work we have to do, and the little time that we have to effect that work in, there depends upon our little ſhort uncertain inch of time matters of more conſequence than ten thouſand thouſand worlds are worth and if we miſcarry in this little time of our lives, we are loſt and undone for ever, better we had never been born, or had been made toads or ſerpents, or the vileſt beaſts whatſoever, than reaſonable creatures. Oh! have you ſo much time for the ſpending the very ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of your ſouls upon the things of this earth, can you ſpare ſo many hours?

                     <p>Conſider therefore in the next place, <hi>That a little will ſerve the turn to carry us through this world.</hi> We are here but in our Pilgrimage, or in our voyage; now a little will ſerve the turn here for the carrying of us through this world: men will not take more in a journy than may help them. If a man that is to go a journy ſhould get a whol bundle of ſtaves and lay them upon his ſhoulder, and you ſhould ask him the reaſon why he carries that bundle, why ſaith he, I am going a great journy, and I know not what need I may have of ſtaves to help me; it's true, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a ſtaff in a mans hand will help him; thus <hi>Jacob</hi> was helped by his ſtaff over Jordan; but to carrie a bundle up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ſhoulder will hinder him: Now a little will ſerve your turn, if you have but meat and drink, food and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (ſaith the Apoſtle) be content; and the ſervants of God in former time, paſt through this world with a very little, and manie of them the leſs they had, the more peace and comfort they had in God, and they were the more fit to die. I remember <hi>Ecolampagius</hi> when he was to die being verie poor, profeſſ'd that he would not have been richer than he was, for he ſaw what a hindrance it was, and ſo he could paſs out of the world with more eaſe and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et a great deal; Certainly a little will ſerve the turn here: we ſay, Nature is content with a little; and if there were Grace it would be content with leſs; and therefore let not our minds be upon the things of the earth: we have not ſo much need of the things of the earth as we think for.</p>

                     <p>And then further, conſider though upon our minding the things of the earth we ſhould enjoy never ſo much; <hi>Yet there is no comfort, no good to be had in them any further than God will be pleaſed to let himſelf through them; they are but as channels to convey the bleſſing and goodneſs of God to us:</hi> Man lives not by bread, nor meat only, you are deceived to think that if you had ſuch and ſuch things you ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have a comfortable life, I ſay you may be deceived in this, for it is God in theſe that doth comfort the heart, there is a notable Scripture for this in the 62. <hi>Pſal.</hi> where the holy Ghoſt ſaith at the 10. verſe, <hi>Truſt not in oppreſſion, and become not vain in robbery, if riches increaſe, ſet not your hearts upon them,</hi> do not mind them, why? in the 11. verſe, <hi>God hath ſpoken once, twice have I heard this, That power belongeth unto God, if riches increaſe, ſet not thy heart upon them;</hi> let not your hearts and minds be upon riches, or any thing in this earth: why? God hath ſpoken once, twice have I heard, that is, again and again: God hath ſpoken effectually to me that all power to do any good belongeth unto him, it's not in riches, there's no power there for making of thee happy, but all belongs to him. This I confeſs is a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual meditation that earthly minded men will have but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle skill in, yet where earthly-mindedneſs prevails in any one of the Saints, this may do him good, whereas the truth is, it is not in the creature, or creature-comforts can do me good, if I had a thouſand times more than I have, I might be miſerable in the earth, and have as little comfort as thoſe that have leaſt, and therefore let me ſet my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon things above, and not on things on the earth.</p>

Let thy care be to do thy duty to thy father, to walk as a child, but let it not be for the things of the earth, thou doſt as much as diſavow the care of thy father for thee; and canſt thou beleeve that God ſhall give his Son to thee and not give thee all things elſe? hath not godlineſs the promiſes of this life as well as of that to come?

                     <p>The laſt that I ſhall name is this, <hi>That all that are Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of Religion, they are dead to the world, or ſhould be ſo:</hi> nay, if you be truly Religious you are ſo, by profeſſion you do profeſſe your ſelves to be dead unto the world. The Scripture makes this argument to take off mens hearts from the things of this world, in the 3. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2, 3. <hi>Set your affections on things above, not on things on the earth:</hi> why? <hi>for you are dead, and your life is hid with Chriſt in God.</hi> Ye are dead, the Apoſtle writes to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> and yet he tels them that they were dead; the Sripture ſpeaks much of the death of the Saints: As it's ſaid of women that liv'd in pleaſures in Timothy, that they were dead while they liv'd: ſo it may be ſaid of Chriſtians that they are <hi>dead</hi> while they live, dead to the world, I <hi>am crucified to the world</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) and we are dead with Chriſt, I find that ſome interpret that Scripture in the 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 29. <hi>Elſe what ſhall they do that are baptized for the dead?</hi> they interpret it thus, That all thoſe that came in, which were Heathens and converted to Chriſtianity and were baptized, they were baptized for dead men; that is, by their baptizm; now there was a profeſſion that they did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe themſelves from that time for ever as dead men to the world, <hi>baptized for the dead;</hi> you have it in ſome of your books <hi>over</hi> the dead, but the word is, <hi>for,</hi> and ſo it is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in this laſt tranſlation, <hi>For dead men:</hi> your baptizm is adminiſtred unto you as a ſign of your profeſſion, to be as dead men unto the world, ſo I find ſome carry it. This is the profeſſion of Chriſtians to be as dead men to the world; Oh do not diſhonor your profeſſion of Religion, for indeed there is a greater evil (as we ſaid) for profeſſors of Religion to be earthly minded than for any others, and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:30201:50"/>
yet how many are guilty of this? It's an obſervation of <hi>Luther,</hi> when God rivealed himſelf to <hi>Abraham</hi> and told him, that he would multiply his ſeed; he made uſe of two ſimilitudes, one was this, That he would make his ſeed as the ſtars of Heaven, and at another time God ſaith, that he would make his ſeed as the ſand upon the ſea ſhore; Now ſaith <hi>Luther,</hi> by theſe two expreſſions there is ſignified two ſorts of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, there are ſome that are as the ſtars of Heaven, that are heavenly minded; There are others that are as the ſand of the Sea: that is, There are ſome profeſſe themſelves to be of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed but are of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirits: Oh now, my brethren, we ſhould labor to have ſuch minds and hearts ſo as we ſhould appear to be the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as the ſtars of heaven, to be of the number of thoſe that are as the ſtars of heaven, that is, through hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly-mindedneſſe. But that we ſhall come to when we come to ſpeak of the converſation of Chriſtians, how it ought to be in heaven.</p>
                     <p>But now, if any one ſhould ſay, <hi>May we not mind earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things and heavenly things too?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Know there is a great miſtake here, you cannot ſerve two maſters, God and Mamon; and it's very obſervable that text of Scripture, in the 3. of <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2. verſe, mark the oppoſition, <hi>Set your affections on things above, not on things on the earth:</hi> they are there oppoſed one to another: Set your affections or minds, for ſo I think it is the ſame word with that in my text, who mind earthly things. A man cannot look up to heaven and down to the earth both at the ſame time, there is an oppoſition between theſe two, between the earthly-mindedneſs that hath been opened to you, and minding of heavenly things.</p>
                     <p>I but you will ſay, <hi>For theſe things while we are upon the earth we have need of them, how can we do otherwaies but mind them? When we come to heaven, there we ſhall have diſpoſitions ſutable to heaven, but ſure not till then?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To that I anſwer, Though Chriſtians do live upon the earth, yet they are not of the earth, there's a great deal of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:30201:50"/>
difference between one that is of the earth, and another that lives upon the earth: Chriſt ſaith concerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he was not of the earth, it's true, though he did live a while upon the earth, yet he was not of it: In the 3. of <hi>John</hi> 31. <hi>He that cometh from above, is above all, he that is of the earth is earthly, and ſpeaketh of the earth:</hi> now Chriſt while he ſpake theſe words he was upon the earth; but He was not of the Earth: And ſo it is with Chriſtians, they are upon the Earth, but they are not of the Earth, they are a people redeem'd from the earth, therefore that's not enough: it's true, theſe things are things that we need, therefore we muſt not mind them, for ſo in the 6. of <hi>Mat.</hi> where Chriſt ſpeaks againſt taking thought what we ſhall eat, or what we ſhall drink, or what we ſhall put on. Saith he, <hi>Your Heavenly Father knows you have need of theſe things;</hi> you have ſome need, I but you have need of other things, and greater need of other things than of theſe things, what need is there for thee to live upon the earth but in order to providing for eternity, and of living to the honor of Chriſt and the praiſe of his Goſpel? I ſay thou haſt no need of any thing on the earth but in ſubordination to higher things; there is no need thou ſhouldeſt live, but for ſome other end, and therefore let not that be any ſuch argument to plead for earthlineſs, as indeed an earthly ſpirit is very witty in pleading for its ſelf.</p>

leſt it proves with you as it doth with many that are dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of Veins of gold and ſilver under ground; that while they are digging in thoſe mines for riches, the earth many times fals upon them and buries them, ſo that they never come up out of the mine again: and ſo it is with many that are beginning in the way of Religion, that are dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in the mines of Salvation, for unſearchable riches, for that that is abundantly better than gold and ſilver; now while you are thus ſeeking for grace and godlineſs, Oh take heed that you be not covered with the earth while you are digging in the world, but keep wide open ſome place to Heaven, or otherwiſe if you dig too deep there will come up damps, if the earth falls not upon you, yet I ſay, there will be damps riſe from the earth that may choak you, if there be not a wide ſpace open that you may let the air that comes from heaven in to you. Thoſe that are dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging into Mines they are very careful to leave the place o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen for freſh air to come in; and ſo, though thou maieſt follow thy calling, and do the work that God ſets thee here for as others do, be as diligent in thy calling as any, yet ſtill keep a paſſage open to Heaven, that there may be freſh gales of grace come into thy ſoul, if at any time thou beeſt got into the world, if thou ſpendeſt one day and haſt not ſome ſpiritual air from Heaven, take heed, there's a damp coming up that will choak thee. Oh! that Chriſtians would conſider of this while they are here below! I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member I have read of <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his Comment upon the 72. <hi>Pſal</hi> the 19. verſ. ſaith the text, <hi>They that dwell in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall bow before him, and his enemies ſhall lick the duſt:</hi> He in a wittie way applied it to earthlie-minded men, ſaith he, If you do ſo lick the duſt, by this you will come to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted one of the enemies of God. It's true, the ſcope of the place is different, but take heed that in this metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſence that you do not lick the duſt and ſo come to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted an enemie to God.

they ſay Moles, though they be blind, yet if they be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the earth then their eyes are opened, and then they ſhake and tremble: and ſo though the earth may cloſe the eyes of men here for a while, yet certainly there will be a day when their eyes ſhall be opened, to ſee how they have gul'd and deceiv'd themſelves. And now it's worſe too in the time of the Goſpel to be earthly-minded than at other times, it was not ſuch an evil thing to be an earthly min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded man in the time of the Law, when all the promiſes of God were carried in a kind of earthly way. Though I do not ſay that all promiſes that were made to them under the Law were meer earthly, but they were carried in an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way; therefore you ſhall find when God promiſes his people in the time of the Law what great mercies they ſhall have, it is by earthly expreſſions, as of gold and ſilver and ſuch kind of things, and their promiſes for Heaven it went under the expreſſion of living in the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a type of Heaven, now though they were taken with earthly things when God reveal'd himſelf to them in an earthly manner; yet now in the time of the Goſpel, lift up your hearts for your calling is from above, now there are Heavenly things revealed, he that is from above is come amongſt us, and the Heavens are broken open, and the glory of it doth ſhine upon the Churches in a far more brighter manner than it did before.

the meditating of the death of Jeſus Chriſt: (I ſay) that's the great thing that wil take off the heart from the things of the earth: The looking upon Chriſt Crucified; how he that was the Lord of Heaven and Earth, yet what a low condition he put Himſelf into, meerly for the redeeming of us! The converſing much with the death of Jeſus Chriſt deads the heart much to the world. In the 3. to the <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians</hi> we have a notable text for that, in the example of <hi>Paul,</hi> he accounted all things as dung and droſſe for Jeſus Chriſt: at the 8. verſe, I <hi>account all things but loſs for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord, for whom I have ſuffered the liſs of all things, and do count them but D<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NG that I may win Chriſt.</hi> And then in the 19. verſe, <hi>That I may know Him, and the power of his Reſnrrection, and the fellowſhip of His Sufferings being made conformable unto his Death. Paul</hi> deſired to be ſo conformable to the very <hi>Death</hi> of Chriſt, that he accounted all things in the world but as dung and droſſe in compariſon of that; <hi>Paul</hi> had the death of Chriſt before his eyes, and meditated much on the death of Chriſt, and that meditation had a great impreſſion upon his ſpirit, that made him account all theſe things as droſſe, as dogs meat in compariſon, and that he might have fellowſhip with the death of Chriſt, Perhaps ſome of you may think of the glory of Chriſt in Heaven, and that may for the preſent make you leſſe worldly; but let me intreat you to meditate on the death of Chriſt, and know that there is an excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in Conformity even to the death of Chriſt, ſuch an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency that may take off your hearts from the things of the world. It's ſaid of the King of <hi>France,</hi> that he asking one once about an Eclypſe, ſaith he, I have ſo much buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the earth, that I take little notice of the things of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Oh my Brethren! for the cloſe of all, I beſeech you let not this be ſaid concerning any of you, that you have ſuch and ſuch worldly imployments, that you cannot enquire after Jeſus Chriſt.

take little notice of the things of Heaven; no, ſurely, the Saints of God have their buſineſſe in Heaven, (as we ſhall ſee God willing hereafter:) Their <hi>City Buſineſs,</hi> their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, their Aims, their Bent, it is higher than the things of this earth. There are things that a man may let out his thoughts and affections too as much as he wil: This ſhews the vanity of the things af this world, that a man had need be very wary how much he minds them, he cannot enjoy the comforts of this earth without ſome fear: but now, when he comes to converſe with Heaven, there he may let out himſelf to the uttermoſt; that ſhews the excellency of theſe things. And you that are but poor and mean in the things of this earth, be not diſcomforted, becauſe there is a charg from God that men ſhould not mind theſe things; ſurely there is no great matter in them, as God charges that we ſhould not mind them: Oh the excellency it lies in things above which are heavenly and ſpiritual, where the Saints have their converſation.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ome reade this Particle <hi>[For] [But:] But our Converſation is in Heaven.</hi> Our Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not as theirs: Certainly the Apoſtle doth intend this, to make a diſtinction from, or a difference between the Saints waies, and the waies of thoſe that were Enemies to the Croſſe of Chriſt: <hi>They mind Earthly things: But our Converſation is in Heaven:</hi> But becauſe of the particle, <hi>[For]</hi> our Converſation; therefore I think that it hath refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

unto the 17 verſe, for the 18. and 19. verſes are in a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentheſis, and therefore if you would know the ſcope of the Apoſtle in it, and what this hath relation to; (for) it is in the 17. verſe, <hi>Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk ſo as you have us for an enſample; for our Converſation is in Heaven,</hi> to it is to follow: he made a little degreſſion when he ſaid, Make us your example; then he ſpeaks of others, but many there are that walk thus and thus, and are enemies to the croſs of Chriſt, <hi>Whoſe belly is their god, whoſe glory is their ſhame, whoſe end is deſtruction, who mind earthly things; But our</hi> (or, <hi>for our) Converſation is in Heaven.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Take heed of following of thoſe whoſe belly is their god, who mind earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, for their end is deſtruction; but rather follow thoſe whoſe Converſation is in Heaven, for their end is, ſalvation: that's the ſcope of the words. Now then from the ſcope and the coherance of them, follow us for an example, For our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is in Heaven; ſo they are to be joyn'd together: from whence (firſt) before we come to ſpeak of this Heavenly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation that the Apoſtle mentions, we have this point, <hi>That the Examples of men whoſe Converſations are heavenly, are to be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Follow us as an example, for our Converſation is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. They are guided by the ſpirit of God, and the end of their Converſation is good, and therefore 'tis ſafe to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. In <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 20. there the Wiſe man ſpeaks of an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Why we ſhould imbrace wiſdom, becauſe that would <hi>teach you to walk in the way of good men, and to keep the paths of the Righteous.</hi> We ſhould obſerve the way of good men, &amp; keep the paths of the <hi>righteous.</hi> It's true, that the examples of the beſt men, though never ſo holy, are not a ſufficient rule for any action, If a man or woman doth any thing, though it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo good, meerly upon the example of another man, yet this that they do will prove ſin to them: I ſay, though the thing be good &amp; thou doeſt it upon the example of other good men, yet if that be al thy rule, the action wil be ſin to thee; for that is the rule of Chriſt to us, <hi>Whatſoever is not of faith is ſin.</hi> Now no example can be a ground ſufficient for faith; therefore, example alone is not a good rule. Yea, and ſomtimes we know
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:30201:55"/>
that Satan himſelf may transform himſelf into an Angel of light: and may for the prevailing of ſome evil make a great ſhew of ſome holineſs: and ſo, many groſſe Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites for a time have had much ſeeming holineſs in their lives: and therefore it muſt be taken for a certain truth that the examples of men never ſo holy are not a ſufficient rule. But yet thus far examples of men that are holy ſhould prevail with us.</p>
               <p>Firſt, They ſhould prevail with us more than other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, than examples of the moſt learned men; let men be never ſo great Rabbies, the example of one holy man whoſe Converſation is in Heaven, ſhould be more to us than the example of many Scholers. For many men that are learned may be very corrupt, they may go againſt their own conſciences; as certainly many do.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It ſhould prevail againſt the example of great rich men, who have goods laid up for many yeers: you ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther follow the example of thoſe that appear to be holy, than the example of the richeſt and greateſt in the places where you live.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It ſhould be more than the example of the Multitude, <hi>Joel,</hi> 3. 14. you have a notable Scripture there againſt following of Multitudes of men, you may ſee there that multitudes go to deſtruction; <hi>Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of deciſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It ſhould be more than the example of thoſe that are meerly related unto us: as children ſhould rather look at the example of godly men and women though they be ſtrangers, than of Father or Mother, or Uncle or Aunt, or the neereſt kindred, though their examples be not rules for our faith, yet they ſhould be more than the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of any others.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Though they ſhould not be rules or grounds of faith, <hi>yet they ſhould be enough to take off prejudices that come from accuſations of men.</hi> If men will accuſe the waies of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and if there be any prejudices taken up againſt the paths of Sion without ground, the example of godly men
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:30201:56"/>
ſhould be enough to make us ſtand out againſt them; it may be you hear many crying out bitterly againſt ſuch a way of Worſhip, and many falſe aſperſions are caſt upon it, becauſe it is not a National way of Worſhip, for few there be that follow it. Now do but obſerve what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of perſons do worſhip God in that way which ſome cal Hereſie, are they not of holy and blameleſs Converſations according to the Goſpel, the ſtricteſt Puritans? Now though you muſt not do as they do meerly from their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, yet their example ſhould have a great deal of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and influence upon you to take off prejudices, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer accuſations, and to calm and ſweeten your angry and bitter ſpirits.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Examples though not ſufficient ground and rule for faith, <hi>yet they ſhould be enough to make us to enquire after thoſe waies, and to examine and try, whether they have any footing in the Word, becauſe the followers of them, are very upright and circumſpect in their way.</hi> Let me at leaſt enquire after theſe waies, let me examine them by the light of the Goſpel, ſurely there is ſome probability that theſe waies are the very paths of Sion, and lead to the gate of Heaven, becauſe the Profeſſors of them are ſuch friends of Jeſus Chriſt; It's likely that theſe men ſhould know the mind of God that do converſe with God moſt, that lie in his boſom, as the beloved Diſciple in Chriſts: Is it not more likely that a man that is a familier friend, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes daily with ſuch an one that this man ſhould know his ſecrets, his will rather than a ſtranger? ſo all men in the world are ſtrangers to God, but only the Saints: they converſe with God, they are the men of his Counſel, and his heart, and therefore of all men in the world it's moſt likely that they ſhould have all the Wils of God revealed unto them: All Learning and Natural wiſdom cannot ſhew the mind of God ſo much as converſe with God, and an holy humble familiaritie with him; God loves to open his boſom to his hidden ones, to reveal his mind to them; and therefore when we ſee men that are godly whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:30201:56"/>
is in Heaven, that they walked in ſuch and ſuch waies, it ſhould make us to think it is like there is, more good in theſe waies than I am aware of at the preſent, it's like that ſuch men as God ſmiles upon, that they ſhould know the mind of God more than other men: therefore though I will not preſently conclude it's the mind of God, and do it meerly becauſe they do it, yet I'le examine and ſearch whether it be not the mind of God or no according to the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The example of godly men ſhould prevail thus far, to make us to take heed that we do not oppoſe thoſe waies except we have very cleer ground to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: then we may oppoſe them as <hi>Paul</hi> oppoſed <hi>Peter,</hi> and reſiſted him to the face, becauſe he did not go in a right way: let men be never ſo holy and godly, yet they may be oppoſed in their way; If upon any examination you ſee cleerly this is not the way of God, I find it to be otherwiſe, not others think it's not the way of God, and ſuch and ſuch are of a contrary mind; No, but I have been exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it by the Word of God, and laying the rule to my conſcience, and my conſcience to that, and I find it to be diſagreeing to the mind of God, then ye may ſpeak or write againſt it, but do it not otherwiſe. If ye ſee men holy, men whoſe Converſations be in Heaven, don't op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it becauſe men do, be ſure your ground be good, and you be cleer in it if you do oppoſe it, otherwiſe you may be in danger of fighting againſt God when you oppoſe them: therefore make ſo much uſe of the example of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, holy men, as not to oppoſe the way but upon cleer Scripture-evidence to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, The example of godly men ſhould prevail thus far with us, <hi>As to prepare us to let in any truth that they do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs and practice.</hi> When we come to examine what is in the waies of God, and Heaven, in our examination, come with prepared hearts to let in the Truths God ſhall reveal unto us, the rather becauſe we ſee ſuch holy &amp; godly men have imbraced thoſe truths before us; when precious Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Truths
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:30201:57"/>
are delivered to us by the hands of the ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt, then thoſe very Truths in our eye are like apples of gold in pictures of ſilver, as beautiful as golden fruit in ſilver diſhes.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, The example of godly men ſhould prevail thus far, as after we have examined, and found their way to be according to the Truth indeed, then their example <hi>ſhould confirm us in the Truth:</hi> ſhould help to ſettle us more in the Truth, ſhould comfort and encourage us in ſuch and ſuch holy courſes; becauſe we find not only that we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of it, and we ſee it to be the way of God, and have experience of it, but others ſee it and they are convinc'd of it, others that are ſo godly they find much communion with God in it; now this ſhould mightily ſtrengthen and further us in that we go on in the ſame way that the Saints of God go on in: And indeed, it ſhould be a very great grief to any godly man, that he ſhould differ from other godly men, though it cannot be but that we ſhould differ ſometimes, becauſe we are imperfect here, yea, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a weak Chriſtian knows that which a ſtrong Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an may be ignorant of, (I ſay) it fals out ſo ſometimes, that God in ſome things reveals himſelf to thoſe that are weak and hides himſelf from thoſe that are ſtrong; ſo that here in this world it cannot otherwiſe be expected for the preſent, till the time that the New Jeruſalem ſhall be let down from God out of Heaven, and then the Saints will be all of one mind and walk all in one way, but till then there cannot be expected but that there ſhould be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent waies of the Saints; but yet I ſay it ſhould be a very great heart-trouble to godly men to ſee that they are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated to go in different waies from other godly men: and on the other ſide a great encouragment and ſtrengthening when the Saints go on in one way together with their faces towards heaven.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>What's to be done when Examples of Godly men are contrary?</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IF you ſay, <hi>What ſhould we do when we have contrary exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and both ſides godly men; ye very godly men whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is in Heaven, ſome go one way, and others as godly as they go another way? what ſhall people do then, when they ſee that either way holy men go in?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> To that I anſwer only theſe two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, God by this means puts you to more ſtrict exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of things, and doth teach you by this, that every Chriſtian though never ſo weak, yet ſhould have a bottom and ground for their faith, and practice out of the Word themſelves, and never did God teach this leſſon more ſtrongly than now he doth, that we ſhould all of us, not ſatisfie our ſelves in any point of Religion, nor in any pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Religion, but what we can our ſelves find and feel footing for out of the Word. In former times Chriſtians were very much led by examples, and a few examplary godly profeſſors would carry all the well affected in thoſe places with them, all that did pretend towards godlineſs would be very loth to go in a different way to ſome emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent godly men, but though perhaps their affections were good, and God may accept of their good affections, yet certainly they were not ſo grounded and eſtabliſhed in the truth as God would have them; but now the Lord ſeems to go another way with his people, and puts every one, the weakeſt, the meaneſt ſervant, to ſearch and to find out the truth themſelves, and to have the knowledge of it themſelves, and we hope the time is at hand for the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of that promiſe, <hi>That all the people ſhall be taught of God,</hi> ſhall be taught to underſtand themſelves what are the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and grounds of the practice of Religion, and thoſe
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:30201:58"/>
tenents and opinions which they hold, and when peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple come to underſtand the grounds themſelves, they have a great deal more ſtrength, and they will come to be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed more than formerly they have been, this good will come of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When you ſee examples on both ſides go con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary one unto the other, and both godly, yet examine but this, Which way hath moſt earthly inducements, for that way that hath moſt earthly inducements to draw or bias the heart, that way lies under the moſt ſuſpiſion; for men that are godly, yet they are but godly in part, and though they may be as godly as other men in ſome other things, yet there may be a temptation, the temptation for Earthly contentment if it lies more one way than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you are to be more wary of one than the other. But that we may paſſe this point, becauſe it is but from the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herance, by way of uſe but in a word or two.</p>

               </head>
               <p>IF the example of men whoſe Converſation is in Heaven is to be followed, hence then are to be rebuked thoſe that rather follow the example of wicked and ungodly ones, if they be great, or learned, or the example of the multitude, will rather follow the example of any than the example of thoſe whoſe Converſation is in Heaven: thou doeſt thus and thus, and yet ſay, Do not others do ſo? but who are they that do ſo? can you ſay in your conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, that you think that they that do ſo have their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations in Heaven, you will do as they do? If there be any example that you will follow, they ſhould be ſuch that you can take it upon your conſciences, that theſe are the men who have their Converſations above; you will do
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:30201:58"/>
as others do, in drinking; ſwearing, Sabbath-breaking, and in all manner of prophaneſs; have theſe their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations in Heaven? Certainly you that do ſo, you follow the example of thoſe who have their Converſations in hell. But it may be you have ſome neighbors live by you whoſe Converſations are blameleſs, yea, they are Heavenly, and when you are in your good moods, your conſciences wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to them, and you could wiſh that you might die the death of the righteous; are there not ſome that live in the ſame families, ſtreets, or towns where you live, that though ſometimes your hearts are againſt them, you op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them, and ſcorn them, and ſpeak againſt them, yet when you are in any good temper, or afraid of death, then you could wiſh that you were as they are, and might die their death; now will you not follow their example, but rather the example of others, whoſe examples are in ſuch things as are ſutable to your vile, ſinful, and baſe luſts? We know that theſe examples of holie men ſhall riſe up in judgment againſt you another day, the Lord will condemn you from their example, and ſay, Did not ſuch and ſuch live in the familie and place where you liv'd, and did not you behold their holie and gracious Converſation, and ſhall the example of ſuch and ſuch vile wretches be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed rather than the example of my Saints? (I ſay) this will ſtop your mouthes and aggravate your condemnation in the great Audit-day: Some there are, that are ſo far from following the example of thoſe whoſe Converſations are in Heaven, as they rage and fret againſt them, and do what they can to darken the glorie of their holie lives, and if they can but have any miſreport of them they will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it what poſſibly they can to the end that they might eclipſe the holineſs of their lives, that ſo they may ſtop their own conſciences, whereas were there not ſomething to darken the luſter and beautie of the lives of the Saints, certainlie mens hearts would condemn them for walking in contrarie waies unto them, and therefore for relief of their conſciences that they may not condemn them for
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:30201:59"/>
walking in waies contrary to them they do what they can to ſpew upon their glory, and are glad if they can hear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ill report of them; and will follow them to their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt, and all becauſe their corrupt hearts are againſt the holineſs of their lives and Converſations.</p>
               <p>And then laſtly, <hi>Let thoſe that profeſs Religion labor to walk ſo as their examples may be convincing others:</hi> Is there ſuch a power in holy examples to prevail with men? you that profeſs Religion, make this an argument to work upon your hearts, that your Converſation may be more in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that ſo your example may do the more good in the place where you live: you that profeſs Religion and yet have earthly ſpirits, and live ſcandalouſlie, and vilie, Oh know! you live to do as much miſchief almoſt as a man can do in this world, no greater miſchief than for one to profeſs Religion, and yet for his Converſation to be wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and ungodly, and ſo to give the Lye to his profeſſion. But for that we ſpake to heretofore, when we treated upon that Scripture, <hi>Only let your Converſation be as becomes the Goſpel.</hi>

               <p>THus we proceed to the principal Doctrinal Truths, <hi>For our Converſation is in Heaven.</hi> Our Citie Converſation, our Citizen-like behavior, or Citie Burges eſtate, for ſo the word ſignifies, our carriage like free denizens it is in Heaven: now from thence you have, <hi>Firſt,</hi>

                  <hi>That the Saints are the Citizens of Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, That their behavior and Converſation even while they are in this world it is in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the firſt (but briefly to make way to the ſecond) <hi>The Saints of God, they are the Citizens of Heaven, they are all free Denizens, Burgeſſes of Heaven.</hi> In the 2. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 19. there you
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:30201:59"/>
may ſee how God hath gathered all the Saints together to be fellow-Citizens of Heaven: <hi>Now therefore ye are no more ſtrangers and forreigners, but fellow Citizens with the Saints and of the houſhold of God.</hi> They have an Heavenly Citie here in the Church: the Church it is a Heaven to the Saints, and as a type of that Heaven that they ſhal come into to live for ever both with the Saints and Angels hereafter. And in the 11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. it's ſpoken of <hi>Abraham, He ſojourned in the Land of Promiſe, as in a ſtrange Country, dwelling in Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles with</hi> Iſaac <hi>and</hi> Jacob <hi>the heirs with him of the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, for he looked for a City which hath foundations, whoſe buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and maker is God.</hi> It ſeems then that all the Cities in the world in compariſon of this Citie have no foundations; <hi>Abraham</hi> looked for a Citie that hath foundations, and whoſe builder and maker is God: The builders and makers of theſe Cities are men, the founders of the moſt famous Cities in this world have been men, and manie times wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and ungodlie men are the builders of them: The firſt Citie that we reade of was built by <hi>Cain.</hi> The builders and makers I ſay of theſe Cities are men, laboring men: But <hi>Abraham</hi> look'd for a Citie that had foundations, whoſe builder and maker is God. And in the 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 22. <hi>But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the City of the living God, the Heavenly Jeruſalem:</hi> mark, <hi>and to an innumerable company of Angels;</hi> ſo that you are to have them your fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Citizens, <hi>The Heavenly Jeruſalem,</hi> that is here in the Church: which is in compariſon of Jeruſalem that was in Canaan called the Heavenly Jeruſalem, ſo that they are Citizens of Heaven even as they are Members of the Church: the Saints of God here in the Church are ſaid to dwell in Heaven, but in that their Citie there are an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable company of Angels alſo, that plainly notes that it hath reference unto the glorious Heaven of the Saints that they are the Citizens of; the Saints are the Citizens of Heaven, there they dwell: in the 13. of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> 6 and 8. verſes, (this would ſerve for proof of this thing and ſo for the other point that remains, That their
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:30201:60"/>
Converſation it is in Heaven) <hi>And he opened his mouth in blaſphemy againſt God, to blaſpheme his Name and his Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and them that dwell in Heaven. And it was given unto him to make war with the Saints, and to overcome them.</hi> Now theſe were not in Heaven, that is, in their bodies they were not in Heaven for the preſent; But they are ſaid to dwell in Heaven becauſe they are of the Church here, and they are free Denizens of Heaven too, of the Heaven of the Saints that they ſhall live in hereafter in a more glorious way; They are <hi>Now</hi> Citizens of it; and they may be ſaid to dwell in Heaven, as we ſhall ſee afterward in the opening of their Converſations being in Heaven.</p>

               </head>
               <p>NOW the Saints are Citizens of Heaven, For, Firſt, <hi>Their names are all inrold in Heaven,</hi> They are written in Heaven, in the 10. <hi>Luke</hi> 20. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in this, That your names are written in Heaven.</hi> In Heaven is the Books of life where all the Names of the Saints are written. <hi>Philip.</hi> 4. 3. <hi>Whoſe names</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are written in the Books of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The Saints are the Citizens of Heaven, <hi>for they have Chriſt their Head gone before to take poſſeſſion of Heaven in their names, therefore they have a right to Heaven.</hi> As a man may be a Citizen, although he ſhould travel in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Country, yet his name being inrol'd there, and he having poſſeſſion there, he may be ſaid to be a Citizen though he be in a ſtrange land for the preſent in his body: So the Saints have their names inrold in Heaven, they have Jeſus Chriſt their head that is gone before in their names to take poſſeſſion for them, and to provide Mantions for them; as in the 14. <hi>John.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:30201:60"/>
Thirdly, <hi>When ever they do actually beleeve, they do take up their freedom;</hi> Their names were there Inrold from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: and ſo Chriſt at his aſcention went and took poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but when they beleeve actually, they do as it were take up their freedom in that Citie. There's many men that are born free, yet there's a time when they take it up: and ſo others that have ſerv'd for their freedom, yet it may be a long time before they be made free: and ſo the Saints when they do actually beleeve they come to take up their freedom in the Citie of Heaven, and are made Free Burgeſſes of Heaven.</p>
               <p>And hence (in the fourth place) <hi>They come no more to be as ſlaves;</hi> they are not bondſlaves as before, they are delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from bondage being made free of Heaven. As if ſo be that forreigners, or ſuch as are ſlaves ſhould come to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchized, then they have the ſame freedom as others have, and are admitted to the like City-priviledges, and they are no more to be accounted as ſlaves: ſo thoſe that are by nature bondſlaves to ſin and Satan, yea, and ſuch as are under the bondage of the Law, yet when they come to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, they are infranchized in Heaven, and are delivered from the bondage of the Law, Sin, and Satan, they are ſaid to be free-men of the Citie of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, <hi>All the Saints have right to all the common ſtock, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, and riches of Heaven;</hi> whatſoever priviledges belong to the Charter of Heaven, the Saints have right and title to them all. As in great Cities there is a Common ſtock and Treaſury that is for publick occaſions, and every Citizen hath ſome intereſt in it; ſo the Saints (I ſay) have intereſt in all the Common-ſtock and Treaſury and all the riches that there are in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, <hi>The Saints are the Citizens of Heaven, they have for the preſent the ſame confirmation of their happy eſtate that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and thoſe bleſſed ſouls have that are raſident in Heaven:</hi> (I ſay) they have this priviledg now by being Citizens of Heaven, that though their bodies be not in the higheſt Heavens, yet they have their happineſs confirmed as ſure
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:30201:61"/>
as the Angels in Heaven have, and as any bleſſed ſouls in <hi>Abraham:</hi> boſom, look how they are confirmed in a happie eſtate ſo as they cannot be made miſerable, ſo is every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever, though he lives in this world, he hath this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg in being a Citizen of Heaven, that he is confirmed in a happie eſtate, that all the powers in hell and in the world can never make this ſoul to be miſerable, and this is a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty priviledg of being a Citizen of Heaven, he is more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged than <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradice, for <hi>Adam</hi> he was not confirmed and ſtabliſhed when he was made in the ſtate of innocencie, but every Beleever is confirmed and ſtabliſhed as the Angels in Heaven are.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, They have this priviledg, <hi>By being Citizens, they have priviledg of free-trade to Heaven.</hi> You know, that Free-men in the Citie have priviledg of Trade more than Forreigners have; Forreigners are fain to pay Cuſtome and double taxes more than the Free-Citizens. So the Saints, they have the priviledg of Free-trade in Heaven, for any thing that doth concern them; they have a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intercourſe with Heaven which others have not.</p>
               <p>Eightly, <hi>They have now for the preſent Communion with the Angels of Heaven:</hi> there is Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion &amp; Commerce between the Saints here and the Angels upon this ground, becauſe they are fellow Citizens; and in that place of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> before quoted, <hi>We are come to the Heavenly Jeruſalem, and to the innumerable company of Angels:</hi> There is a great deal of intercourſe between the Saints and Angels here upon earth, the Angels look upon them as their fellow Citizens, and are miniſtring ſpirits for the good of the Elect, and they do very great ſervices for the Church-men here in this world upon this ground, becauſe they look upon them as their fellow Citizens.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, <hi>They have the protection of Heaven, being the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of Heaven:</hi> I ſay, they have Heavens protection. As one that is a Citizen, he hath the protection of the Law of the Citie, &amp; of the power of the Citie to defend him; hence we reade of <hi>Paul,</hi> that becauſe he was a <hi>Roman</hi> it was dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:30201:61"/>
to meddle with him, as in the 22. of <hi>Acts</hi> 25. verſe, as they bound him with thongs, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid unto the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion that ſtood by, <hi>Is it lawful for you to ſcourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Take heed what you do, I am free of the Citie of <hi>Rome:</hi> And mark, (ſaith the Scripture) when the Centurion heard that, he went and told the chief Captain, ſaying, Take heed what thou doeſt, for this man is a Roman, he hath the protection of the City. Thus the Saints are Citizens of Heaven, They are not Romans, but of the Heavenly Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, and when any are about to wrong one of them, they had need take heed what they do for he is a Citizen of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the King of Heaven is his King to protect him; and he ſits and laughs at the enemies of the Church: And the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Angels themſelves they are their guard, to guard all theſe Citizens, and to protect them, and this is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable eſtate of all the people of God, that they are the Citizens of Heaven. <hi>Our City Converſe.</hi> All this I note out of the ſignification of the word in the original, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the underſtanding of the propriety of the language, and the word, we ſhould not have the underſtanding of this truth.</p>
               <p>Whereſore my brethren it being thus, it ſhould teach all the people of God to walk as becomes Citizens, not to be rude in their behavior; 'tis a diſhonor to Citizens to be rude in their behavior, it's enough for Country people that never had any education to be rude; but certainly the Saints of God, they have the education of Heaven (this may be added for a tenth Particular) They have the holy Ghoſt to be their Inſtructer, to bring them up in holy and good manners that is ſutable to Heaven, this the Saints have; and manifeſt it in your Converſations, be not rude in your way, prize your priviledg of being a Citizen of Heaven; it's that that coſt Jeſus Chriſt dear to purchaſe this infranchizement and liberty for you: we reade in the 22. of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Captain when he heard that <hi>Paul</hi> was a <hi>Roman,</hi> in the 27. verſe: their chief Captain came and ſaid
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:30201:62"/>
to him, <hi>Tell me, art thou a Roman?</hi> He ſaid, <hi>Yea.</hi> And the chief Captain anſwered, <hi>with a great ſum obtained I this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> anſwered, <hi>I was free-born.</hi> They were wont to give great ſums to purchaſe freedoms of the City. Oh! this City that here we are ſpeaking of, hath ſuch priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as is beyond any in the world: And no man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man can come to be free of this City but it is by a great purchaſe: No man can ſay as <hi>Paul</hi> did here, that he was born free; no, but if he came to be free of Heaven it was with a great purchaſe, it was with the purchaſe of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt that was more worth than all the world. And if the Son makes you free, then you ſhall be free indeed, and therefore prize this as a great mercie; while you live here in this world, account it as a great mercie that you are a Citizen of Heaven, account your happineſs to conſiſt there, it is more than to have Houſe and Lands here; for a man to have a freedom of ſome Citie, it is more than to have Houſe and Land in the Wilderneſs: What though the Lord doth order things ſo as while thou liveſt in the wilderneſs of this world thou haſt no habitation of thine own, yet certainly the Lord hath made thee free of Heaven, it was purchaſed for thee by the blood of Jeſus Chriſt: Now by that price that it coſt thou mayeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that there is ſome great matter in it, that thou art a free Denizen of Heaven.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>How the Saints have their Converſation in Heaven, Opened in Nine Particulars.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>BUt now, our Converſation ſhould be anſwerable; and now we come more fully up to the ſcope of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle; <hi>But our Converſation is in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Converſations of the Saints that are free Citizens of
<pb n="701" facs="tcp:30201:62"/>
Heaven ought to be anſwerable; though their Co-habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be in this world, yet their Converſation it ſhould be in Heaven; in the 7. of <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. 18. there you reade of the excellent eſtate of the Saints, <hi>But the Saints of the moſt High ſhall take the kingdom, and poſſeſs the kingdom for ever:</hi> That that is tranſlated here, <hi>The Saints of the moſt High,</hi> it is not only meant of the Moſt High God, but the Saints of the high Places, ſo 'tis tranſlated by ſome, for the Saints are the Saints of high places in regard of their intereſt in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and in regard of their Converſations ſutable to the place, in the 2. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 6. <hi>And hath raiſed us up together, and made us ſit together in Heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> The Saints are ſet in Heavenly places, Heavenly dignitie, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly privileges, Heavenly prerogatives, yea, and they themſelves may be ſaid to be in Heavenly places though their bodies be upon the earth, their ſouls are in Heavenly places, their Converſation is in Heaven, They are the Saints of the High God, and they are ſet in high places.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, <hi>What is this Converſation that is in Heaven that is here ſpoken of.</hi> I ſhall open it in theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, The aim and ſcope of their hearts, it is Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-ward that the Saints look at, as their aim and ſcope is Heaven, they look upon themſelves in this world as pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims and ſtrangers, Heaven's their home, and their eye is there, their end, their ſcope, whatſoever they do it is for Heaven ſome way or other to fit them for Heaven, and to lay in for Heaven againſt they ſhall come and live there, their Converſation therefore is in Heaven: All that they do, eating, drinking, going about their buſineſs, yet I ſay their aim it is Heaven. I remember it's reported of <hi>Anaragorus</hi> a Philoſopher, that being asked wherefore he liv'd, he ſaid, he was born to contemplate the Heavens, he made it the end of his life for which he was born to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template Heaven; Being a Phyloſopher and having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in the motions of the Heavens, he took ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in it, that he accounted it the end for which he was born. So the Saints look at Heaven as their Center that
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:30201:63"/>
they aim at, that's their ſcope: we (ſaith the Apoſtle) do not look at things that are ſeen, but at things that are not ſeen, nothing in the Earth is our ſcope, but Heaven is our ſcope, and ſo their Converſations may be ſaid to be in Heaven in that reſpect.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Their Converſations are in Heaven, for they are acted by Heavenly principles in all their waies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Heavenly principles you will ſay, <hi>What are they?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a Heavenly Principle, That God is all in all: that's a Principle that the Saints are guided by, in Heaven they look upon God to be all in all unto them, ſo do the Saints here, in what they do, in what they are, in what they enjoy, they act upon this Principle, that it's God that is all in all, whatſoever I ſee in the creature, yet it's God that is all in all to me, I act by vertue of this Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>That God the infinite Firſt-being, is infinitely worthy of all love for himſelf, that's a Heavenly Principle: the Saints that are in Heaven, they look upon the infinite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie and glorie of God, they look upon him as the Firſt-Being of all things, having all excellencie, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie enough to ſatisfie all creatures for ever, and look upon him as infinitly worthy of all love and ſervice for himſelf; know this is a heavenly Principle: So the Saints their converſation is in Heaven, they are acted by heavenly prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; I look upon ſuch and ſuch things in the world whereby I may go in credit, encreaſe, or comfort, this is an earthly principle: But when my heart is ſo upon God, that it looks upon him as infinitly excellent and worthy of all love, ſervice, fear, honor, and worſhip for himſelf alone, whatſoever becomes of the creature God is worthy of all for that infinite excellencie in himſelf; this is a heavenly principle: and for one to be acted in his life by ſuch a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple as this is, this is to be acted by heavenly principles, not by ſuch low, and baſe principles as the men of the world are, but by heavenly principles.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Their Converſations are in Heaven.</hi> For here
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:30201:63"/>
though they live in the world, they have communion with the God of Heaven that is above in the whol courſe of their lives. In the 1. Epiſtle by <hi>John</hi> 1. chap. you have divers excellent expreſſions about our communion with God. In the 3. verſe, <hi>That which we have ſeen and heard declare we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, That ye alſo may have fellowſhip with us, and truly, our fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And then in another Scripture we reade of the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the holy Ghoſt, Thereis Communion with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and holy Ghoſt. Now what makes Heaven but God? we ſay, where the King is there's the Court, where God is there's Heaven, let God be where he will. There is ſome controverſie among ſome, where the Saints ſhall be after the Reſurrection; ſome think it ſhall be ſtill here, and yet with all the glory that the Scripture ſpeaks of. Now it's no great matter where it be, ſo it be where God is, thoſe that have Communion with God, they are in Heaven, their Converſation is in Heaven: now it's that that is the life of the Saints, their Communion with God; thy life it is to have communion with the Creature, that is for thee to cloſe with the contents of the Creature, and the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that is in man to taſt any thing, or to have any delight in any thing in this world, when there is a ſutable object to the facultie, that's his Communion with the Creature; As now a Drunkard, there is a kind of Communion that he hath meerly with lude company, and with the creature to pleaſe his ſence for a while, there's all the communion that he hath: But what a different Converſation is this, for one meerly to pleaſe his ſence in meat and drink a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while, and another to have communion with Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt? The Saints here in this world have not an Imaginary but a Real Communion with the Father Son and holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Communion, you will ſay, what's that?</p>
               <p>By Communion with God we mean this, The acting of the ſoul upon God, and the receiving in the influence of the goodneſs and love and mercy of God into the ſoul:
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:30201:64"/>
When there is a mutual acting of the ſoul upon God and God upon the ſoul again; as when friends have Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion one with another, that is, that one acts for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the other, there is a mutual imbracing and opening of hearts one upon another for the ſatisfying of the Spirits one of another: So communion with God is the mutual actings of the ſoul upon God, and God upon the ſoul a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: The Saints they ſee the face of God, and God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in the face of the Saints: And they let out their hearts to God, and God lets out his heart to them. We cannot expreſſe this to ſtrangers, a ſtranger ſhall not meddle with this joy, this is a myſtery, a riddle to the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal world. Do but you conſider this, that what Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion you have with your lude company, to ſit, and eat, and drink, and play, and tell ſtories all day long, this you think is a brave life; but now, that the communion of the Saints is raiſed higher, and the comfort of the Saints is not in ſuch poor, low, baſe things as thine is, the Saints have comfort in God the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt, in an infinite higher way, and in that reſpect their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations are ſaid to be in Heaven: And eſpecially when they are with God in his Ordinances they cannot be content except they have Communion with God there, it's note<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for them to call upon the Name of God, to kneel down and to uſe ſome humble broken hearted expreſſions; Oh but, what communion have I with God and Jeſus Chriſt and the holy Ghoſt in my duties at this time! I come to the Word and other Ordinances, Oh! but what communion have I with God in them? I cannot be ſatisfied except I taſt and ſee how good the Lord is; I cannot go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad about my buſineſſe but with a heavy heart except I hear ſome thing from Heaven this morning; all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of their lives do depend upon this, in having commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Father Son and holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Their Converſation may be ſaid to be in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Becauſe they do live according to the Laws of Heaven:</hi> They do not here in this world live according to the Laws
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:30201:64"/>
of men, &amp; the luſts of men, but they look for their directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from Heaven, What rule is there from Heaven to guide me? There muſt be ſome word from the God of Heaven to order and guide them in their waies, or elſe they cannot tell how to ſute with them; Indeed while they live in the Cities of the world they muſt obey the Laws of men, but ſtill it is in order to the Laws of Heaven, the main thing that they ſubmit to, is the Statute Laws of Jeſus Chriſt the great Law giver; becauſe there is a Law of Heaven that doth require them for to obey the Laws of men that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thoſe Laws of Heaven, therefore they do obey them; but the Laws of Heaven are thoſe that the Saints look after for their direction in all their waies, ſuch and ſuch a thing I have a mind to, but will the Law of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven juſtifie me in this? have I any word from Jeſus Chriſt to guide me in ſuch a way? I dare not do otherwiſe than according to the Will and Scepter of Chriſt, they muſt be my rule in all my waies: whereas before thy luſt was thy rule, and thy own ends thy rule; and the common courſe of the world thy rule; but now the Laws of Heaven are thy rule; and therfore their Converſations are in Heaven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are guided by the Laws of Heaven: Heaven is their aim, They are acted by heavenly Principles, They converſe with the God of heaven, And then fourthly, They live according to the Laws of heaven.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, Their thoughts and hearts are ſet upon heaven, as he ſaith, <hi>The ſoul is where it loves rather than where it lives;</hi> where the heart is there's the ſoul, there the man may be ſaid to be. Now the Saints have their hearts in heaven, their thoughts in heaven, their meditations in heaven, working there, <hi>When I awake I am alwaies with thee (ſaith David.)</hi> And Oh how ſweet are the thoughts of heaven unto the Saints! While thou art mudling in the world, and plodding for thy ſelf in the things of this world, If God ſhould come to thee and ſay, Where art thou? as he ſaid to <hi>Adam;</hi> yea ſometimes while thou art at prayer and hearing the Word, Where are thy thoughts, and about
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:30201:65"/>
what? even as we ſay in the proverb, are running about a Wool-gathering.</p>
               <p>But now come to one whoſe Converſation is in Heaven, he keeps his thoughts and meditations there continually, meditating on the glorious things that are reſerved in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. As I remember I have read of that holy man, Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> that being in the midſt of a dinner, and people won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what he was a muſing about, he preſently breaks out, <hi>For ever, for ever, for ever,</hi> for almoſt half a quarter of an hour he could not be ſtill'd, but he cries, for ever, for ever, for ever. So far as any man or woman hath their Converſation in Heaven their thoughts are there, thinking Oh eternity, eternitie, to be for ever in Heaven, to live for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with Chriſt and God, and Oh the Crown of glory that is there! when will that bleſſed day come when I ſhall come to enjoy thoſe good things that are there? his thoughts will be there, and he is longing to be there, his love and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and affections will be working there. It's ſaid of the people of Iſrael, <hi>Acts,</hi> 7. 39. That their hearts turned back again to Egypt; they never returned in their bodies to Egypt, but their hearts were there, they would fain have the Onions and Fleſh-pots that were in Egypt, their hearts were there. So it may be ſaid of many, that though they come and hear the Word, yet their hearts are in their ſhops, their hearts are after their covetouſneſs; but it's contrary with the Saints, Though they live here in this world, yet their hearts are in Heaven: As I remember it's written of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> that ſhe ſaid, If they rip'd her open they ſhould find <hi>Callis</hi> in her heart; And ſo it may be ſaid of Saints, whoſe Converſations are in Heaven; I ſpeak not of all Profeſſors of Religion, for it's ſaid of bodies, (when <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of the reſurrection) there are bodies Celeſtial, and bodies Terreſtial, ſo I may ſay, There are Profeſſors Celeſtial, and Profeſſors Terreſtial, but as for ſuch whoſe Converſations are in Heaven, who walk with God, and live here the lives of Heaven upon Earth, If they were rip'd up, you ſhould find Heaven in their hearts; un-rip many
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:30201:65"/>
mens hearts, and there's nothing but the earth, unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and baſeneſs; ſuppoſe God ſhould come this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and rip up all your hearts, and diſcloſe them to all the men of the world, what a deal of filthy ſtuff would be found in many of your hearts? but for ſuch whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations are in Heaven, they would be ready to have God unrip their hearts when he pleaſeth, Lord, try, Lord, ſearch me, Lord, examine and ſee what is in my heart; I'le but put this now to you as in the Name of God, and let con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience anſwer, What do you think would be found in your hearts if they ſhould be unrip'd now? and if your conſciences tell you, Oh Lord! if my heart ſhould be rip'd up now, there would be a filthy deal of ugly and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtuff there, ſurely I have not had my Converſation in Heaven, my heart hath been ſinking even down to low, and baſe things: but now, for thoſe whom this text concerns, it will be an exceeding comfort to them; and I hope that there are divers of you that may be able to ſay, if the Lord ſhould at this preſent rip our hearts and ſhew them to all the world, I hope the world ſhould ſee that Heaven is ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped upon our hearts. We account it ſad weather when we cannot ſee the Heavens for many daies, when we cannot ſee Heaven many times for a week together; and we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it an ill dwelling where men dwell in narrow lanes in the City, ſo that they can ſcarce ſee the Heavens except they go abroad in the fields. My brethren, ſurely it's a ſad time with a gracious heart when any one day paſſes without converſe with Heaven, without the ſight of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and meditations of Heaven, and having their hearts there. Thus it ſhould be with Chriſtians whoſe Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations are in Heaven, they ſhould never love ſuch dwellings wherein they cannot ſee the beams of the Sun; It's a moſt comfortable thing for to ſee the light, a man that dwels in ſome dark houſe, it's very comfortable for him to walk out into the open air, and to behold the Heavens; Oh my brethren! our ſouls dwell in dark houſes every one of us; for our bodies are to our ſouls like a dark and low celler,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:30201:66"/>
but the Lord gives us liberty to go abroad, to be converſing with the things of Heaven that he hath revealed in his Word and in his Ordinances: And as many Citizens that live in dark rooms &amp; keep a long time cloſe to their work, yet at ſuch times as they cal days of Recreation, they walk abroad in the Fields and take the freſh air, and oh how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightſom is it to them! The ſame ſhould be to a gracious heart that hath a great many buſineſſes (indeed) in the world, I but on the Lords day, Oh that he may now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy God in his Ordinances more than before; his thoughts are upon thoſe waies wherein he may come to have more of Heaven, Oh! that I may come to converſe more with God than at other times! And upon that the Sabbaths are the joy of his ſoul, his delight, he longs after the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, he thirſts after Ordinances, for indeed his heart is in them, for he finds there is more of Heaven in them than in other things; and in that regard the Saints having their thoughts and hearts in Heaven, thus he proves to have his Converſation to be in Heaven. <hi>Moſes</hi> never came to <hi>Canaan,</hi> and yet God gave <hi>Moſes</hi> a ſight of it, carried him up to mount <hi>Nebo.</hi> Heavenly meditations are as it were mount Nebo, whereby when the heart is raiſed a little upon the mount, it's able to ſee Heaven, &amp; behold the glorious things there. The Scripture ſpeaks of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> that he had his neſt among the ſtars: A Saint hath as it were his neſt, his dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling among the ſtars, yea, above the ſtars in the higheſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens. As 'tis with wicked men, that when they ſeem to draw nigh to God, yet their hearts are far from him; then they are in their ſhops, they are among their ſhips when they ſeem to be worſhipping of God: So when the Saints ſeem in regard of their bodies to be far from God, yet their hearts are in Heaven in the mean time.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, For the opening of a Heavenly Converſation, it conſiſts in this, <hi>When in the courſe of mens lives they do converſe and delight in the ſame things that are done in Heaven, they make their happineſs the ſame happineſs that is in Heaven, and make their exerciſe to be the ſame exerciſe that is in Heaven:</hi> As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:30201:66"/>
What is there in Heaven? There is the fight of the face of God; <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God.</hi> And the Angels, <hi>Alwaies behold the face of God.</hi> So the Saints may be ſaid to have their Converſations in Heaven becauſe their exerciſe here while they live, it is in the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the face of God, in ſtanding before God ſeeing his face; the greateſt delight and contentment of their ſouls, it is, that they can ſee ſomewhat of God,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What's to be done further?</hi> The Work of Heaven, it is in the Praiſings and Bleſſings of God. What do the Saints and Angels of Heaven, but continually bleſſe, and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and praiſe the Name of that God whom they ſee to be ſo infinitly worthy of all praiſe, and honor from his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? Then is a mans Converſation in Heaven when as he doth the ſame things, when he joyns with Angels &amp; Saints in doing of the ſame work, of magnifying and bleſſing and praiſing God.</p>
               <p>What's done in Heaven, <hi>but the keeping of a perpetual Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath?</hi> Then are our converſations in Heaven, when we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in Gods Sabbath, yea and indeed to keep a conſtant Sabbath unto God, though buſied about earthly things, yet ſtill we keep a Sabbath to God, in reſting from ſin, and being ſpiritually imployed. And that's a Sixth thing.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Then our Converſation is in Heaven, <hi>When in Earthly imployments, yet we are Heavenly:</hi> when we uſe earthly things after a heavenly manner; it is not the place that God looks at ſo much, where his Saints are, But what they do: Though while we live in the earth we uſe earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, yet when we can uſe them in an heavenly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, then our Converſation may be in heaven though we upon earth.</p>
               <p>As thus firſt, When in the uſe of earthly things, we do quickly paſſe through earthly things to God, we make uſe of them, but we do not ſtick in them; we make them the means to paſſe through to God, and get quickly through: a carnal heart ſticks in the things of the earth, mingles with the earth; but a ſpiritual, and heavenly heart makes
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:30201:67"/>
earthly things but as Conduit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> for conveyance of him to heaven, we here carry about with us the fleſh, and becauſe we have ſo much earth, we have need of theſe earthly things, I but they are means of conveyance to Spiritual and Heavenly things.</p>
               <p>And then, When we uſe Earthly things as Heavenly, that is, we take a riſe of earthly things to meditate of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; upon the enjoyment of any thing in this earth we raiſe up our thoughts to the things of Heaven; when we ſee the light, to remember then the glorious light of Heaven, and of the inheritance of the Saints which are in light; when we caſt any ſweetneſſe in the creature, If theſe things be ſo ſweet, Oh what is heaven and God then that is the Fountain of all good things! Thus to make all earthly things to be but as heavenly riſes to us, That's a heavenly Converſation, that in the uſe of earthly things doth quickly paſſe through to God, and that makes ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and heavenly riſes of earthly things.</p>
               <p>Eightly, <hi>Then is our Converſation Heavenly when the Saints in their Converſe together are Heavenly:</hi> when the Saints in their converſe do look upon themſelves as the Citizens of Heaven, and converſe as it beſeems thoſe of ſuch a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. When as Country men are abroad in forreign parts and they meet together, and there be conferring about the ſtate of their country in their own language, and aboue their friends, and what things there are there among them, they will ſay one to another, (as <hi>Engliſh men)</hi> me thinks we are in <hi>England</hi> now; our converſe is as if: we were in <hi>England.</hi> So when the Saints in their meetings, they do not meet to jangle, and wrangle, but they meet to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe of Heaven, and to confer about their Country, and every one telling news of Heaven, there's none of the Saints that walk cloſe with God, but when they meet together may tell one another ſome tidings of Salvation from above. When Country men meet together in any place common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the firſt queſtion is, What news is there from our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, from <hi>England;</hi> So the Saints when they meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:30201:67"/>
if they be of Heavenly Converſations, They will be talking ſomwhat of Heaven before they go: what news of our Countrie? what news from Heaven? though they may have leave to refreſh themſelves being poor earthlie creatures here, with ſomthing of the earth, yet they will have ſome talk of Heaven before they part one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: This is a Heavenlie Converſation when the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Saints of Heaven is in Heavenlie things.</p>
               <p>The ninth and laſt thing wherein the Converſation of the Saints in Heaven is, is this, <hi>That their great trade while they are upon the earth it is for Heaven:</hi> Though they be not in their bodies there, yet their trading is there, and that's the ſpecial thing that ſeems to be noted in the verie word in the text; now their chief trade it is in Heaven, the Saints <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

               <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>The Saints Trading for Heaven, opened in Seven Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>NOW in the Saints Trading for Heaven there are theſe ſeveral things conſiderable.</p>
               <p>Firſt, As in trading you know it is requiſite in thoſe that are trades-men to any Countrie, that they ſhould have skill in the Commoditie that they trade
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:30201:68"/>
for; ſo the Saints they have skill in Heavenly things; there's many poor Chriſtians who have little skill in the matters of the world, ſpeak to them about them they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand but little, but ſpeak to them about Heaven, and you may quickly perceive that they have skill in heavenly Commodities, they have a skill from God, they are Wiſe Merchants.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A Trades-man, he muſt have a ſtock to trade withal: Now the Saints they have a ſtock to trade withal for heaven, they have grace in their hearts, grace in the heart is a ſtock for a trade. If you leave your Children no lands, yet if you leave them a good trade and a ſtock, you think you leave them a plentiful portion. Now the Saints though they have but little in the world, yet they have skill in the Commodities of heaven, they have a good trade and a good ſtock too, they have a ſtock of grace that ſhall never be loſt, how ever they perhaps may not have thoſe In comes that they do deſire ſomtimes, yet they ſhall never loſe their ſtock, their portion, and it ſhould be their care to improve their ſtock for heaven, and indeed then they have their Converſation in heaven, when they improve and lay out all their ſtock that way about heavenly Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.</p>
               <p>And then a third thing in trading is, To take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Market for Commodities: Great bargains may be had ſometimes that cannot be had at another; ſo the trade of a Chriſtian for Heaven it is in the obſerving his advantages that he hath for heavenly things, and thoſe that have their Converſations in heaven they are very wiſe and underſtanding this way; they are able to know their times and ſeaſons; other men that have not skill in the matters of heaven they do not know their times and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and therefore they neglecting their markets, it may be upon their ſick and death bed then they begin to think of heaven, and then, Oh that they might but know that their ſouls might go to Heaven when they go from their bodies! I but thou art unskilful in heavenly Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:30201:68"/>
thou dideſt not know thy time, thou ſhouldeſt have had thy Converſation in Heaven in the time of thy life, and ſo have obſerved what advantages God gave thee for tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for heaven; Oh that we were but all wiſe this way, to make it appear that our Converſations are in Heaven in this reſpect, namely, That we are wiſe to obſerve our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, Oh! the advantages that God hath given us all at one time or at another for Heaven, there's not any one of you but God hath given you much advantage for Heaven had you but taken it, If you will reflect upon your own hearts, the courſe of your lives in former times, your conſciences may tell you, Oh ſometimes what fair advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages had I for Heaven! How did the Spirit of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſtir in me? What truths were there darted into mee at ſuch a ſeaſon! What motions flowing in had I at ſuch a time? Oh how happy had I been if I had taken ſuch an advantage for Heaven, I had even been in Heaven already: Now thoſe who do converſe with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, they watch at thoſe advantages, they come not to hear the Word but they watch for the time to have God ſtirring in their hearts, and they follow that advantage, they watch for the time of the ſoftening of their ſpirits, and the enlivening of their ſouls, and they follow hard thoſe advantages, and ſo trade for Heaven, and grow rich in Heavenly Commodities.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Where there is a trade from one Country to another, there's much intercourſe. A man that trades to ſuch a Town or Country, ther's much intercourſe between that man and thoſe that live there: ſo a Chriſtians tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for Heaven is in this, there is very much intercourſe between Heaven and his ſoul, every day he ſends up to Heaven, and every day he hath ſomething from Heaven ſent down to his ſoul! Oh do but examine what inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe there hath been between Heaven and you: how is it with many of you? even as if there were no Heaven at all? Men that are no trades-men to the <hi>Indies,</hi> 'tis as if there were no ſuch place at all to them. So it is with many
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:30201:69"/>
that lives even in the boſom of the Church, there is very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle intercourſe between Heaven and them; but a trader for Heaven hath much intercourſe with heaven.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, A man that trades to any place, if he trade for great matters he hath the chief of his ſtock where he trades; though he be not preſent in his body, yet the chief of his eſtate is there: If a man be a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> or a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Merchant and trade thither, the chief of his eſtate lies there, in <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Turkey</hi> more than here. So it is with one that trades for Heaven, the chief part of his eſtate lies there, he accounts his riches to lie in Heaven; indeed he hath ſomwhat to live upon here in this world for a while, but there's his riches, he looks at Heaven as the place where his greateſt treaſure lies.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, A man that trades, is willing to part with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing where he is, that he may receive advantage in the place where he trades: So it is with the Saints that trade for Heaven, they are willing to part with much that they might receive afterwards in Heaven: they are willing (I ſay) to part with any thing here in this world, to the end that they may receive it when they come home. A man that is abroad, and is going to his own Country, and there he is trading for Commodities, he is very willing to part with all his money where he is for receiving Commodities in his trade; or thoſe that give their moneyes here that ſo they may receive commodities in another place where they are trading: A carnal heart that doth not know the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty nor excellency of the Commodities of Heaven, they are willing to part with nothing, but will keep all, they think with themſelves, what we have here we are ſure of, but that that they talk of Heaven we do not know what it is, it may prove to be but an imagination, therefore we wil keep what we have and be ſure of that: Oh! thou art no trader for heaven, if thou wert thou wouldſt be willing to part with any thing here, that ſo thou mightſt receive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities there, thou wouldeſt be content to live poorly, and meanly in this world ſo be it that thou mighteſt have
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:30201:69"/>
thy riches when thou comeſt into thy manſion of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Trades-men that trade for great matters, they muſt truſt much, they cannot expect to have preſent pay in great ſums. It's true, men that trade for little matters, that trade by retale, they uſually take in their pence and two pence as their commodities goes forth; but it's not ſo with Merchants that trade for great things in whol-ſale: So 'tis in traders for Heaven, they truſt much; and indeed, the grace of Faith it is the great grace that helps in the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for Heaven, they have a little earneſt for the preſent. You that are traders, and go to the Exchange and ſell bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains for many thouſands, you have not perhaps above twelve pence or a crown for the preſent, it may be only a promiſe, but you expect the great ſums afterwards. So thoſe that are traders for Heaven, they have ſome earneſt, they be contented with a little for the preſent, the firſt-fruits of the Spirit, or a bare promiſe from Chriſt, this is that that binds the whole bargain, and they expect to have the full pay hereafter when they come to Heaven. It is a happy thing when God gives men and women hearts to be willing to truſt God for eternity, and if they have but a little comfort and grace now, yet to look at that as an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt peny of all the glory that Jeſus Chriſt hath purchaſed by his blood, and that God hath promiſed in his Word, thou art not fit to be a trades-man for Heaven that canſt not truſt, that canſt not be content that great bargains ſhould be bound with a little earneſt. But that's the ſoul that trades in Heaven, that can be content to wait for the fulfilling of promiſes, &amp; to take what they have from God for the preſent though it be but a very little, as an earneſt to bind all thoſe glorious things that God hath promiſed in his Word. Here you ſee a trader for Heaven in theſe Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven things. Now put all theſe things that you have heard together with theſe; and you may ſee what it is to have our Converſations in Heaven.</p>

               </head>
               <p>NOW then, there are ſome Evidences of Chriſtians having their Converſation in Heaven. As we ſhewed you ſom Evidences of an Earthly Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, ſo likewiſe of a Heavenly Converſation: that is, ſome demonſtrations plainly to ſhew, <hi>That the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations of Chriſtians are in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the firſt place, It's plain certainly, there are Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that have their Converſations in Heaven; Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are Chriſtians that can vilifie all the things of this earth: ſurely except they had their Converſations higher than the earth they could not ſo vilifie the things of the earth. It's an evidence of the height of Heaven, that a man is lifted up very high, that ſhall look vpon the very Globe of the earth as a very punctum, as a little thing: ſo an evidence that the hearts of the Saints are on high when they can look on the things of the earth as ſmal; it's true, we that are upon the earth look upon the ſtars as ſmall, and the earth as great; but if we were in Heaven we would look upon the ſtars as great and the earth as ſmall, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, accounted all things but as dung and droſſe, dogs meat, for the excellency of the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt: and <hi>Luther,</hi> that accounted the whol <hi>Turkiſh Empire</hi> but a Crumb that the great Maſter of the Family caſts to his dog: ſurely here's an argument that the Saints have their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations in Heaven that can look upon the things of the earth as ſo mean, and ſo little, as indeed they are.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Evidence is this, That they can be content with ſo little in this world, and can live ſuch comfortable lives in the enjoyment of ſo little; perhaps you cannot tell
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:30201:70"/>
how to have comfortable lives except you have ſo much co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in by the yeer, and ſo much proviſion: but now, one that is heavenly, a godly man or woman, can tell how to live a joyful and happie life in the want of the things of this world; though they have but little, though but bread and water, though but mean habitations, mean cloathes, though but of mean eſteem in the world, yet can go through the world with a joyful heart, bleſſing God all his daies, nothing but admiring, praiſing, and magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God for his rich mercie; and bleſſing himſelf in God, and accounting his portion to be a goodly portion, and his lot to be fallen into a fair ground. I verily beleeve that there are very many poor, mean people in this world, yet their houſes are more fill'd with bleſſings of God in one day, than many Rich, Great, Noble men have their houſes in twenty or fourty yeers: now this argues that they have their Converſations in Heaven, that though they want comfort never ſo much in this world, yet they can live comfortable lives; ſurely it is ſomthing that doth rejoyce them, when they can ſo rejoyce in the want of theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, when their joy depend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> upon the things of this world; men that have earthly hearts, if they loſe but their outward comforts, they cry our, Oh we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done! And you may ſee mightie alteractions in their very countenances, they have nothing to joy their hearts when they loſe the things of the world: but it is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſo with the Saints, whatſoever croſſes they meet withal here in this world, yet ſtill they rejoyce in Chriſt, bleſſing God, the courſe of their lives is nothing elle but a continual magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, and praiſing God for his mercie and goodneſs to them; ſurely they have their Converſations in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Not onlie can live joyfullie in the want of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie comforts, but they can ſuffer the loſs of all, yea, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer hard things, ſuffer afflictions, ſuffer torments and tortures with joyful hearts, reade but that 11. of the <hi>Heb.</hi> at your leiſure, 13, 14 verſes, They confeſſed that they were ſtrangers, and pilgrims on the earth, for they that ſee ſuch

things, declare plainly that they ſeek a Country (this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is to be annexed to the ſecond evidence) Mark, They that ſeek ſuch things declare plainly that they ſeek a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, ſurelie there is ſomthing elſe that they ſeek after when they ſet ſo light by the things of this world, For the Saints are not fools, but there is ſome reaſon for what they do, ſurely there is ſomthing in it, for they have the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as you have, and they have need of comfort as well as you, and had they not ſome other comfort beſides out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comforts, they could not live ſo comfortably in the want of outward comforts, but they that are content with a little, as pilgrims and ſtrangers: they declare plainly that they ſeek a Country; that is the ſecond Evidence.</p>
               <p>And then, <hi>For the ſuffering of tortures and pains for the ſake of Chriſt.</hi> This is another Evidence: and ſo you have in the 10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 32. <hi>But call to remembrance the former daies in which after ye were illuminated ye endured a great fight of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, partly, whilſt ye were made a gazing ſtock, both by reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and afflictions, and partly whilſt ye became companions of them that were ſo uſed,</hi> and then in the 34. verſe, <hi>And took joyfully the ſpoiling of your goods,</hi> Why? <hi>knowing in your ſelves that ye have in Heaven a better and enduring ſubſtance:</hi> This made them take joyfully the ſpoiling of their goods. What? when their goods were ſpoil'd, did they take that joyfully? what were they mad men to rejoyce at the plundering of their eſtates? No, it was no madneſs, It was becauſe they knew in themſelves that they had in Heaven a better and an enduring ſubſtance, and that made them be willing to wander about in ſheeps skins, and goats skins, in leather cloathes, as in the latter end of the 11. of <hi>Heb.</hi> reade but from the 36. verſe to the end: this argued their Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be in Heaven. If you reade in the ſtorie of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, you ſhall find verie often when they came to the ſtake, ſtill their thoughts were in Heaven, and their hearts there, and encouraging one another what they ſhould have in Heaven, and of the glorie that they ſhould have there, that being willing to ſuffer ſuch hard things for Chriſt, and
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:30201:75"/>
that being able to undergo all with ſo much joy, is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that there have been Chriſtians in the world that have had their Converſations in Heaven.</p>
               <p>A Fourth Evidence of Chriſtians having their Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Heaven is this, <hi>That their hearts are ſo fill'd with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly riches.</hi> It is an Argument of a man that trades much unto ſuch a place, when he hath his Warehouſe ſtor'd with the Commodities of ſuch a Countrie: As now, though no man ſhould tell me which way his trading lies, that ſuch a man were a Spaniſh or Turkiſh Merchant; yet if I come into his Warehouſe, &amp; find that conſtantlie his Warehouſe is fill'd with thoſe Commodities, I may conclude, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainlie this man is a Spaniſh or Turkiſh Merchant: he hath the Commodities of the Countrie continuallie in his ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe. So, the Saints have much of the riches of Heaven in their hearts continuallie, they have much grace, much holineſſe, much of the Image of God, much ſpiritual life there is there in a Chriſtian, and you may ſee in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation he doth manifeſt (I ſay) much of the Excellencie of Heaven, much of the Glorie of Heaven ſhines in his face; ſurelie his Converſation is in Heaven who hath ſo much of the riches of Heaven in his heart: <hi>The heart of the wicked</hi> (ſaith the holy Ghoſt) <hi>is little worth:</hi> Look into the heart of a wicked man, or woman what is there: thy heart that ſhould be thy ſtorehouſe, what is it fill'd withal? it's fill'd with dirt, and droſſe, and filth, and uncleanneſs, the hearts of wicked men are ſtored with thoſe things: but now, look into the hearts of the Saints, they are fill'd with God, with Chriſt, with the holie Ghoſt, with Grace, that ſhews that they have traded much in Heaven; in a conſtant way you ſhal find their hearts fild with grace, and manifeſting much in their lives, and therefore, ſurelie their Converſation is in Heaven.</p>
               <p>A fifth Evidence is this, <hi>That they are willing to purchaſe the Priviledges of Heaven at ſo dear a rate;</hi> namely, <hi>The Ordinances that are part of the Priviledges of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Now the Ordinances that are the means whereby they come to

               <p>Sixtlie, <hi>When they are ſo ſenſible of the ſtoppages between hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and their own ſouls.</hi> If there ſhould be a general ſtoppage of ſhips that are in <hi>France, Turkie,</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> your Countrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are not ſenſible at all of it; but your Merchants I'le warrant you would be ſenſible enough of it, and when they come together upon the Exchange, al their converſe would be of it. So it is with thoſe that have their converſations in Heaven; and here's a great difference between thoſe and thoſe that are earthlie minded; tell thoſe that are earthlie of anie ſtoppage in the Intercourſe between them and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and they know not what you mean, they think you are fools and mad: but the Saints they are ſenſible of it, oh it is a ſore and ſad evil to them, I mean, when at anie time God hides his face from them, when at anie time they go into the preſence of God &amp; can hear nothing from him, can receive no Letters from Heaven (as I may ſo ſay.) If the Poſt doth not come from ſuch a Countrie, the Merchants are troubled at it. So when the Saints ſend up their prayers to Heaven by which they trade thither and can hear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from God again; and when they cannot feel thoſe influences from Heaven let into their ſouls as heretofore ſometimes they have done, Oh! they bewail this as a great evil that is upon them above any evil in the world, that influences of Heaven are ſtop'd, and that God ſeems to be a ſtranger unto them, Oh theſe things they complain of one to another, and they make their moans when they feel the ſtoppages of Heaven; this plainlie declares, that they are Traders for Heaven, and that their Converſations are there.</p>

The laſt Evidence of a Saints having his Converſation in Heaven is; <hi>His willingneſs to die, to depart this world:</hi> The going out of this world with ſo much comfort, joy, peace, and triumph as many of the Saints have done; as we might give you the expreſſions of many of the Saints when they were readie to die, rejoycing at the hope of Eternal life, at their going out of the world; ſurely had they not conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Heaven while they lived here, their ſouls would not have been ſo willing to have departed out of their bodies. A man that hath nothing to do in another Country, it may be ſhall be there as a dead man, he goes but with little joy thither: But now, a man that hath had trading to another Country, and he hath great riches, and ſo thriven there, that whatſoever he ſeems to be here, yet there he is a great man: Oh! how comfortably doth that man go to the Country! how glad is he when he takes ſhip and ſees a fair gale, and proſperous wind to carry him to that Country! And ſo it is with the Saints who have their Converſations in Heaven, becauſe they have ſo much riches there, when they come to die they die with joy, and bleſſe God for that day as the moſt bleſſed day that they have ſeen; for they are going now to the Country that they have been trading to all their daies, and where their riches lies. Theſe are the Evidences and Demonſtrations that the Saints have their Converſations in Heaven.</p>

                  <head>The firſt Reaſon.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Becauſe their ſouls that are their better part, they are from Heaven.</hi> You know, that when God made Man, He breathed into his noſtrils the breath of life. The Soul of man, it is as it were, the breath of God: God did not ſay of Mans Soul as of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures, <hi>Let it be made, let there be a ſoul in mans body.</hi> No, but when he had formed the body, he breathed the ſoul into him. It was to note, that the ſoul of man had a more Heavenly, and Divine original, than any of the other creatures that are here in this world; and becauſe the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal it is ſo Divine, and Heavenly, therefore it is, that when the ſoul is (as it were) its ſelf, is ſet at liberty, it would be at its original: Indeed, though mans ſoul be of a Divine, and Heavenly Nature, yea through the fall of man, ſo it is, that the ſoul of man is even almoſt turned to be fleſh, and ſo mingled with unclean droſſie things as if it had no ſuch Divine and Heavenly original? and therefore a natural man is called <hi>fleſh, That that is born of the fleſh, is fleſh;</hi> as if he had no ſoul at all: for I ſay, the ſoul of man through his fall, the Nature of it ſeemed to be changed, it is at leaſt depreſſed down to ſuch vile things, as if it never had ſuch a Divine and Heavenly original. But now, when God works grace in the ſoul, the ſoul of man begins to return to its ſelf, and to know its ſelf, and begins to return to its own nature that it had in its firſt creation: and as ſoon as ever the ſoul begins to know its ſelf, it looks then preſently at all theſe things that are here below as vile things in compariſon, as contemptable; for indeed, all theſe things in this world are infinitly beneath the ſoul of a man: [Infinitly] that is, in compariſon, we may even call it an infinite diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween mans ſoul and all theſe things that are here below in the world; the ſoul of man is neer unto God himſelf, and therefore when as the ſoul returne unto its ſelf, it would be ſome where elſe than where it is, and would converſe with thoſe things that are ſutable to its original. As it is with
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:30201:77"/>
a man that hath a noble birth, ſuppoſe a Prince is got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another Country, and there being a child, is uſed like a ſlave, ſet to rake channels, and ſuch mean imployment; now all the while that he is there and not know his original, he minds nothing but to get his victuals, and do his work that he is ſet about; but if once he come to know from whence he was, namely, born the Heir unto ſuch a great Prince, or Emperour that lives in ſo much glory in ſuch a Country; then he that liv'd like a ſlave, his thoughts, and mind, and longings are, to be in the Country where his birth was ſo high, Oh that he might be but there, he ſhould be happy then; and it doth him good to hear any man ſpeak of that Country. Truly, ſo it is with the ſouls of men, they are the birth (as I may ſo ſpeak) of the high God, of the great King of Heaven and Earth, being breathed ſo into the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils of man. Now through mans fall the ſoul comes to be a ſlave to the Devil, and is ſet about drudggery to provide for the fleſh: but now, when God is pleaſed to convert the ſoul, the Lord comes then to declare to a man or woman, Oh man, woman! thou art born from on high, thy ſoul is (as it were) a ſparkle of the Divinity (as I may ſo ſay) thy Father by creation, nay, not only by creation as he is the Creator of all Creatures, is God, but by a more ſpecial work of his, by a more ſpecial work (I ſay) than in the firſt creation of other things; thy ſoul is from God, and of a Divine Nature, and is therefore capable of Communion with Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt; Certainly, thou never hadſt ſuch a Divine and Excellent being given the meerly that thou ſhouldeſt delight in the fleſh, and be ſervicable to thy body, in eating, and drinking here a while; Oh! conſider of thy Country whence thou cameſt at firſt; here's one work of grace, to know the Excellency of our ſouls, and from whence they came: ſurely, if grace do this, it muſt needs turn the heart of one that is converted to God, to have his Converſation to be in Heaven. That's the firſt Reaſon.</p>

                  <p>But not only ſo, becauſe the ſoul had a Heavenly ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, and therefore will not be content with a portion here in this world, But ſecondly, <hi>When grace comes there, the ſoul hath a Divine Nature put into it beyond the excellency that it had in its firſt Creation:</hi> I ſay, there is a Divine Nature higher than is meer natural excellency; in the 2 <hi>Peter.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as his Divine Power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godlineſs, and whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promiſes, that by theſe you might be partakers of the Divine Nature.</hi> Certainly the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle did not here mean, meerly what <hi>Adam</hi> had in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, I never read that that's cal'd the <hi>Divine Nature;</hi> though it's true, there is a renewing of the Image of God in man when he is converted; I but there is ſomewhat more in the ſoul of man than repairing of this; the holy Ghoſt coming and dwelling in the ſoul in a higher way than it dwelt in the ſoul of <hi>Adam</hi> at the firſt; indeed before it was a creature, but ſuch a creature as only had reference to God, as God was the Creator, and man was the creature; but now it hath reference to God as being made one with the Second Perſon in Trinity, and ſo one with the Father: and therefore of a higher Nature than man was in the ſtate of innocency. And you know what is ſaid of Adam in Paradice, He was of the earth earthly, he was of the earth in compariſon of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> (take <hi>Adam</hi> in innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in compariſon of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> he was but of the earth earthly) and ſo his poſterity though <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood ſhould have been but of the earth earthly, &amp; their portion its like ſhould have bin but in a happines in this world: we never read in Scripture of a Heavenly condition <hi>Adam</hi> had been in though he had ſtood; but the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> is from Heaven Heavenly. And the poſterity of the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> that is, thoſe that are by <hi>Regeneration</hi> made the children of the everlaſting Father, that are made the poſterity of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:30201:78"/>
Jeſus Chriſt by faith are from Heaven Heavenly; therefore their ſouls are indued with a Divine Nature, with ſuch high principles of grace as it muſt needs carry up their ſouls to Heaven: If a lump of earth ſhould be ſo changed as to have a ſpirit and a life put into it, and to be made of ſuch an Airial nature as any of the birds are, this lump of earth would fly in the air preſently. It is ſo in the work of converſion, All men and women are earthly, and therefore they fink down to the earth, and the earth is their proper center; but when once they come to be converted, there is a ſpirit put into them whereby they come to mount up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft: It is not more natural for the Earth to fall down low, than it is for the fire and air to aſcend up high, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every creature doth move towards the Center of it, heavie things fall down becauſe below is the proper place of them; light things riſe up, becauſe their proper place is to be above: and ſo, the Converſations of the Saints muſt needs be in Heaven, becauſe there's their Center, there's that that's ſutable to the Divine Nature that is put into them.</p>

                  <p>God hath ſo ordered things in this world on purpoſe, <hi>that he might wean the hearts of the Saints from the world.</hi> The Lord loves to have the hearts of his Saints to be in Heaven where he hath treaſured up ſuch glorious things for them, and becauſe that the Saints while they are here in the world, &amp; have ſo much of the world in them, they would feign be living here in the world; therefore God doth ſo order things that they ſhall meet with little content in this world, that they may be weary of it, and be wearied from it: and indeed, here's the reaſon why Gods people have met with ſuch croſſes in the world, why the Lord hath kept his Saints ſo low and mean in the world: It may be you are ready to draw ill concluſions from thence, and to think, I am afraid God doth not love me that he keeps me ſo low and mean, and I meet with ſuch croſſes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do not.

Though as I have gone along, I have endeavoured not only to ſpeak to your heads, but your hearts, and to quicken what I have ſaid, ſo as might quicken your hearts: yet from the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of all, there are divers Uſes that may be profitable unto you.</p>

                  <p>The firſt is this, If the Saints live ſuch a Heavenly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation as hath been opened to you, Oh how far are they from being Saints, from being godly, <hi>Who are ſo far from having their Converſations in Heaven, as they have their Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Hell.</hi> There are a generation of men that profeſs themſelves to be Chriſtians, &amp; ſay, that they hope to go to Heaven; and yet if you behold their Converſation, it is no other than the Converſation of hell: Certainly, 'tis not what men ſay, but how they live that will caſt them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother day: he that is of Heaven, or for Heaven, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is in Heaven: and he that is for hell, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is helliſh: now that's a Converſation in hell that is like to what is done in hell, what is there in hell, but blaſpheming and curſing? What is there in hell, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and malice? what is there in hell, but raging and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs? Theſe things are the Converſations of many men who are even devils incarnate.

So that as the Saints have their Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Heaven, when they die they go to their own place, that is to heaven where their Converſations were: ſo on the contrary, the wicked having their Converſations in hell, when they die they go to their own place: as it was ſaid of <hi>Judas, He went to his own place:</hi> So a wicked man dying, having his Converſation in hell while he liv'd, (I ſay) when he dies he goes to his own place, that's his own proper place, he took content and delight in thoſe things that were done there, and ſo when he dies, there he ſhall go. <hi>As the tree falls ſo it lies.</hi> As thy Converſation is, and the bent of thy heart is there, ſo it muſt lie to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>

of the earth, which being got up neer the heavens, do make a ſhew as if they were ſome ſtar in heaven, but you find a great deal of difference between the ſtars and them in this, for within a little while they fall, and vaniſh, and come to nothing; and ſo it is with many hypocrites, they by the Word are raiſed up a little for the preſent, and ſeem to be above the ſtars, and they have a glittering ſhew as if they had ſomthing heavenly in them, even like the ſtars of heaven, they ſeem to be got above others: your blazing ſtar, a child would think it a great deal bigger than one of the ſtars that is an hundred times bigger than that is; ſo 'tis with many hypocrites, they have a greater ſhew of Religion than many that have truth of Godlineſs, and that are truly gracious, they look upon them as wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at the excellent parts that they have, excellent abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, it may be, they will diſcourſe ſometimes in an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent manner about heavenly things; you ſhall find ſome that have no ſoundneſs at all, yet will have very excellent diſcourſe, they ſpeak the very language of Canaan, but it is in ſuch company where they may gain reſpect by it, but ſtill are but as meteors that hang between heaven and earth: whereas the truth is, while they ſeem to be ſo high above others, and ſo heavenly, yet their hearts are groveling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth: many times while they have moſt excellent expreſſions in prayer, yet God ſees their hearts baſely clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to ſome earthly thing, there is ſome baſe earthly contentment that their hearts are upon, while they ſeem to be ſo heavenly, much like to the Kite that flies on high as if it were an Eagle, but the eye of it while it is above in the air is fixed upon ſome carrion, upon ſome prey that it hath upon the earth, and as ſoon as ever it ſees a fit oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to ſeiſe upon the prey, it comes down to ſeiſe upon it, and that's the place the Kite would be at, that's the place he doth moſt delight in, to be upon his prey: And ſo an hypocrite, though he riſes high in ſome actions, yet the truth is, his eye is upon ſome earthly prey, and when he ſees his opportunity, thither he goes and finks down to

things they are to be look'd upon as the good things, as the Throne of God, &amp; thoſe earthly things only as the things of Gods foot-ſtool: but now, How many are there that have Earth their throne and Heaven their foot-ſtool! that is, Heavenly things are made ſubordinate to earthly things; Oh! this ſhould not be in any of thoſe that profeſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be Chriſtians, none of the Saints ſhould ſatisfie themſelves in any life but this, to be able to ſay, I bleſſe God, my Converſation is in Heaven, though God let me live upon the earth, yet my converſation is in Heaven. What an unworthy thing it is for one that doth profeſſe to have his portion and his inheritance in Heaven, yet to have the heart ſo mingled here with the earth; In <hi>Gen</hi> 45. 20. ſaith <hi>Joſeph</hi> in ſending for his father, <hi>Regard not your ſtuffe, for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.</hi> Regard not the ſtuff, do not let it grieve you to forſake your ſtuff, leave all your lumber behind you, for all the good things of Egypt are yours. Oh what a ſhameful thing is it, that Chriſtians ſhould regard their ſtuff ſo much as they do, that hope to have the good things, not of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but of <hi>Heaven</hi> its ſelf to be theirs! Surely if we have ſeen the things of Heaven, one would think that all the things of the earth ſhould be dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened in our eyes: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>That which was glorious</hi> (ſaies the text) <hi>had no glory in compariſon of the greater glory.</hi> That Scripture I confeſſe, is ſpoken in comparing of the Law and the Goſpel, there was a glory in the delivering of the Law, but that had no glory in compariſon of the greater glory, that is, in compariſon of the Goſpel; for in the Goſpel we behold as in a glaſſe with open face the glory of God, and are changed into the ſame image, as from glory to glory: But we may apply it thus; As the things of the earth that were glorious before in your eyes, yet in compariſon of the greater glory, ſhould not at all be glorious; though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore converſion theſe things were glorious, &amp; grant it, that there is ſome kind of glory upon the things of this world, that they are gilded and varniſh't over, but in compariſon of the greater glory they are not glorious at all, though they
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:30201:86"/>
that never ſaw any thing elſe as glorious but the things of the world, yet thou that haſt ſeen the greater glory ſhouldſt not account theſe things glorious: Oh therefore Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, lift up your hearts to Henven, and let your Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be in Heaven: Though God hath ſo ordered it, that you muſt live here a while and muſt be content, for indeed to ſome Chriſtians that have their Converſations in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, it's a great part of their ſelf-denial, and of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to God, to be willing to live upon the earth, and to ſtay from Heaven till Gods time come; This is a riddle and a myſtery to many, that it ſhould be a part of our Salvation, Obedience, yea, of Self-denial, though they had Crowns of Glory, though they were Kings and Princes here in this world, to be willing to ſtay here. We might come to attain this, if our Converſations were in Heaven, and our hearts there. As we reade of <hi>Daniel,</hi> though God ſo ordered it, that he could not live at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> where the Temple was, yet he would open his window towards <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he would ever be looking that way. And ſo, though God hath ſo ordered it, that we cannot come yet to live in this Heavenly Jeruſalem bodily, and in that full way as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after we expect to do, yet we ſhould open our window, our eyes, and the doors of our hearts ſhould be open to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven. I remember I have read of <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt King of <hi>England,</hi> that had a mighty mind to go to Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, but becauſe he could not go, for death prevented him, he gave charge to his Son to carry his heart thither. And ſo it ſhould be with us, we ſhould endeavour to have our hearts there, and to have as much of Heaven as we can though we cannot be there our ſelves in nature: Every creature hath put into it by the God of nature an inſtinct to move to its proper place; as now, becauſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place of fire is above, there is an inſtinct of nature in fire to aſcend to its proper place. And the proper place of earth is below, and therefore it will fall down to the Center! a heavie thing that hath much earth in it, though it breaks its ſelf to pieces yet it will fall down towards its
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:30201:86"/>
Center: and ſo it will be with a Chriſtian, though he break himſelf to pieces, whatſoever he ſuffers, yet he hath an inſtinct to carry him to his proper place; fire becauſe its proper place is above, if it be kept down by violence, what a mighty power there is in fire to make way for its ſelf that it may get up, that's the very reaſon of the mighty force that there is in Guns, becauſe there is fire in the pouder that is kept in, when the pouder is once fir'd, becauſe the fire would get up above, therefore it breaks with violence, and if it cannot have vent to get out, it breaks any thing in the world for it muſt out, that it may get up to it's own place; and ſo it ſhould be with a Chriſtian, there ſhould be a ſtrong impetiouſneſs to get up to his own place; that would be an evidence indeed that Heaven is thy proper place: Oh Chriſtians lift up your hearts, and let your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations be in Heaven.</p>

               <p>Firſt, Know, <hi>That a Heavenly Converſation will be a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Converſation;</hi> then you will convince men that you have ſomwhat more than they have when they ſee you live Heavenly; for the men of the world they know the things of the world, are the things that their hearts are upon, and that which they mind; but now, when they ſee thoſe that profeſſe Religion mingle themſelves with the earth as they do, then they will think that they are act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſame principles that themſelves are; but now, Heavenly Converſations will convince them, when they behold them walking above in the whol courſe of their lives, when they ſee an evenneſs and proportion in their courſe; take them at all times, and in all buſineſſes, they carry themſelves as men of another world: As a man
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:30201:87"/>
that is a ſtranger to a place, may for a while act it ſo, as he may ſeem to be one that is a native in the place, but one that is born in the place, will go nigh to find him out in one thing or other: and ſo, 'tis very hard for men to carry themſelves ſo if they have not true grace, though they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſometimes to be very Heavenly, yet one that is a true Citizen of Heaven will diſcern them at one time or other if they have not grace; yea, the truth is, carnal men wil diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover themſelves that they are born of the earth, and are of their Countrie, his ſpeech betrais him, he is a Giliadite: But when Chriſtians ſhal in their conſtant way have their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations in Heaven, then their Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>verſations are very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing; There are the Raies of Heaven about them, they have the luſtre of Heaven ſhining whereſoever they go, and in all company, ſurely ſuch a man ſeems to be in Heaven continually; So it will force it from the very Conſciences of men to ſay, Certainly theſe are the Citizens of Heaven; if there be any Denizens of the new Jeruſalem while they live upon the earth, theſe they are. I remember it's ſaid of that Martyr Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> That he did rejoyce that he ever came into the priſon to be in company with that Angel of God Mr. <hi>Bradford,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi>'s Converſation, it was Angel-like, like an Angel of Heaven, and did convince almoſt every where, where he went: Oh! 'tis of great uſe that Chriſtians ſhould live convincing Converſations. You know what <hi>Dives</hi> ſaid to <hi>Abraham,</hi> That he would have one ſent to warn his brethren, that they might not come to that place: ſaith <hi>Abraham, They have</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets:</hi> Oh but ſaith <hi>Dives, If one riſe from the dead, they would hear him.</hi> I may ſay thus, If God ſhould ſend one from Heaven to live among men, and to preach to them, ſurely they would regard him. Would it not be a great benefit to the world if God ſhould ſend ſome one Saint from Heaven, or Angel to converſe in a bodily way among us? Truly, Chriſtians ſhould live ſo, as if they came from Heaven every day, as if they had been in Heaven and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with God. When they go to perform duty in a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:30201:87"/>
and get alone between God &amp; their ſouls, they ſhould never leave ſtriving till they get their hearts ſo in Heaven, and get themſelves upon the Mount, ſo as when they come down to their family their very faces may ſhine, ſo that you may ſee by their Converſations, that certainly they have been with God upon the Mount this day.</p>
               <p>Now I appeal to you in this, Do you live ſo, as that your family, and your neighbors may ſee that you have bin this morning in Heaven? Every morning we ſhould have ſome converſe with Heaven, which if we had, our Converſations would be convincing all the day long, and very profitable it would be to the world; Chriſtians that live Heavenly Converſations they are (I ſay) of very great uſe in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where they live. As I remember it's ſaid concerning Chriſt, When he aſcended up to Heaven, he gave gifts to men. And if we could oftener aſcend up to Heaven, we ſhould be more able to be beneficial to the world.</p>

               <p>AN Heavenly Converſation is, <hi>a growing Converſation.</hi> Oh! they grow mightily, they do thrive in grace exceeding much in a very little time, they grow to attain to a very great meaſure of Communion with God the Father, and with Jeſus Chriſt, and every day they grow more and more ſpiritual, having ſo much of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven within them: It's true, when they come into Heaven, they ſhall be perfect: But now, the fetching from Heaven is that that makes them grow, it muſt be the influence from Heaven that muſt cauſe the grouth of Saints; As now, ſuppoſe that the ground upon which flowers and herbs grow, be never ſo fertile in its ſelf, and the herbs or plants be never ſo well rooted in the earth, yet if there be not an
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:30201:88"/>
influence of heaven upon them they will not grow much, nay not at all, but quickly wither: So it is with Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, let them have never ſo much means of growing below, never ſo many Ordinances, yet if they have not rich dews from above they wil not grow, or if there be any growth, yet either they wil bear no fruit, or elſe it will be very ſhri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled and ſowre fruit. You know, that fruit that hath the moſt of the beams of the Sun that comes from heaven upon it, that fruit grows riper and ſweeter than other fruit; fruit that grows in the ſhade, that hath the influence of Heaven kept off from it, it is ſowre fruit. And the reaſon that the Saints have ſo little fruit, and that it is ſo ſowre, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that they have not more influences from heaven, they do not ſtand in the open Sun, their ſouls are not preſented dayly before God, and have the warm beams of the Sun of Righteouſneſſe ſhining from Heaven upon them; but there is ſomething between Heaven and their ſouls: but a Converſation in Heaven, as it would be a <hi>Convincing</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, ſo it would be a <hi>Growing</hi> Converſation.</p>

Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that others beholding your good works, may glorifie your Father which is in Heaven. Then indeed the Image of the God of Heaven is held forth when mens Converſations are heavenly, the Lord takes much delight to have his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be diſpenſed abroad by his Saints, to have ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon the world: As in a glaſſe, though beams of the Sun do not ſhine upon a wall, yet by a glaſſe you may take the beams of the Sun and caſt the reflection of them
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:30201:88"/>
upon a wal: ſo thoſe beams of the glory of God that ſhine in Heaven, the Saints by their Heavenly Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may (as it were by a glaſſe) take them and reflect them upon the world, and upon the faces of men: the hearts of the Saints ſhould be as a glaſſe taking the beams of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God and caſting them up and down where they are, and ſo your Heavenly Father ſhould come to be glorified by you. Let every Chriſtian think thus, My Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is thus and thus; but what glory do I bring to God by my Converſation? do others glorifie God by beholding the luſtre of the holineſs of God in me? do they ſee cauſe to bleſſe God that they ſee ſo much of the glory of God in me? Certainly, there is more of the glory of God ſhines in the gracious, holy, ſpiritual Converſation of a Chriſtian, than ſhines in the Sun, Moon, and Stars, than in Heaven, and Earth: I mean, for the works of Creation and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that are in Heaven and Earth; the creatures that God hath made, as the Sun, Moon, and Stars; and here in this world, the Seas, the Earth, the Plants, and the like, though they have much of the glory of God, yet a Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Converſation declares more of the glory of God than all theſe. You know what the Pſalmeſt ſaith, <hi>The Heavens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the glory of God, and the Firmament ſhew his handy work.</hi> It may be ſpoken more fully of Heavenly Converſations, the Heavenly Converſations of the Saints, declare the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God; and thoſe that ſhine in the Firmament of the Church are ſtars, (for the Church is the firmament, and the Saints be there as ſtars) &amp; they declare the Handy work of God. Now though its true, As in Heaven there's one ſtar differs from another ſtar in glory: and ſo in Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, every one cannot attain to ſo much glory as another, yet every one is a ſtar, the meaneſt Chriſtian that lives, the weakeſt Beleever that is, yet ſhould be as a ſtar in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though he cannot ſhine ſo gloriouſly as the Sun, or as other ſtars, yet there ſhould be never a Beleever, never a godly man or woman in the Church but ſhould ſhine as a ſtar in the firmament, but ſhould be as the Goſpel is, even

               <p>AN Heavenly Converſation, it's a Converſation that will bring much glory to your ſelves: Though it's true, that the Saints ſhould aim at the glory of God moſt, yet there will come glory to themſelves whether they will or no if their Converſations be in Heaven: it's impoſſible but that in the conſcience of men they ſhould be honored walking in a Heavenly Converſation: There's an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Scripture, that ſhews, that in our glorifying of God, we glorifie our ſelves alſo: 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 11, 12. the Aploſtle he praies for them, <hi>Wherefore alſo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we pray alwaies for you, that our God would count you worthy of this Calling, and fulfill all the good pleaſure of his goodneſs, and the work of faith with power:</hi> To what end? <hi>That the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He praies for the Theſſalonians, <hi>That they might walk ſo, that they might have ſo much of the grace of God in them, that the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt might be glorified in them.</hi> Oh! this is that that all the Saints ſhould deſire, and endeavor after, That the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be glorified in them; <hi>and ye in him</hi> ſaith he: Labor you, that Chriſt may be glorified in your lives, and you ſhall be glorified in him. We ſhould deſire that Chriſt may have glory in our glory, &amp; then we ſhall have glory in Chriſts glory: this is a ſweet and bleſſed life, when as the Saints have ſuch hearts, as they can ſay, Lord, let me have no glory, but that thou

mayeſt have glory in. Then ſaith God, Is it ſo? Doeſt thou deſire no further glory in this world, but that I may have glory in? then I will have no glory in this world, but what thou ſhalt have glory in: Chriſt will make us par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his glory, as well as we ſhall make him partaker of our glory.

And it's a notable paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage that in the Goſpel, if you examine the place of Chriſts transfiguration upon the mount, there Chriſt ſhewed his glory unto ſome Diſciples, that he carried with him; and this is that that I would note from it, do but obſerve in the ſtory who were the Diſciples that Chriſt carried with him to ſee his glory, they were, <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John;</hi> now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards if you compare that ſtory with the ſtory of Chriſt being in his Agony, which was preſently after; where his
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:30201:90"/>
ſoul was heavie unto death, when he was to be betraied, and to be crucified the next day, and fell groveling upon the earth, &amp; ſweat clodders of blood through the anguiſh that was upon his ſpirit, &amp; cried out, Oh Lord! <hi>If it be poſſible let this cup paſs from me.</hi> Here's a great deal of difference between Chriſt in his Agony, and upon the mount in his Transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and obſerve, that Chriſt would have none of his Diſciples ſee him in his Agony, but <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> only thoſe three that ſaw him in his transfiguration upon the mount in his glory.</p>
               <p>The note from hence is, <hi>That thoſe that can converſe much with Chriſt in glory, can converſe with Chriſt in Heaven, can ſee Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, they may be permitted to ſee Chriſt in his Agony and it will do them no hurt.</hi> But now, for the other Diſciples that did not ſee Chriſt in his Glory, if they had ſeen Chriſt in his Agony, it might have offended them, Is this our Lord and Maſter that is in ſuch a fearful Agony at this time? Oh! it would have offended them; but now, the other that ſaw him glorified, it offended them not; Well, though he be in an agony now, yet we know him to be a glorious Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, and we will beleeve and truſt in him ſtill. So, if we can converſe with God in glory upon the mount, what ever agony we ſee Chriſt in afterwards we ſhall be able to bear it: when <hi>Stephen</hi> had the ſtones ratling about his ears, yet when he ſaw the Heavens opened it was nothing to him then, he fell aſleep, he rejoyced in the expectation of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And if you reade in the Book of Martyrs, ever when they came to their ſufferings you may ſee how they did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, when they did think of Heaven, and remember eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. Saith one woman to her child that was going to be burnt, when as the people thought ſhe would have rung her hands, and made great lamentations to have ſeen her child ſtepping into the flames, ſhe ſaid nothing but this, Remember eternal life my ſon.

                     <hi>Labor to be skilful in the myſtery of godlineſs, to draw ſtrength from Jeſus Chriſt in every thing you do.</hi> For my Brethren, Chriſt he is <hi>Jacob's Ladder.</hi> When <hi>Jacob</hi> lay aſleep he ſaw a ladder on which the Angels did deſcend and aſcend up to Heaven. Now this <hi>Jacob's</hi> Ladder is no other but Jeſus Chriſt to Chriſtians, and that muſt be ſet up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; if you would go to Heaven, and converſe with Heaven, it muſt be by Jeſus Chriſt, you muſt be inſtructed in the myſterie of the Goſpel in converſing with God through a Mediator; there is ſuch an infinite diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and us, that except we have Chriſt the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor we can never come to God, nor God come to us; it is
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:30201:93"/>
only Chriſt the Mediator that is the Ladder: We need not ſay Who ſhall go up to Heaven to fetch Chriſt down? No, we may have Chriſt in our hearts, and ſet up him, and ſo we may go up to Heaven by his Mediation. When as a Chriſtian comes to live in this manner; what I do expect from God, I expect to draw it through a Mediator, and all the ſervices that I tender up to God I tender them up through the hand and heart of Chriſt: Now thoſe that are acquainted with this have much converſe with Heaven: By Jeſus Chriſt the Mediator I may come up there and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent my ſelf there, though no unclean thing may come there, for God looks upon the Saints through him as righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, being cloathed with his righteouſneſs, they may come to their Father with boldneſſe, having their Elder brothers garments upon them, they may come and kneel before the Throne of grace, come into Heaven as into the Preſence Chamber and kneel every morning for their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers bleſſing; it's by him what we have acceſſe unto the Father: Oh! acquaint thy ſelf with the Myſtery of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe in drawing all from Chriſt; and tendering all to God through Chriſt: By this Heaven comes down to thee, and by this thou climeſt up to Heaven, this is the <hi>Jacob's</hi> Ladder. But thoſe men that only look upon God in a natural way, that's thus, Indeed all good things muſt come from God; and ſo they go to prayer, <hi>Lord we beſeech thee bleſs us this day, for all good things come from thee.</hi> And they ſerve God, their conſciences tell them they muſt worſhip, and ſerve God while they live here: but it is but in a dull natural way: let me leave it in your hearts, All good comes from God through a Mediator, through Jeſus Chriſt the ſecond Perſon in Trinity, God-Man, and all my ſervices are tendered up to God through him; there is this Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor God-Man that unites God and me together, and ſo by him I have acceptance both for my perſon and all my acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and by him I come to have other manner of bleſſings than comes from God meerly as Creator, God in bounty beſtows upon the creature many good things, but when
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:30201:94"/>
we come to deal with God in Chriſt we come to have Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly bleſſings, bleſſings beyond the power of nature, yea beyond all thoſe bleſſings that nature can be any convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of, beyond the bleſſings that the conduits of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are able to hold forth, they have the bleſſing from God imediately, imediately I mean in reſpect of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it's by the mediation of Chriſt, they enjoy God in Chriſt, and ſo come to enjoy God in a Heavenly, Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural way: Oh this is the way to have our Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Heaven; and thoſe Chriſtians that are much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Goſpel of Chriſt, they come to live far more Heavenly Converſations than others that go on in a dull, heavie, and natural kind of way in ſerving of God: But being not acquainted with this myſterie, their hearts lie low upon the earth, and know not what it is to have their Converſations in Heaven.</p>

                  <head>The Seventh Rule.</head>
                  <p>And ſo the next Rule with which I muſt cloſe all is this, <hi>Exerciſe much the grace of faith:</hi> There is no way to get above the Creature, and above Nature, but by exerciſing the grace of Faith. Many Chriſtians think they muſt exerciſe love to God, and exerciſe ſorrow for ſin; the grace of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, mourning for ſin, that's good, thou ſhouldeſt do that, and thou ſhouldeſt exerciſe patience; but the great grace that is to be imployed if thou wouldeſt attain a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly life, it is, The exerciſe of Faith: and make conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to put forth that grace much, for it's by that that we do converſe with God through Chriſt. Though Chriſt be the ladder, yet it's faith that carries us up this ladder, and brings us down again, it's faith that makes the things of Heaven real to the ſoul, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. It's faith that is an evidence of things not ſeen, and the ſubſtance of things ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for, by faith theſe things come to be made real and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial things, and as preſent things, faith it is that gives a great excellency to all the things of Heaven its ſelf, and
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:30201:94"/>
therefore live much by faith, and walk by faith, and not by ſence, and then ſhalt thou be above the world and live in Heaven; and as the fruit of thy faith wait for the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Our Converſation is in Heawen</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>from whence alſo we look for the Savior the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> &amp;c. Where a mans Converſation is, there his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations may be; and where the expectations are, there a mans Converſation is; now our Converſtaion is in Heaven from whence alſo we look for Jeſus Chriſt; as if he ſhould ſay, It's not a motion, do not you think that when we ſpeak of Converſing in Heaven that we pleaſe our own fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; Oh no, ſaith he, we by faith look upon Heaven as the moſt real thing in the world, for we expect the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ere long to appear in glory bodily, and we ſhall ſee him with theſe eyes, and ſhall change our vile bodies and make them like his glorious body, we by faith looking upon ſuch glorious things to be ſo real, and ſo at hand, and we waiting for theſe things it's this that makes our Converſation to be in Heaven: our hearts and all are there, becauſe that we expect that theſe things will be made good to us quickly, Oh Chriſtians do but exerciſe your faith in this, in Jeſus Chriſt, and put forth this fruit of faith in waiting for the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt when he ſhall come and appear in his glory, this will help to make your Converſations to be in Heaven; Oh what a bleſſed time will that be when Jeſus Chriſt ſhall come from the Heavens, and appear to thoſe that have been waiting for him! it was a bleſſed thing to have Chriſt here perſonally and to live with him when he was upon the earth though it were in the ſtate of his humiliation, Oh when he ſhall come in his glory, how bleſſed will that be! and when he ſhall change our vile bodies that they may be like unto his glorious body, Oh this will keep the heart in expectation of Chriſt, for then that vile body of thine that is now a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of ſin and death, matter of diſeaſes, a body of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and a lump of clay, now it ſhall be made like the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious body of Jeſus Chriſt to ſhine more glorious than the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:30201:95"/>
Sun in the firmament; this will be when Jeſus Chriſt ſhall come with all his Angels in his glory; and this is obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when all the glory of the creature ſhall be darkened with the glory of God and Jeſus Chriſt, yet then the bodies of the Saints ſhall ſhine gloriouſly before the face of God and Jeſus Chriſt, ſurely they ſhall be more glorious than the glory of the Sun, for that you know will be darkened at the coming of Jeſus Chriſt; The great glory of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Jeus Chriſt, and the Angels ſhall darken the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, but the glory of the bodies of the Saints ſhall be ſo great, as all the glory of God, and Jeſus Chriſt, and the Angels ſhall not darken their glory, but it ſhall appear with a very great luſtre: now if the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, and the Angels ſhould darken it, then to what purpoſe is it that their bodies ſhall be like to the glorious body of Jeſus Chriſt? but certainly it ſhall not darken their glory: If a candle could be raiſed to have ſo much luſtre and beauty as if you ſhould put it into the mideſt of the Sun, yet it would ſhine in the midſt of it, it would be a ſtrange kind of light you would ſay: It ſhall be ſo with the bodies of the Saints, that though they are put into the midſt of the glory of God, and his Son, yet their very bodies ſhall ſhine in beauty and luſtre there: Now did we beleeve this, and wait for it every day, how would it change us! I have a diſeaſed and a lumpiſh body, and my body hinders me in every duty of worſhip, and ſervice, wandering and vain thoughts lodge in me now; I but I'le wait for that time when Chriſt ſhall come in all his glory, and make my body to be like unto his glorious body, to make it to be able to look upon the face of God, and to be able to be exerciſed in holy duties to all eternity without any wearineſs, and without any intermiſſion: ſo ſhall the bodies of the Saints be raiſed to that power, that their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſhall be ſo ſtrong, that their ſouls ſhall be exerciſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the higheſt things poſſible for a creature to be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with without wearineſs; wait for this: I have many things here that trouble my mind, and ſpirit, and hinders
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:30201:95"/>
me in my converſe with Heaven, but within a while the time ſhall come that I ſhall be delivered from all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles here, when Chriſt ſhall appear with his mighty An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to be admired of his Saints, and when he ſhall come and take the Saints to judg the world, and ſhall ſet all the Saints upon Thrones to judg the world: the expectation of this time will raiſe the heart very much to be in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>But then eſpecially, when I conſider the glory that ſhall be upon my ſoul, let me think thus, if this body of mine that is a lump of fleſh ſhall be by the almighty power of God whereby he is able to ſubdue all things unto himſelf, raiſed to that height of glory, to be more glorious than the Sun in the Firmament; then, what height of glory ſhal my ſoul be raiſed too! but then, take not only my ſoul, but my grace, the Divine Nature that is in my ſoul, what ſhall that be raiſed too? The plants are capable to be raiſed to a higher excellency than ſtones; and the Rational creature to a higher excellency than a Senſitive creature; and the Senſitive higher than the Vegetative, and the Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral creature to a higher excellency than the Natural: Then raiſe your thoughts thus; My body ſhall be raiſed ſo high, what ſhall my ſoul be then? and what ſhall my graces that are in my ſoul be? Oh! wait for this, it is but for a little while before I ſhall be with God for him to be all in all to my ſoul enjoying full communion with him; (I ſay) exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe faith, and wait for it, look for it every day, conſider it's neerer and neerer, your ſalvation is neerer than when at firſt you beleeved, God hath a little work for you here, but as ſoon as this is done this ſhall be my condition, I ſhal ſee my Savior, my ſoul ſhal preſently be with him and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy ful communion with him in glory, and my body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a while ſhal be raiſed and ſhall live for ever with him: ſhall be where he is, and ſhall enjoy all that he hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by his blood, as much glory as the blood of Chriſt is worth am I capable of; the text ſaith, <hi>It ſhall be a weight of glory:</hi> I am not here fitted to bear a weight of glory, if the glory of Heaven ſhould ſhine in upon me ſo much as it
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:30201:96"/>
might, it would ſwallow me up preſently. We reade in the 7. of <hi>Dan.</hi> upon the glory of God appearing to him, ſaith he, <hi>I</hi> Daniel <hi>fainted, and was ſick certain daies.</hi> If God ſhould open the Heavens, and dart in ſome light from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into us ſo as he might, alas we ſhould faint preſently and be ſick and die, <hi>No man can ſee God and live;</hi> no man here can enjoy that that God hath prepared for his Saints in Heaven and live; therefore let us be content for a while to be as we are, and exerciſe thy faith and hope in what ſhall be; Thou ſhalt be able to bear that weight of glory, and be able to ſtand before the face of God continually to enjoy thoſe things that eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, nor can enter into the heart of man to conceive: nay, though a man hath a ſpiritual eye, and a ſpiritual ear, and a ſpiritual heart enlarged to ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural things, yet they are things not only beyond the eye of ſence, but the eye of reaſon; nay, the eye of faith hath not ſeen them fully, nor ear hath ever heard of, neither can enter into a gracious heart to convince what it is; but thoſe Cluſters that we have of this land of Canaan do ſhew that mere is a glorious reſt for his people. Now by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of your faith and hope work theſe things upon your ſouls every day, it would be a mighty help to make your Converſation to be in Heaven; where ſhould my heart and thoughts, where ſhould my life and converſation be, but where I expect ſuch things as theſe are to be revealed very ſoon in the Day of Jeſus Chriſt, in his appointed time, which is at hand.</p>

daughters, and died; but he addeth, Enoch <hi>walked with God.</hi> The holy Ghoſt ſpends three verſes upon <hi>Enoch,</hi> He tells you how long he lived and begat <hi>Methuſelah, and</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch <hi>walked with God.</hi> And in the 23. verſe there he ſpeaks of him again; and in the 24. verſ. <hi>Enoch</hi> walked with God again. As if the Lord ſhould ſay, Oh my ſervant <hi>Enoch</hi> I muſt not paſs by him, he was an eminent holy man in his generation, I muſt not paſs by him without ſome eſpecial teſtimony: as if God ſhould ſay, Oh he was the delight of my Soul, he walked with me: <hi>Enoch</hi> walked with God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Enoch</hi> he was a Prophet in his time, he converſed much with God, and God revealed much of his mind to him. We find in the Epiſtle of <hi>Jude</hi> 14. there the holy Ghoſt mentions him again, Enoch <hi>alſo, the ſeventh from</hi> Adam, <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied of theſe, ſaying, &amp;c.</hi> Enoch <hi>propheſied,</hi> he was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: Where do we find <hi>Enoch</hi>'s propheſie in all the Book of God? we have the Propheſie of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and other Prophets; but where the Propheſie of <hi>Enoch?</hi> Here the holy Ghoſt ſaith, That <hi>Enoch</hi> propheſied, ſaying, <hi>Behold the Lord cometh with ten thouſand of his Saints, &amp;c.</hi> Now for the propheſie that is here mentioned by the holy Ghoſt, in this Epiſtle of <hi>Jude,</hi> we have it not ſet down in words ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but yet we have ſomewhat ſet down even in a verſe or two before my Text, of <hi>Enoch's</hi> propheſie, and that is in the very name of his ſon <hi>Methuſelah,</hi> there is that very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of <hi>Enoch</hi> that the holy Ghoſt ſpeaks of in the Epiſtle of <hi>Jude,</hi> in the name (I ſay) of his ſon <hi>Methuſelah,</hi> for <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſelah</hi> ſignifieth thus much, he dieth, and then the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out, that is the floud, he dieth and then comes the floud, that's the ſignification of the name <hi>Methuſelah:</hi> So that <hi>Enoch</hi> propheſied many hundred yeers before the flouds coming; and that propheſie ſeem'd to go further, for Gods dealing with people in thoſe times, were but as a type of his dealing with men in after-times. That the Lord would ſend forth a floud againſt all wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men in due time to deſtroy them, he dieth, and then
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:30201:97"/>
the ſending forth of the floud, for the floud did come in the very laſt yeer of <hi>Methuſelah,</hi> and that's obſervable that this <hi>Methuſelah</hi> he liv'd longer than ever any man liv'd ſince the world began, <hi>All the daies of</hi> Methuſelah <hi>were nine hundred and ſixtie nine yeers, and then he died.</hi> Now this may be one reaſon of the lengthening out of his life, that he might fulfil the propheſie of <hi>Enoch,</hi> for <hi>Enoch</hi> propheſied that the floud ſhould come when he died, now becauſe God had work to bring about, and to defer the floud for a while after, therefore <hi>Methuſelah</hi> muſt live ſo long.</p>
               <p>God doth lengthen out, or ſhorten mens lives according to the work he hath to do, according to the uſe he hath to make of them. But thus much for <hi>Enoch:</hi> The perſon who it was.</p>

                  <head>ENOCH WALKED WITH GOD.</head>
                  <p>Now this phraſe of walking with God, ſometimes it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies ſome ſpecial miniſtration before the Lord, as in the 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 30, 35. <hi>Wherefore the Lord God of Iſrael ſaith, I ſaid indeed, That thy houſe, and the houſe of thy father ſhould walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me for ever.</hi> And then in the 35. <hi>I will raiſe me up a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Prieſt that ſhall do according to that which is in my heart, and in my mind and I will build him a ſure houſe, and he ſhall WALK before mine anointed for ever:</hi> That is, for a ſpecial and holy miniſtration, ſo it's taken ſometimes.</p>
                  <p>But here we are to underſtand it more largely, (though it's true, <hi>Enoch</hi> was a Prophet and he might be ſaid to walk with God in regard of the ſpecial miniſtration of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Office that he had;) for walking with God, in waies of righteouſneſs and holineſs: ſo walking with God, as it's ſaid of <hi>Noah,</hi> that was his great grand-child, in the 6. of <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. <hi>Theſe are the generations of</hi> Noah, Noah <hi>was a juſt man and perfect in his generation, and</hi> Noah <hi>walked with God.</hi> This his great-grand-child (no queſtion hearing of his fathers walking with God was a great argument for to move him to the like, and his walking with God is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:30201:98"/>
to be in being righteous, and in being perfect with God. The 70. in their tranſlation turns this that you have in your books <hi>walk with God,</hi> by the word, <hi>he pleaſed God.</hi> And that's obſervable that the holy Ghoſt in men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning <hi>Enoch</hi> in the new Teſtament, doth follow the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of the Septuagent in the 11. of the <hi>Heb.</hi> there you ſhall find that <hi>Enoch</hi> is mentioned among the Catalogue of the Beleevers there: <hi>By faith</hi> Enoch <hi>was tranſlated that he ſhould not ſee death, and was not found, becauſe God had tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him:</hi> for before his tranſlation he had this teſtimony, that he pleaſed God. That word that you have here in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis</hi> rendered, <hi>he walked with God:</hi> in the <hi>Hebrews</hi> it is that he had this teſtimony, <hi>That he pleaſed God:</hi> &amp; indeed it comes to one, he walked in the waies that God was pleaſed and delighted in.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He pleaſed God.]</hi> The <hi>Calde</hi> tranſlates it, <hi>he walked in the fear of God;</hi> and ſo ſome Interpreters quoting the <hi>Jeruſalemie Thargum,</hi> he <hi>ſerved</hi> or <hi>labored</hi> in the truth before the Lord: and that's one thing further in the explication that it's ſaid, he walked with God <hi>after</hi> he begat <hi>Methuſelab.</hi> Some now think that <hi>Enoch</hi> was a wicked man before the time that he begat <hi>Methuſelah,</hi> in that ſixty and five yeers there's no mention of his walking with God, but <hi>Enoch</hi> lived ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty five yeers and begat <hi>Methuſelah,</hi> and he walked with God after he begat <hi>Methuſelah:</hi> but that's no ſufficient ground to conclude, becauſe it's ſaid <hi>after:</hi> that he did not before; it might rather be to note the conſtancy of his wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with God, that he continued in the conſtant courſe of his life in his walking with God.

                  <hi>THat 'tis the great excellency and commendations of a godly man, to walk with God:</hi> Or, <hi>That it is the higheſt teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that can be given of a man that walks with God.</hi> Walking with God is a high excellency, and whoever hath this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony hath the higheſt teſtimony that can be given unto a man in this world, that he walks with God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that's obſervable, that God mentions him twice, as if he loved to mention his poor creatures walking with him: at the 22. verſe; <hi>And</hi> Enoch <hi>walked with God.</hi> And then in the 24. verſe, <hi>And</hi> Enoch <hi>walked with God.</hi> Oh! as if God ſhould ſay, This is that that is the delight of my ſoul indeed. Yea, and that's obſervable in the teſtimony of <hi>Noah,</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 9. perhaps in the reading of it you may not obſerve that that I ſhal obſerve unto you now, <hi>Noah</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was a juſt man, and perfect in his generations, and</hi> Noah <hi>walked with God.</hi> He doth not ſay thus, <hi>Noah</hi> was a juſt man and walked with God: But mark, he repeats <hi>Noah</hi> twice, <hi>Noah</hi> was a juſt man and perfect in his generations, and <hi>Noah</hi> walked with God: as if he ſhould ſay, This is the bleſſed man that lived in a wicked generation, and though that generation was ſinful and wicked, yet he kept cloſe with God; <hi>Noah</hi> was juſt and perfect, and <hi>Noah</hi> wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with God; Oh I take delight in this <hi>Noah:</hi> Conſider my ſervant <hi>Noah, Noah</hi> was thus, and <hi>Noah</hi> walked with God. There's a great Emphaſis in doubling of his name, and there can be no reaſon given of it, for the ſenſe would be perfect without it: as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>Noah</hi> was a juſt man and perfect in his generation, and walked with God; But for the putting of a ſpecial incomium upon <hi>Noah,</hi> Oh!
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:30201:99"/>
                  <hi>Noah was a juſt man and perfect in his generations, and</hi> Noah <hi>walked with God.</hi> Oh! 'tis the excellency of a man to walk with God, and for God himſelf to own a man and to ſay, that he walks with him: Men may live in a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the duties of Religion, Eternal duties, and go ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry far that way, and yet be ſtrangers unto God, never know what it is to walk with God; they may have by-waies of their own in which their hearts do walk; as the Stars that have a motion turn about by the Primum Mobile, the firſt mover, one way, but they have a ſecret motion the other way themſelves: and ſo, though many in their external profeſſion ſeem to be moved one way, but ſecretly their hearts move another way, they do not walk with God all that while, they did pray, and reade, and hear, and come to Sermons and make great profeſſion, ſo as men might think they walked with God, but it was not ſo. As it is with a ſhip, you may be bound to ſuch a Port, and the ſhip and the ſails blow that way, and yet when the ſhip goes eaſt, a man may walk up and down in the ſhip weſt-ward: ſo in profeſſion, a man ſeems to be carried eaſt-ward, yet his private walks may be another way, to his own ends, to his own deſigns; but here's the honor of a man when God himſelf ſhall own him, as if God ſhould ſay concerning <hi>Enoch,</hi> I who am a God that am the Seer and Searcher of all mens hearts, and I obſerve the waies of my ſervant <hi>Enoch,</hi> and I ſee him not only in the outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of godlineſs, but in the ſecret of his ſoul he walks with me, he hath no bye-walks at all, but he keeps him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf cloſe with me and walks with me continually; Enoch <hi>walked with God.</hi>

               <p>This phraſe, <hi>Walking with God,</hi> we have expreſt in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in divers other phraſes that are to the ſame purpoſe: as walking before God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 40 <hi>The Lord before whom I walk,</hi> ſaith <hi>Abraham;</hi> and ſo God bad <hi>Abraham, Walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me and be upright.</hi> And ſo in the 116. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. <hi>I will walk before the Lord in the Land of the Living.

               <head>CHAP. III. <hi>How the Soul is brought to Walk with God, Diſcovered in Six Particulars.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>FIrſt, <hi>Every one by nature goes aſtray from God,</hi> in the 58. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3. it is ſaid of all the wicked, that <hi>they are eſtranged from the wombe, they go aſtray as ſoon as they are born, ſpeaking lies.</hi> That's one of the firſt things wherein wickedneſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in children, but 'tis from the very womb that they go aſtray, before they can ſpeak: 'tis natural for the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to go aſtray from God as ſoon as they have any being. The way wherein men naturally do walk, it is the way of death, it's the way of their own hearts, of their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, it's the common courſe of the world, it is the walk of the fleſh. But now, the work of God in bringing the ſoul to walk with him, it is, Firſt, To cauſe the ſoul to make a ſtop in the way that men naturally walk in; Thoſe that the Lord hath left for a while in the way of nature, that walk in the way of death, the Lord is pleaſed to come to them by ſome mighty work of his to make a ſtop, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, where am I? what's my way; whither am I go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? is the way that I am in like to the way that befeems an Immortal ſoul? Is the way like to end well that I am walking in? It cauſes the ſoul to make a ſtop in it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to think where it is, whither it is going, and ſo uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally cauſes ſome fear, fearing it is in a way like to miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſo that it dare not proceed further in that way that it hath been walking in all this while, though never ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant a way, though never ſo ſutable to the fleſh, the Lord forbid that I ſhould go on in that way that I have walked in. There's a ſtop cauſed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The Lord manifeſts to the ſoul the way of life, what the way of life is.</hi> This ſtop of the ſoul is juſt like to that we
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:30201:100"/>
reade of <hi>Saul,</hi> that when he was poſting on in the way of death, there did ſhine a light round about him, and cauſed him to ſtop ſo that he could go no further. But then (I ſay) the Lord manifeſts to the ſoul what the way of life is. In the 30. of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 21. <hi>And thine ears ſhall hear a word behind thee ſaying, This is the way, walk ye in it.</hi> Oh! how many are there that can tell this by experience, that they have been walking in the waies of death, of eternal miſery, and bleſt themſelves in thoſe waies? But there was a bleſſed time wherein God cauſed them to hear a voice as it were behind them ſaying, This is the way, walk-in it; you are out of the way, but here's the way of life, if you would not periſh eternally, here's the way, walk in this way; It is a ſecret voice that the Lord cauſes to be heard in the ſoul, but yet a powerful voice: perhaps you have come to the Word, and have heard what the way of life is: but yet that never hath given a turn to your hearts: but when God would have the ſoul to come in to walk with him, he cauſes the ſoul (beſides the outward voice of the Word) to hear a voice behind in ſecret, and yet powerfully, ſaying, Oh! this is the way; Oh thou poor ſoul that are wandring from the way of life, and art going on in the way of eternall death, Come in, come in, here's another way, This is the way, walk in it: And ſo the Lord gives a mighty turn to the ſoul by that ſecret voice.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Lord makes peace between himſelf and a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;</hi> He doth reveal the doctrine of Reconciliation. For a ſinner at firſt when he comes to have his eyes enlightened, when he comes to know himſelf and to know God; Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly God at firſt cannot but appear terrible to a ſinner that hath walked in the waies of death formerly, and though I ſee my way to be dangerous, and I ſee another way to be good, Oh but God is terrible to me, and how can two walk together that are not at peace? In <hi>Amos</hi> 3. 3. <hi>Can two walk together except they be agreed?</hi> ſaith the text, Oh there is naturally an enmity between Man and God, every man in the world is naturally an enemy to God; and can
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:30201:101"/>
there be two walking together unleſs they be agreed? Oh! you that are going on in the waies of enmity with God, ſurely you are ſtrangers to this way of walking with God, can you walk with God before you are agreed? no ſoul can have this teſtimony given of it, that he hath walked with God, but ſuch a ſoul as is reconciled to him; God doth manifeſt that in ſome meaſure to the ſoul before it's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thus to walk with him, as here <hi>Enoch</hi> did, and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Enoch</hi> came to walk with God by this, for the holy Ghoſt in the forenamed place of the 11. of the <hi>Heb.</hi> ſaith, <hi>It was by faith</hi> that he did it, and without faith it's impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to pleaſe God, that's as much as, without faith it's impoſſible to walk with God. The holy Ghoſt means the ſame thing, when the Apoſtle ſaith, that he did walk by faith, and without faith it's impoſſible to pleaſe God, therefore there muſt be a work of faith to bring the ſoul to be reconcil'd, and that there may be an agreement between the ſoul and God before it can walk with him. That's the third thing.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Though there be peace made ſo that God doth not appear as an enemy againſt the ſoul, yet there may be ſome ſtrangneſs after peace made.</hi> There was peace made between <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Abſalom, David</hi> was paſſified towards him, yet he would not ſee his face for a while, he would have been gone from his preſence, there ſhould not be that converſe with him in that familier way as a child with the father for a while: So though there be peace made, yet there's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd a further work of God for the ſouls walking with him, that is, That God ſhould render himſelf in lovelineſs, and fulneſs of mercy, and ſweetneſs, and delightfulneſs unto the ſoul, that there may be a familiarity between the ſoul and God; It's one thing for me to know God is not as an enemy to me, that he doth not intend wrath and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery againſt me, and another thing for the ſoul to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the ſweet delightful countenance of God, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracements in the arms of his mercy, and thoſe condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God, that he is willing to come and deal with us
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:30201:101"/>
as a friend with his friend in a familiar way: Therefore that's a fourth work, the Lord is pleaſed to manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the ſoul in the ſweetneſs of his love, and his delight; Not only thou art that ſoul that ſhalt not be damn'd, that ſhalt eternally be ſav'd; but thou art the ſoul that my ſoul delights in, thou art one that I take as my friend, and that I love to deal with in all ſweetneſs, and to bring into a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity with my ſelf. This is that that is manifeſted to the ſoul for the bringing of it to this walking with God that here the holy Ghoſt ſpeaks of concerning <hi>Enoch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>The Lord is pleaſed to ſend his holy Spirit to guide the ſoul To himſelf, and to guide it in walking With himſelf:</hi> In the 8. <hi>Rom.</hi> it's ſaid, <hi>All that are the ſons of God are led by the Spirit of God.</hi> As a father when he walks with the child he gives him his hand and leads along the child with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: when any comes to be a child of God, God puts forth his hand and leads him, and ſo they walk together. As have you not ſeen ſomtimes a father and child walking in the garden, the father puts forth his finger and the child takes hold of it and ſo walks along with him: even ſo the Lord puts forth his Spirit into a gracious ſoul, and God and the ſoul thus walks together being led by the Spirit of God; in the 35. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8, 9. there you may ſee what the Lord ſpeaks of the way of the redeemed ones. <hi>And an high way ſhall be there, and a way, and it ſhall be called the way of holineſs, the unclean ſhall not paſs over it, but it ſhall be for thoſe; the way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faring men though fools, ſhall not err therein:</hi> Though they be very weak and fools, yet they ſhall not err therein. And no Lyon ſhall be there, nor any ravenous beaſt ſhall go up thereon: it ſhall not be found there, but the redeemed ſhall walk there, that's the priviledg of the redeemed ones. Now this way of walking up unto the Land of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan from their captivity, it's typical, to typifie the walk of the ſoul with the Lord.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, For the ſouls walking with God, there is this further done by God, <hi>Chriſt the Son of God he takes the ſoul and brings it unto God the Father, as the Spirit leads, ſo Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:30201:102"/>
The Lord Jeſus Chriſt he brings the ſoul unto the Father to render God and the ſoul familier together: In <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 18. <hi>Through him we have an accceſs by one Spirit unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> We have an acceſs through him, we have a manuducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, He brings us unto the Father, we have acceſs through Jeſus Chriſt. As if a Prince ſhould take a Traytor that is reconciled to his Father, having his pardon, and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being paſſified towards him, the Prince comes &amp; takes him by the hand, and ſaith, Come, I'le bring you unto my Father, and I will walk along with you unto my Father: So it is, None that ever hath been a ſinner can walk with God, but Chriſt muſt walk together with him; Chriſt walks along with him, and ſo God is ever more rendred ſweet, aimable, and lovely; why? Becauſe Chriſt hath him by the hand (as I may ſo ſay) God the Father hath him in one hand, and Chriſt hath him by the other hand, and ſo the ſoul walks in this bleſſed walk, between the hands of God the Father and the Son; and the holy Ghoſt leads and guides him too.</p>

               <p>BUt now, The way of the ſoul in this walk with God: When the ſoul is thus brought to God, and by this means enabled to walk with him, Then what's the way of the ſoul in walking thus with God?</p>

                  <head>Walking with God cauſes the ſoul to eye God.</head>
                  <p>In the firſt place, Now the ſoul being come thus to God, in all the waies of God it ey's God, and ſets God before it. <hi>Enoch</hi> walked with God: that is, <hi>Enoch</hi> in the waies of his
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:30201:102"/>
life ſet God before him, and did eye God in his waies; Firſt beholding the infinite beauty there is in God. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, God being the fountain of al good to the ſoul. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the ſoul apprehending God infinitly worthy of all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. Theſe three things cauſes the eye to be upon God continually: The Lord hath infinit excellency and beauty in him. The Lord is the fountain of all good to me: The Lord is infinitly worthy of all honor and ſervice; and a ſoul walking with God eyes God thus continually. In the 26. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3. <hi>For thy loving kindneſs is before mine eyes, and I have walked in thy truth:</hi> Oh Lord! I ſee thee aimable, love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and gracious, and the fountain of all good, and Lord, I have walked in thy truth, ſetting God before me; ſo in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 8. <hi>I have ſet the Lord alwaies before me that I might not fall.</hi> A ſoul that walks with God ſcarce ey's any thing but God, when it enjoyes the creature yet the eye is upon God; as the little child walking with the father looks up to the father; every ſoul that walks with God hath his eye upon him, for there's no ſuch lovely drawing object to the ſoul as God himſelf is; whereas wicked men they do not find God to be ſuch a lovely object, ſees no ſuch excellency in him, and therfore they rather turn their eyes away from him, they look another way, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86. 14. <hi>They do not ſet God before them;</hi> men that walk according to the luſts of their own hearts in their wicked ſinful waies, the Lord is not in all their thoughts, as in the 10. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> That's the firſt thing in the way of the ſouls walking with God, he eyes God, and ſees God before him.</p>

                  <head>Walking with God cauſeth a man to carry himſelf as in Gods Preſence.</head>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The ſoul behaves its ſelf as in Gods Preſence.</hi> I ſee my ſelf in Gods preſence, and my eye is upon God, Oh let me then look to my ſelf, that the carriage of my ſoul be as beſeems one who is in the preſence of ſo holy, ſo great, ſo glorious and bleſſed a God as the Lord is, in the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.

17. <hi>As of God in the ſight of God ſpeak we in Chriſt,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; when we come to do any thing, we do it as of God, in the ſight of God, knowing that we are all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes before God. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> ſpeaking concerning <hi>Noah's</hi> walking with God, he hath this expreſſion, <hi>Noah</hi> walked with God, that is, he had God alwaies preſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes, walking ſo holily, and ſo reverenced God: This is to walk in the fear of God, when the ſoul upon the apprehention of Gods preſence ſhall labor to compoſe its ſelf as beſeeming the preſence before whom it is, and this indeed is the walk that you ſhall find the Saints of God in all day long, would you know where to find a Saint? you may know his walk, you ſhall all the day long find him walking in the fear of the Lord, <hi>Preverbs</hi> 23. 17. ſaith the text there, <hi>Let not thy heart envy ſinners: but be thou in the fear of the Lord all the day long.</hi> He doth not ſay, do thou fear the Lord all the day long, but be thou in the fear of the Lord all the day long, Oh the walk of a Chriſtian ſhould be ſo from morning to night, to walk in the fear of the Lord; and nothing in this world ſhould put him out of this walk, no temptations ſhould call him out of it, but in the fear of the Lord all the day long: This is the walk of a Chriſtian, when he labors to behave himſelf as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeems the preſence of God.</p>

                  <head>Walking with God is, when we make Gods Will the Rule of our will.</head>
                  <p>Thirdly, The ſoul may be ſaid to walk with God, <hi>When the way of it is the ſame way that God himſelf goes, the ſoul doth that that God doth:</hi> What's the way of God, but the way of holineſs and righteouſneſs? when the ſoul makes the Will of God to be the rule of it, I will not be acted by my own will, I will not be acted by any thing but by the Will of God: what is it that God wills? I will the ſame thing, then the ſoul walks that way God walks, when it doth ſute its ſelf with God, ſets the Lord as an example before it,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:30201:103"/>
as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Be ye holy as your Heavenly Father is holy;</hi> I ſee the holy and the righteous waies of God, and I labor as a deer child to follow him, and to go in the very ſame ſteps that God doth, how doth God carry buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes? I will labor to carry things ſo as God doth, that my life ſhall hold forth a reſemblance of God himſelf; this is to walk with God, to do as God doth, to imitate God; that's a third thing in a ſouls walking with God.</p>

                  <head>Walking with God is, when a Soul hath the ſame Ends that God hath.</head>
                  <p>The Fourth is this, Not only to do the ſame thing, to make the will of God to be the rule of it, <hi>But to have the ſame ends that God hath:</hi> What's the end that God hath in all his waies? Surely it is, that his bleſſed Name may be magnified, that his glory may be ſet forth; I'le drive on the ſame deſign, that ſhall be the great deſign of my life, it's that that my ſoul ſhall aim at as the higheſt end of all things, and all things ſhall be ſubordinate to this end e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, The glory and honor of God, it's that that God aims at, and therefore that which I'le aim at, thus the ſoul goes along with God; as now, A man may be ſaid to go along with another man when they do both drive on the ſame deſigns: Oh! this is a bleſſed thing indeed. We ſhall ſpeak to that hereafter: but the very opening what it is ſhews much of the excellency of it; and I beſeech you as you go along, examine your own hearts, ſee whether by the very mentioning of theſe things you be not ſtrangers to God; examine by the workings of God in bringing your ſouls to walk with him, or otherwiſe by the way of the ſoul, in eying God, in behaving its ſelf as in the preſence of God, in making the Will of God to be its rule, and in driving on the deſign that God doth.</p>

                  <head>Walking with God, is the obſerving the adminiſtrations of God and ſuting the ſoul to them.</head>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>It is the obſerving of the ſeveral adminiſtrations of God, and the ſuting of the ſoule to the ſeveral adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God in the world:</hi> I open that thus, God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeems to work in one way, ſometimes in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way; now the ſoul that walks with God obſerves which are the ſeveral waies and adminiſtrations of God in the world, and let me (ſaith the ſoul) labor to ſute my heart with them: that's thus, ſometimes the Lord is in a way of judgments, in the world, heavie and dreadful af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions: yea, ſometimes againſt his own Saints, and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: then let me ſute my heart according to this, <hi>Oh Lord! we will wait upon thee in the waies of thy judgments,</hi> ſaith the Church in <hi>Iſa.</hi> Are we under Gods way of judgments, in a way of afflictions? Lord, we will ſute our ſelves to honor thee there according to that way, we will labor to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe thoſe graces that are ſutable to theſe adminiſtrations of thine. And Lord, art thou in a way of mercy? we will ſute our ſelves accordingly, and labor to draw forth and exerciſe our graces that are ſutable to thoſe waies of thine. And art thou in a way of affliction in my family, or in a way of mercy? Lord, I will labor to exerciſe thoſe graces that are ſutable to thoſe waies of thine. This is to walk with God. As when we walk with a man, if he turn this way, then I ſet my ſelf to go with him, and if he turns ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, then I ſute my ſelf to go with him that way, ſo though the waies of God be never ſo vario<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>us, yet the ſoul that walks with God is ſutable to thoſe waies of God; Oh this is a great Art, a great Myſtery to ſute a mans ſelf to theſe ſeveral adminiſtrations of God in the world. You ſhall have ſome that if God go in a way of mercy, Oh there they can bleſs, &amp; praiſe God, and they think that this is to walk with God; but if God turns his back upon thee and takes away thy choiſeſtearthly comfort (it may be) thy deereſt yoke-fellow &amp; ſo comes in a way of affictions, how
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:30201:104"/>
canſt thou ſute with Gods waies then? When God was in a way of mercy, then my exerciſe was in joy, and thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, and ſpeaking good of his Name; but now the Lord is in a way of afflictions, now I exerciſe faith on God, now I exerciſe patience, now I exerciſe Chriſtian wiſdom, to know what good I can get out of this hand of God, that what courſes ſoever God takes, yet ſtill a Chriſtian hath ſeveral graces to exerciſe in ſeveral conditions, and that not only while God is in a ſmooth path the ſoul can exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Joy, and Thankſgiving, &amp; ſpeaking good of his Name: But let God go into a rugged path of very great afflictions, yet the ſoul doth ſute it's ſelf unto God according to his ſeveral adminiſtrations; this is to walk with God.</p>

                  <head>Walking with God, is, To have a Holy Dependance upon God. Opened in Four Particulars.</head>
                  <p>Sixthly, Walking with God, it is, <hi>To have a holy depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon God in all his waies.</hi> For one to live in a holy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon God for theſe Four things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In a holy dependance upon God for <hi>Direction;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Firſt. For Direction</note> Oh <hi>lead me in the way of thy truth.</hi> When a Chriſtian looks up to God and depends upon him in the conſtant courſe of his life, depends upon him for direction, Oh Lord! teach me thy way, Lord, lead me in the way of everlaſting life, Lord, ſend forth thy light and thy truth to guide me; Thou ſhalt be my guide even unto death, when the ſoul dare not go one ſtep further, then it ſees God going before it, and therefore it ſaith, Lord, lead me, guide me: I beſeech you examine as you go along, can you ſay, that in the courſe of your lives this you find; That you walk in a holy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon God for guidance and direction in every ſtep? whatſoever you meddle with, yet your walk is thus in a holy dependance upon God for direction in your bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fineſs, and according as the buſineſs is, of leſſe or greater conſcequence the heart works more after God for guidance and direction for that buſineſs. But now, the men of the
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:30201:105"/>
world they are afraid that God ſhould lead them into hard paths, into ttoubleſom waies, and therefore they are ſhy of Gods Guidance; this is the way of wicked hearts, (I ſay) they are ſhy of the guidance and direction of God; but a gracious heart ſaith, let God lead me, and let the way be what it will. The wicked are guided by their own thoughts, by their own counſels, by the examples of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, what's moſt ſutable to their own ends, but the way of the Saints is this, Lord, guide me.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Their holy dependance upon God it is for protection to protect them in what they do.</hi> Lord, I am in the way that <note place="margin">Secondly. For Protection</note> thou haſt guided me into, I may meet with much trouble and affliction, but Lord do thou protect me, do thou defend me in this way of thine. As the child walking with the father, if he hears any noiſe that doth ſcare him, he looks up to the father, and depends upon his father to be prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: So when a child of God ſhall in all his waies walk in a holy dependance upon God for protection, this is to walk with God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The ſoul depends upon God for aſſiſtance in any thing that it undertakes.</hi> Lord, this is the work that thou <note place="margin">Thirdly. For Aſſiſtance.</note> calleſt me to, Oh let me have ſtrength from thy ſelf in this work, I can do nothing without thee Lord, and let me have aſſiſtance from thee. Whereas the wicked they make fleſh their arm, and therefore there's a curſe pronounc'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, in <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 5. verſe, they are ſtrangers to any ſuch work as this, of dependance upon God for aſſiſtance! Now and then at a ſpurt, they will ſay, that God muſt help them and they can do nothing without God: I but to have a holy, gracious frame of ſpirit to walk in a holy dependance upon God for aſſiſtance in every buſineſſe, this is far from the wicked and ungodly.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>The ſoul walks in a holy dependance upon God for</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Fourthly. For a bleſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all it doth.</note> 
                     <hi>a bleſſing upon all it doth. Walk before me and be upright, I am thine exceeding great reward.</hi> As if God ſhould ſay to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> Walk in dependance upon me, I am thy reward, though thou haſt little encouragment in the world, yet
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:30201:105"/>
look up to me for thy reward: ſo when the ſoul turneth from men, and the world, and minds not ſo much what en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement it hath from the world, but looks up to God, Lord, I depend upon thee for a bleſſing, and how ever things ſeem to go, yet Lord, I look up to thee for the brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging all to a good iſſue; here's now a ſoul walking with God.</p>

                  <head>Walking with God makes a man free and ready in the waies of God.</head>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>One that walks with God, in all his waies of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Obedience his heart is free in him, he comes off readily to every good work,</hi> he is not hall'd and pull'd to God, but he walks with him. There's a great deal of differenet between one that is dragged after another, (as if you ſhould drag a priſoner that hath no mind to go that way) and another that walks up and down with delight and pleaſure with you: 'Tis not enough to walk with God, for to be in the way that God would have you to be, or to do the things that God would have you to do, except your hearts do come off freely in the waies of obidience, except there be a cheerfulneſs in the waies of obedience, except you chooſe the waies of holineſs as the waies that are moſt ſutable to you, this is the walking with God. In the 119. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. <hi>I will walk at liberty,</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) for I ſeek thy precepts.</hi> It's a notable Scripture. The men of the world they think that there is no walking at liberty but for them to ſatisfie their defires to the uttermoſt, to walk after their luſts which is the Scripture phraſe: No but ſaith <hi>David,</hi> my liberty is this, I ſeek thy precepts. A carnal heart thinks it is the greateſt bondage in the world for to ſeek the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of God, and to conform to Gods precepts, that I muſt walk according to rule, that's a bondage: No, I'le walk at liberty, for I ſeek thy precepts. It's an excellent argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of grace in the heart, to account the precepts of God to be the greateſt liberty to the ſoul: When I am in the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:30201:106"/>
waies of ſin, I am in the waies of bondage, I am a ſlave to Satan; but when I ſeek thy precepts, I am at liberty. As a man when he is walking up and down in the fields, he is at liberty. So when the ſoul is walking with God it is at liberty, but when the ſoul is walking without God it is in a dungeon, a priſon; but (I ſay) when it walks with God it is at liberty, it comes off freely in all the waies of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>

                  <p>Eighthly, Walking with God conſiſts in the <hi>Converſe and Communion that the ſoul hath with him in holy duties:</hi> There are the ſpecial walks of the ſoul with God, and of God, with the ſoul in the duties of holy Worſhip. In the 18. of <hi>Levit.</hi> 4. ſaith the Lord there, <hi>Ye ſhall do my Judgments, and keep mine Ordinances, to WALK therein, I am the Lord your God.</hi> You muſt <hi>Walk</hi> in Gods Ordinances, the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God they are the <hi>Walks</hi> of a gracious ſoul, and there the ſoul meets with God, in the 26. of <hi>Levit.</hi> 11, 12. It's a notable Scripture to ſhew that in Gods Ordinances there the ſoul meets with God. <hi>And I will ſet my tabernacle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you, and my ſoul ſhall not abhor you,</hi> that is, ſhall <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi> in you, <hi>And I will WALK among you, and will be your God, and ye ſhall be my people.

So that you ſee in the 18. of <hi>Levit.</hi> there God ſaith, <hi>You ſhall walk</hi> in mine Ordinances, the Ordinances are the godly mans walk: then in the 26. of <hi>Levit.</hi> the Ordinances are Gods walk; ſo that we ſee they walk the ſame way, and there God and a gracious heart meet together. The Churches enjoying Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances are the Candleſticks that we reade of in the 1 of <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. <hi>In the midſt of the ſeven golden Candleſticks was one like unto the ſon of man, cloathed with a garment down to the feet,</hi>

                     <hi>and gird about the paps with a golden girdle:</hi> The Lord Jeſus Chriſt is in the midſt of the Candleſticks; that is, in the midſt of the Churches, where there are the Ordinances of God, there he is, and if you would walk with him you muſt find him there; in the 68. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24. there likewiſe you may ſee what the way of a gracious heart is in walking with God, <hi>They have ſeen thy goings O God, even the going of my God, my King,</hi> (where?) <hi>in the Sanctuary.</hi> If you would walk with another you muſt know where his goings are, obſerve where he uſes to walk, and be going there. They have ſeen thy going O God, even the goings of my God, my King, in the <hi>Sanctuary;</hi> there's the goings of God, if you would meet with God and walk with him, it muſt be in the Sanctuary, it muſt be in his Ordinances. In the 7. of <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. verſe, it is ſaid, <hi>That the King</hi> (ſpeaking of Chriſt) <hi>is held in the galleries;</hi> now what's that but in the Ordinances? that's as it were the galleries of the great King of Heaven and Earth. And you know Princes and great men, they have their ſumptuous galleries wherein they uſe to walk, and only chief favourites are permitted and ſuffered to be there to walk up and down: <hi>The King is HELD in his galleries:</hi> that is, when Jeſus Chriſt is in Communion with his Saints in his Ordinances, in the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Worſhip: Oh 'tis the moſt pleaſant galleries to walk in that he hath, it's as pleaſant a gallery as he hath in Heaven it's ſelf, Oh! he loves to be there, The King is <hi>Held</hi> there. Oh! many a ſweet and comfortable turn hath a gracious heart in theſe galleries, that is, in the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Duties of Worſhip in walking with Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>When the ſoul is exerciſed in the Ordinances, it hath converſe with Chriſt, it hearkens what Chriſt ſaith, and Chriſt hearkens what ſuch a ſoul ſaith, I will hearken what he will ſay, and the ſoul knows the voice of Chriſt, 5. <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. <hi>It is the voice of my beloved,</hi> ſaith the Spouſe. Oh it knows what the voice of Chriſt is when they walk toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Ordinances: Chriſt ſpeaks to the ſoul, and the ſoul knows his voice, and the ſoul ſpeaks again to Jeſus Chriſt,

there is a bleſſed converſe between them, Chriſt lets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the heart, and the heart opens its ſelf to Chriſt, Oh! the Communion that a gracious heart hath with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in Ordinances it is unſpeakable! Only thoſe that are acquainted with it underſtand what the meaning of converſing with God there means; It is with many even as it was with <hi>Adam,</hi> that when God came to walk in the garden, we read that he was hid in the buſh: The Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and Duties of Worſhip are as <hi>Paradice,</hi> as <hi>Eden;</hi> and God comes many times to walk with us, and would feign have communion and converſe with us, yet Oh! how many times are many of his ſervants hid in the buſh; they have walked looſly, and contracted ſome guiltineſs upon their ſpirits, and ſo the preſence of God is terrible to them, and the more the voice of God, and the preſence of God is in an Ordinance, the more they are afraid becauſe of ſome guiltineſſe: they are intangled in the buſh when as they ſhould be converſing with God, Oh the difference that there is between ſome Chriſtians and others in the exerciſing themſelves in the Duties of Worſhip!

                  <p>The Ninth Particular is this: <hi>The ſoul that walks with God, as God reveals himſelf unto it ſtill more and more, ſo it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows God more and more, and ſtill ſeeks to glorifie God more and more,</hi> that's walking: There is a progreſſe in the waies of godlineſs where there is a walking. The ſoul when firſt it is led by the hand of Jeſus Chriſt to God, and comes and
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:30201:107"/>
walks with him, Oh 'tis ſweet and comfortable, but ſtill as God reveals himſelf more and more to the ſoul, ſo the ſoul ſtill grows up in godlineſſe more and more, and ſtill is more holy, and more gracious, and honours God more in the Converſation of it than formerly it hath done, it gets neerer and neerer to Heaven every day; this is to walk with God. There's a notable Scripture in the 63. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. <hi>David</hi> ſaith there, <hi>My ſoul follows hard after thee, O Lord, thy right hand upholdeth me.</hi> As a poor child that is walking with the father, it may be he is weak, and cannot go ſo faſt as it doth deſire, but the father puts forth his hand and takes hold of him and ſo upholds and ſtrengthens the child, and it follows hard after the father: ſo 'tis here: Oh Lord thy right hand upholds me: If it did not uphold me, I could not walk, but thy right hand upholds me, and then my ſoul follows hard after thee, and ſo increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in godlineſs more and more: <hi>I will praiſe thee more and more</hi> ſaith <hi>David</hi> in another place ſpeaking of the honor that he diſir'd to give to God in his way, he profeſſ'd he would ſtill ad to the praiſe of God, and praiſe him more and more.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the principal things wherein walking with God conſiſts.</p>
                  <p>Now to all theſe take in that conſideration that we have mentioned all along, and that makes it up, That all theſe are in a conſtant courſe of a mans life, This <hi>walking with God.</hi>

                  <p>Some other men that know not what it is to walk with God, perhaps they may come and walk a ſtep or two in Gods waies, but they quickly turn out again, and they find them tedious and irkſom to them: But the heart that walks with God doth all this that I have named.</p>
                  <p>That is, Eyes God in all his waies. Behaves its ſelf as in the preſence of God. Walks in the ſame way God doth. Obſerves Gods deſigns. And ſo likewiſe the reſt, and all this in the conſtant courſe of his life.</p>
                  <p>It's true, Through the violence of ſome temptation there
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:30201:108"/>
may chance to be a ſtep aſtray, or there may be perhaps ſome fall in the way; but ſtill the heart is God-ward, and ſtill is towards God, it gets up again, and walks again in the way, it doth not meerly go a ſtep into the way of God as ſome carnal men do; it may be ſomtimes when Gods hand is upon them, or upon the hearing of ſome Sermon, then their hearts are a little touch'd, and they ſeem to be a little froward; but take the conſtant courſe of their lives, and it's in the way of ſin; But the conſtant courſe of the waies of the Saints, are in the waies of God. As now, a Swine may go through a fair meadow, I but that's not the place that it doth ſo much regard, but it would be in the mire and dirt, and there it wallows. So it is with many wicked men, they will come and hear, and pray, and do ſome good duties, this is a Swine in a meadow; but when they come to thoſe waies that may ſatisfie the luſts of the fleſh, there they wallow, that's their proper place, and therefore far from walking with God. A begger will perhaps follow a man a little way ſo long as he hath hopes of getting any thing by him: but if the man goes ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from him, he turns aſide to another way, he will go no further along with him: ſo 'tis with many men, even many profeſſors they would ſeem to follow God perhaps for comfort, and for ſomething that they would have from him; but if they cannot find preſently what they would have from God, then they turn aſide: whereas (I beſeech you obſerve this) the difference between a friends walking with another out of delight of Communion with him, and a begger that only goes along with another man begging for an alms; The man that goes along begging for the alms he doth not regard the company of this man any further than he may have hopes of an alms from him, if he cannot have what he would have, or if he have once what he would have, he turns aſide from the man: But a friend that is walking with his friend, that that ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies him is, the company of his friend, and the converſe that he hath with him while he is walking, and ſo he goes
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:30201:108"/>
on in a conſtant way, and walks to the end of the place where his friend is to go, and is ſorry that the walk is ſo ſhort, and ſtill deſires to converſe with his friend: So I ſay, this is the difference for all the world in Profeſſors, there are ſome that have ſome touch of conſcience, and they ſee there is no way for them if they have not mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from God but they muſt periſh, and perhaps they will be ſeeking of God, and following of God, and crying to God for mercy: but if they have not comfort according as they expect they turn away from him, and ſeek for comfort other waies: But a gracious heart that is indeed turned to God, it doth not only ſeek to God for mercy for its ſelf that it might be delivered from miſery, but it ſees an excellency in God, and finds ſweetneſs in Converſe and Communion with God, and loves the preſence of God, and this is the ground of the conſtancy of his heart in the waies of holineſs, Becauſe it loves ſo much of the preſence of God, and Communion with God, it is for God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that the ſoul is in thoſe waies, and ſuch a one will hold out in the waies of God. Indeed one that meerly ſerves God in a ſervile way, and ſeeks himſelf only in ſeeking of God, ſuch a one (I ſay) will be ready to turn aſide; but where the ſoul walks with God out of a ſence of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, Sweetneſs, and Good that there is in Communion with God, ſuch a one goes on in a conſtant way to the end and is not tir'd in the waies of God as others are. You know, If you be walking from place to place, if you have good company with you, you are not weary, you account the journy nothing, why? becauſe you have good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and eſpecially if you have good diſcourſe all along too; ſo it is with Chriſtians, Oh the waies of God come to be very eaſie to them upon this ground, and ſo they hold out.</p>

                  <head>The firſt Excellency.</head>
                  <p>And this may be in the firſt place: <hi>The walking with God.</hi> Oh there is an Excellency in it: If it were only this, That it makes the waies of God eaſie: All the waies of God, how eaſie are they to the ſoul that knows what this means, <hi>[Of walking with God]</hi> That hath God in his company con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, Oh the eaſineſs that there is in the waies of God! it's that that is worth a world, and it's a very grievous and ſad condition that men and women are in who have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced conſciences, and dare not wilfully go out of Gods waies, but are alwaies drooping and find them grievous and tedious to them: But it is becauſe they have not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God in them: they are in them meerly, upon ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity becauſe they ought to be in them. But the Saints find the waies of God more eaſie to them, for they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies good company with then. <hi>When I awake, I am alwaies with thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>David.</hi> The very nights are pleaſant unto them: when he awakes ſtill he is with God. There's ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men and women cannot lie alone; thoſe that cannot ſleep when they awake, if they have no company with them the nights are tedious; but if they cannot ſleep, and yet when they awake they have ſome with them the nights are not ſo tedious to them: When I awake I am ever with thee ſaith <hi>David</hi> concerning God. That's the firſt thing, for the Excellency of this walking with God.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="excellency">

                  <head>The ſecond Excellency.</head>
                  <p>But Secondly, This walking with God, it is, <hi>moſt hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</hi> Oh 'tis an honorable thing to walk with God. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance upon Kings and Princes we know is honorable; The Maids of Honor that do but attend upon a Queen, it's a great honor; the attendance upon a King, yea upon Noble Men: But now, not only attendance, but free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with Princes, that's more than meer attendance; to walk with an Emperour as a friend up and down in his Galleries, in his Gardens, in his Orchyard. So it is with the Saints, <hi>Abraham</hi> is called Gods friend. <hi>You are not my ſervants, but my friends,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. God admits the ſoul to come as a friend and to have converſe with him, Oh! this is honorable. They were accounted bleſſed that were in the preſence of <hi>Solomon,</hi> that were but his ſervants to wait at his Table; much more to ſit at his Table, to ſee the order of <hi>Solomons</hi> Table: Then to be alwaies with God, and walking with him, what a bleſſed and honourable thing is this! It is the honor of Angels themſelves, that they do but ſee the face of God, the Angels that are in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven do behold the face of God; what honor is it then for Chriſtians to be alwaies walking with God? Honor! 'tis that that is the great honor and happineſs of the Church when ſhe ſhall be in her glory. Mark how Chriſt doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe himſelf, in <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 4. <hi>Thou haſt a few names even in</hi> Sardis, <hi>which have not defiled their garments,</hi> What's promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to them? <hi>and they ſhall walk with me in white; for they are worthy.</hi> There ſhall be a glory put upon them, and they ſhall walk with me, for they are worthy. The walking with Chriſt, that's the greateſt honor that Chriſt could promiſe unto them. And ſo in the 14. of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> it's ſaid of thoſe that ſtood upon Mount Sion with the Lamb, having harps in their hands, and ſinging of a new ſong; in the 4 verſe, <hi>Theſe are they which were not defiled with women, for they are virgins; theſe are they which follow the</hi>
                     <pb n="288" facs="tcp:30201:110"/>
                     <hi>Lamb whitherſoever he goes; theſe were redeemed from among men; being the firſt fruit unto God and to the Lamb.</hi> They follow the lamb whitherſoever he goes: This is the honor that is put upon them: Oh the walking with God it is moſt honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>

               <div n="3" type="excellency">
                  <head>The third Excellency.</head>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Excellency of walking with God conſiſts in this, <hi>In the bleſſed ſatisfaction that the ſoul muſt needs have in walking with him:</hi> to walk with life its ſelf, with glory, with happineſſe, and that in a conſtant way, this muſt needs ſatisfie the ſoul, muſt I ſay bring inconceivable ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and peace unto the ſoul thus walking with Him. You know what <hi>Philip</hi> ſaid, <hi>Let us ſee the Father, and it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth us:</hi> What, would it ſuffice <hi>Philip</hi> to ſee God? Oh then! not only to ſee him, but to walk and be continually with him. People will run many times but to have the fight of a great man, but to be admitted into the ſame room and to walk with him; this is more, in the 33. of <hi>Exod</hi> 14. <hi>And he ſaid, my preſence ſhall go with thee, and I will give thee reſt:</hi> God promiſed to <hi>Moſes</hi> that his preſence ſhould be with him, and then when the preſence of God is with the ſoul, Oh the reſt that the ſoul hath by the preſence of God! Oh the lettings out of joy that there muſt needs be to the heart that walks with God! in the 38. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. 9. <hi>They ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly ſatisfied with the fatneſs of thy houſe, and thou ſhalt make them drink of the rivers of thy pleaſures; for with thee is the fonntain of life: In thy light ſhall we ſee light.</hi> Certainly where God walks there is a glorious light round about, that ſuch a ſoul never walks in darkneſs, the light of God ſhines about it; as we reade of thoſe that walked with Chriſt to Emaus, the text ſaith, <hi>Their hearts burn'd within them.</hi> Certainly the hearts of the Saints walking with God muſt needs be fild with thoſe influences from God that muſt make their hearts glow within them while they are walking with him: in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 15, 16. you have a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Scripture there about the ſatisfaction of the ſoul in
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:30201:110"/>
walking with God, <hi>Bleſſed are the people that know the joyfull ſound: they ſhall walk O Lord in the light of thy countenance, In thy Name ſhall they rejoyce all the day, and in thy righteouſneſs ſhall they be exalted.</hi> Thoſe that walk with God they walk in the light of Gods Countenance, and in Gods Name ſhal they rejoyce all the day, and in his righteouſneſs ſhall they be exalted. Oh! a bleſſed thing it is to walk with God. The ſpeech of that noble Marques <hi>Galiatius</hi> that was of great birth in <hi>Italy,</hi> and forſaking all his honors and friends and coming to <hi>Geneve,</hi> he had this expreſſion, ſaith he, upon a time feeling his ſweet converſe with God, <hi>Curſed (ſaith he) be that man that accounts all the gold and ſilver in the world worth one daies enjoyment of Communion with Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He had left a great deal of gold and ſilver, the Pope himſelf was a neer kinſman to him, and great poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and kindred he had, and left it all to come to <hi>Geneve,</hi> to profeſſe the truth there, and he found all recompenced in Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with Chriſt, and his heart was ſo ful with it, that he even curſed thoſe that ſhould account all the gold and ſilver in the world worth the enjoyment of one hours communion with Chriſt: Oh an hours walking with Chriſt is more than all the world. I appeal to thoſe ſouls that have been acquainted with this, whether would you have loſt ſuch an hour that you have been converſing with God for all the world? what would you take for the enjoyment of ſuch an hour as that is? Oh not thouſand thouſands of worlds a gracious heart would not take for ſome hours that it hath in enjoyment of communion with God in walking with him; Oh there's infinite ſweetneſs in wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with God. There's a great deal of good to be had in walking with the Saints, as ſometimes I have told you of Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> that was the Martyr, when he came to priſon he rejoyced that ever he was put in priſon there to meet with that Angel of God <hi>John Bradford:</hi> Now if it be comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to have communion with the Saints though in priſon, Oh how ſweet is it to have communion with God in wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with him! I remember I have read of a King, that
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:30201:111"/>
once beholding <hi>Plato</hi> walking up and down with other Phyloſophers, he cries out thus; <hi>Oh life! this is life and true happineſs; yonder is true happineſs:</hi> he did not look upon his Kingdom as affording a life to him, and as affording that happineſs as he did beleeve <hi>Plato</hi> and the Phyloſophers had converſing one with another about Phyloſphie; as if he ſhould ſay, 'tis not the Kings of the earth that live the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py lives, but theſe Phyloſophers that walk and converſe thus one with another. Oh then what life and happineſs it is for the ſoul to walk up and down with God, and to converſe with God himſelf! what though thou walkeſt in the velly of Bacha, yea what though thou walkeſt in the ſhadow of death in reſpect of outward afflictions, yet wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with God is that that will ſhine upon thee, and will ſweeten thy heart even when thou art walking in the vally of Bacha, and in the ſhadow of death. In the 7. of the <hi>Revel.</hi> ſee whither Jeſus Chriſt leads the ſoul in walking with Him, <hi>The Lamb which is in the midſt of the Throne ſhall feed them, and ſhall lead them unto living fountains of waters, and God ſhall wipe away all tears from their eyes.</hi> Thus when thou walkeſt with Jeſus Chriſt, he leads thee to the living fountains of waters that comfort thee; the comforts that thou hadſt in the world were but as dirty puddles; but thoſe comforts that thou haſt in Chriſt when thou walkeſt with him, they are the fountain of living waters. That's the third thing wherein the excellency of walking with God conſiſts, The abundance of ſoul-ſatisfaction that the heart hath in God.</p>

               <div n="4" type="excellency">
                  <head>The fourth Excellency.</head>
                  <p>The fourth Excellency that there is in walking with God is this, <hi>It's a ſpecial part of the covenant on our part that God doth make with us, upon which the very bleſſing of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant doth in grreat part depend:</hi> as that Scripture in the 17. of <hi>Gen.</hi> doth cleerly ſhew, where God is coming to make a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to be a God to him and to his
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:30201:111"/>
ſeed; what's that God requires of <hi>Abraham</hi> now? <hi>Walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me and be upright;</hi> Then I am God alſufficient, and I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into covenant with you, to be a God to you, and a God to your ſeed, <hi>Walk before me and be upright.</hi> As if that were all the thing that God look'd at, that you ſhould walk with him and be upright: [then] you ſhall have the bleſſing of the Covenant. Oh this is a great excellency, that it is a ſpecial part of the Covenant that God makes with his people on their part: and then on his part, he will be a God unto them. What was it that God requir'd, in the 6. of <hi>Micah,</hi> 6, 7. verſes, there you may ſee how God prizes walking with him, that it's the great thing that God doth look at, whereas there were ſome that ſaid, <hi>Wherewith ſhall I come before the Lord, and bow my ſelf before the high God? ſhall I come before him with burns offerings? with Calves of a yeer old? will the Lord be pleaſed with thouſands of Rams, or with ten thouſands of rivers of Oyl? ſhall I give my firſt born for my tranſgreſſion, the fruit of my body for the ſin of my ſoul?</hi> What ſhall I do to pleaſe God? Mark in the 8. verſe, <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O man, what is good: and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do Juſtly, and to love Mercy, and to WALK humbly with thy God?</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, This is the great thing, to <hi>walk</hi> with thy God; not only to exerciſe ſome particular grace of thy Juſtice, and Mercy, but in general, to walk with thy God; Never tell me of any thing that you would do for me, but in the conſtant courſe of thy life, walk humbly with thy God. This therefore was the comfort of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> when he had the meſſage of death come to him, in the 38. of <hi>Iſa. Remember O Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart; he turned his face to the wall, and</hi> (the text ſaith) <hi>he wept</hi> (it was for joy:) as if he ſhould ſay, Lord, it's true, there hath been many infirmities in me; but Lord, I have walked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee in truth, and with a perfect heart; as if he ſhould ſay, I may boldly challenge, and I do come now Lord to challenge the good of the Covenant, that thou wouldſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me according to the riches of thy mercy, for Lord
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:30201:112"/>
I have walked with thee: as if he ſhould ſay, Lord, was not that the thing that thou didſt require of my father <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham?</hi> why Lord, I have walked before thee, and I have been upright in ſome meaſure; therefore Lord, be a God alſufficient to me, Lord, remember thy Covenant, be a God to me, be All in All to me becauſe of this. Oh my brethren! Is not this worth ten thouſand thouſand worlds, That the ſoul may be able to appeal to God that it hath done that which is a ſpecial thing that is requir'd in the Covenant on our parts; and ſo upon it may have the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Gods performing the Covenant on his part.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="5" type="excellency">
                  <head>The Fifth Excellency.</head>
                  <p>And then the fifth thing is, <hi>There is a bleſſed ſafety in wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with God.</hi> As in the 23. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. there ſee the Prophet <hi>David</hi> that was a man much exerciſed in walking with God, ſaith he, <hi>Yea though I walk through the vally of the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me, thy rod and thy ſtaff doth comfort me:</hi> I am walking with thee, and though I be walking in the ſhadow of death, I'le therefore fear no evil. Now is it not a bleſſed thing to be in ſafety alwaies with God? And in the 138. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7. ſaith <hi>David, Though I walk in the midſt of trouble thou wilt revive me; thou ſhalt ſtretch forth thine hand againſt the wrath of mine enemies: and thy right hand ſhall ſave me.</hi> No matter what the trouble be ſo God be with the ſoul; he that walks uprightly walks ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the 10. of the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> 9. Whereas it's ſaid of the wicked that they walk upon a ſnare continually: in the 18. of <hi>Job,</hi> 8. <hi>The wicked walk upon a ſnare:</hi> The waies of wickedneſſe that you walk in, they may ſeem to be pleaſant and comfortable to you, but certainly you are upon a ſnare, and you may be catch'd and undone for ever, though perhaps thou haſt eſcap'd all this while, yet thou art in continual dangers, Every ſtep (I ſay) thou goeſt on in the waies of ſin, thou art upon a ſnare, and in danger to be catch'd to thy eternal deſtruction; But he that walks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:30201:112"/>
he walks ſurely, and this is a great excellency, for a man to walk ſurely, I know I am in my way for I am with God: A child doth not fear what way ſoever it goes in, if he can but ſee his father. Now the ſoul may know ſurely, I am in the right way, I am with God; and I am ſafe what ever danger comes, for I am walking with God.</p>

               <div n="6" type="excellency">
                  <head>The Sixth Excellency.</head>
                  <p>The ſixth Excellency that there is in walking with God is this, <hi>From hence the ſoul comes to enjoy a holy boldneſs and a holy familiarity with God.</hi> It may be when the ſoul comes firſt to God, the preſence of the great God ſtrikes ſome fear, there is ſome dread of the Majeſty of God; But when the ſoul hath uſed to converſe with him, there is a holy fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity that the ſoul hath with God, and a holy boldneſs, it can have free liberty to ſay any thing to him now; and this is the reaſon that ſome now that never knew what the ſpirit of prayer meant, and what the liberty of the ſoul in opening its ſelf to God meant before, yet when they have come to be acquainted with the waies of God; Oh what liberty have they then in their ſpirits to open their hearts to God, yea, they can open their hearts to God as one friend to another. I remember it's ſaid of <hi>Luther,</hi> that when ever he was praying, he could ſpeak to God as to his friend. In <hi>Job,</hi> 22. 21. <hi>Acqusint now thy ſelf with Him, and be at peace.</hi> The ſoul comes to have an acquaintance with God, Oh what a phraſe is here! What, acquaint our ſelves with God, that God ſhould be our acquaintance! I, God is willing to be the acqaintance of the pooreſt Chriſtian in the world, Poor men and women, and Servants, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that perhaps ſome rich men that is by them wil ſcorn their acquaintance, but they account them rather (as it's ſpoken of ſome vile people) fit to be ſet with the dogs of the flock, yea, perhaps though they be poor godly people, yet they think it too much debaſing themſelves to have any kind of acquaintance with them: Well, but the infinite
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:30201:113"/>
God though he is ſo high that he humbles himſelf to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the very things that are done in Heaven, yet this God thinks not much to be one of thy acquaintance, to be of the acquaintance of any one that hath any godlineſs in them; when we ſee a great man, a man of parts and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor come to ſome poor man and ſhake him by the hand, we will ſay, Look what an humble man is this, that will be ſo familiar with the meaneſt of all. Oh! now acquaint thy ſelf with God, This is the bleſſedneſs of walking with God; the ſoul comes to have a familiar converſe with God, and a holy boldneſs.</p>

                  <head>The ſeventh Excellency.</head>
                  <p>The ſeventh benefit or Excellency that there is in wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with God is this, <hi>The Communication of Gods ſecrets.</hi> He that walks with God ſhall come to know the mind of God. It's impoſſible for a man to take delight in walking with another but he muſt diſcover ſecrets from him; there's ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any true friendſhip where there is a cloſeneſs of ſpirit. But where there is true friendſhip they will take one another and walk together, and open their hearts each to other: this is comfortable walking indeed. Thus it is in walking with God, this is the bleſſing of it, ſuch ſouls they have the ſecrets of God diſcovered to them, they come to know much of the mind of God; though they are weak in their natural parts, yet (I ſay) they come to know much of Gods mind becauſe they are with God. We reade in the 13. of <hi>Proverbs,</hi> 20. verſ. ſaith the holy Ghoſt there, <hi>He that walketh with wiſe men ſhall be wiſe.</hi> Then what ſhall he be that walks with God? Surely if there be wiſdom to be learned from our walking with wiſe men, then there is wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to be learn'd in walking with God: 'Tis from hence that men that are weak in parts they come to have ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent knowledg in the great myſteries of the Goſpel, and you wonder at it: you ſee ſuch a mean ſervant that a while ago could underſtand nothing at all; yet now comes to
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:30201:113"/>
underſtand the great myſteries of the Goſpel, and that be yond many great Scholers: How comes this to paſſe? he walks with the God of wiſdom, and the God of wiſdom doth delight to let out himſelf to him, and to open his heart to him, they come to know the counſels of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they walk with him; thoſe Chriſtians that keep cloſe to God in a holy converſation walking with him, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they come to know more of the mind of God than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do; others that walk looſly they know little of the great myſteries of the Goſpel, they may talk ſomething of them, but certainly they have not a ſpiritual inſight into the Great myſteries of the Goſpel ſo as thoſe have that walk with God.</p>

                  <p>The eighth benefit of walking with God it is, <hi>That ſuch find favour in Gods eyes for granting their petitions; for to hear them in their prayers.</hi> In the 37. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. ver. <hi>Delight thy ſelf in the Lord, and he ſhall give thee the deſire of thine heart;</hi> walk with God, and enjoy converſe and communion with him, ſo as to delight thy ſelf with him, and he will give thee thy hearts deſire, thou ſhalt have what thou wouldſt have. As now, if a man have a petition to give to any great man, If he can but obſerve him in his walks, then he thinks that ſurely when he may have ſuch an opportunity, now to preſent it as he hopes to have audiance, and acceptance of the petition. I remember I have read of one that offered to give a great ſum of mony that he might have but liberty to whiſper any thing in the Kings ear every day, why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thereby he thought that he ſhould have a great many people come to him to deſire his help for to prefer their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, and if he might have but that liberty he ſhould get enough that way. Now the ſoul that hath the liberty of walking with God, what a priviledg hath he? and what opportunities to preſent petitions to God? and the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in hearing of them. If a King will admit a man to walk with him, ſurely ſuch a man whatſoever he preſents

it's like to ſpeed. Now my brethren, upon this ground it is thus: you ſhall ſee a great deal of difference in a formal profeſſor's prayer, &amp; the prayer of a godly man that walks with God; the difference in the prayers of theſe two is thus: I'le ſet it out by this ſimilitude. You have your beggers, and they pray for an alms, but they ſtand at the door; but if you a have ſpecial friend, an acquaintance that ſhall come to deſire a favour from you, the door is opened for him, you carry him into the Parlour, and there he opens his mind to you, he hath a great deal of priviledg more than the other: Both come to ask a favour from you, but one ſtands at the door, and the other is let into the Parlour and walks up and down there, and there opens his mind to you. Juſt for all the world is there this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the prayers of formal profeſſors, and the prayers of thoſe that walk with God; Thoſe that make but a meer profeſſion of Religion, they will pray as others do, but they are like beggers at the door, they ſee not Gods face all the while, they knock it may be, but the door is not opened for them to come in: But a gracious heart that walks with God, doth not only ſtand knocking at the door, but it is opened and he comes into the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence Chamber, and there ſaith God, What is thy requeſt O thou ſoul? As if a friend ſhould hear another that is his dear friend ſtand knocking at the door, he preſently o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens the door and carries him into the beſt room that he hath, and there ſaith, Tell me what it is that you would have, I am not able to deny you; and this is the priviledg of thoſe that are gracious and holy, that walk with God: they have much priviledg in prayer, much benefit that way, and freedom with God, and aſſurance of Gods gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of their petitions.</p>

As it was with <hi>Moſes,</hi> he went up and was but with God fourty daies upon the mount, and when he came down, his face did ſhine that the people were not able to behold it: God appeared in a viſible manner to him; But ſpiritually it's true now, the ſoul that is converſing with God fourty daies, yea, in the conſtant courſe of his life, hath a beauty, a luſtre, a glory put upon it, and ſuch a luſtre and glory that thoſe that have enlightened conſciences and yet are guilty they are ſcarce able to bear the fight of them: As I appeal to you, when you have given liberty to ſome way of ſin, and you have come into the preſence of thoſe that have been godly and walked very cloſe with God, hath it not ſtruck a terror to you? for there is a glory and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon thoſe ſouls that do walk cloſe with God, they do ſhine in the midſt of a crooked and perverce generation.

                  <p>And beſides, <hi>The preſence of God, and familiarity of the ſoul in walking with him, will make the preſence of God neither at death or judgment ſhall ever be terrible to it.</hi> Thoſe that now walk with God and have much converſe with him, (I ſay) when they come to die, Gods preſence ſhall not be terrible to them; yea when Jeſus Chriſt ſhall come in flaming fire to revenge himſelf upon thoſe that know him not, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt ſhal not be terrible to them: Why? Becauſe they walked with Chriſt all the daies of their lives: In the 11. of <hi>Hoſea,</hi> 10. verſ. <hi>They ſhall walk after the Lord: he ſhall roar like a Lyon.</hi> Mark how theſe two are joyned together: wicked and ungodly men they ſhall tremble at the roaring of a Lyon: but for the Saints it ſhal not be terrible to them: And how much is it worth, that when God ſhall appear in death, and at judgment here and hereafter, the terrour of God ſhall be taken away? My brethren, God appears at death, and at the times of Judgment ordinarily in another manner than he doth in the time of proſperity; you ſee no terror in Gods preſence now; but beware of it when death is approaching: wicked men when they lie upon their death-beds, how terrible is the preſence of God to them then! but thoſe that walk with God ſhall not find it ſo: when they come to die, then God appears to them; Now am I going to ſtand before the great God, to have my eternal eſtate determined one way or other: But what God is this? He is great indeed; but he is my friend, I have had converſe with him all the daies of my life: And ſo, when I muſt come to Judgment here comes Jeſus Chriſt with his thouſands of Angels in glory, but it is Chriſt that I have converſed with all the daies of my life, this Chriſt hath been my friend before whom I am.

It's a bleſſed thing to walk with God now; but when you come to the End of this walk you ſhall find it bleſſed indeed. If a man did come to enjoy God at laſt, though it was through never ſo many difficulties, yet he had cauſe to bleſſe God. If one were going to poſſeſs a Kingdom, though his way were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuch a difficult way and hard, yet the end of his way would make it comfortable, becauſe it is to go and take a Kingdom: But now, you that are walking with God, you have comfort in your walk, but the end of your walk, oh that will be glorious indeed! it is to poſſeſſe a Kingdom, it is to have the crown of glory ſet upon your heads; your communion that you have with God here, it is but as the forerunner of that glorious Communion that you ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy with him together with the Saints and Angels to all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>What ſtrangers are the moſt part of the world to this that I am ſpeaking of.</hi> That which I am ſpeaking of it's a riddle to moſt men in the world, This walking with God is but an empty ſound to moſt men, yea, for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of the world they walk (as the Scripture ſpeaks) after their own counſels, you ſhall find divers notable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in Scripture of the walk of ſinners, of wicked men.</p>
                  <p>They walk according to their own counſels. They walk after the fleſh. They walk after their luſts. They walk after the courſe of this world. They walk in the vanity of their minds. They walk contrary unto God. They walk according to men.</p>
                  <p>Yea, That's obſervable unto this, That the holy Ghoſt condemns, not only walking according to the courſe of the world, and as men, But to walk in the way of Kings is condemn'd in Scripture: In 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 2. If to follow the courſe of any men one would think it might be moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable the following of the King: but here's a charge againſt <hi>Ahaz</hi> that he walked in the waies of the Kings of Iſrael: and the 2 <hi>Kings,</hi> 17. 8. <hi>They walked in the Statutes of the Heathen:</hi> here's to walk as Kings walk, and then to walk in the Laws of Kings, God would not have any men walk in them any further than they are according to his own Statutes. Not to ſay, it's according to Law, and I muſt walk according to Law: No, this is charged to walk according to the practice of Kings, or their Laws be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil. And there's another Scripiure in the I <hi>Kings,</hi> 15. 26. <hi>He did evil in the ſight of the Lord, and walked in the waies of his father, and in his ſin wherewith he made Iſrael to ſin.</hi> There's to walk in the way of great men, and that's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. Secondly, to walk in the way of the Laws of the places where we live. Thirdly, to walk according to our fathers, that's condemned. And then laſtly, to walk
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:30201:117"/>
according to the common courſe of the world, that's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; and yet this is the walk of ſinners. And further The Scripture ſaith, That wicked men they walk in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: and they walk after their own imaginations, and in the vanity of their minds, they walk in lies, and their hearts walk after the ſight of their own eyes, and they walk after their covetouſneſs: We might mention neer twenty ſuch kind of expreſſions in Scripture, and theſe are the walks of ſinners: But the waies of the Saints, they are to walk with God, but thoſe that walk in the way of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that is, in the vanity of their minds according to the fight of their own eyes, after their covetouſneſs, and after the fleſh, and their luſts, and laſiviouſneſs, and vanity, and ſuch kind of expreſſion as we have in Scripture, Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they ſhall have the end of their walk to be no other but deſtruction and eternal miſery.</p>

Oh that we would but conſider of this when we are in our walk &amp; there have vain thoughts: As ordinarily men that are walking in their pleaſant Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, or it may be pleaſant Rooms, Oh the vanity and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of their thoughts!

Oh what a vile and ſinful thing is this! The Lord humble you for your ſinful walks, humble you that are Saints, you ſometimes have had ſome walks with God, why is it that you walk no more cloſe with God? you complain ſometimes of your great buſineſs in the world, and occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to converſe with the world that you have no time for your Communion with God; and yet when you are off from the world, and when you have time alone wherein you might converſe with God, and when you have walks to the Citie and from the Citie again, what Communion might you have with God! But Oh! how backward are our hearts even unto this that is our happineſſe, and our glory!

The Lord doth often call us to walk with him; As ſometimes familiar friends will call one another, Come, let us walk out together, and thoſe that are very familiar and loving: though they may have ſome buſineſs yet they will lay it aſide, ſeeing their deer friends calls them to walk, they take ſo much delight in it: many times God our deer friend cals us, Come, let us walk out toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. When God at any time doth dart in a Heavenly thought into your minds, he doth (as it were) call you to walk with him there, and would have you follow that thought, The following that Heavenly thought that's darted into your minds, that's the anſwering of Gods call to walk with him.

                  <p>And then the laſt thing that I ſhall name by way of Uſe is this, <hi>If there be ſo much Excellency in our walking with God here, what will there be in Heaven then!</hi> If our converſe with him in this world be ſo ſweet, Oh how ſweet ſhall our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with him in Heaven be! when we ſhall walk with him in white: when we ſhall have our garments glorious indeed, and our ſouls fit to converſe with God. Now the truth is, we are very unfit to converſe with the Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of our blindneſs and darkneſſe, we do not know God. As now, let an ignorant man come to converſe with a learned man, he gets but very little good, for he is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to put a queſtion to him, nor able to underſtand what the man ſaith, eſpecially if he ſpeaks any depth of learning to him. So, many that are very weak when they are in diſcourſe with thoſe that are ſtrong and godly, they are not able to make that uſe for their diſcourſe as others can, and it's a great excellency for one to be able to improve his converſe with ſome men that have abilities and ſtrength, to be able (I ſay) to improve their Converſe it's a great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency.
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:30201:118"/>
Alas! we are not able to improve our converſe with God here: but in Heaven we ſhall be able to improve our converſe with God, We ſhall know as we are known, we ſhall underſtand God, if God doth but communicate himſelf we ſhall be fit to receive all the beams of his glory that he ſhal be pleaſed to let out, Oh! that wil be an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent thing indeed when we ſhall be alwaies walking with God, and converſing with him continually. Saith <hi>Bernard,</hi> in the gracious viſitations of the Spirit of God to his ſoul, <hi>How ſweet if it were not ſo little!</hi> but then it ſhall be conſtant, we ſhall then follow the Lamb whitherſoever he goes, and walk with him in white according as he ſpeaks. Now the Church cries out and ſaith, <hi>Oh draw us, and we will run of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thee.</hi> The Spirit of God had need to draw us here; but then we ſhall have no ſuch need of drawing, but we ſhall of our ſelves, from the inclination of our own hearts, be alwaies walking and converſing with God, we ſhall have nothing elſe to do but to walk continually with the Lord, <hi>I will walk in thy truth, unite my heart to fear thy Name: Pſal.</hi> 86. 11. It's an excellent Scripture, I will walk in thy Truth ſaith the Prophet, Oh unite my heart to the fear of thy Name. As if he ſhould ſay, I find much ſweetneſſe and good in walking in thy Truth here, Oh Lord unite my heart to the fear of thy Name, Lord keep me alwaies here, it's good being here, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid when Chriſt was transfigured in his glory: So, when the ſoul is walking with God, it ſaith, it is good being here: Well, when thou comeſt to Heaven thou ſhalt alwaies be with the Lord as the Scripture ſpeaks, and therefore from the excellency that thou findeſt here, learn to long after Heaven, where thou ſhalt be continually with the Lord; and take only this one note for the ſetting out of the excellency of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and I confeſſe only ſuch as have had much ſweetneſs in walking with God here, will underſtand what I mean by this; As ſuppoſe that all thoſe ſweet manifeſtations of God to thy ſoul here, and all the dartings in of the Spirit of God, all thoſe ſoul raviſhing joys that thou haſt had,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:30201:119"/>
ſuppoſe they were put all together, that thou hadſt them all over again at this inſtant, what a comfortable time would it be! At ſuch a time may ſome ſoul (that knows what the meaning of this point is) ſay, Oh the ſweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion I had with God! I would give a world to have it again: Well, thou hadſt it once, but it was quickly gone, and thou haſt had it a ſecond and a third time, yea, many times when I have been with God I have had wonderful, &amp; gracious lettings out of God to my ſoul, Oh that I had them again! Well, ſuppoſe thou hadſt now in this one quarter of an hour all the comfort and joy that ever thou hadſt in all thy life put all the times together, what a comfortable quarter of an hour would this be! Now in Heaven to all eternity thou ſhalt have that in a kind infinitely more than that for milions of yeers, even for ever. Oh! what will Heaven be! If I ſhould ſet out Heaven to a carnal man I muſt tell him of Crowns of glory, And there he ſhall ſee glorious ſights, he ſhall be freed from all kind of ſorrows, and there he ſhall have a Kingdom: But if I would ſet out Heaven to a Saint, I muſt tell him this, He ſhall have communion with God, and all thoſe ſoul-ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing comforts that he hath had in the preſence of God in this world, he ſhall have them all together, and infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more than them, Oh this is that that will make their ſouls long after Heaven, and ſet prize upon it.</p>

But now, one that walks with God, his walk lies beyond Sence, and above Reaſon; though things of Sence ſeem to go this way or that way, quite croſſe to him, yea, though Reaſon ſeem to go quite croſſe to him, yet ſtill his heart is not in a hurry, but he hath that that can quiet his heart though Sence and Reaſon ſeem to be contrary: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7. there you ſhal ſee the walk of a godly man, <hi>For we walk by faith and not by ſight,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; beyond our ſight, either beyond our ſight of ſence, or the ſight of Reaſon; we walk by faith. But now, this is a great point, a Chriſtian walking by faith, and therefore I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſpeak to that by its ſelf from this very text, (God willing) in another Treatiſe.</p>

There are many people that when they are abroad in the world they ſeem to be very ſtrict in their way, but follow ſuch men to their houſes and there you ſhall ſee a great deal of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. You will find many times as much difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the courſe of men when they are abroad and in their houſes, as you find in their cloaths; you ſhall have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men and women when they go abroad they wil be very neat, and though they have but little means, yet they wil lay it upon their backs ſo that they may be fine abroad; but come to them in their families and they care not what cloaths they wear there: It is juſt ſo in regard of their lives, their lives have as much difference as their cloaths: When they are abroad then they put a good face on things and ſeem to be very fair in their converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſpeak good things, but at home there they are froward and perverſe, and perhaps in their paſſions, will ſwear, there they are prophane, and ungodly, and vent their corruptions in a moſt ungodly manner; doeſt thou walk with God? If thou hadſt to deal with God thou wouldſt be the ſame in thy family that thou art abroad, that thy wife, children, and ſervants in thy family might give as good a teſtimony of thee as when thou art abroad with others: Yea, and if ye could retire with them into their very cloſets you ſhould find them the ſame there in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny duties of Religion. You ſhall have many when they come abroad and joyn with others, Oh how enlarged are they! yet dead and dull when they are at home either in family or cloſet, yea their own conſciences tells them ſo. Thoſe that walk with God wil be as ſpiritual in the one as in the other; it may be when they are with others, becauſe they are to be the mouth of others they wil ſure themſelves according to thoſe they pray with; yet when they are alone

                  <head>The third Evidence.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A man that walks with God hath a ſerious ſpirit:</hi> walking with God will compoſe the ſpirits of men and women, will take off that looſneſs and vanity of ſpirit: Therefore wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the vanity of the mind, that's quite croſſe to wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with God; as in the 4. of the <hi>Ephe.</hi> 17. there it's ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of wicked men, it's ſaid that they walk in the vanity of their minds: All wicked men they walk in the vanity of their minds; then all thoſe that walk with God walk in the ſeriouſneſs of their minds: It muſt needs be that they muſt have a ſeriouſneſs of ſpirit in all their waies, for it's with God that they have to deal withal, they take not that liberty to run this way or that way as others do. If ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants be walking one with another they can take liberty to go out of their way and talk with this or the other body as they pleaſe: But if a ſervant walk with his Maſter or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris, he muſt not take that liberty but muſt go as they go. So, many that walk only with the creature, they take liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to run up and down as they pleaſe; but thoſe that walk with God, they muſt have compoſed ſpirits, and walk ſeriouſly, and though they may walk ſeriouſly, yet cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; I beſeech you conſider of this: For that Chriſtian knows not the way of Chriſtian-rejoycing that doth not know how to mix it with ſeriouſneſs; yea, <hi>Senecha</hi> that was a Heathen could ſay, <hi>Joy, it is a ſerious thing;</hi> there is a kind of ſeriouſneſs in true joy, for the joy of a Chriſtian is not frothy, it is a compoſed joy: As thus now, It's ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, A Chriſtian in his joy he is able to command him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he can let out his joy ſo far and yet at a beck he can
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:30201:121"/>
command himſelf to the moſt ſpiritual duty in the world from his joy, he doth not profuſely let out his heart ſo as he cannot call it in again. Certainly, thou doſt not joy as a Chriſtian if thou canſt not take off thy heart from creature joyes, God gives thee liberty to be merry, but ſo, as to have it under thy command, as thou ſhalt be able to call thy heart off from it to the moſt ſerious duty in the world.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He cannot only command himſelf to holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the midſt of his joy, but he finds himſelf the fitter for holy duties by it: now this is a ſerious joy if it be no other than I can command my ſelf off from it, and that that fits me for that which is holy: Chriſtians had need take heed of frothineſſe, ſlightneſſe, and vanity, for certainly the wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with God cannot but make them ſerious, and thoſe that are ſlight and vain, ſurely they do not converſe with God, for God is ſuch a ſerious object that it's impoſſible but it muſt work a ſeriouſneſſe in the ſpirits of men.</p>

                     <hi>A man that walks with God, he loves to be much retir'd from the world.</hi> It's true, he muſt follow his occaſions in the world, he doth that in obedience unto God, but except he may have his retired times he knows not how to live, it's true, when he is in his calling he walks with God there, he carries his heart Heavenly: There's a great deal of difference for one to walk with a friend in company with others, and when they are alone, though it's true, that while the Saints of God live in the world they muſt converſe with the men of the world, and they have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of God there: but though they have ſomewhat of God there, yet that's not ſo much as when God and their ſouls are alone, this is that that is exceeding ſweet and comfortable to them, therefore they have their retired times of meditation; and retired times of prayer; as we reade of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> he went out into the field to meditate, or to pray, for ſo meditation and prayer is taken ſometimes in Scripture for all one: <hi>I'le powr forth my meditations to thee,</hi> ſath <hi>David:</hi> that was his prayer: So, becauſe they ſhould be both joyned together, <hi>Iſaac</hi> went out into the field to meditate. Thoſe that walk with God if they live in a houſe and have no retir'd rooms, they go abroad and have ſome time or other to be retir'd by themſelves; where-as you have other men, they know not how to ſpend any retired times, when they are alone their minds wander this way or that way, and they gaze after every feather that flies, and it's a priſon for them to be alone, and they won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that men and women will ſhut up themſelves alone, ſurely it's but their melanchollineſſe. Oh poor wretch, thou knoweſt not what walks they have, they are not alone all this time, they would be loth to give their retired times for all the times of thy Jollity and Bravery; Thou thinkeſt if thou beeſt abroad in company, and there art feaſting, and having good cheer, and muſick, and talking,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:30201:122"/>
and laughing that this is a brave life, they would be loth to change their retired times for the times of thy greateſt Jolity with thy companions: One that walks with God he loves ſome retir'd times as well as to be buſie in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe of the world.</p>

                     <hi>One that walks with God, he is careful to make even his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts with God, he doth keep his accompts with God even.</hi> This is a ſpecial thing in walking with God, when they lie down to conſider, Are my accompts even with God? is there nothing amiſſe between God and my ſoul? what hath been this day between God and my ſoul? For how can two walk together except they be agreed as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaith: Therefore they are very careful to keep their agreement with God. Indeed Jeſus Chriſt the great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciler hath firſt reconciled their ſouls to God and ſo they come to walk with him: but then afterwards in the courſe of their lives they muſt keep up their agreement with God, and not to run in areriges with, and ſo to be inſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the world, and inſnared in the corruptions of their own hearts, as that men and women will be, if they be not careful to keep their accompts with God even daily, They will inſnare their ſouls in the world and in the luſts of their own hearts till God and their ſouls come to be ſtrangers, yea, til they be afraid almoſt to think of God; Here's the reaſon that many people are loth to come to prayer, loth to come to duties of communion with God, why? becauſe they have not kept their accompts even with God, but have run in areriges with God, and their hearts are intangled in the world, and in their luſts, and now the preſence of God comes to be terrible to them; Oh poor wretch that thou art, what thou that art a Chriſtian and yet in ſuch a caſe that the preſence of God ſhould be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to thee!

                     <hi>That the more ſpiritual any Truth is, or any Ordinance is, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Company is, the more doth the ſoul delight in it:</hi> One that is uſed to God, and converſes with God, when ſuch a one meets with a Truth that hath much of God in it, Oh how it cloſes with that Truth! when it meets with an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance that hath much of God in it, when it meets with Company that hath much of God in it, how doth this ſoul delight in it! This is ſutable to the heart that conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes much with God, ſaith the ſoul, I have had ſweet walks with God, now me thinks I come into ſuch a Company, I ſee the very Image of God in theſe, and Oh how ſweet and delightſom are theſe to me! and ſo for Truths, and Ordinances, the more ſpiritual they are the more ſuch a one doth delight in them: whereas a carnal heart that walks according to the fleſh, in the way of the world, if there be ſome Truths that have ſome kind of humanity in them, as now, ſome ſollid diſcourſe that ſhews ſtrength of reaſon, or ſtrength of judgment in a Sermon, he will take

                  <head>The Tenth Evidence, Opened in five Particulars.</head>
                  <p>See but how the Scripture deſcribes the walk of the Saints with God; there are ſome four or five particulars that I ſhal infiſt upon, wherein I ſhal open ſome Scriptures, deſcribing the Saints walk with God.</p>
                  <p>As firſt, Their walk it is a walk of Humility, a way very humble. The heart that walks with God muſt needs be very humble in the preſence of God; you know the place in the 6. of <hi>Micah, He hath ſhewn thee, O man, what he would have thee to do, To walk humbly with thy God:</hi> that's more than the offering of thouſands of Lambs, or ten thouſand Rivers of Oyl, To walk humbly with thy God: A proud man or woman never knows what it is to walk with God. But the walking with God cauſes much humility, there's no ſuch thing in the world to humble the heart of a man as to have converſe with God, do you ſee a man proud and haughty, and high in his carriage, ſurely you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this man hath little converſe with God: ſaith <hi>Job, I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now have mine eyes ſeen thee:</hi> what then? <hi>I abhor my ſelf in duſt and aſhes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Another thing that the Scripture ſpeaks of the walk of a Chriſtian with God, it is, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs; Walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, and he upright.</hi> I might give you twenty Scriptures for that, how uprightneſs is the walk of a Chriſtian with God: I'le give you only one about this, and that is in the 3 Epiſt. of <hi>John,</hi> 3. verſe, there it is expreſt in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, by <hi>walking in the truth:</hi> and ſo ſometimes in the Old, <hi>the walking in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs,</hi> and <hi>walking in the Truth,</hi> is ſomewhat the ſame: <hi>I rejoyced greatly</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle)
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:30201:124"/>
                     <hi>when the Brethren came and teſtified of the truth that is in thee, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as thou walkeſt in the truth:</hi> So that this ſurely hath refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto walking according to the truth of the Goſpel in the truth and ſincerity of our hearts: <hi>They teſtified of the truth that is in thee:</hi> That is, The Word of the Goſpel that did prevail in thy heart, and prevailing in thy heart thou didſt walk-in the ſtrength and power of that Truth, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the truth; here's a walking with God. And no marvel though the ſoul of this man was in ſo good a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as indeed it was; for you find in the 2. verſe of this Epiſtle a very ſtrange expreſſion of <hi>John</hi> concerning this <hi>Gaius:</hi> what doth he ſay of him? <hi>I wiſh</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>above al things, that then mayeſt proſper and be in health even as thy ſoul proſpereth.</hi> It ſeems this <hi>Gaius</hi> had but a poor, weak, ſickly body: but a very good ſoul he was; and ſaith <hi>John,</hi> I wiſh that thou mayeſt proſper even as thy ſoul proſpereth. Oh! that thou hadſt but as good a body as a ſoul! It's a very ſtrange ſpeech. It were a curſe to many of you I am afraid. But <hi>John</hi> could ſay concerning <hi>Gaius,</hi> Oh that this man <hi>Gaius</hi> had as good a body as he hath a ſoul! And how came he to have his ſoul to proſper? He walked in the truth, and according to the truth; and al that he did was in the truth and ſincerity of his heart, hence his ſoul came to proſper: and thoſe that have but very weak parts, yet if they walk in the truth, their ſouls will proſper.</p>
                  <p>The Third thing is, <hi>Walking in the fear of God.</hi> And indeed, theſe two are very neer a kin one to another, ſo you have it in the 5. of <hi>Nehe.</hi> 9. verſe, <hi>Alſo I ſaid it is not good that ye do, Ought ye not to WALK in the fear of our God?</hi> and he gives an argument there, <hi>Becauſe of the reproach of the Heathen.</hi> So may I ſay to all Chriſtians, that would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe themſelves Chriſtians and godly; ought not ye to walk in the fear of our God? whatſoever other men do, they do thus and thus, and ſeek to follow their own ends and waies, but ought not YE to walk in the fear of our God? that's the walk of a Chriſtian, the fear of God it is continually upon him.

of the <hi>Acts,</hi> of the walk of the Chriſtians in the Primitive times upon which they came ſo to grow up in the waies of godlineſs as they did, at the 31. verſe, the text ſaith, <hi>Then had the Churches reſt throughout all Judea, and Gallilee, and Samaira, and were edified;</hi> (and what then?) <hi>They walked in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the holy Ghoſt, and ſo came to be multiplied.</hi> It's an excellent Scripture; would you be built up in godlineſs? let the fear of God be upon you, and if you walk in the fear of God, you will walk in the joy of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> No, But the way to have true joy in the holy Ghoſt it is, To walk in the fear of God, and though you have a company of vain and wanton ſpirits, that are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but for Jolity and Mirth, they cannot admit of any kind of ſeriouſneſs (that we ſpake to before:) But certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their Jolity it's but frothy and carnal, but thoſe have the beſt Joy in their hearts that walk moſt in the fear of God: When I ſee a Chriſtian have the fear of God upon him, and that in the whol courſe of his life, then he will have much of the comfort of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>The comfort of the holy Ghoſt it's joyned with the fear of God:</hi> and if you ſee any that talk never ſo much of the joy that they have; it's but a frothy carnal joy except the fear of God be upon them; Oh it will be a means to convince others of the excellency of the wales of God, when they ſhall ſee Chriſtians walk in the fear of God; thus ſaith the text, <hi>they were multiplied;</hi> there were many that were convinc'd by it and did joyn with them, becauſe they did ſee ſuch a beauty and excellency in their way, walking in the fear of God and in the joy of the holy Ghoſt: and this was at a time when they had much reſt; many people it may be when they are in danger, then they wil ſeem to walk in the fear of God: but mark, this was in a time when this people was freed from their danger, then they walked in the fear of the Lord; and in the joy of the holy Ghoſt, that was encreaſed in them: And this is the
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:30201:125"/>
walk of the Saints in their walking with God.</p>
                  <p>Two or three things more I ſhall mention. As now,</p>
                  <p>The walk that they walk, it's <hi>above:</hi> The way of the Saints it is on high, it's a walk above the world, they keep themſelves on high aloft in a ſpiritual way: it's true, their hearts are humble before God, and yet they are on high too; though they look not upon themſelves as worthy of the leaſt crumb of bread, yet they look upon themſelves again as too good to be vaſſals to the world, or to their luſts; and they look upon themſelves as being ſet by God in too a high condition to be ſatisfied with all the world to be their portion; their hearts are lifted up on high to converſe with the moſt High God, and ſo they come to be delivered from the ſnares of death that are below.</p>
                  <p>Yea and alſo, They endeavor to walk as Chriſt walked: as in the 1 Epiſt. of <hi>John,</hi> 2. 6. <hi>They walk as Chriſt himſelf walked, thoſe that walk with God.</hi> Who did ever walk with God ſo as Chriſt did? who had ever that fellowſhip with the Father and the Son ſo as Chriſt had? The Saints they labor to walk ſo as Chriſt walked, to look upon Chriſt as the pattern of their lives. And ſo as Chriſt was anointed with the oyl of joy and gladnes above his fellows; ſo they come to have ſome of the ointment run down upon them, they come to have ſomewhat of that communion that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt had with the Father, Chriſt had much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Father in the conſtant courſe of his life: Now the Saints laboring to walk as Chriſt walked, ſo they come to have Communion with God. The Lord bring you into this walk, and keep you in ſuch a bleſſed walk as this is.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX. <hi>Twelve Rules of Direction for walking with God.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WHat Rules ſhould be obſerved for a Chriſtian's walking with God? You will ſay to me, You have ſhewed to us, <hi>That it is a moſt bleſſed thing to walk with God,</hi> and we are convinced of it: But what Rules may there be given for it?</p>
               <div n="1" type="rule">
                  <head>The Firſt Rule.</head>
                  <p>Be ſure of this, <hi>That there be no way of ſin in thee.</hi> Take heed of giving way to any ſin, eſpecially known ſin, though it be a little one, though it ſhould be but a ſin of omiſion, the giving way to any known ſin, will make the preſence of God terrible, and make all thy duties empty; will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrang God from thy ſoul: there's more evil in it than thou art aware of, thou canſt have no Communion with God while thou art in any way of ſin, eſpecially if it be againſt Light, The <hi>leaſt</hi> ſin that is that a Chriſtian gives way unto, is like a thorn in a mans foot, but a <hi>great</hi> ſin, &amp; a ſin againſt knowledg is like a great gaſh in a mans foot; now if a man hath but a thorn in his foot he cannot walk well, it will make him halt; if a man hath but a little gravel got into his ſhoo he will not be able to walk along, he may walk a ſtep or two, but not very long. Now ſmall ſins are like gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in the ſhoo, or like a thorn got into the foot; but if thou falleſt into a great ſin, a ſin againſt light, againſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, Oh that is like a great gaſh that one may cut with a hatchet or an ax; if a man hath cut a great gaſh in his foot he wil hardly be able to walk with comfort: Even ſo it is when thou falleſt into any great ſin, thou hadſt need then go to the Chyriurgeon, thou hadſt need then have ſalve applied to thee to heal thy ſoul, or otherwiſe it wil hinder thee in thy walk with God.</p>

                  <head>The ſecond Rule, or Direction.</head>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Labor to abſtract thy heart from earthly and ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al things as much as thou canſt that thou mayeſt be ſpiritual:</hi> A droſſie, earthly, ſenſual heart is unfit to have communion with God, God he is a Spirit, and thou muſt be Spiritual in thy converſe with him, take heed of mingling thy heart with creature comforts, thou mayeſt make uſe of them, but in a ſpiritual way, do not defile thy heart with them, let not thy heart cloſe with them as adequat objects of thy deſires, or of thy love, take heed of being intangled, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſnar'd with any creature comforts; a man cannot walk if he hath got into a ſnare, when men fetter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the world, and intangle themſelves with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of buſineſſes, &amp; creature contentments, it doth migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily hinder their freedom in walking with God, when mens hearts ſink down to the creature they cannot walk with God, for God is above, he is on high, and the way of the wiſe is on high, and we muſt keep our ſelves on high: If ſo be that Chriſtians have ſometimes ſome good affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, their hearts are a little ſtir'd up to things that are good; but at other times their hearts ſink down to the world, and to ſenſual, and earthly contentments, they cannot walk freely with God, they can but hault at the beſt; as a man that hath one leg ſhorter than the other, he cannot walk evenly, but he haults as he goes; ſo when our affections are up and down, ſometimes they are ſtir'd up to Heaven, and ſometimes down to the world again, yea, perhaps at the ſame time when we have ſome truths heave us upward, and yet a droſſie ſpirit to ſink us downward, this will be but haulting, our affections muſt go even, muſt not be for Heaven and Earth together, except it be in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination one to the other, and ſo while we are on the earth we are in Heaven if we keep our hearts in a ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to ſpiritual things when we are buſied about earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; Then is a mans heart ſpiritual, and ſeparated from the
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:30201:127"/>
earth when he knows how to have comfort in God alone, when he knows how to make up the want of all creature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforts in God himſelf, that's a ſpiritual heart. Now you will ſay, we muſt not be inſnar'd in the things of the earth: when is a mans heart ſpiritual? It's then Spiritual when it knows how to ſatisfie its ſelf in God alone, and to make up the want in all creature comforts in God himſelf, and no Chriſtian can walk with God except he attains to that pitch, to know how to make up all in God, and uſe all in order unto God.</p>

                  <head>The third Rule, or Direction.</head>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>If thou wouldſt walk with God, evermore take Chriſt with thee</hi> God and the Soul cannot walk together but with Chriſt; Chriſt, God and Man, that Mediator, by that I mean this, in all thy converſe with God have an eye to Chriſt, look unto God the infinite glorious Firſt. Being of all things, but through Chriſt the Mediator, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe God will not be rendered amiable, and ſweet, and lovely to thee, then is God rendered ſweet and amiable, and lovely to the ſoul, even as a friend that the ſoul can have familiarity withal when as he is look't upon through Jeſus Chriſt: do thou act all by Chriſt by the ſtrength of Chriſt, and tender up all thy ſervices to God through Chriſt, thoſe that are not acquainted with the myſtery of the Goſpel in Chriſt, ſurely they know but little of this walk with God.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Oh yes! Certainly, though it was ſo long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt came, yet his eye was upon Chriſt: for in the 11. of the <hi>Heb</hi> 5. verſe, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That it was by faith that he walked with him;</hi> it was all by faith. Now Chriſt is the object of faith, and ſo his eye certainly was upon Chriſt: It was through faith, and I will give you one Scripture that will ſhew the uſe of eying of Chriſt in
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:30201:127"/>
walking with God, in the 25. of <hi>Exod,</hi> 21. verſe, <hi>Thou ſhalt put the Meroy-Seat above upon the Arke, and in the Ark thou ſhalt put the Teſtimony that I ſhall give thee, and there will I meet with thee, and I will commune with thee.</hi> That is, There at the Mercy-Seat. They were come to the Ark to look up to the Mercy-Seat, and there ſaith God, wil I meet with thee, and there will I commune with thee. Now what's the Mercy-Seat but Jeſus Chaiſt? we muſt look upon God in Chriſt, and ſo God is rendered amiable, ſweet, glorious, and lovely unto us in his Son, there doth God meet with his Saints, and there he communes with them; Indeed while we look upon God as he is in himſelf he is a conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fire, and we cannot epxect to commune with God there, and therefore thoſe that look upon God meerly in a legal way, look upon him as one that doth exact and require ſuch and ſuch ſervices and duties of them, and meerly conſidering God as a Judge; if they perform not ſuch and ſuch duties they do not meet and commune with God; But ſuch as look up to the Mercy-Seat, look up to Chriſt by faith, when they have to deal with God in Chriſt, Oh theſe meet with God, theſe commune with God, Oh there's much ſweet communion between God and their ſouls, they walk with God, becauſe God through Chriſt comes to be rendered gracious, lovely, ſweet, amiable, and familier to them.</p>

                  <head>The fourth Rule, or Direction.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Be careful to beautifie thy ſoul;</hi> or more generally thus, (Firſt:) <hi>Have a great care of thy ſpirit,</hi> look to thy ſpirit rather than to thy outward actions in thy walking with God; God is a Spirit, and will be worſhiped in ſpirit and truth. One that would walk with God had need be very careful of his ſpirit, keep thy heart with all diligence, for it is with thy ſoul that God converſes: Indeed 'tis the proper ſpheer of a Chriſtian to be buſie about his heart, to be buſie in the inward man, there's the ſpheer of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an:
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:30201:128"/>
It's not ſo much about the outward man, if the hear be kept in a right frame, the outward man will be brought over of its own accord; But be careful of thy ſpirit, (that is) of the thoughts of thy mind; Take heed of admitting of any uncleanneſſe in thy very thoughts, for the ſoul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes with God in thoughts as well as we converſe with men in words; how do you commune and converſe with men but by ſpeech? therefore doth God give ſpeech to men that they may converſe one with another, what ſpeech is unto men, that the thoughts are unto God; we converſe much with God by our thoughts, make conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of thoughts, labor to cleanſe thy thoughts, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the affections of thy heart, and the ſtirrings of thy heart, for God and thy ſoul doth converſe together, in the workings and ſtirrings of thy heart look to thy ſpirit; and labor to beautifie thy ſoul with that that may make thee aimable and lovely in the eyes of God, and then the Lord will delight to converſe with thee, and walk with thee. If you were call'd out to walk with a man that were your ſuperior, with ſome Chief in your pariſh, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, or Knight, or Noble man, If ſuch a one ſhould call you to walk with him, you would labour then ſo far as you were able to adorne your ſelves with ſuch cloaths as were ſutable unto the company of ſuch a one: you that profeſſe your ſelves Chriſtians, God doth call you every day to walk with him, and if you would expect to have communion with God, and that God ſhould take delight in you, you muſt labor to beautifie your ſouls, to dreſſe you with thoſe things that may make you aimable in the eyes of God, and not to come dirtily and filthy into the preſence of God. Now that that makes the ſoul aimable in the eyes of God it is, Holineſſe, for that's the very Image of God, and God delights to walk with one where he can ſee his own Image, the more reſplendent the Image of God is in the ſoul the more doth the Lord delight to walk with ſuch a ſoul; labour for the behavior of thy ſoul to be ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto God; When I walk with one that is my ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:30201:128"/>
I muſt have ſuch a demenour as is ſutable to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and as it was ſaid before, To walk with God was to walk in the fear of God. And that's the fourth thing, Take heed to thy ſpirit, beautifie thy ſoul in that that may make thee aimable and lovely in Gods eyes, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thy ſelf ſo as is ſutable to the preſence of God; I ſhall only give you one Scripture about the beautifying of the ſoul, in the 45. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> where it's ſpoken of the Church and of the Saints being brought into the preſence of God, in the 13. verſe, <hi>The Kings daughter,</hi> (that is, the Church) <hi>is all glorious within.</hi> (Many make great ſhews of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>without,</hi> but the Kings daughter is all glorious within,) <hi>her cloathing is of wrought gold:</hi> there's her ornaments: mark what follows in the 14. verſe, <hi>She ſhall be brought unto the King in raiment of needle-work:</hi> (She ſhall be brought to the King, to Jeſus Chriſt, with garments of needle-work) by that is meant, the ſeveral graces of the Spirit of God that puts a beauty upon the ſoul: as there is a variety in needle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work that cauſes a beauty upon the work, and ſo ſhe ſhall be brought to the King. So you muſt have that that may make you aimable and lovely in the eyes of the King.</p>

                  <head>The Fifth Rule, or Direction.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take heed of halting.</hi> When you walk with him you muſt not halt between two but give up your ſelf fully to God, you muſt give up your ſelves wholly to him in walking with him; not to have a diſtracted heart, or a divied heart between two: <hi>Why halt ye between two opinions</hi> (ſaith the Prophet?) <hi>If God be God, worſhip him; if Baal, worſhip him.</hi> So, when the heart is not divided up and down, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in the way of God, that's the thing that I mean here; that is, If I cannot be happy here, I am content to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable here; when the ſoul is ſo reſolved and doth not halt in Gods way, when the ſoul knows that here is the way that there is happineſs to be had in, and whatſoever ſeems to the contrary to fleſh and blood, yet I know that
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:30201:129"/>
in theſe waies there's happineſs to be had, there's enough to bleſſe my ſoul for ever, and therefore whatſoever becoms of me, I am reſolved upon theſe waies; this is one that is fit to walk with God, he will not halt, but will treat ſtrait ſteps in the waies of God: and that the Apoſtle requires of us in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 13. <hi>Make ſtreight paths for your feet, leſt that which is lame be turned out of the way.</hi> Make ſtreight paths, go on in a ſtreight way, not having the heart longing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſomething elſe: There are ſome that have ſome convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of conſcience, that have their hearts inclinable to the waies of God, and are going on in ſome of the waies of God, yet they have longings of ſpirit after ſomething elſe: but when the heart indeed walks with God, it gives up its ſelf wholly to him, and is reſolv'd in theſe waies: you have had ſome good thoughts; but if your hearts be divided between God and the world, you will turn to be Apoſtats in time, that which is lame <hi>will</hi> be turn'd out of the way, the waies of God will be tedious to you when you do not give up your ſelves wholly to them; and this is the reaſon of the Apoſtafie that there is in the world, they ſeem to go on in Gods waies, but they go on but lamely becauſe they do not give up themſelves wholly to the waies of God.</p>

                  <p>If you would walk with God, <hi>Take heed of formality in all holy duties;</hi> be laborious in holy duties, take pains with your hearts in them, labor for the power of godlineſs in holy duties, you muſt ſtrive to get up to God in them: It were well if when we perform holie duties we did but keep cloſe to the Duty its ſelf, few go ſo far: But it's one thing to keep cloſe to the Duty, and another thing to keep cloſe to God in the Duty; we muſt labor not only to mind what we are about, but to keep cloſe to God in the Duty, to find God in all duties that we perform, and in the uſe of all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances to take pains to find God there, and not to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie &amp; quiet our hearts except we find God in the duties that we do perform; we have a notable Scripture for this, in
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:30201:129"/>
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 24. <hi>In all places where I record my Name, I will come unto thee, and I will bleſs thee.</hi> That is, where ever there is any Ordinance, or any holy Duty to be perform'd, there's a recording of Gods Name. And ſaith he, I will come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, and there I wil bleſs thee. If you would walk with God, you muſt go where God is, and be in thoſe places where God uſes to come: now the walk where God uſes to walk it is, in his Ordinances, in his Worſhip, therefore you muſt be very ſpiritual in worſhip, and ſanctifie the Name of God there; (according to that that we have trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon at large) you muſt take pains there, ſtir up your <note place="margin">Goſpel worſhip</note> hearts and all that is within you to walk with God there, and not be ſatisfied except you have ſomething of God there. It's a notable ſpeech of <hi>Bernard, I never go from thee without thee:</hi> when ever I come to any holy duty and leave it, I never leave it but I have thee with it: we muſt not be ſatisfied except we meet with God in holy duties.</p>

I beſeech you obſerve it, ſome that have been walking with God and then met with theſe that come with fair ſhews with that which is falſe, (and you may know it in this that it gives liberty to the fleſh) they think here's a fine, even, and ſmooth way that I may have content to the fleſh in; obſerve it, there's no ſuch way to allure ſuch as have by the power of the Word eſcaped from the waies of ſin in a great meaſure, no ſuch way (I ſay) to allure them as to come and ſhew them how they may make a profeſſion of godlineſs and yet have liberty to the fleſh too: Oh the Lord deliver yong beginners from the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons of our age! the wantons that are in our generation that do allure them through the luſts of the fleſh, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe liberty to them, for ſo the text ſaith, <hi>While they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe them liberty they themſelves are the ſervants of corruption: THEMSELVES:</hi> Mark, thoſe that promiſe them liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and bring ſuch Doctrine of liberty to you, they <hi>Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi> are in the mean time the ſervants of corruption: Oh take heed of declining to the waies of the fleſh after thou haſt ſeem'd to begin in the ſpirit; what haſt thou to do in the way of Aſher and in the waies of Egypt? Oh thou that heretofore didſt ſeem to converſe with God, and to walk with him, what iniquity haſt thou found with me ſaith God? So what evil haſt thou found in the waies of God?

that the Lord would be pleaſed to cauſe his Angel to meet with ſome that are declining from his good and bleſſed waies! as we read in the book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> That the Angel met <hi>Hager</hi> when ſhe was flying from <hi>Abrahams</hi> family, from the Church of God, and ſaith he, Hager Sarah's <hi>Maid, from whence cameſt thou?</hi> doeſt thou come from <hi>Abraham's</hi> family? art thou going from thence? and where doſt thou think to find ſo much good as in <hi>Abraham's</hi> family, where the preſence of God is?

God: That ſo ſoon as we are got but one ſtep from God, if we did but begin to bethink our ſelves; where are we? what are we doing? Oh this would cauſe us to return, and not to go ſo far off from God.

                     <hi>Make good interpretations of all Gods waies and dealings with thee.</hi> This is a mighty help to us to keep on in the way of God, and to walk with him. If God comes in a way of affliction, make good interpretation of the affliction, do not preſently conclude, that God appears like an enemy to thee, that will diſcourage thee in the waies of God; but look upon God as intending good unto thee in every thing; and that will help thee to keep cloſe to him, and to walk cloſe with him in every condition: If God ſeems to go out of the way of proſperity, and to come in the way of affliction, make good interpretations of it: do not therefore think that God is therefore leaving of thee and forſaking thee, but exerciſe faith in this, and beleeve that God may intend as much good to thee in that way as in any way whatſoever, and I ground this rule upon that text in the 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> In the former part of the chapter the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks of Gods chaſtening of his people, <hi>My Son deſpiſe not thou the chaſtening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked of him; for whom the Lord loveth he chaſteneth, and ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth every ſon whom he receiveth:</hi> and in the 7. verſe, <hi>If ye en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure chaſtening then God dealeth with you as with ſons: for what ſon is he whom the father chaſieneth not? but if ye be without chaſtiſements whereof all are partakers, then are ye baſtards and not ſons.</hi> So ſtill he goes on in the point of chaſtiſement, in the 9, 10, 11. verſes he ſpeaks of nothing but of chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, now then in the 12. verſe he draws a concluſion from thence, having laid this as a ground, that we are to look upon God as a father in his chaſtiſements, <hi>Wherefore</hi>
                     <pb n="333" facs="tcp:30201:132"/>
                     <hi>then lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees, and make ſtraight paths for your feet, leſt that which is lame be turned out of the way.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, when as you appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend God in a way of wrath againſt you, and not in a way of love, your knees will be feeble and you will not be able to go on with that cheerfulneſs, and to walk with God in that hard way that he ſeems to call you too: But looking upon your ſelves as ſons, and God intending good unto you, that by chaſtiſements you may be made partakers of his holineſs; now ſaith he, lift up your hands that hang down, and thoſe feeble knees, thoſe feeble knees that were ſo weak whereby you were difinabled to walk with God: Thoſe feeble knees will be ſtrengthened if you make good interpretation of the waies of God, and beleeve that the Lord intends good unto you. And as in other chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſo among the reſt the chaſtiſements of ſpiritual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certions; when God not only comes with outward afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon you, but when the Lord ſhall come againſt you, even himſelf with ſpiritual diſcertions, and afflictions, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven afflicting your ſouls you muſt make good interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of them.</p>
                  <p>You will ſay, That's hardeſt to walk with God; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we may walk with God, and keep on in communion with him notwithſtanding outward afflictions, but when the Lord ſeems to withdraw himſelf, and when there is both outward and inward too, that's hard: For outward afflictions, I will give you one notable Scripture for a child of God, following hard after God though God ſeeme to withdraw himſelf from the ſoul, in the 63. <hi>Pſal.</hi> where by the title of the Pſalm you ſhall find that <hi>David</hi> was in the wilderneſs of Judah, and that was when <hi>Saul</hi> did perſecute him for his life: <hi>Saul</hi> perſecuted <hi>David</hi> and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, and <hi>David</hi> was fain to ſculk up and down in the wilderneſs of Judah from place to place, and yet mark, <hi>O God, thou art my God,</hi> (for all that) <hi>early will I ſeek thee, my ſoul thirſteth for thee, my fleſh longeth for thee in a dry and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty land, where no water is:</hi> And then in the 8. verſe, <hi>My</hi>

If times of affliction, when God ſeems to withdraw himſelf by his afflictions, yet our ſouls ſhould follow hard after God: Doth God ſeem to go from us as if he would not walk with us? Oh run after him: As a poor child if the mother ſeems to go away from it, and gets over a ſtile before it, the child cries and runs after: So it was with <hi>David,</hi> when the Lord did ſeem by thoſe adminiſtrations of his to be going away from him, ſaith he, My ſoul follows hard after him. And this is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent frame of ſpirit, that the more the Lord ſeems to be gone from a Chriſtian, the more hard doth the ſoul follow after God, nothing can ſatisfie ſuch a one but God himſelf; and therefore he ſaith, Lord, my ſoul thirſteth after <hi>Thee</hi> in a dry land, he doth not ſay after <hi>water,</hi> but after <hi>Thee.</hi> So in any affliction, if thou canſt ſay this, Lord, it is not ſo much the deliverance from an affliction that my ſoul thirſteth after, but Oh Lord! thou knoweſt my ſoul thirſts after thee, and may the affliction be but made up in thy ſelf it is ſufficient, I never find my ſoul following more earneſtly after thee than now in the time of my affliction.</p>

               <p>I have divers things to ſpeak to thoſe that God hath ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to withdraw himſelf from.</p>
               <pb n="335" facs="tcp:30201:133"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> You will ſay, You have told us of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of walking with God, and we account it the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our lives to walk with him; <hi>Oh but God will not walk with me, but withdraws himſelf from my ſoul ſo that I cannot ſee him, and hides himſelf from me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I have divers things to ſay to thee:</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, Be of good comfort; It's a good ſign, that God hath made thee know what it is to walk with him, that canſt be ſenſible of his withdrawings; there is a generation of people in the world that go on in a ſlight kind of way in the profeſſion of Religion, and they know not what it is to be ſenſible of any of Gods withdrawings from them, you never hear them complain of any ſuch thing, they know not what it means; therefore (I ſay) it's a good ſign that thou knoweſt what it is to walk with God becauſe thou art ſenſible of any of Gods withdrawings from thee.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Examine whether thou haſt not ſometimes ſhut out God from thee, when God hath offered himſelf to walk with thee.</hi> Hath not God ſometimes tendred himſelf, and even taken thee by the hand to walk with thee, and thou haſt not bin at leaſure then, thy mind hath been about ſomewhat elſe? Oh! therefore be humbled before him for all thy unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy dealings with him, and for all thy declynings from him; Know, God calls thee to this, There hath been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wandrings of thy ſpirit from God, Oh that thou couldſt but ſay in reſpect of thy ſpiritual wandrings, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>David</hi> ſaith in reſpect of his wandrings, in <hi>Pſal</hi> 56. 8. <hi>Thou telleſt my wandrings, put thou my tears into thy bottle, are they not in thy book?</hi> Oh that thou couldſt but ſay ſo! Lord, there hath been many wandrings of my ſpirit, but Lord, put my tears into thy bottle; ſutable to my wandrings ſo are my tears, Oh! it grieves me to the ſoul that ever I have grieved thy Spirit; when thy ſpirit hath even taken me by the hand to walk with thee I have withdrawn my ſelf, and upon that thy Spirit hath been grieved; Oh it grieves my ſoul! Oh Lord, thou haſt taken notice of my wandrings, take notice of my tears that are ſutable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="336" facs="tcp:30201:134"/>
Thirdly, <hi>It is better that God withdraw, than that we with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw.</hi> I beſeech you obſerve it: If God withdraws from you it is your affliction: but if you withdraw from God, it is your ſin; and ſin is worſe than affliction, better bear any affliction, yea ſpiritual afflictions than commit ſin; and that you ſhould labor to be ſenſible of: you that complain of God's withdrawing from you, and that God will not walk with you; Be you more ſenſible of your own with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawings as a greater evil to you than Gods? It's true, Gods withdrawing from me it is a ſore affliction above all that ever befell me in this world; but my withdrawing from him it is a greater burden to me. And it may be if God did not withdraw from thee, thou wouldſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from him: And many times God doth withdraw from his people to prevent his peoples withdrawing from him. As many times the mother will withdraw her ſelfe from the child that the child may not be wandring from her. And this may be the very end why God withdraws, he ſees thy heart begins to be looſe, wanton, ſlight, and vain, and therefore it is that he hides himſelf, that thou maieſt be awakened and ſenſible of the danger that thou art in by withdrawing thy ſelf from God; that ſo thou maieſt cleave to him the more fully, and that thy ſoul may follow more after him, that thou maieſt lift up thy heart and cry more earneſtly after God. But now, if God be withdrawn, &amp; the ſoul be not ſo ſenſible as to cry after him, or if it ſhould leave off crying; then ſuch a one is in a dangerous condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on indeed. As if a poor child had loſt the father or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and were crying after them; at length comes ſome begger with an apple or plumb and ſteals away the child, and then the child is quiet for the preſent; Oh take heed of that, depart not from the Lord, keep crying after him in all his withdrawings.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Gods withdrawing of comfort is not alwaies the withdrawing of his preſence:</hi> Thou maieſt miſtake, thou thinkeſt that God is withdrawn, why? becauſe he hath withdarwn comfort; there may be a great miſtake in this:
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:30201:134"/>
God (I ſay) may withdraw comfort, and not withdraw his preſence, take this for a certain rule and make much uſe of it, when comforts are gone: Do not ſay when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts are gone, therefore the preſence of God is gone, there may be as ful and as gracious a preſence of God when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts are gone as ever there was: he may be preſent with his graces and ſupport; as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. 8. <hi>My ſoul followeth hard after thee, thy right hand upholdeth me;</hi> though thou ſeemeſt to be gone. So, God may be preſent to uphold thee, and to ſtrengthen thee, and to exerciſe thy faith in him, and that may be as acceptable to God: The exerciſe of faith in the want of comfort may have as much of God in it as all the comfort that ever thou hadſt in all thy life; and therefore do not ſay, that Gods preſence is gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe comforts are gone: The beams of the Sun in the winter time is not ſo effectual as the influence of the Sun when it is in a cloud in the ſummer time: Is the preſence of the Sun gone in the ſummer becauſe there's a cloud between the ſun and you? It may be a child will think, Oh the Sun is gone out of the firmament becauſe there's a cloud: I but I know there's the Sun ſtill, for there's the influence of the Sun, there's ſome heat in the day, and there's ſome light wherby I may ſee to do my work, though I have not that luſtre as before; Now when the Sun ſhines in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it ſhines bright but there's not that influence of the ſun upon the earth as makes the plants grow: So, ſometimes the beams of Gods preſence may be clouded to a Chriſtian by reaſon of outward afflictions, and yet there may be more of Gods preſence than at another time, when it ſhall ſhine in the beauty of it in the comfotrs of a Chriſtian for ſo I compare the ſhining of the Comforts of a Chriſtian to the ſhining of the Sun in the winter, that ſometimes have no influence to ſanctifie the heart, As in winter times the Sun hath not that influence to fructifie the ground, but at other times though the Sun be clouded yet it hath influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to make the ground fruitful; ſo though God may not ſhine upon thee in regard of outward comforts, yet he
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:30201:135"/>
may ſhine in upon thy ſoul and make thee to increaſe and grow in goodneſs more than ever before.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>If thou canſt not ſee Gods face, yet hearken and ſee if thou canſt not hear his voice, and follow that.</hi> Doeſt thou come to the Word and there hear his voice? Is not God pleaſed to ſpeak to thy ſoul out of his Word? Thou goeſt perhaps into thy cloſet and canſt not ſee his face there as thou wert wont to do, yet bleſſe him that thou canſt hear his voice, and follow his voice though it be in the dark. As now, if a child be going with the father and it be loſt, yet if the child cries, and the father or mother ſpeaks, that quiets the child very much; ſo it is with the children of God, when they cannot ſee Gods face, yet they may hear Gods voice: They cannot have thoſe comforts from God as ſometimes they have had; thoſe ſweet manifeſtations of the love of God ſhed abroad into their hearts; but when they come to the Word, they cannot but ſay that they hear their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers voice; Perhaps the word is not a comforting word to thee as hereto fore, I but is it not a directing word, an inſtructing word, an inlightening word? Oh this now ſhould ſupport thee for the preſent.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, All that I will ſay further is this, <hi>Keep thy ſelf in a waiting frame for God:</hi> Do not determine that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord is gone he will ever be gone; Oh no, but keep ſtill in the waies of God waiting for him, reſolve, that though God leaves thee, yet thou wilt not leave the path in which God was heretofore: I am ſure that God was once here, Oh then keep the path wherein thou wert wont to meet with God, for thou ſhalt meet with him again: It's better to keep the path, the ordinary high-way of God, for you are more like to meet with God there than if you ſhould go out of the way: I'le give you a Scripture or two for that and ſo conclude. The firſt is in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101. 2. I <hi>will behave my ſelf wiſely in a perfect way, Oh when, wilt thou come unto me!</hi> That which I quote this for is this, the reſolution of <hi>David</hi> to behave himſelf wiſely in a perfect way, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his panting after the preſence of God, Oh when
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:30201:135"/>
wilt thou come unto me! as if he ſhould ſay, Lord, Thou art abſent from me now, but Lord, I will not go out of the way wherein I was wont to find thee, Oh when wilt thou come! I will not determine that I ſhall never ſee thee in this way as heretofore I have done, no, but I hope I ſhal afterwards meet thee. And ſo in the 119. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> 8. verſe, <hi>I will keep thy Statutes;</hi> what then? <hi>Oh forſake me not utterly.</hi> It ſeems that the Lord for the preſent to <hi>Davids</hi> apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion had forſaken him: but what was <hi>Davids</hi> reſolution? God hath forſaken me and I'le forſake him? Oh no, But I'le keep thy Statutes, and Oh! leave me not utterly. So keep on in the waies of God ſtill, go on in his way and wait for the preſence of God until he come; and conclude this, <hi>Surely, he will come.</hi> Be not like to children, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſee the Sun going down, therefore they conclude that the Sun is gone, and will never come again. Though God ſeems to withdraw the light of his face from thee, do not conclude and determine, well, I ſhall never have thoſe comforts from God, in communion with God, in walking with God, as once I was wont to have; do not ſay ſo, but go on, and keep in the waies of God, wait upon him and look up towards him, and ſo thou maieſt come to have as much Communion, Sweetneſs, and Joy in God as ever thou hadſt in all thy life. And now know, that God cals for the work of faith in ſuch times as theſe are, now God calls thee to walk by faith and not by ſence.</p>
