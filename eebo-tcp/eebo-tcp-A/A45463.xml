            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>However, if thou wilt improve this in the mean time, thou wilt find it more Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial than the Transitory Injoyments of this Life, which Fade before we can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive 'em to Flourish: But Virtue well Rooted in the Soul is like a Rock in the Sea, all the Affections being guided there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, to the Crowning their End with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Glory: Which that thou may'st attain to, is the Desire of thine,</p>

            <head>Young <hi>AeSOP's</hi> Life.</head>
            <p>IN one of the farthest Parts of Germany, there Liv'd once a worthy and sober Dr. of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, by Name John Lozmani, of an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and Honourable Family: He was a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman no less to be Admir'd for his Exquisite Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, than Belov'd for the internal Endowments of a Vertuous and Generous Soul; and One, whose As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect might Excite the Affections of a Chaste Princess, as well as Check the wanton Glances of the most Lascivious Lover. To all which, (besides the great Observance, and profound Respect the People paid him) were added, a copious Estate, and plentiful Revenues. He had not arriv'd to above the Age of Twenty, before Heaven Crown'd his Sun-shine Years with the chaste Enjoyments of a Marriage Bed, and made him the Husband of a Young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, in whom Love and Beauty, as well as Vertue and Chastity, were eminently Predominant. But, tho' Heaven had showr'd its Blessings down in so singular manner upon their Heads, yet it seem'd to deny 'em a long time, That which is the End and Design of Wedlock; the Thoughts of which, with the Apprehension of not leaving Issue behind, to keep up the Name and Honour of a Family, depress'd Lozmani's Spirits, and forc'd him to Affect a solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and retired Life: But all this, by his Lady's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing happily Deliver'd of a Son, quickly Vanish'd, and the Clouds of Melancholly Dispers'd; his Spirits became more Strong and Lively, and his Joy rais'd to a higher Pitch than before. Glad was he to see Heaven bless him with a Son so Fair, so Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, and so well Proportion'd, in whom the very Heart and Soul of its Parents were bound up. But, alas! when we go about to Assure ourselves of a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:107584:6"/>
Constant Flux of Felicity, and Promise Happiness with its Duration, then are we not only the most Deceiv'd, but render'd, by Fortune's inconstant Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, (as to this World) the most Miserable, and the most Unhappy: For,</p>
            <lg>
               <l>As in all things, so in poor Mortal's Heart,</l>
               <l>Sorrow and Joy, by Course, do Act their part:</l>
               <l>For, Fortune's Course, b'ing Fickle as the Wind,</l>
               <l>How then can That be Constant, when she's Blind?</l>
               <l>Nor is she ever Worship'd by the Wise,</l>
               <l>But only Fools, who make her Throne the Skies.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Thus we see the Mutability of all things: For, this Son, whom they Named Christianus, growing into Years, and proving the exact Picture of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he was Educated and Instructed by him, in the ways of Virtue; and had already Learn'd Manners enough to prove himself an Ornament to his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, when (about the Ninth Year of his Age) he Unfortunately fell from the Turret of his Father's House into a Garden adjoyning, whereby he was not only taken up for Dead, but had his Back broke, his Joints dislocated, and his whole Body bruised in a Deplorable manner.</p>
            <p>Imagine now what Scenes of Sorrow attended it: And Guess how great an Impression it made upon the Hearts of Two loving and indulgent Parents, who would have parted with all their Wealth to have prevented It, if possible! But, such is the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revocable Decree of Heaven, that an Alexander, whose Arms Punish'd all the known World, till it Confess'd him Conquerour, can no more Evade the Poyson of his Cup-bearer, Antipater's Son, than a Croesus, with all his Wealth, pretend to Bribe a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity! If we expect to Enjoy an immortal Gift, we must not allow ourselves in the excessive Transports of the Passions of the Mind: A Mediocrity in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, will Fortify us against all the Disappointments in Nature; and preserve to us, at least, the Idea and Remembrance of what our Senses once Delighted in, when Passion robs us of this, and our Reason too.</p>
            <lg>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:107584:6"/>
               <l>Passion, ah Passion, spoils the Nobler Parts,</l>
               <l>And makes fond Mortals Deify their Hearts;</l>
               <l>Vexing the Spirits with Impure Dissentions,</l>
               <l>Pushing us on, t'Adore our own Inventions.</l>
               <l>''And very few are free from this Infection,</l>
               <l>''For every one's a Slave to some Affection.</l>
               <l>But, ah! Ten Thousand times more Happy's he,</l>
               <l>Who Subdues Passion, and sets Reason free;</l>
               <l>That his weak Opticks may more clearly 'spye</l>
               <l>The Imperfections that proceed thereby.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>But, to return, As Christianus was so Unfortunate in the Juvenal of his Years, to be made a Cripple; so he became the more Helpless, and outwardly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable: For his Deformity so Discompos'd his Mother, that soon after she made a Chamber her Consinement, and in a little time her Aspect became Pale and Wan; the Vermilion of her Cheeks were wash'd off with Pearly Tears; and her Eyes affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing more than the ghastly Ideas of the King of Terrours, and his silent Urn; her Brows were Depress'd with Clouds of Melancholly; and all her Actions, Discourse and Conversation, spoke nothing but deep Resentments of a troubled and discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mind: The Excess of which Passion hurry'd her into a Hectick Fever, of which, (maugre all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearments of a tender and loving Husband) she in a most Sorrowful and Tragical manner, gave up the Ghost.</p>
            <p>Never was a Gentleman more Disconsolate than <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ozmani: Grief over-whelm'd his Heart; and his Soul continually disburthen'd it self, by breathing out passionate Complaints, and dolourous Sighs: And, what with the Death of his Lady, and the Deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of his Son, he was reduc'd to a low and weak Condition. His Friends being Concerned to see him so, and perceiving him in a deep Consumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they, with all the tender Expressions of Love and Affection, indeavour'd to expel the Grief which had Seiz'd his Mind; but all in Vain, for he rejected their Visits, refus'd their Counsels, despis'd their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107584:7"/>
Comforts, and wholly deny'd himself the Society of his own Family. Thus he Linger'd out a Month or Two, till he found his Vitals ready to take Flight, when he sent for his Brother in Law; to whom he Communicated his Grief in the following Manner.</p>
            <p>Brother! Mortals may imagine, that by their Wealth they are secur'd from Vicissitude and its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences; and that Fortune hath lost her Power, and is Subject to the Controuls of a Guilded Purse, or the Amorous Looks of a Fair Beauty: But, alas, so long as we are Born with Affection, and suffer it to Reign Arbitrary over our other Powers, we are not Sensible that she is Hood-winck'd both to Wealth and Grandeur, as well as Poverty and Want: Nor will we Believe, that what Favours she heaps upon us at One time, she may Sweep away at another. Who would have Thought, a Person so Rich and Wealthy; so Well-belov'd, and Esteem'd; so much Refpected, and Admir'd; so Bless'd in the soft Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of a vertuous and loving Wife; and, in fine, once so Happy in the Enjoyment of a Son, who<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e Beauty seem'd to be the Master-piece of Nature—<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>I say, Who would have imagin'd a Person once so Fortunate, should have Liv'd to see so dire a Catastrophe befall him? Ah, have I Liv'd to see the Lady of my Affections, my Bosome-Friend, and the Soul of my Love, surrender up all the Efforts of Nature, all the Ravishing Endearments of Love and Beauty, and all the Conjugal Affections of a Wife to her Husband, into the Hands of that grim Tyrant Death! And, shall this Memory of mine forget her, and Live, with nothing to feast my Opticks on, but the Deformity of a Son? No, no; Maugre all the Delusive Advice, to stay and linger out my Days here, I'll force my Fate, and compel Atropos to Cut this Thred of Life—</p>
            <p>And here Lozmani Swooning, he seem'd as if he had already taken Possession of another World, till his Senses were retriev'd, when opening his Eyes, he thus went on:—I am glad my Dissolution arriv'd
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107584:7"/>

Consider, Brotherly Love is as Chains of Gold about the Neck; and without it we are worse than Savage Beasts: Love Sweetens our Dispositions, and flings away all Acts of Hostility, constraining us to turn and Kiss one another in the Heat of Broils and Animosities: But where is this to be sought for? In Relations there's very little Sympathy to be found; every one's Heart is case hardened to the Afflictions of his Friend; and to say, in Extremity, I am thy Brother, or Kinsman by Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is like Whistling to the Wind, or rowling Stones up-hill.</p>

The Effect of this Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise will be this: You shall send your Son out, and he will return with an Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Talent; he will say, Father, I heard a Boy contemn God, by telling a Lye, which made my Heart Ach till I had Reprov'd him: Mother, I saw a Rarity, a rich good Man take his Coat off, and Cloath a poor Miserable Wretch there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; Would to God I were firmly Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

That thou art alone, thô thou hast Three Parts of the World to bear thee Company: For, where are thy Companions, when thy Reason is fled. You and they are all like Sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Posts jostling one another into the Fire. Well then, if thou lovest Wisdom, thou wilt not come within the Decoys of this World, where Sins are by-paths to lead us till the Devil finds us: Neither ask thy Neighbour, which way thou must go; for, who knows but he hath world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Business near the Lyon's Den, and may desire thy Company: But pull thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science by the Sleeve, Consult That, and thou shalt escape the Snares of Satan.</p>

                  <hi>LIke begets Like:</hi> It's true, it does so in the Course of Nature: But, the Child may lose great part of it's Origine Nature, by the Reception of unnatural Nutriment. This may be done thus. Let an Infant suck a Moross, Surly, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and it will receive not only Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment, but the ill Qualities of the Nurse. No wonder then, the Child de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generates from its Parents, when it par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipates of another's Nature! There can be no true Affection between the Mother and such a Child: For what difference will there be between the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate and a Bastard, when thou shalt take them both Young, and bring them up, saying, <hi>I am thy Mother,</hi> and the like? In fine, every Mother ought to Suckle her own Child, when she is not infirm. Besides, Dost thou think the Brests were made for no other Use than to excite Lust? Consider, All Objects ought to be hid, which have force enough in themselves to attract Vice. Let this suffice: If thou woud'st preserve tender Flowers till they are <hi>Ripe,</hi> they must not be expos'd to every unwholsome Blast.</p>

               <p>I Cannot but observe from this, the truly Honest and Generous Spirit of an <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>patient</hi> Man: How he will pursue the <hi>internal</hi> Peace of his Soul, before the <hi>external</hi> Injoyments of his Body; and Value a composed <hi>Solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> Life, before the common <hi>Luxurious</hi> Delicacies of an infatuated Republick. Whilst the Discontented run too and frô amidst the Venomous Streams of Infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and suffer themselves to be <hi>blown</hi> up like Bubbles, in the Air, to Dance a little, and Vanish. The Distressed <hi>Coney</hi> would have stay'd in her <hi>Borough</hi> had she not been pursu'd by the Hunters; so, O Man! if thou art Persecuted ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Body, or Estate, and canst not stay Secure in thy Habitation, for fear of Enemies, then hast thou a lawful Call to Evade 'em by flying from one place to another, till at last they drive thee to the Rock where thou vvilt be secur'd to all Eternity. Whilst Vagabonds like the Spider are svvept avvay by the Wrath of common Justice.</p>

            <head>A Miscellany of Divine Maxims.</head>
            <p>WOuldst thou be truly perfect? love God with all thy Heart, and thy Neighbour as thy self.</p>
            <p>Let thy eye be always upon God and thy self, and thou shalt never see him without Goodness, nor thy self without Misery.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:107584:50"/>
Let us be what God will, so we be but his; and let us not be what we will our selves, against the Will of God.</p>
            <p>He that neglects his own Will, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies best with God's.</p>
            <p>So love thy Neighbour upon Earth, as that thou mayst enjoy his love in Heaven.</p>
            <p>Thou canst not love thy Neighbour too much, but thou mayst too much shew thy love.</p>
            <p>One great Argument of our love to our Neighbour, is to bear with his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections.</p>
            <p>We should never endure to hear evil spoken of any but our selves.</p>
            <p>We should never undervalue any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: The Workman loves not that his work should be despised in his presence. Wherefore beware, for God is present e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where, and every person is his work.</p>
            <p>We ought not to love our Neighbour only because he is good, or because we hope he will be so, but because God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us so to do.</p>
            <p>In holy duties we should speak little, think much, but do more.</p>
            <p>It is a great evil not to do good.</p>
            <p>Confidence in an unfaithful Man in
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:107584:50"/>
time of Trouble, is like a broken Tooth, and a Foot out of Joynt. Charity makes God our debtor; for the Poor are his receivers.</p>
            <p>Hast thou an Estate, and wouldest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease it? Divide thy riches to the Poor; those Seeds that are scattered do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, but hoarded up they die.</p>
            <p>Arm thy self against a profest enemy; but he that dissembleth friendship strikes beyond a caution, and wounds above a cure: from the one thou mayst deliver thy self, but from the other, good Lord deliver thee.</p>
            <p>The Touch-stone trieth Gold, and Gold trieth Men.</p>
            <p>As the Servants of God are known by their own Vertues, Humility and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, so the Servants of the Devil are known by their opposite Vices, Pride and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</p>
            <p>To boast is to be vain, since the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Conquerour; if he measure his own Shadow, shall find it no longer than it was before his Victory.</p>
            <p>The World is a wide Prison, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Day an Execution-day.</p>
            <p>Our Stomachs are common Sepulchres
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:107584:51"/>
for Birds, Beasts, and Fish; they all die to feed us: Lord, with how many deaths are our poor lives patched up! How full of Death is the Life of Man!</p>
            <p>Beware of Drink: where Drunkenness Reigns, Reason is an Exile, Vertue a Stranger, and God an Enemy: Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my is Wit, Oaths are Rhetorick, and Secrets are Proclamations.</p>
            <p>To shun the accidental Troubles of this Life, is to meditate on Eternity.</p>
            <p>To have a desire to be Poor, and not to receive the inconveniencies of it, is too great Ambition: For it is to desire the honour of Poverty, and the commodity of Wealth.</p>
            <p>There is no better way to end happily a free spiritual Life, than daily to begin it.</p>
            <p>There is no reason to be given for the Fault we commit in Sin, for the Fault would not be Sin, if it were not against Reason.</p>
            <p>In short, the sum of all is, Fear God, and keep his Commandments; for this O Man, is thy whole Duty, which if Sincerely perform'd, will terminate in eternal Salvation</p>
