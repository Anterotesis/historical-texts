         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>AINT <hi>Paul</hi> having in the foregoing parts
of this <hi>Epistle</hi> dispatch'd that <hi>Subject</hi>
which was the Great Occasion of his
writing of it; and endeavour'd by many
Arguments to perswade <hi>the Galatians</hi> not
to suffer themselves to be mislead by
those False-Teachers who were crept in
amongst them, into a needless, and even dangerous mixture,
of the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> together with the <hi>Gospel of Christ:</hi>
Goes on in the <hi>Close</hi> of all, to exhort them to such <hi>Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Duties</hi> as he thought most necessary to recommend to
them in those Circumstances in which they then were.</p>
            <p>It was the unhappiness of that <hi>Church,</hi> as it generally
is of all Others in the like <hi>Cases,</hi> that their <hi>diversity</hi> of
<hi>Opinion,</hi> as to the Point before-mention'd, had set up a <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity</hi>
of <hi>Parties</hi> and <hi>Interests</hi> amongst them; and made
them much more zealous for their own <hi>particular Tenents,</hi>
in which they differ'd from one another, than for <hi>the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Faith and Doctrine of Christ,</hi> in which they agreed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
Instead of <hi>glorifying God</hi> by a <hi>Holy Life,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. v. 15.</note> their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
was to <hi>tear</hi> and <hi>worry one another</hi> about the <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi>
of the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses.</hi> Religion was turn'd into Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
And he was accounted the best man, not who was
the most careful to <hi>live quietly,</hi> and to <hi>do his duty consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiously,</hi>
but who was the most violent to <hi>defend</hi> his <hi>Point,</hi>
and to <hi>run down</hi> all those that were of a <hi>different Perswasion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In opposition to this furious and contentious Spirit,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102607:4"/>
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> having first determined the <hi>Point</hi> which occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
all their difference, goes on finally to stir them up to
such <hi>Duties,</hi> as he supposed would be most likely to reduce
them to a <hi>Christian Temper</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>And <hi>1st,</hi> Since the <hi>Law</hi> was that they were so zealous
for, he desires them to reflect a little, what it was that the
<hi>Law</hi> its self commanded them, Ch. v. 14. <hi>For all the</hi> law <hi>is
fufilled in one word,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verse 14.</note> 
               <hi>even in this, Thou shalt</hi> love <hi>thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
as thy self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly,</hi> He represents to them, what the <hi>present Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi>
of such <hi>Contentions</hi> would be likely to be: That
while they thus quarrell'd with one another, they would
give a fair opportunity to the common Enemy to destroy
them all,<note place="margin">Ch. v. 15.</note> 
               <hi>v. 15. But if ye bite and devour one another, take
heed that ye be not consumed one of another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. 16, 19, 20, &amp;c.</note> He bids them consider, that <hi>Hatred, Variance, Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
Strife, Seditions, Heresies, Envyings,</hi> and such like; how
fair soever the pretence may be of a concern for the <hi>Honour
of God,</hi> and the <hi>Interests</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> are yet as much the
<hi>Works of the Flesh,</hi> and as destructive of Salvation, as <hi>Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi>
or <hi>Drunkenness,</hi> or any other the like Immoralities.
And that, if they would approve themselves truly zealous
in his Service, they must do it by a quite contrary Practice:
By their <hi>Love,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ch. v. 22, 23, 24, 25.</note> 
               <hi>Peace, Long-suffering, Gentleness, Goodness,
Meekness,</hi> and the like <hi>Fruits</hi> of that blessed <hi>Spirit,</hi> which
evermore leads Men to be kind and charitable to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>And having thus given them these <hi>General Cautions,</hi> he
finally adds two or three <hi>particular Directions</hi> in such <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,</hi>
wherein they seemed more especially to stand
in need of his Advice.</p>
            <p>As <hi>First,</hi> That they should not suffer their <hi>differences</hi> so
far to transport them, as to make them be perpetually <hi>quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:102607:4"/>
and <hi>disputing</hi> with one another. For that this would
be a means rather to keep up their differences, and embit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their Spirits, and set them farther from Agreement,
than conduce to the composing of them,<note place="margin">Ch. v. 26.</note> v. 26. <hi>Let us not
be desirous of vain-glory, provoking one another, envying one
another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. vi. Verse 1, 2.</note> That much less should they indulge a peevish
Temper so far, as to be glad of any occasion to expose one
anothers <hi>Sins</hi> and <hi>Infirmities;</hi> but rather should mutually
endeavour to help, and <hi>bear one anothers burdens:</hi> And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that the best man in the World may some time or
other be <hi>tempted,</hi> and <hi>overtaken in a fault,</hi> and so need
the same <hi>Charity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this end,<note place="margin">Verse 3.</note> 
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That they should learn to be <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:</hi>
And instead of comparing themselves with other men,
and valuing themselves upon their being <hi>Better</hi> or more
<hi>Orthodox</hi> than their Neighbours, should examine themselves
by the <hi>Rule</hi> of their <hi>Duty,</hi> and see how they stood with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to that: And remember, that when we come before
<hi>God</hi> in <hi>Judgment,</hi> the Enquiry will not be, whether we have
not exceeded some others in our Piety, but whether we
have liv'd so as we our selves might and ought to have
done, v. 5. <hi>For every man shall bear his own burden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly</hi> and lastly, That above all, they should not suffer
their <hi>differences</hi> in other things, to abate their <hi>Charity,</hi> or
make them ever the less ready in all <hi>Good Offices,</hi> whether to
their <hi>Teachers,</hi> or to <hi>one another.</hi> But should consider, that the
Time is coming when God will call us to <hi>give an account
of our stewardship;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vs. 6, 7, 8, 9.</note> how we have employed those <hi>Talents</hi> he
has committed to us. And then they who have been so wise
as to manage them as they ought to do, shall receive a <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Reward:</hi> Whilst those who have minded only their Lusts
or their Interests; who have either hoarded up their
<hi>Riches</hi> without <hi>doing</hi> and <hi>Good</hi> at all with them, or have
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102607:5"/>
spent them only in <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Extravagance,</hi> shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
to a miserable state of <hi>Everlasting Punishment:</hi>
From whence he concludes in the Words of the <hi>Text;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As we have therefore <hi>Opportunity,</hi> let us <hi>do good</hi> unto <hi>all</hi>
men, especially unto them who are of the <hi>houshold of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From which Words I shall take Occasion to discourse
on these Four <hi>Points:</hi>

            <p>II<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>. Of the <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Measure, When</hi> and <hi>How far</hi> we
ought so to do; <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. <hi>As we have Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity;
According to our</hi> Ability; for so also that Phrase

            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>IV<hi rend="sup">thly</hi>. Of the great Engagement we have to do this, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
in the</hi> verse <hi>before, from which our</hi> Text <hi>is
the Inference:</hi> Let us not be weary in <hi>well-doing,</hi> for in

Opportunity, let us do <hi>Good</hi> unto All men, especially
unto them that are of the <hi>household of Faith.</hi>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>For the better clearing whereof, I must observe, That the
<hi>word</hi> in the <hi>Original</hi> is very <hi>emphatical;</hi> it signifies not
barely the <hi>doing good,</hi> but implies a care and choice in the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102607:5"/>
               <hi>Doing</hi> of it; that we should do, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the Good</hi> that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<hi>Good,</hi> whatsoever it be which another wants, and
wherein we may be capable of lending our assistance to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charity</hi> is a duty as <hi>comprehensive</hi> as it is <hi>excellent:</hi> It ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
its self to all sorts of <hi>Good Offices</hi> whereby we may at
any time be able to serve our neighbour, and do any real
act of kindness to him. And indeed since God designed
that to <hi>Do Good</hi> should be the indispensable <hi>duty</hi> of <hi>all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi>
it was but necessary to give such a Latitude to it,
that no Christian whatsoever might have just cause to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
that he was not in a capacity, in some way or other,
of fulfilling it.</p>
            <p>To run through all the several <hi>parts</hi> of this <hi>duty,</hi> and
shew in how many Instances one man may be capable of
<hi>Doing Good</hi> to another, were an undertaking as difficult
and infinite, as it would be to draw a <hi>Scheme</hi> of all the
<hi>Miseries</hi> and the <hi>Calamities,</hi> of all the <hi>Wants</hi> and the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities,</hi>
which any man ever did, or ever shall fall into in
this world. Suffice it in general to say, That by whatsoever
<hi>Act</hi> of ours we do in any wise promote either the <hi>present
Welfare,</hi> or the <hi>Eternal Happiness</hi> of our neighbour; do in
any sort contribute to make him more easie or comfortable
in <hi>this life,</hi> or to further his everlasting felicity in <hi>the other;</hi>
in that we discharge this <hi>Duty</hi> of <hi>Doing Good</hi> to him, and
which there is no man so mean or low in the World, but
he may find frequent <hi>Opportunities</hi> of putting in practice.</p>
            <p>But tho this therefore be the general import of <hi>Doing
good,</hi> and the undoubted <hi>duty</hi> of every Christian; yet if
we consider that expression according to the <hi>stile</hi> of the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scriptures,</hi> we shall find it commonly used there in a
more <hi>limited sense,</hi> to signifie that particular kind of<note n="*" place="margin">Act. x. 38.—ix 36. 2. Cor. i<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

taking this for the meaning of our <hi>Apostle</hi> in these <hi>words,</hi>

for the <hi>exercise</hi> of such a <hi>Charity,</hi> and to have repeated those
<hi>Commands</hi> more frequently, and to have enforced them

to <hi>God;</hi> and to have declared that no service we can do
the One, shall be accepted, whilst we continue to neglect
the Other. But above all,</p>
            <p>* If not only to have promised the <hi>Blessings</hi> of <hi>this life</hi>
to the practice of it,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>See below,</hi> iv. Point.</note> but to have set forth to us the great
and final Inquest of the <hi>Day of Judgment,</hi> as depending in
a manner entirely on this one thing, and entailing either
<hi>Eternal Happiness,</hi> or <hi>Eternal Misery</hi> upon us in the other
World, according as we have been <hi>Charitable</hi> or not, in this:</p>
            <p>If, I say, all this may be thought sufficient to lay an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
upon us to be very diligent and forward in the
discharge of any <hi>Duty,</hi> there is then none to which our
<hi>Religion</hi> has been more careful to excite and oblige us than
this <hi>one</hi> of <hi>Charity,</hi> nor in which therefore a <hi>Christian</hi> will
be less able to excuse himself, if after all this he shall still
continue to neglect the performance of it.</p>
            <p>But of the <hi>Obligations</hi> which we lie under thus to <hi>Do
Good,</hi> I shall have occasion to speak more fully in the <hi>Close</hi>
of this Discourse: In the mean time having thus pointed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102607:6"/>
out to you what that <hi>Good</hi> is I am now more particularly
to recommend to your practice, and given you a general
Prospect of our concern in it, I shall go on to the <hi>second
Thing</hi> which I proposed to consider,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>II<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>. Of the</hi> Time <hi>and</hi> Measure, <hi>When and How far it is
our</hi> Duty <hi>to</hi> Do this good; As we have Opportunity; Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our Ability.</p>
            <p>I have before said, that the Phrase of St. <hi>Paul</hi> would well
enough bear each of these Interpretations; and I shall ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
chuse both, than prefer either. They Both agree very
well with the design of the <hi>Text,</hi> and will either of them
afford some Useful and Seasonable reflections to us, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
our Practice in the <hi>Duty</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>And 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. Of the <hi>Time,</hi> the <hi>Season</hi> of <hi>Doing Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It has been the general Sence of the most Ancient <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters</hi>
of this passage,<note place="margin">See Chrys. Hieron, &amp;c. in loc.</note> to refer the <hi>Opportunity</hi> here spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of to the <hi>Time of our present life;</hi> as being indeed the
only space we have for the Exercise of such a <hi>Charity.</hi> And
accordingly the<note n="*" place="margin">Vulg. Lat. Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac. Arab.</note> 
               <hi>Learned Translations,</hi> departing a little
from the strictness of the <hi>Greek Original,</hi> have most of
them render'd it not as we have here done, <hi>As we have
therefore opportunity:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion Serv. Vs<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. 7, 8.</note> But as it still stands in our <hi>Liturgy,</hi>
Now while <hi>we have Time, let us Do Good unto all
men.</hi> And thus it will agree very well with the Rest of
the <hi>Context;</hi> where the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks of two different
<hi>seasons,</hi> the <hi>One</hi> of <hi>sowing,</hi> the <hi>Other</hi> of <hi>harvest;</hi> and <hi>Exhorts</hi>
the <hi>Galatians</hi> not to neglect to <hi>sow now,</hi>
               <note place="margin">—9.</note> and then they
shall be sure to <hi>reap hereafter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed this is a Remark, than which none can be
more proper for our serious Consideration. It has pleased
<hi>God</hi> to send us into this World, to exercise our selves, and
to prepare our Souls for the Happiness of the Other. Here
therefore is the <hi>Time</hi> of <hi>Labour;</hi> the fatal <hi>season</hi> that must
render us either <hi>Happy</hi> or <hi>Miserable</hi> to all <hi>Eternity.</hi> And
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102607:7"/>
I am sure, I need not tell you either how short, or how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
at the best this <hi>Time</hi> is. Our years run on apace;
whilst we are discoursing of it we draw nigher to the
Grave. Every <hi>minute</hi> cuts off some portion of our Life;
and we cannot tell how soon <hi>death</hi> may overtake us, and
deprive us of it all at once. And certainly then we ought
to esteem it a very seasonable Admonition, which the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle</hi>
here gives us, <hi>presently, whilst we have</hi> yet the <hi>Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
to Do Good,</hi> seeing we cannot tell how little a space
we may have lest us for the <hi>doing</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>It is the folly of a great part of the World, that in this,
as well as in too many other Instances of their <hi>Duty,</hi> they
love still to Procrastinate, and put off the <hi>doing</hi> of it as
long as ever they can. They will <hi>Repent</hi> when they are
<hi>Dying,</hi> and be <hi>Charitable</hi> when they are <hi>Dead:</hi> But will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
run the hazard of their Souls to all Eternity, than
part either with their <hi>Sins</hi> or their <hi>Money</hi> before needs they
must. And truly for those of the <hi>Other Communion,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that a little <hi>Sorrow</hi> and <hi>Confession</hi> at the last, is enough
to discharge them of all the <hi>Guilt</hi> of their <hi>Sins;</hi> and that
by a <hi>Good Legacy</hi> left to the <hi>Church,</hi> for <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Masses</hi>
to be said for them, they shall soon get quit of the <hi>Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of them too; What wonder if they reserve both their
<hi>Riches</hi> and their <hi>Repentance,</hi> for so <hi>Seasonable a Time,</hi> and <hi>so
Good an Occasion?</hi> But for men who see through these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions,
and smile at such Bargains, and wonder how any
<hi>Christians</hi> can suffer themselves to be so grosly cheated in a
matter of so much concernment, as their <hi>Money</hi> commonly
<hi>is</hi> to <hi>most,</hi> and as our <hi>Souls</hi> certainly <hi>ought to</hi> be to <hi>all</hi> of us;
nevertheless still to delay their <hi>doing Good,</hi> and neglect the
<hi>Opportunity,</hi> and leave the issue of all to a <hi>death-bed Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi>
and a <hi>death-bed Charity:</hi> What can we conclude but
that such persons as these, must have too great an affection
both for their <hi>Riches</hi> and for their <hi>Lusts;</hi> and that could
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102607:7"/>
these Men have lived for Ever, they would never have
thought of being either <hi>Charitable</hi> or <hi>Religious?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed for those who have been <hi>Liberal</hi> and <hi>Bountiful</hi>
before, to <hi>finish</hi> their <hi>Race</hi> with <hi>Glory;</hi> and adorn their
<hi>Death,</hi> with the same Charity that had given a <hi>Luster</hi> and
<hi>Ornament</hi> to them whilst they <hi>Lived;</hi> This is so far from
being worthy of any Censure, that it ought rather to make
their Memory precious to all future Generations. But o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
to tarry to the last hour, and never think of <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Good</hi> to <hi>others</hi> with the Portion which God has Given
us, till we are no longer in a condition to enjoy it our
selves; this must certainly be very <hi>Sinful</hi> and <hi>Scandalous:</hi>
And tho I will not say that such a <hi>Legacy,</hi> rather than <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
at the last, shall utterly lose its Reward; Yet as it
wants much of that Praise which the <hi>Early giver</hi> meets
with among <hi>Men,</hi> so I think it may be justly doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it shall find so Favourable an Acceptance in the sight
of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But (2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>.) This <hi>Phrase, As we have Opportunity,</hi> will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of yet another consideration, and that more Agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to our litteral translation of it, <hi>viz. When ever a fitting
Occasion presents its self, and we are in a Condition of doing</hi>
of it. Not that we should suppose it to be our <hi>Duty,</hi> to give
to every one indifferently that shall ask of us, and in the
usual <hi>dialect</hi> of the <hi>streets,</hi> abuse the Sacred <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi>
to cover over their own <hi>Idleness</hi> and <hi>Vndeserving.</hi> There
is a <hi>Prudence</hi> to be used in the <hi>Distribution</hi> of our <hi>Charity,</hi>
as well as a <hi>Liberality</hi> to be shown in the <hi>proportion</hi> of it.
And St.<note n="*" place="margin">2 Thes. iii. 10. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. in loc. p. 394. E.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> himself has told us there are some, who <hi>If
they will not work, neither let them eat.</hi> But that whenever
a true and worthy Object of <hi>Charity</hi> presents its self to us,
we should then embrace the <hi>Occasion;</hi> and look upon it
that this is the <hi>Opportunity</hi> in which if we are able, we
ought to <hi>do Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:102607:8"/>
Nay but yet farther, (3<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>.) Tho it be most certain in
the General, that whenever a titting <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>Charity</hi>
calls upon us for our relief, we ought, if we are in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
to lay hold on the <hi>Opportunity</hi> to <hi>do Good:</hi> yet
some Special <hi>Seasons</hi> and <hi>Occasions</hi> there are, which will in
a particular manner deserve to be look'd upon as the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Times</hi> for this <hi>Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such are 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. The <hi>Times of Want</hi> and <hi>Scarceness:</hi> Whether
it happens by the Hand of God, or through the Sins and
Violence of men; Whether by some <hi>dearth</hi> or <hi>famine</hi> in the
Land, or by the miseries of <hi>War</hi> and <hi>Tumults;</hi> the Obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of <hi>Commerce</hi> abroad, and the natural consequence
of that, the <hi>Decay</hi> of <hi>Trade</hi> at home. In these and the like
Cases, the more the <hi>Necessities</hi> of the <hi>poor</hi> encrease, the
greater should be our care and concern to relieve them:
And we must not think, that an <hi>ordinary Charity</hi> will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
us, when such <hi>Accidents</hi> and <hi>Calamities</hi> as these, call
for an <hi>extraordinary bounty</hi> from us.</p>
            <p>But especially, 2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>. Such is the <hi>Time</hi> of <hi>Tryals</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions
for righteousness sake:</hi> When it pleases God,
whose Judgments are unsearchable, to expose (as many
times he does) his own <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Servants,</hi> to <hi>suffer</hi> for
their <hi>Faith,</hi> and a <hi>good Conscience;</hi> being <hi>persecuted in one
City or Country, to fly into another:</hi> And thereby at the
same time, that he does them the <hi>honour</hi> of making
them <hi>Confessors</hi> for their <hi>Religion,</hi> offers us the <hi>Benefit,</hi> of
being in some measure <hi>Partakers</hi> with them in their <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions;</hi>
by our careful provision for, and our generous
reception of them.</p>
            <p>It was this consideration especially, that open'd so far
the hearts of the <hi>first Converts</hi> to <hi>Christianity</hi> towards one
another, that they accounted nothing they had their own;
but were even glad of the opportunity to do somewhat
extraordinary in testimony of their <hi>Love</hi> to those, who
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102607:8"/>
shew'd so much <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Constancy</hi> to their Blessed <hi>Master.</hi>
And sure we ought in some measure to imitate the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Charity</hi> of those Men, at a time when so many of our
<hi>Brethren</hi> have follow'd their <hi>Example,</hi> in a <hi>Primitive zeal,</hi>
and <hi>firmness</hi> to their <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the least return we can make to <hi>God,</hi> for the
Peace and Tranquility we hitherto enjoy, when so many
<hi>Thousands</hi> have been exposed to ruin for that <hi>Faith,</hi> which
we count it our <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Happiness</hi> to profess. And
certainly we ought to consider, if the <hi>storm</hi> should have
broken first upon us, what we should have in that <hi>case</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from them, and let that inform us what we ought
to do for them.</p>
            <p>And these are such <hi>Opportunities,</hi> as the Necessities of
Others make for us: There are yet many <hi>special Occasions</hi>
for <hi>Doing Good</hi> which our <hi>own circumstances</hi> will offer to us.</p>
            <p>So, <hi>3dly.</hi> In the <hi>Times</hi> of our <hi>Happiness</hi> and <hi>Prosperity:</hi>
When <hi>God</hi> does in any extraordinary manner give a <hi>Blessing</hi>
to us, whether in our <hi>Persons</hi> or in our <hi>Affairs;</hi>
Whether in our own <hi>Private concerns</hi> only, or in the
more <hi>General</hi> and <hi>Publick welfare</hi> of our <hi>Friends</hi> or <hi>Country.</hi>
These are such <hi>Times</hi> in which not only our own <hi>Reason,</hi>
and the <hi>Common Practice</hi> of <hi>Mankind,</hi> but even <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
has directed us to make our <hi>Charity</hi> to <hi>Others,</hi> one
way of expressing our <hi>Grateful acknowledgments</hi> to <hi>Him:</hi>
That whilst we rejoyce in the effects of his Mercy to us,
our Brethren may find Cause to joyn thanks with us, for
the Liberal expressions of our Love and Kindness to
them. And therefore when God Commanded the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi>
in three <hi>Solemn Feasts</hi> every year, to keep up the
Memory of the <hi>Blessings</hi> he had done for them in bringing
them up out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and planting them in that <hi>Good land</hi>
which they possessed; He took particular care that the <hi>Poor</hi>
should not be forgot by them; <hi>Deut.</hi> xvi. 11, 14. <hi>Thou shalt,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:102607:9"/>
says he, <hi>rejoyce before the LORD:</hi> Thou, <hi>and thy</hi> Son, <hi>and
thy</hi> Daughter, <hi>and thy</hi> Man-servant, <hi>and thy</hi> Maid-servant,
<hi>and the</hi> Levite, <hi>and the</hi> Stranger, <hi>and the</hi> Fatherless, <hi>and
the</hi> Widow, <hi>that are within thy gates.</hi> For which end
there was a <hi>Publick Collection</hi> always to be made at those
<hi>Feasts;</hi> v. 16. 17. <hi>Three times in a year shall all thy Males
appear before the LORD, in the place which he shall chuse,
in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks,
and in the feast of Tabernacles; They shall not appear before
the LORD</hi> Empty. <hi>Every man shall</hi> give, <hi>according to
the Blessing of the LORD thy God, which he hath</hi> given
thee.</p>
            <p>And not only if we have already received any Signal
<hi>Blessings</hi> and <hi>Deliverances</hi> from <hi>God;</hi> But <hi>4thly,</hi> When we
would implore his Favour for <hi>Future Mercies;</hi> Whether to
<hi>deliver</hi> us from any <hi>Evils</hi> or <hi>Calamities</hi> which either our
<hi>Sins have deserved,</hi> or we may otherwise have just
Cause to fear are ready to fall upon us; Or else to send
down some <hi>new Blessings</hi> upon us, or to <hi>continue,</hi> or to <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi>
those we have aleardy received: In all these, and the
like Cases, there is nothing can more effectually <hi>appease
God's Anger,</hi> and <hi>enliven our Prayers,</hi> and make our Piety and
our <hi>Repentance acceptable</hi> in his sight, and so obtain those
Mercies which we desire from him; than to accompany
all our other Service, with some extraordinary <hi>Acts</hi> of
<hi>Charity,</hi> and thereby give a new Force, and Vigour to it.</p>

with the dew of Heaven;</hi> The best Advice he could give
him to stay the hand of <hi>God,</hi> and prevent the <hi>Evil</hi> that was
denounced against him, was to do some extraordinary

that there is yet another meaning which some have
given to the <hi>phrase</hi> of my <hi>Text</hi> which I have now

thing I proposed in this matter,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly,</hi> Of the <hi>Measure</hi> we are to observe in our
<hi>Doing Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that in general is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>As far as we

For so we find the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> sometimes used, not
only in the best <hi>Greek Authors,</hi> but even in these very
<hi>Epistles:</hi> and particularly <hi>Phil.</hi> IV. 10. where
St. <hi>Paul</hi> excusing the <hi>Philippians</hi> that did not
sooner send their relief to him, tells them they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
no Good-will <gap reason="foreign">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis tis compotes.</note> so the <hi>Syriac</hi> renders it; and so<note n="*" place="margin">Chrys in Phil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hom. XV. p. 135. E.</note> St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome,</hi>
not to mention any others, expresly tells us
we are there to understand it.</p>
            <p>But now what that proportion in particular is,
which every one ought to distribute in Works of
<hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> this is what I shall not undertake
precisely to define. Thus much our <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102607:11"/>
that <hi>what a Man sows, the same he shall also reap:</hi>
And that we are to understand this not only with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the <hi>kind,</hi> but to the <hi>Measure</hi> and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion</hi>
too,<note place="margin">2 Cor. IX. 6.</note> himself shews us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> IX. 6. <hi>He which
soweth sparingly shall reap sparingly, and he which
soweth bountifully shall reap bountifully, every Man
according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give,
not grudgingly or of necessity; for God loveth a chearful
giver.</hi> And from both which it is obvious to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that though S. <hi>Paul</hi> would not prescribe any
certain Bounds to Men's <hi>Charity,</hi> which ought to be
a <hi>free-will Offering,</hi> large and voluntary, not narrow
and constrained; yet that in <hi>general</hi> he has plainly
enough delivered his Opinion, that the <hi>more</hi> we <hi>give,</hi>
the <hi>better</hi> God will <hi>accept</hi> of it; and the greater and
more certain shall our returns from Heaven be.</p>
            <p>And to a truly <hi>Charitable</hi> mind, there will need
no other direction than this. But because such is the
narrowness of most Men's Souls, that they are apt to
think every little pittance that they bestow on <hi>Acts</hi> of
<hi>Mercy</hi> to the <hi>Poor,</hi> to be abundantly sufficient to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title
them not only to an Acceptance, but to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
also: Though I shall not presume to set any
bounds where the <hi>Gospel</hi> has not, by determining
what men ought to lay aside for this <hi>Duty;</hi> yet thus
far I will adventure to correct their Mistakes, as to
shew what that <hi>proportion</hi> is below which I suppose
Men ought not, without some extraordinary Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
to fall; or if they do, may have just cause to
fear that they shall be look'd upon by God, as <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful</hi>
and <hi>Vncharitable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:102607:11"/>
Now in order hereunto, I shall in the <hi>first place</hi> take
it for granted, that every Man ought to be the more
<hi>liberal</hi> in his <hi>Charity</hi> to others, the more <hi>free</hi> and
<hi>bountiful</hi> the <hi>Providence</hi> of <hi>God</hi> has been in its <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributions</hi>
to him. That is to say, that our <hi>Charity</hi>
must bear a proportion to our Abilities, and that
to <hi>whomsoever much is given, of him,</hi> in this sense also,
<hi>much shall be required.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is what St. <hi>Paul</hi> seems to have laid down as
the standing rule for the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to proceed by,
1 <hi>Epist.</hi> XVI. 2. That every one of them should
lay aside <hi>according as God had prosper'd,</hi> or blessed
<hi>him:</hi> Which was the very <hi>measure</hi> that we before
saw <hi>Moses</hi> gave to the <hi>Jews</hi> heretofore; <hi>Deut.</hi> XVI.
17. <hi>Every man shall give according to the Blessing of
the LORD thy God which he hath given thee.</hi> And
the same <hi>Apostle,</hi> in his 1st <hi>Epist.</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> VI. 18.
Bids <hi>Timothy charge them that were rich in this world,</hi>
not only that they should be <hi>ready to give, and glad to
distribute,</hi> but that they should <hi>be rich in good works;
i.e.</hi> should exceed others as much in their <hi>Charity,</hi> as
they did in their <hi>Estates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And from all which it is very plain, that if those
to whom God has given a larger <hi>Ability</hi> than others;
whose <hi>riches</hi> are greater, or whose <hi>occasions</hi> less; who
have neither so many to <hi>maintain now,</hi> nor to <hi>provide
for hereafter;</hi> do not in some proportion go beyond
them in works of <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>beneficence:</hi> They may
justly be looked upon to come short of that <hi>Charity
God</hi> expects from them, though otherwise they
should chance to give in a lower and more scanty
degree.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:102607:12"/>
But <hi>Secondly,</hi> and to come more closely to the <hi>point</hi>
proposed. It cannot reasonably be doubted, But that
as our <hi>Saviour</hi> himself tells us, that <hi>He came not to
destroy the Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. v. 17.</note> 
               <hi>but to fulfil it:</hi> So <hi>except our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
shall exceed the righteousness of the</hi> Scribes <hi>and</hi>
Pharisees,<note place="margin">—20.</note>. the strictest and most diligent observers of
the <hi>Law, We shall in no case enter into the Kingdom of
Heaven.</hi> It remains therefore, that though the
<hi>Gospel</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> has not particularly defined what
<hi>proportion</hi> every man should give in works of <hi>Charity,</hi>
yet that no <hi>Christians</hi> ought to give less now, than
what the <hi>Jews</hi> heretofore were ordinarily obliged to
do.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>proportion</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> was this.<note n="a" place="margin">

               <note n="c" place="margin">Exod. xxii. 25. Levitie. xxv. 35, 36. Deut xxiii. 19</note> That they should lend to them without
<hi>Vsury;</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Deut. xxiv. 19.</note> That they should not go over their <hi>Fields,</hi>
their <hi>Vineyards,</hi> or their <hi>Olive-yards</hi> a second time to
gather them clean; or if they left any <hi>sheaf,</hi> or <hi>clusters,</hi>
or <hi>bunches</hi> behind, that they should not go back to
fetch them, but should leave all that escaped their
first Gathering, together with a certain<note n="e" place="margin">Levit. xix. 19. Deut. xxiv. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Part</hi> of
each field, which they called the <hi>Corner of the field,</hi>
untouch'd, <hi>for the Stranger, for the Fatherless, and
for the Widow;</hi> besides some other <hi>Instances</hi> of the like
kind, prescribed to them<note n="f" place="margin">See Deut. xxiv. 14. &amp;c.</note>.</p>
            <p>This was the <hi>Jew's righteousness,</hi> that is, his <hi>duty,</hi>
his <hi>obligation:</hi> And if he transgress'd in any thing of
all this, he <hi>broke</hi> the <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>sinned</hi> against <hi>God.</hi>
But they had <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Charity</hi> yet beyond this, and
which they properly called by the Names of <hi>Mercy</hi>
and <hi>Bounty.</hi> Such were all their <hi>Voluntary Offerings</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:102607:12"/>
at their <hi>Feasts</hi> before mention'd: All their <hi>Occasional
works</hi> of <hi>pity,</hi> upon extraordinary Emergencies: If
for example <hi>God</hi> had given them a greater increase
than ordinary in their <hi>fields</hi> or their <hi>Vineyards;</hi> or
they had met with any unexpected <hi>Good success</hi> in
their Affairs: If their <hi>Children</hi> and their <hi>Flocks</hi> were
multiplied unto them; or else on the other hand,
some greater <hi>sin</hi> was to be expiated, or some <hi>Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
to be prevented, which seem'd ready to come
upon them, unless they took care, by some extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> to prevent
the evil, and reconcile themselves to <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such was the measure of the <hi>Jews Charity</hi> under
the <hi>Law,</hi> and certainly the <hi>Christians</hi> ought not to
be less. And therefore tho' I shall not pretend to
determine what every man ought to do in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
and indeed amidst the great variety of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes</hi>
and <hi>Circumstances</hi> in the World, could not well
give any certain rules for this matter; yet thus much
I am perswaded we may conclude.<note place="margin">See <hi>Dr. Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>'s Pract. Cat. l. 3. Sect. 1.</note> That no <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
can ordinarily excuse himself, who does not lay
aside somewhat more than the <hi>thirtieth part</hi> of his
yearly income for the <hi>Stranger,</hi> for the <hi>Fatherless,</hi>
and for the <hi>Widow,</hi> besides all <hi>Occasional A<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> of
<hi>Charity</hi> on extraordinary Emergencies; which was
the least that <hi>God</hi> required of the <hi>Jews</hi> heretofore,
and is, I believe, the least that any <hi>Christian</hi> can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
presume shall be expected of him now.</p>
            <p>And as we may justly suppose this to be the very
<hi>lowest degree</hi> that is fit to be mention'd among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
for the <hi>ordinary</hi> discharge of this <hi>duty.</hi> So,
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> On <hi>extraordinary Occasions,</hi> such as those we
before laid down, 'tis certain, that this will by no
means suffice. Here we must set no <hi>bounds</hi> to our
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102607:13"/>
               <hi>doing Good,</hi> but what our want of <hi>Ability,</hi> or <hi>Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity</hi>
prescribes to us. <hi>Charity</hi> indeed does not only
allow, but oblige us first to <hi>provide for our own:</hi> And
when that is prudently and moderately done, what
further remains, tho' it be ours, yet it is ours only in
trust for the supply of the <hi>wants</hi> and <hi>necessities</hi> of our
Neighbours.<note place="margin">Chrys. de La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar. conc. 2. <hi>p.</hi> 50. C. D. Edit. Par. Gr. Lat.</note> And if the Exigences of the Poor be
great, and they cannot otherwise be supplied, we
must resolve rather to part with all that we can spare,
than to see them languish and perish for want of it.
And woe be to that man who indulges either his <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness</hi>
or his <hi>Vanity</hi> with that, for the lack of
which his poor Brother perishes! What our Saviour

            <p>Such must in general the <hi>Christians Love</hi> and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence</hi>
be: But then as <hi>God</hi> himself, though he is
<hi>kind</hi> to the <hi>Vnthankful</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi>
               <note place="margin">—36.</note> has yet a particular
regard to his <hi>own Servants;</hi> and even amongst them,
does in a more especial manner promise to favour
such as we are now speaking of, the <hi>Liberal,</hi> and
<hi>Charitable Christians</hi> above all others, so ought we
also to do:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Chrys.</hi> in loc. p. 859. A.</note> We must, <hi>as we have Opportunity,</hi> Do
Good, <hi>unto all men;</hi> But yet</p>
            <p>2ly, <hi>Especially</hi> to them who are of the <hi>Houshold</hi>
of <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By those <hi>who are of the Houshold of Faith</hi> we may
understand,<note place="margin">Hieron. in loc. D.</note> either <hi>first,</hi> more largely, <hi>All Christians</hi>
in general, who in the <hi>Scripture Phrase</hi> are often cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>God's Houshold,</hi> Ephes. II. 19. Or <hi>secondly,</hi> more
particularly, those of whom the <hi>Apostle</hi> was speaking
<hi>ver. 6. Let him that is taught in the Word, communicate
unto him that teacheth in all good things.</hi> And in which
soever of these <hi>two senses</hi> we take the Expression, the
<hi>Rule</hi> of our <hi>Text</hi> will hold good in both: That we
ought in a more especial manner to be careful to <hi>do
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102607:14"/>
Good</hi> to them, beyond such others as we are not so par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
engaged to.</p>
            <p>Nay but, <hi>secondly,</hi> and to carry this Reflection yet
farther: We may in the exercise of our <hi>Charity</hi> not
only make a <hi>distinction</hi> betwixt <hi>Christians</hi> and <hi>others,</hi>
and among them prefer those chiefly who labour in
<hi>the word</hi> among us; but should even with respect to
all others, take care as far as we can to give to those
first who either the <hi>best deserve,</hi> or at least the <hi>most
stand in need</hi> of our assistance.</p>
            <p>For since the largest fortune is not enough to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a man to relieve all;<note place="margin">See <hi>Ambros.</hi> de Offic. l. 2. c. 15.</note> and 'tis certain that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the <hi>wants</hi> of some may be much more urgent than
those of others, and so more fit to be consider'd by
us; but also that there are many, and those common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the most clamorous and importunate, that are
utterly unworthy to be regarded by us: He who will
<hi>Do Good</hi> with that <hi>prudence</hi> and <hi>discretion</hi> he ought
to do, must take all the care he can to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the one and the other of these, that since he
cannot be a <hi>Common Benefactor</hi> to all, he may at least
become so to them that the most deserve his <hi>Pity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And,<note place="margin">

               <hi>(1st.)</hi> There are many who finding <hi>Begging</hi>
not only a more easie and agreeable, but sometimes a
more profitable Employment too, not only neglect
to <hi>work</hi> themselves, but even train up their <hi>Children</hi>
to the same Trade of <hi>Idleness,</hi> and of living upon the
<hi>Charity</hi> of others. As soon as they are <hi>born,</hi> before
they can yet speak for themselves, their <hi>Looks</hi> and
<hi>Cries</hi> serve for a new Topick to encrease the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of their <hi>Parents:</hi> And no sooner are they able
to use their <hi>Limbs,</hi> and have attain'd so much of
<hi>Christianity</hi> as may suffice for their purpose, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
the Compassion of unwary and good-natur'd
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102607:15"/>
men, but from thenceforth they are set free to shift
for themselves, and live as their friends have done
before them.</p>
            <p>Now, tho' I will not say a man <hi>commits</hi> a <hi>Sin</hi>
that relieves one of these, and do confess, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he who gives to all, may chance to light on a
true <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>Charity</hi> among many that are much
otherwise; yet certainly it is for the most part a
good deed misplac'd:<note place="margin">Chrys. Hom. in Laz. 2. p. 51. B. C. p. 52. <hi>D.</hi>
               </note> And though I know St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi>
seems to exhort us <hi>to give to all,</hi> upon this
consideration, That sometimes thereby we shall hit
aright; yet I can no more believe that the bare <hi>possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
of this should make a man <hi>charitable</hi> without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction,
than that the passage of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> which he
urges for it, should engage us to receive indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
all that pass by, into our <hi>Houses,</hi> because by
so doing <hi>some have entertained Angels unawares.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. xiii. 2.</note>
But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(2dly,)</hi> There is another sort of men, who by
their <hi>own fault</hi> are reduced to <hi>Poverty,</hi> and are now
no longer in a condition to help themselves, tho'
'tis in a great measure owing to their former <hi>sins</hi> and
<hi>neglects</hi> that they are not.</p>
            <p>I do not think that such ought wholly to be pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by, especially if they are at last come to a <hi>due
sense</hi> of their <hi>Folly,</hi> and to a <hi>serious Repentance</hi> for
it. But yet if we have before us <hi>better men,</hi> and
as <hi>necessitous</hi> as the other; Such as have wrought
whilst they were able, and are now fallen into
<hi>Poverty,</hi> because either their Employment fails
them, or their <hi>Strength</hi> is gone through <hi>former
Labours:</hi> If a decrepit Age has overtaken them, or
it may be a <hi>numerous Family</hi> keeps them still under,
notwithstanding all their <hi>Pains</hi> and <hi>Industry;</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102607:15"/>
such persons as these ought first to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd,
and take place of those, who have not so
fair a pretence to our Assistance.</p>
            <p>And this brings me to a <hi>(3d.)</hi> Reflection; and
which will yet more direct us in the wise discharge
of this <hi>Duty.</hi> There are many every where <hi>no less
necessitous,</hi> but much <hi>more modest,</hi> than the rude
and clamorous <hi>Street-Beggar;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Videndus est ille qui te non videt: Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendus ille qui erubescit videri. <hi>Ambros.</hi> de Offic. l. 2. c. 15, 16.</note> Who are fearful and
scrupulous; Who <hi>mourn in secret,</hi> and complain
to <hi>GOD</hi> in their Extremities, but cannot tell
how to make their Wants known to their <hi>fellow-Christians.</hi>
They labour diligently; they neglect
no Care to support themselves, and those for whom
they are concerned to provide. But alas! they
labour in vain; Either a decay of <hi>Trade,</hi> or it may
be unavoidable <hi>Losses</hi> in it; <hi>Want of Business, Fire,
Sickness,</hi> a thousand other <hi>Misfortunes</hi> keep them
low and miserable: They cannot tell how to <hi>ask</hi>
our <hi>Charity,</hi> and yet are ready to perish for
want of it.</p>
            <p>Such Men as these ought, I do not say to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
with all chearfulness when known, but to be
enquired after and found out, that they may be both
assisted and encouraged by us. And our <hi>Charity</hi>
should descend like the <hi>Dew</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> upon them;
in the most soft and easie, the most courteous and
obliging manner that is possible. We should take
care to consult their <hi>modesty</hi> as well as their <hi>wants;</hi>
and if possible not let them know from what hand
their help comes, or to whom it is, besides <hi>God,</hi> they
are to return their thanks for it.</p>
            <p>The truth is, these are a sort of Men, that do as
much deserve our <hi>Charity,</hi> as the common sort of
<hi>Beggars,</hi> for the most part, do our Refusal. And
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102607:16"/>
if it be some kind of <hi>Reproach</hi> to our <hi>Country,</hi> that
these latter are not more suppressed, and set on
work; it is certainly a great deal more both our
<hi>Sin</hi> and our <hi>Scandal,</hi> that the others should not
be more carefully provided for, and encouraged by
us.</p>
            <p>I shall add yet one remark more, <hi>(4thly)</hi> and
which will bring me still nearer to the <hi>Command</hi> of
my <hi>Text; As we have opportunity let us</hi> Do Good
<hi>unto</hi> all Men; <hi>especially unto them that are of the</hi>
Houshold <hi>of</hi> Faith.</p>
            <p>I have before said, that by those of the <hi>Houshold
of Faith</hi> we might understand, either <hi>all Christians</hi>
in <hi>general;</hi> or else in <hi>particular,</hi> those who <hi>labour</hi>
in the <hi>Word</hi> among us: And I am sorry I should
have any Occasion to give you a <hi>third meaning</hi> of
it, for such <hi>Christians</hi> as are of the same <hi>particular
Faith</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> with one Another, or have any
reflections to offer thereupon to you. But, alas!
both our <hi>Divisions</hi> are too great to be dissembled at
<hi>any Time,</hi> and the Consequences of them too deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
to be utterly passed by at such <hi>a Time,</hi>
and in such a <hi>Discourse</hi> as this.</p>
            <p>We live in an Age, wherein Men's different
Opinions in <hi>Points</hi> of <hi>Christian Doctrine,</hi> have
so far transported them, as to make them almost
utterly forget all the <hi>Measures</hi> of <hi>Christian Love</hi> and
<hi>Charity</hi> towards one another. I need not tell you
how sad the Effects of a <hi>misguided Zeal</hi> have
been, both in our own and other Countries?
What <hi>desolations</hi> it has wrought? How many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
it has <hi>ruined?</hi> What <hi>Wars</hi> and <hi>Disturbances</hi> it
has raised, almost in all the parts of the Christian
World? We have seen with our <hi>Eyes,</hi> and it has
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102607:16"/>
been told unto us, what <hi>Calamities</hi> our <hi>Brethren</hi>
have undergone <hi>abroad:</hi> And to what extream
Miseries they are reduced in the midst of us,
no Man can be ignorant, though I fear but
few of us lay it so effectually to heart as we
ought to do. And all this for the sake of that
<hi>Religion</hi> which by the blessing of God we yet enjoy
in peace and security.</p>
            <p>In such an unhappy state as this; When the
<hi>numbers</hi> of our distressed Brethren are so <hi>great,</hi>
their <hi>cause</hi> so <hi>Good,</hi> and their <hi>Wants</hi> so <hi>pressing,</hi>
though I would not be so uncharitable as to say
that we should withdraw either our Affection or
Assistance from any <hi>other Christians,</hi> no not from
those who have been their <hi>Persecutors;</hi> yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
I may, without abusing the <hi>Design of</hi> my
<hi>Text,</hi> say thus much; That we ought, in the first
place, to give to those who are of the same
<hi>Houshold of Faith</hi> with our selves, before such
as do not stand in so near a Relation to us.</p>
            <p>And, blessed be God, who has not only hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
continued his favours to us, it may be, for
this very end that we might be able <hi>to minister
to the necessities</hi> of these his <hi>Saints,</hi> but has in
some measure opened our <hi>Hearts</hi> too, and made
us willing to do it. Only let us take the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation</hi>
of our <hi>Apostle</hi> in this place, as well as
his <hi>Direction;</hi> and since their needs still continue,
let us consider how we may still go on to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for them; And let <hi>us not be</hi> weary <hi>in</hi> well-doing,
<hi>for in due season we shall reap, if we faint
not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:102607:17"/>
Which brings me to the last thing proposed,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vthly,</hi> To consider the great <hi>Engagement</hi>
we have to the fulfilling of this <hi>Duty,</hi> in that
<hi>Glorious Reward</hi> which God has promised to the
performance of it.</p>
            <p>Among all the <hi>Arguments</hi> which either the
<hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> or the <hi>Common prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
of <hi>Reason</hi> afford to us, to stir us up to the
<hi>practice</hi> of this <hi>Duty,</hi> there is none that strikes so
forcibly upon the minds of all sorts of Men, as
the Consideration of those <hi>great Blessings</hi> which
God has promised to the diligent performance of
it; and of those <hi>severe Judgments</hi> which he will
one day execute upon those that shall continue to
neglect and disregard it. Other reflections may
serve to convince Men of the <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness</hi>
of such a <hi>practice,</hi> and which indeed is
so very clear that there are few so ill-natured and
insensible as to deny it: But this shews the <hi>Necessity</hi>
of it. Others may force us to confess it to be very
titting that we should be thus <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>charitable</hi>
to one another: But this speaks with <hi>Authority,</hi>
and makes us resolve in good earnest so to be.</p>
            <p>He that tells me how highly reasonable it is that
I should <hi>do</hi> all the <hi>Good</hi> I can with the <hi>portion</hi> which
<hi>God</hi> has given me, * That for this end I have received
it, and to this end ought especially to employ it:
* That my <hi>riches</hi> are not <hi>my own,</hi> but committed to
me in <hi>trust</hi> for the <hi>Benefit</hi> of <hi>others,</hi> as well as for
my <hi>own use;</hi> and that I shall be <hi>false</hi> to that
<hi>trust,</hi> if I <hi>do</hi> no <hi>Good</hi> to others by them: * That I
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102607:17"/>
ought to express my <hi>Gratitude</hi> to <hi>God</hi> for his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Favours to me, by being <hi>Bountiful</hi> to
those who have not received so large a portion
of him: * That this will, above any thing, render
me most like unto God, and most <hi>beloved</hi> of <hi>Men:</hi>
* That the poorest person in the World is yet my
Brother, partaker of the same <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
it may be of the same <hi>Promise</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> too
with my self; and therefore that it will be highly,
not only <hi>un-Christian,</hi> but even <hi>unnatural</hi> and <hi>inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,</hi>
not to have some <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>feeling</hi> of his <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccles. xi. 1, 2.</note> In a word, * That our <hi>Riches</hi> are very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,
and we should consider, that what is the
Condition of many Thousands now, but lately in
as <hi>flourishing</hi> an Estate as our selves, may, for
ought we know, the next Year be our own, if
<hi>God,</hi> for our <hi>Vncharitableness,</hi> shall think sit to let
us also fall into the hands of the same <hi>Cruel</hi> and
<hi>Merciless</hi> men; and therefore that we ought to
think what we should judge reasonable for others
in such a Case, to <hi>do to us;</hi> and then remember the
<hi>Great Rule</hi> both of <hi>Nature</hi> and the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and <hi>do
even so unto them;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. vii. 12.</note> does certainly speak a great
deal of <hi>Sense,</hi> and may justly move my <hi>Assent</hi> to
his <hi>Arguments.</hi> But 'tis the man who can <hi>draw
aside the Vail,</hi> and set <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death, Blessing</hi> and
<hi>Cursing</hi> before me; and then make it appear upon
such <hi>Grounds</hi> as I cannot <hi>deny,</hi> or even <hi>doubt of,</hi>
that my <hi>Happiness</hi> or <hi>Misery,</hi> both in <hi>this World</hi> and
<hi>the other,</hi> depends upon my <hi>Observance</hi> or <hi>Neglect</hi> of
this <hi>Duty,</hi> that will awaken all the <hi>Powers</hi> of my <hi>Soul,</hi>
and at the same time both <hi>convince</hi> and <hi>force</hi> to a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:102607:18"/>
And such is the <hi>Argument</hi> we have here before us, and
from which therefore the <hi>Apostle</hi> concludes the <hi>necessity</hi>
of our <hi>doing Good,</hi> as a matter that would admit of no
debate: <hi>Be not,</hi> says he, <hi>deceived; God is not mocked:
For whatsoever a man soweth, that he shall also reap. He that
soweth to his flesh,</hi> that is, that either spends what he has
on the <hi>sensual Enjoyments</hi> of the <hi>Flesh,</hi> or else hoards it
together to the <hi>Covetous</hi> satisfying the <hi>desires</hi> of it, <hi>shall
of the flesh reap corruption: But he that soweth to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
i.e. as the next <hi>Verses</hi> interpret it, <hi>does good,</hi> makes
a <hi>wise,</hi> and <hi>pious,</hi> and <hi>charitable</hi> use of what he has, <hi>shall
of the Spirit reap life everlasting.</hi> Wherefore, <hi>let us not
be weary in well-doing; for in due season we shall reap, if
we faint not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many are the <hi>Promises</hi> of the like kind which we
meet with in other places of <hi>Holy Scripture:</hi> And from
all which it is obvious to conclude, that if we have
any regard either to our <hi>present Happiness,</hi> or to our
<hi>future Glory,</hi> there is nothing wherein we ought to be
more careful, than by our <hi>Charity</hi> to establish our selves
in both. For,</p>

               <p>What is it possible for any one to desire to make
him a <hi>happy</hi> man in <hi>this World,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> has not freely
promised to the <hi>merciful</hi> and <hi>liberal?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Would he secure his</hi> Riches? <hi>Would he confirm
the</hi> Enjoyment <hi>of them both to himself whilst he</hi> lives,
<hi>and</hi> deliver <hi>them down in</hi> peace <hi>to his</hi> posterity <hi>when he
comes to</hi> dye? <hi>This</hi> Charity <hi>has the promise of above
any thing besides:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. xxiii. 27.</note> He that giveth to the poor, <hi>says</hi> Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,

eye shall be blessed, for he giveth of his bread to the poor.
<hi>And holy</hi> David <hi>confirms the truth of this Remark

               <p>Nay, but would he do yet more? Would he even

Enjoyment of it? 'Tis a strange Assertion, but yet by
the Blessing and Promise of <hi>God,</hi> a very true one, that
by giving it thus away, he shall encrease it. <hi>There is,</hi>
says <hi>Solomon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. xi. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>that scattereth, and yet encreaseth.</hi> And
would you know who that is? He will tell you in the
next <hi>Verse:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">—25.</note> 
                  <hi>The liberal soul shall be made fat, and he that
watereth, shall be watered also himself.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Would he provide himself a security amidst all the</hi>
uncertain, <hi>and many times</hi> miserable Varieties <hi>of this
World? And be safe even in the midst of all its Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers?</hi>
Charity <hi>is the best defence, the surest preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
against all</hi> Calamities:<note place="margin">Psal. xli. i.</note> Blessed is the man, <hi>says</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
that considereth the poor and needy, the <hi>LORD</hi> will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
him in the time of trouble.<note place="margin">—2.</note> The <hi>LORD</hi> will preserve
him, and keep him alive, and he shall be blessed upon the
earth, and not deliver him into the will of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p>In short, would he be <hi>blessed</hi> in all things that <hi>he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
his hand unto,</hi> and have every thing prosper accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his hearts desire? It was the promise of God to
the <hi>Jews</hi> heretofore, and I see no reason why we should
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:102607:19"/>
not in proportion apply it to our selves now, that he
would deal with them, according as they did with other
men,<note place="margin">Deut. xv. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> xv. 7. <hi>If there be among you a poor man of one of
thy brethren within any of thy gates, in the land which the</hi>
LORD <hi>thy God giveth thee:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">—10.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou shalt not harden thy heart,
nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother—Thou shalt
surely give him;</hi> because <hi>that</hi> for this thing <hi>the</hi> LORD
<hi>thy God shall bless thee in all that thou</hi> puttest thine
hand <hi>unto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are some of the <hi>present Promises</hi> which God
has made to the <hi>Charitable man.</hi> I might to all this add
the severe <hi>Threatnings</hi> even of <hi>present Evils</hi> to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
Miser; to him who has no bowels of Mercy
towards any others, and therefore deserves no compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
himself either from <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Man.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job xx. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>He hath swallow'd
down Riches,</hi> says <hi>Job, and he shall vomit them up again;
God shall cast them out of his belly:</hi> and that for this very
reason,<note place="margin">—19.</note> 
                  <hi>ver. 19. Because he hath oppressed and forsaken the
poor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this is yet the least part of this <hi>Argument,</hi> and
therefore I will not insist any longer upon it. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the <hi>portion</hi> of the <hi>Cross,</hi> which every good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
must expect more or less to meet with in this
world, may often times make these <hi>present Promises</hi>
much less certain to us now, than they were to the <hi>Jews</hi>
heretofore. But the other part of the Consideration is
without Exception, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2dly, <hi>That if</hi> we be not weary in well doing, <hi>then
in</hi> due season, <hi>when the great day of Retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
comes,</hi> we shall <hi>infallibly</hi> reap, if we
faint not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:102607:19"/>
And here I shall presume, that no One will so far mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
the meaning of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in these words, as to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that this, or any other <hi>Vertue</hi> alone, will be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to our <hi>Eternal Salvation:</hi> So that if a man does but
<hi>give liberally to the poor,</hi> 'tis no great matter how he lives,
or what he does with the rest of his Estate. No, this is
by no means the meaning of this <hi>Promise. Charity</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a most excellent Vertue, and will go as far, it may
be farther towards the securing our <hi>Salvation,</hi> than any
One thing besides in the World.<note place="margin">1 Peter iv. 8.</note> St. <hi>Peter</hi> has told us,
that it shall <hi>cover the multitude of sins:</hi> that is, shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the forgiveness of them.<note place="margin">1 John iii. 19.</note> And St. <hi>John</hi> prescribes it
as the best means to <hi>assure our hearts before God:</hi> that
is, to enable us to appear with confidence before him
in Judgment. And a Greater than both has told us,
that if <hi>we give Alms of such things as we have,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke xi. 41.</note> 
                  <hi>all things
shall be clean unto us.</hi> But yet when all is done, neither
this, nor any other <hi>Vertue</hi> alone can save us. There
must be an <hi>Vniversal Holiness</hi> in all other respects
too,<note place="margin">Heb. xii. 14.</note> and <hi>without</hi> which <hi>no man shall ever see the</hi>
LORD.</p>
               <p>And yet perhaps even in this <hi>Case</hi> also, tho by our
neglect in other matters we should be so unhappy as to
come short of <hi>Heaven,</hi> our <hi>Charity</hi> nevertheless may not
lose its reward; but may serve to make us <hi>less miserable,</hi>
if not <hi>more glorious;</hi> to allay our <hi>Damnation,</hi> if not to
encrease our <hi>Reward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But not to pursue these Imaginations: That which the
<hi>Apostle</hi> here promises is plainly this; That if we be not
wanting to our selves, our <hi>Charity</hi> shall be sure to meet
with a proportionable <hi>recompence</hi> from <hi>God-Almighty:</hi>
and we shall <hi>reap</hi> among others, these Three great <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages</hi>
by it<note n="*" place="margin">Prov. x. 12. Dan. iv. 27. 1 Pet. iv. 8.</note>; <hi>First,</hi> That it shall prepare the way for
the more certain and easie <hi>forgiveness</hi> of our <hi>sins: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:102607:20"/>
It shall procure us a more large and comfortable
portion of <hi>Gods Grace,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts x. 4. 2 Cor. ix. 14. Hebr. vi. 10.</note> to enable us to discharge our
duty the better now: And <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. xix. 21. Luke xvi. 9. 2 Cor. ix. 6, 7. 1 Tim. vi. 19, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>If we faint not,</hi> but
persevere in this and all other parts of our <hi>duty,</hi> it shall
Crown us with a more <hi>exceeding weight of Glory here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</hi>
Whilst the sordid, covetous Miser, were it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for him otherwise to abound, in all the highest
perfection of <hi>Christian Piety,</hi> yet for want of this <hi>One
Vertue,</hi> shall lose his Reward, and be <hi>cast out,</hi> with the
<note n="†" place="margin">Mat. xxv. 25, 30.</note> 
                  <hi>unprofitable Servant,</hi> who <hi>hid his Talent,</hi> and made
no use of it, <hi>did</hi> no <hi>Good</hi> with it, <hi>into utter dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
where is weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of
Teeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what then remains but that having all these En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements
to stir us up to a warm and vigorous
discharge of this <hi>duty,</hi> we now suffer our selves to be
perswaded, in the words of our <hi>Saviour Christ,</hi> to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
our selves Bags which wax not old,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke xii 33.</note> 
                  <hi>a Treasure in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
that faileth not, where no Thief approacheth, neither
Moth corrupteth.</hi> Or as Himself elsewhere expresses it,
with more immediate reference to our last considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<note place="margin">Luke xvi. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>To make to our selves friends of the Mammon of
Vnrighteousness, that when we fail they may receive us
into Everlasting Habitations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet I cannot conclude without adding one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
more, and which I hope may, I am sure
should be of very Great weight with us.</p>
               <p>It has been one of the chiefest Reproaches which
those of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> have endeavoured to fix
upon our <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> that it has not only put a
stop to <hi>Charity;</hi> but has moreover cut off the very
Ground and Foundation of it; and all this only for
rejecting those <hi>superstitions</hi> by which they principally
have their Gain.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:102607:20"/>
How false this <hi>imputation</hi> is as to the latter part of
it, we have now pretty largely seen. <hi>God</hi> be thanked,
<hi>Christianity</hi> affords <hi>Motives</hi> and <hi>Engagements</hi> enough
to <hi>Charity,</hi> without running to any vain and superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
pretences for the support of it. He who believes
the singular Efficacy of this <hi>practise</hi> both by the <hi>promise</hi>
of <hi>God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. ix. 14.</note> and through the <hi>prayers</hi> of those whom He
relieves to obtain the <hi>forgiveness</hi> of his <hi>sins,</hi> and to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
his <hi>Soul</hi> from <hi>Eternal damnation,</hi> will need no <hi>Vision</hi>
of <hi>Purgatory</hi> to open his Heart to the <hi>Poor.</hi> He may
indeed turn his <hi>Charity</hi> another <hi>way;</hi> instead of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
his <hi>Money</hi> with the <hi>Priests</hi> for <hi>Masses</hi> and <hi>Prayers;</hi>
for <hi>Pardons</hi> and <hi>Indulgences;</hi> for <hi>Holy Trifles</hi> to <hi>prevent</hi>
or <hi>expiate Sins,</hi> He may bequeath it to the <hi>Poor</hi> which
is a great deal better. And if this be the <hi>Charity</hi>
which our <hi>Religion</hi> has put an end to, we shall neither
be afraid or ashamed to confess it.</p>
               <p>And for the <hi>former;</hi> It might easily be made appear,
that laying aside the <hi>Superstitions</hi> we but now menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd,
there has much more been done since the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi>
in works of <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>true Charity,</hi> than ever was
done in twice that time from the first <hi>rise</hi> of <hi>Popery</hi>
among us to its going off. And how much soever
some of late have thought fit to <hi>Magnifie</hi> the <hi>Piety</hi> of
<hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> yet upon these <hi>Principles</hi> we may
venture to say, that in this as well as all other Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
our own <hi>City</hi> do's exceed them.</p>
               <p>To run through a <hi>particular comparison</hi> in this point,
were both to abuse your Patience, and the Design of
this discourse. Let the Account of what has been
done in its <hi>publick Hospitals</hi> only this <hi>last Year</hi> serve as
a short but sufficient Evidence whereby to judge with
how little reason we are tax'd with a <hi>decay of Charity</hi>
amongst us.</p>

               <head>A True report, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>Such was the Effect of the <hi>last Years Piety:</hi> And
how much of all this has been <hi>wholly Established
since the Reformation;</hi> what vast <hi>additions</hi> have been
made to what was indeed <hi>begun before;</hi> how faithfully
these <hi>great Trusts</hi> have been, and are <hi>still administred;</hi>
and kept up not withstanding the mighty <hi>losses</hi> they
have sustain'd, and the other frequent <hi>misfortunes</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which they have fallen, is well known to most of
you in this <hi>Assembly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Could I to all this Add the summ of what in such
a doubtful, and discouraging Year as this, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to common Estimate has been, has nevertheless
been expended within this <hi>One City</hi> in more <hi>private
Acts</hi> of Mercy: What <hi>liberality</hi> has been shown in <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections</hi>
twice made for our <hi>Exiled Brethren,</hi> after two
before gather'd for our Neighbours of the <hi>French
Churches</hi> on the same occasion: Not to mention all other
Occurrences, from which no Day, scarce any Hour is
exempted; We should then have enough not only to
<hi>silence,</hi> but to <hi>shame</hi> the <hi>Cavils</hi> of our <hi>Enemies,</hi> and to
engage us to <hi>bless God,</hi> who has in some measure open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
our Hearts to the <hi>Cries of the Poor,</hi> and not suffer'd
them in vain to call upon us.</p>
               <p>But yet since this is the <hi>Reproach</hi> they would now
endeavour to tix upon us; let us be as ready by our
Practice to <hi>confute</hi> this, as we have been, with good
success, by our <hi>Arguments,</hi> to answer all their other
<hi>Objections</hi> against us.</p>
               <p>Let us shew them, that tho' our <hi>Religion</hi> will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
allow us <hi>to boast of</hi> our <hi>Good Works</hi> to <hi>Men,</hi> nor
to pretend to <hi>Merit</hi> by them of <hi>God;</hi> yet it teaches
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:102607:21"/>
us to he no less, nay in truth to be much more studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
than themselves in the performance of them.</p>
               <p>And the more to engage us to this <hi>Care,</hi> let us of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
represent to our selves the <hi>Great Motive</hi> which
St. <hi>Paul</hi> has here set before us, to stir us up to a free
and ready Discharge of this <hi>Great Duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us consider, that the <hi>Time</hi> is <hi>coming,</hi> when we
must give a strict account of our selves, and of all the
<hi>Abilities</hi> and <hi>Opportunities</hi> that we have had of <hi>Doing
Good,</hi> and <hi>what Vse</hi> we have made of them.</p>
               <p>That the Enquiry then will not so much be what
our <hi>Opinions</hi> or <hi>Persuasions</hi> were in such or such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted
<hi>Points</hi> of <hi>Christianity?</hi> To what <hi>Church</hi> we
have belong'd? or, How well we have determined the
many <hi>Questions</hi> that so fatally <hi>distract</hi> and <hi>divide</hi> mens
<hi>minds</hi> in <hi>matters</hi> of <hi>Religion?</hi> But rather, How <hi>well</hi>
we <hi>have lived?</hi> How <hi>charitable</hi> we have been to those
who have differ'd from us? and in particular, How
<hi>kind</hi> and <hi>bountiful</hi> to the <hi>Poor</hi> and <hi>Needy?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is what our <hi>Saviour</hi> assures us, in the Great Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
which he has left us of the <hi>day</hi> of <hi>Judgment;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. xxv.</note>
And with which, as being the <hi>noblest Argument</hi> that ever
