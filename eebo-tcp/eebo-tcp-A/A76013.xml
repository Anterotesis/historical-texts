            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I bleſſe the Lord, I never doubted of his preſence and ſucceſs in this undertaking, being ſo righteous a Cauſe; and had long ſince put into Gods determination, but upon advertiſements from friends in <hi>England,</hi> That if I could

continue here without engaging till the firſt of <hi>January,</hi> the work would be done without blood. I cannot but admire up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what Intelligence you ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of a ſecond Treaty: Indeed I was inforced to make uſe of ſuch an Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to remove the Commiſsioners from <hi>London,</hi> whom I cannot but blame for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding from their Inſtructions; but I hope they will give you a ſatisfactory ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Proceedings. Yet I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that I could not but reſent their carriage, having ſecured one of them for betraying the private inſtructions; of which I doubt not but you have bin fully informed.</p>
            <p>My laſt anſwer to the Lord <hi>Lambert,</hi> who ſent ſeveral Meſſengers to invite mee to a ſecond Treaty, was, T hat I could not treat without authority from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsioners for the government of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:168756:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 20 -->
and to that end deſired a Paſſe for the ſame Meſſengers to go to <hi>Portſmouth</hi> to receive their Commands and Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; who was returned back with this anſwer from <hi>Lambert</hi> and the Councel of Officers, That they could not conſent thereunto: and ſince that, I have not heard from them.</p>
            <p>I have your Army (I bleſſe God) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the River <hi>Tweed,</hi> within three houres ready to be drawn together, and they are very cheerfull and unanimous, willing to endure any hardſhip for your Service.</p>
            <p>The laſt night Capt. <hi>Campbelt</hi> came expreſs from <hi>Ireland,</hi> giving a full account of their affection to the Parliament, and of the late Tranſactions there; That they had ſeized <hi>Dublin</hi> Caſtle, and ſecured <hi>Jones</hi> and others, with a Declaration to ſtand by and own your Authority: for which (on this inſtant) wee kept a day of Thankſgiving. They writ alſo to the

               <hi>Iriſh</hi> Brigade in <hi>England,</hi> which I diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them. Sir <hi>Hardreſſe Waller</hi> gives mee an account, that all the Forces and Garriſons in <hi>Ireland</hi> had declared for you.</p>
            <p>This is ſuch a mercy, that I hope the Lord will make us ſenſible of, and careful to improve. They required my opinion, as to managing of the Affairs of the Army, which in ſuch an urgent neceſsity I preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to give. I have diſpoſed of moſt of the vacant Commands in <hi>Scotland</hi> to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry honeſt men, who are ready to die for your Service, or to disband at your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. And before your Letter came to hand, I had diſpoſed of Col. <hi>Saunders</hi> and Major <hi>Bartons</hi> Commands, the Lord <hi>Lamb<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

I believe that you never doubted of my perſevering in thoſe good Principles I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared for, and that I ſhould comfortably (if the Lord had pleaſed to frown upon us) have ſuffered in this moſt Righteous undertaking. I have made ready to March, but am unwilling to hazzard your Juſtice and Authority upon a Fight, when it may be done with more ſecurity. I ſhall attend your further Command, and deſire the Lord to bleſſe your Forces and Counſels, and to reſtore you in your juſt
