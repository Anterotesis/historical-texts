            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the same <hi>Bernard</hi> hath it in his first Sermon;
which of all other Festivals is more solemnly
and more devoutly to be observed by us, for
that it is more proper and peculiar to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
than to any other. <hi>Nam caeteras quidem

the Saints are common to us with many other
Churches; <hi>Haec verò sic nobis est propria, ut

but the solemnity of this day is so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
to the Church and state of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
that I know not any Country in the
world that hath so great cause to keepe it Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-day,
as we of this Nation have. The <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites,</hi>
in memory of their deliverance out of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> from the bondage of <hi>Pharoah</hi> King
of <hi>Egypt,</hi> were to keepe a solemne Holy-day.
And <hi>Moses</hi> gives them a memento to thinke
on that day, <hi>Remember this day in the which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:2824:6"/>
yee came out of Egypt, Exod.</hi> 13 3. And the
<hi>Iewes</hi> afterward, in memory of their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
from the malice and wrath of wicked <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
who had appointed them all to the
slaughter, kept a Holy-day with feasting and
much joy, yea, and they promised that the
dayes of that anniversary solemnity, called the
dayes of Purim, <hi>should bee remembred and
kept throughout every generation. and every
family, and every Province, and every City,
even those dayes of Purim should not faile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Iewes, and the memoriall of them
should not perish from their seed, Hest.</hi> 9. 28.
Beloved, this dayes deliverance, which Gods
right hand hath wrought for this Land, is
much like to the delivery of <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;</hi>
for <hi>Rome</hi> is <hi>Egypt</hi> mystically, and so
it is called in the Revelation, and we were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
from the bondage of <hi>Rome</hi> this day,
and wee were delivered from the tyranny of
the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> which yoke some of our
friends would have put upon our neckes this
day, if they could have had their will; and
shall we not then remember this day, wherin
we came out of <hi>Egypt?</hi> This dayes delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
is much like the deliverance of the <hi>Iewes</hi>
from the wicked devise of <hi>Haman,</hi> the <hi>Iewes</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:2824:7"/>
Adversary. For was there not powder prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to blow us up? was there not Fire and
Faggot provided to burne us up? were wee
not all of us as sheep appointed to the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
and shall not then this day bee remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred?
shall we suffer the memoriall of it to
perish from us or our seed for ever? Oh no,
<hi>The Lord hath so done his marvelous workes</hi>
as upon this day, <hi>that they ought to be had in
everlasting remembrance. This is the day
which the Lord hath made, we will rejoyce
and be glad in it, Psal.</hi> 118. This is a day of
the Lords owne making; not as though the
Lord did not make all the other dayes as well
as this. Yes, (to speake with <hi>Cassiodore) Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit
omnes, sed hanc singulariter,</hi> he hath made
all the dayes in the yeere, and one day telleth
to another the goodnesse of God their Maker;
but he hath made this after a singular manner,
because this day makes report of a singular fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the Lord hath wrought for us upon it;
<hi>fecit totos, sed non tales,</hi> he hath made all the
other dayes, but he hath not made them such

            <p>Suppose the King and Queene with all the
Nobles, Bishops and Iudges were assembled
together in the house of Parliament to consult
and deliberate touching the weighty affaires
of this Kingdome, as indeed it was appointed.
And suppose then under this house in a Vault
there were laid thirty Barrels and foure Hogs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads
of Gunpowder with Faggots and iron
Barres upon them, as there were indeed. But
now goe on, and imagine the traine to be laid
the powder fired, the terrible blow given, and
on a sudden imagine the whole building to
cracke asunder, the plankes all on a flame, the
beams and stones flying in the ayre, the joynts
and members of all the worthies of our Land,
rent and torne and scattered one from another
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2824:10"/>
the walls of the streete bedawbed with mens
braines, the waies bedewed with mens blood,
scarcely so much as one bone left of a great
many for buriall. Then imagine you see the
Church adjoyning as with an earthquake de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
the Monuments of the dead defaced,
the Hall of Iustice demolished, the Records
and Charters of the Kingdome perished, the
whole circuit thereabouts turned into smoake
and rubbish. Then imagine you see the City
in an uprore, the Country in perplexity, the
Papists every where up in armes, the <hi>Spaniard</hi>
with his forces landing upon your coasts rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to joyne with them, your houses rifled,
your goods spoyled, your Maidens ravished,
your Wives abused, your Children slaughte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
Gods Temple profaned, the Kings au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
debased, the Popes power advanced,
the pure preaching of the Word abolished,
the Idolatrous superstition of the Masse esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished.
Truely all these consequents, and
farre worse, if I were able to expresse them,
would have followed upon that vile and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent
treason, if it had taken effect. The
face of all things would have been quite alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:2824:10"/>
               <hi>Rome</hi> had had but one necke, that hee might

both of Church and Common-wealth, the
glory of this famous and flourishing King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
(the hope of posterity) was laid as it
were upon the block. The instrument of death
was lifted up by the damned instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the
Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and was ready to give us all
the mortall stroke, or, as they call'd it, the
deadly blow; had not the Angell of GOD
stepped in in the very nicke; had not our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
God by his most miraculous and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
providence put to his helping hand and
awarded the blow, and turned the edge of the
Axe upon the necke of our Adversaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
The net was spread, and the snare was
laid, and the pit was digged, and the Hunters
were gone out to drive us into their gins, and
they had the game faire before them; but the
net was broken by the finger of God, and the
snare was discovered by the eye of God, and
the pit that they had digged for us, they fell
into it themselves, and were taken with their

which is <hi>deplored,</hi> and in her <hi>prosperity,</hi>

passions and passages which respect the <hi>ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi>
of the Church. where yee have first an
<hi>imprecation</hi> of evill: 2. An <hi>intermination</hi> of
judgement. The imprecation in this, the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in the next. In the <hi>imprecation</hi> (which
wee have chosen for our theme) wee are to
consider these 2. things. 1. How the Psalmist
in the person of Gods seruants <hi>devoves</hi> the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
of the Church to destruction; and 2.
how he <hi>describes</hi> and most lively depaints out

they are devoved: 2. How they are described.</p>
            <p>For the first, hee prayes God to remember
them. <hi>Remember the Children of Edom, O

               <note place="margin">Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio.</note> Remember them? that is, when thou

malice with extreame punishment, and for
their spite against the Church, let them feel the

is true, the imprecations used by the Saints in
Scripture against wicked men are very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
and fearefull, but wee are not to thinke
notwithstanding, that either they transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
herein against the rule of charity, or sinned
against the precep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of Christ Iesus. For, first,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
in all these imprecations they doe not so much
respect <hi>themselves</hi> and their owne preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as the <hi>glory of God</hi> and the conservation
thereof; the quarrel that they have with these
men is not private but publike; neither doe
they curse them because they are <hi>their</hi> enemies,
but because they are <hi>Gods</hi> enemies, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
of GODS Church. Secondly, in all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
these imprecations the Saints of GOD are
not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, such as take delight in
other mens destruction, and rejoyce themselves
in seeing evill befall other men; for they doe
not wish these judgements to befall upon their
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:2824:13"/>
enemies out of any spite or spleene or thirsty
desire of revenge, but because they understand
by this meanes the glory of GODS Iustice
is to be made manifest before the faces of the
children of men. God will have his glory
even of sinners; either in their <hi>salvation,</hi> if
they <hi>turne</hi> unto him; or in their <hi>confusion,</hi> if
they continue <hi>obstinate.</hi> In the <hi>salvation</hi> of

glory, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the confusion of sinners the glory
reflects upon Gods justice. It is true, GOD
delighteth not in the death of any sinner; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will hee have any of his Saints to take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in the destruction of any wicked man:
but God desireth the glory of his justice to
be manifest, and the Saints of God may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
that the glory of GODS justice may be
made manifest, though it be by the death and
destruction of wretched and unrepentant sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, in all these imprecations wee
are not to thinke that the Saints of God were
carried away with the fire and fury of some
preposterous zeale; but led and directed by
the discerning prudence of a propheticall spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
did curse and devove not every enemy,
but those whom they knew GOD had set
a marke upon, as upon <hi>Caine,</hi> and utterly
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:2824:13"/>
rejected from the society and company of his
Elect Children. Lastly, wee must know, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> hath observed, that these im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations
are not onely <hi>prayers</hi> but <hi>prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi>
being indeed prophetical denuntiations of
those fearefull judgements which should cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
overtake and overthrow all the enemies
of God and his Church without repentance;
and therefore in all these imprecations, as the
affection is not at all distempered, so neither is
there any violation of patience, any branch of
charity, any neglect of the precept of Christ.</p>
            <p>Now for the second branch of the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
what is lawfull for us to doe in this case,<note place="margin">Fabritius</note>
whether wee may imitate the Saints in this, I
doubt not but that we may, if we admit these
limitations, and take a few distinctions along
with ush: 1. Wee must diligently distinguish
betwixt the <hi>cause</hi> and the <hi>person</hi> that maintains <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
the cause. As touching the <hi>cause,</hi> if it be an <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill</hi>
cause, wee may condemne it and lawfully
pray against it, whatsoever the persons be that
maintain it. It is cleere by the example of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
who prayed against the wicked counsell
of <hi>Achitophel, 2. Sam.</hi> 15. 31. And by the
example of the blessed <hi>Apostles,</hi> who prayed
against the plots and practices of <hi>Herod,</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:2824:14"/>
and <hi>Pilate</hi> and the Pharisees to stop the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of the Gospell, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 29. As touching
the <hi>persons</hi> of our enemies, wee are to note
this distinction: Some are <hi>private</hi> enemies,
some are <hi>publike.</hi> If they bee private enemies
onely, we must distinguish betwixt their <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
and their <hi>sinne:</hi> Their <hi>sinne</hi> we may pray
against; <hi>Yea, I will pray yet against their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse;</hi>
but their <hi>nature,</hi> we must not wish

our private enemy wee may hate and pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst,
but for his nature, the man himselfe,
we must be so farre from hating him, that we
must love him, and we must be so farre from
wishing him evill, that we must bee ready to
doe him all the good we can, as our <hi>Saviour</hi>
commanded in his Sermon upon the Mount,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 44. and the blessed Apostle injoyneth
<hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 14. 20. These are our <hi>private</hi> ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:2824:14"/>
But if our enemies be <hi>publike,</hi> that is, if
they be not onely <hi>our enemies,</hi> but the <hi>enemies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
of God</hi> and his Church, the enemies of the truth
of God, and of the Religion in the Church,
then wee may curse them in the name of the
Lord, and pray against them, according to the
example of the Saints of God, but yet I pray
you here take this Proviso. Those publike e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
of GOD and the Church are of two

that the Text is principally meant of the <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi>

or the Church of the Iewes then, in
their sore captivity; for to those dayes this
Psalme hath reference: But yet, as I take it, it reacheth farther, and may very fitly be
applyed even to all such as bandy themselves
against the Church of God in any age, or at
any time whatsoever. So that upon this rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning,

1. By the <hi>naturall</hi> course of generation,

which begat us. 2. By the grace of <hi>spirituall</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:2824:16"/>
adoption, so the Elect and servants of GOD
are called the Children of God. 3. By the
likenesse of <hi>morall</hi> imitation, and that two
wayes, either in <hi>good,</hi> or in <hi>evill;</hi> in <hi>good,</hi> so
the <hi>faithfull</hi> are said to be the <hi>Children</hi> of

witnesses in his <hi>Antilogia,</hi> written against
<hi>Eudaemon Iohannes,</hi> the Grecian Bishop. The
<pb facs="tcp:2824:17"/>
Religion of Popery, as it is most agreeable to
the corrupt nature of man, so I verily thinke,
there is not any religion in the world, except it
be Mahometisme, the yonger sister to Papisme
that gives more way to the flesh, and opens 2
greater gap to sensuality and carnality and all
manner of licentiousnesse, than the Doctrine of
Popery doth, as it is taught in these dayes.
Witnesse first, their <hi>doctrine of dispensations,</hi>
whereby they teach that the Pope hath power
to dispence with the Word of God,<note place="margin">D D. Bear</note> and with
every Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mandement of the Law; and not only
with the Law, but with the Gospell too, and
the Epistles of S. <hi>Paul.</hi> Now to what horrible
loosenesse and lewdnesse of life doth this tend!
and what sinne is there, be it never so hainous,
which a carnall man will not be encouraged to
commit by this licentious doctrine? incest, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domy,
adultery, perjury, rebellion, all these
have bin dispensed with by the Popes holines;
there are such evident and apparent instancesto
prove this, that it cannot be denied. Witnesse
2. their <hi>doctrine of Pardons</hi> and indulgences,
which are impudent and shameles. Their <hi>taxa
poenitentaria Apostolica,</hi> whereby impurity is
granted to every sinner and pardon for every
sin, be it never so grievous, so be that the party
payeth according to the rate of absolution
<pb facs="tcp:2824:18"/>
hee is taxed upon that score, shall stand as a
sufficient witnesse against them in this point.
Now is not this a doctrine of licentiousnesse?
when they make sinne but a money-matter,
nay more, when for bowing the head, or say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over a short prayer, visiting a Church,
creeping to a crosse, wearing a crucifixe, and
the like, pardon may be purchased for sinnes
without number, and that for yeeres without
number. Witnesse thirdly, their <hi>doctrine of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular
confession,</hi> the practice whereof what
a gap to uncleannesse it opened, <hi>Nectarius</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Constantinople</hi> saw well, when he ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
it out of his Church, as the <hi>Tripartite</hi>
story sheweth, and <hi>Agrippa</hi> likewise testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
when hee cals it <hi>genus quoddam lenocinii,</hi>
a Bawd to uncleannesse; for that Priests and
Friers, having hereby under pretence of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
free accesse unto women, it falleth out
many times that whose soules they should
gaine to God, their bodies they do sacrifice to
the divell. Witnesse fourthly, their <hi>doctrine of
constrained chastity</hi> and prohibiting of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls the <hi>doctrine of
of Divels. Paphnutius</hi> a good Bishop saw
well what cause of horrible impurity and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
it was like to be, and therefore hee
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:2824:18"/>
very stoutly opposed the decree of constrained
single life made in the <hi>Nicene Councell,</hi> and
all the Fathers in that Councell, pondring his
reasons, were willing to forgoe their owne
and yeeld to his judgement, and so revoked the
decree, as is plaine by the story. But <hi>Gregori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
Magnus</hi> had a more full insight into this
matter, when the heads of more than 6000.
Infants were raked out of a pond before his
face, which made him confesse his errour in
tying Priests to a single life, and commend the
Apostles advice, <hi>It is better to marry than to
burne;</hi> and hee added moreover, <hi>It is better
to marry than to give occasion to such abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
murther.</hi> Witnesse fifthly, their <hi>doctrine
of veniall sins,</hi> giving manifest occasion of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to the professors thereof. It is too plain
it needs no proving. Witnesse sixthly, their <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of implicit faith and ignorance,</hi> which
they call the mother of devotion, and debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the people from reading the holy
Word of God. This cannot choose but bee
occasion of great licentiousnesse; for as <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi>

of the Scriptures hath bred heresies,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:2824:19"/>
brought in corruption of life, and turned all
things up side downe. What should I tell
you of <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe, the holy mother of these
holy doctrines? In what place of the world
is there more impiety, cruelty, atheisme, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity,
poysoning, treachery, and all manner
of villany reigning, than in <hi>Rome</hi> under his
Holinesse his nose? Did not <hi>Mantuan</hi> one of
their Poets say of old, <hi>Vrbs est jam tota lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panar?</hi>
Did not the smell of <hi>Romes</hi> filthinesse

that in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> where

that was broke up, see how <hi>Claud. Espen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caeus</hi>

seen it, none can deny but he which hath not seen
it.</hi> The Romanists quarrel with us, &amp; complain
much against the profanenes and uncleannesse
of our Religion. But if the Whore of Babylon
and her adherents had not brazen fore-heads,
they would for shame cease to accuse us, and
assume the aspersion upon themselves, being
farre more guilty, and their Religion directly
tending thereunto, as I trust I have sufficiently

Papists,</hi> they are a company of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious,
bloody, cruell hearted people against
Gods servants.</p>
            <p>First, for the <hi>men of this world,</hi> how hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted
and cruelly fierce they have beene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the children of the Church, the stories
of all ages doe most sufficiently witnesse; but
especially the holy Scriptures; wherein by
certaine resemblances of them to the most
fierce and revengefull beaits and creatures that
are, the holy Ghost would not obscurely lay
open the malice and wrathfull cruelty of these
men. Sometime they are called Bulls, <hi>Many
young Buls are come about mee, fat Bulls of

came upon mee with open mouth, as it had
beene a ramping and a roaring Lion;</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time

<hi>Now thy habitation is among Scorpions.</hi>
All these are wrathfull, fierce, revengefull, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell
creatures. Such are the wicked of the world
what should I tell you of the primitive time,
and that firy tryall of Gods Saints under the
most barbarous and bloody persecutions?
what rewards were proposed to them that
could invent and devise the most uncouth and
cruell torments? and what tortures could ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man or divell devise which were not put
upon the faithfull Christians, who then in a
manner dyed all most glorious witnesses of
the truth, which they sealed with their blood.
<hi>Some of them were racked, some were tryed by
mockings and scourgings, by bond and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment;
they were stoned, they were hewen a-sunder, they were slaine with the sword, &amp;c.
Heb. 11. 35. &amp;c.</hi> There you have even a briefe
map of these torments, which the miscreants
of the world powred like haile-shot on the
heads of Gods servants. Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> hath
inlarged the bed-roll of these tortures, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the persecution under <hi>Nero,</hi> that
wretched blood-hound, who as hee was fed
with sops dipt in blood, being a child: so
<pb facs="tcp:2824:21"/>
when hee became a man hee tooke a delight
to wash his hands and imbrue his heart in
the blood of GODS Saints. So cruell a
wretch was hee, and so witty in cruelties,
that it was the opinion of divers Christians
then living, that <hi>Nero</hi> was <hi>that Antichrist,</hi>
as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> relates, <hi>lib. 20. de ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitat.
Dei, cap. 19.</hi> I cannot stand upon all
particulars. Let it be enough that <hi>Tacitus</hi>
writes of him, how that <hi>Quaesitissimis poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis

Christians with most exquisite and strangely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devised
torments.</p>
            <p>That Author relates how that wretched
Emperour would have Christians covered
and sowed up in Beares skinnes, and the skins
of other wilde beasts, and so expose them to
be worried and eaten up of fierce and cruell
Dogges. All the foure Elements are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of his cruelty; for the <hi>earth,</hi> hee made
great deepe pits and holes in the earth, and
would throw them downe head-long to
perish there; for the <hi>water,</hi> hee made di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers

Birds of the ayre; for the fire, hee made divers
be tied to the stake, and tumbled others bound
into the fire to burne to ashes; not onely so,
but hee was wont to take a great number of

them, and so set them on fire <hi>in u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

off all humanity, but rather monsters of men
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:2824:22"/>
and incarnate divels. I must referre you to the
stories.</p>
            <p>But you may say these were <hi>Pagans,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
enemies to Christ and Christianity,
and therefore no wonder, if they maligned
Gods Children, and drave them from City to
City, and hated them extremely, and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
them even unto death; but wee hope
there are none that call themselves <hi>Christians</hi>
who are guilty of so great cruelty as you speak
of: Yes, Beloved, I say it, and I will say it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
that the <hi>Popish faction</hi> are as guilty of
this cruelty against GODS Church, as the
very Pagans were, and that <hi>Popish Rome</hi> is as
thirsty of blood as ever <hi>Heat henish Rome</hi>
was, and therefore in the <hi>Revelation</hi> shee is
called that <hi>Scarlet whore</hi> which hath made
her selfe drunke with the <hi>blood</hi> of GODS
Saints.</p>
            <p>Because this matter will lye hard upon the
Papists, among whom I verily think there are
many honest men, that I may not doe them
wrong, nor my speech wrongly interpreted,
I pray you observe with me this distinction.
There is great difference betwixt these two,
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi>
Those worthies and men of renowne, whom
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2824:23"/>
God stirred up to be reformers of the Church
abused by Popelings, wee had them all from
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and I doubt not but
that God, as in every age from Christs time
hath had, so hee hath at this day like wise a
true Church even in <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe, which gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
under the tyranny of the Man of sinne,

GOD by prayer to make a purgation of his
Church. Wee speake not of these, but wee

consisting of the Pope and his Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
and the rest of his shavelings, and profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
votaries, which worship the Beast, and
have taken the mark of the Beast in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads.
These I call the <hi>Popish faction,</hi> and
these I can prove to be as deepely stained with
the blood of the children of God, as ever hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish
Rome was. They call themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed

            <p>If you desire any reasons of this conclusion
why the wicked doe thus joyne together so

may take notice briefly, if you will, of these
three: 1. <hi>Is</hi> because they are swayed with one
head, that is, the divell; and that makes them
so joyntly conspire in evill. For as Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
worketh unity and unanimity in good
things in the children of the church, so there
is the like contrary working by the divell in
the children of disobedience. Their nature <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
is the same all dre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

3. They know well enough that if they
should be divided they were not able to stand,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>

consent and unity forsooth a note of the true
Church of CHRIST. To which I could say
much, but for this time I will say but one
thing with Saint <hi>Augustine, Vt est ecclesia
Dei una, si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

is unity in the Church of Christ, so there is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in the church of Antichrist; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I say that unity barely and absolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
without the truth of doctrine cannot
be a right distinctive note and infallible mark
of the Church. For what greater agreement
and consent is there than among theeves and
robbers? <hi>Come,</hi> say they, <hi>cast in thy lot among

So likewise among the Turks &amp; Mahometans
there is great consent and agreement insomuch
that their sect and profession is by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> far and
neere propagated; and yet it will not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
follow that Mahometisme is the true
Church. No more will the Papists plea hold,
that because there is great unity and consent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them (although I am able to shew the
contrary) yet suppose it were so, I say, their
plea will not hold that they are the true church
because of their unity; if I may call it proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unity and not rather a conspiracy. For (as
