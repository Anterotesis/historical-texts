            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LETTER From the SPEAKER OF The House of Commons, TO THE Gentry, Freeholders, and Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the County of YORKSHIRE, In Answer to their Protestation.</head>
            <p>MY Lords and Gentlemen, I am commanded by the House to let you know, that it is a very great satisfaction and contentment to this House, to finde the Affections and Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of your County, so worthily and seasonably
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63940:3"/>
expressed, and with so much wisdom and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, as they have observed in this your Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion now presented unto them: Upon which, this House doth set a much higher rate and value in respect of the many subtile practices of the Malignant party in your County, both to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet the peace of the whole Kingdom, and to oppose the just proceedings of this House, and to beget, if it had been possible, a contrary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of you, from which you have now so fully vindicated your selves, and the most considerable part of that County.</p>
            <p>Nor can we but observe, that at this time, when the Protestant Religion, and Fundamentall Laws of the Kingdom, and Liberty of the Subjects, are so much invaded, as appeareth by that unheard of prevalencie of wicked Councell, which hath ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to that height, as to procure both Houses of Parliament to be proclaimed Traytours (a thing never before attempted, no not in the worst times) you do with so much zeal and courage of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer your selves to support your King, your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and Liberty; all which will be preserved by your faithfull adherence to this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And besides all these, the House cannot but take notice of your wisdom and fidelity, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63940:3"/>
your detestation of those lawlesse Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultations and Resolutions, at the last Assizes at York, where Propositions were made for the raising Forces both of Horse and Foot in that County, the levying of money for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of them, together with the taking away the arms of the peaceable and best affected Subjects; all which was endeavoured to be strengthened by the bold, and Illegall attempts of the Grand-Jury, who at that time did lay aside all presidents of Love and Justice, in such presentments as were at that time by them made; which matter this House will in due time take into serious consideration.</p>
            <p>For your Resolution to withstand all these so Illegall proceedings, the House hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to return you their most hearty thanks, and to let you know, that this House doth esteem your Affections herein, as the most lively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations of your loyalty to His most Sacred Majestie, and infallible symptomes of your fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to the Parliament, the onely means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the felicity of the English Nation.</p>
            <p>Lastly, this House hath commanded me to let you know, that they do assent to your desire of publishing this your Protestation in all Parish churches, Markets &amp; Fairs within the county, the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63940:4"/>
same being as they conceive, a matter so much tending to the preservtion of the peace, not onely within your County, but likewise within the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall parts of the whole Kingdom. And thus I bid you heartily farewell, and rest</p>
