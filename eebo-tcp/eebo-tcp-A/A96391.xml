            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To deliver my particular opinion, touching the Originall, and the various, and diſguiſed wayes, of advancing your unhappie Iarres, cannot be compriſed within the narrow limits of an Epiſtle: you ſee the <hi>Scots</hi> have made a volume of theirs, and I recommend it to you as a peece worth your reading, and whence (I beleeve) your owne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ngenuity will be able to gather, more ſatisfaction in theſe particulars then I ſhall ever bee able out of my poore obſervations to acquaint you with. For though it was the buſineſſe of another Kingdome, and is now happily compoſed, and may therefore ſeeme either not to concerne <hi>England</hi> at all, or at leaſt not at this time, yet if you paralell the paſſages there, with thoſe that have happened with you ſome yeares paſt, and eſpecially ſince your <hi>Parliament</hi> beganne, you will eaſily beleeve, that if not one man, yet men of the ſame mind, laid the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chavillian ground work of both your diſturbances, and how many other things ſoever have in ſhew bin offered as happy meanes to maintaine <hi>Monarchy</hi> and <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> yet there were two other whites onely ſhot at, the ſilencing of the <hi>Lawes,</hi> and the alteration of the <hi>Religion</hi> in both Kingdomes. The maine block in the way to hinder theſe deſignes, we ſay is your fixed <hi>Parliament,</hi> and are therefore perſwaded, that what ever elſe may be pretended, yet the drift of the plot at preſent on foot is this, to cauſe that great Aſſembly by little and little of it ſelfe, to languiſh unto that death, unto which by violence its enemies is not yet able to bring it, and therein to make good the Proverb, to doe that by the Fox which is not feaſable by the Lyon. For my owne ſence of the buſineſſe thus much in ſhort, The ambitious <hi>Clergie</hi> will (never willingly) hearken to any alteration, (for the better) much leſſe to a perfect Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Church, and in this the <hi>Papiſt</hi> and Libertine will certainely joyne hands with them: The Royaliſt will hinder (in what hee may) the pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And for the fooliſh neutrall, that hopes to have his throat laſt cut, it is likely, he is not an inconſiderable part of the Kingdome, ſo that now if you can conceive that the remainder is a ſtronger and as reſolute a party as theſe, there is good hopes of a good Concluſion, elſe without the omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent hand of Heaven miraculouſly aſſiſting, I feare that a ſhort lived man may live to heare, that the bravery of the renowned <hi>Engliſh</hi> walkes hand in hand with the ſordid vaſſalage, of the French and Spaniſh Nations; And that the Language of your <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and <hi>Leges, &amp; conſuetudinis Regni</hi> bee tranſlated into
