            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAving ſeen a Paper of <hi>Hugh Derboróugh</hi>'s, which was read by <hi>Sam Jenings</hi> at their laſt Quarterly Meeting at <hi>Philadelphiá,</hi> and approved by the Meeting, and he received &amp; owned as one of their Church Members, I found it convenient to ſay ſomething in Anſwer to it, he moſt falſly and maliciouſly accuſing me in ſome things, and alſo diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manifeſtly his and his Brethren's Ignorance, Unbelief and Hypocriſie, with whom he hath joyned himſelf.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>He was deceived in me, and enſnared by me, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch Chárges, &amp;c. as if there were ſuch as did divide Chriſt, &amp; not preach Faith in the Man Chriſt Jeſus, nor own the Man Chriſt Jeſus as Mediator in Heaven, but the Grace of God within only; and ſuch like Charges, as that they did not own the Reſurrection of the Body, and the Coming again and glorious Appearance of that heavenly Man Chriſt Jeſus, to judge the quick and the dead at the great Day of Judgment.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That ſuch Charges were true, I have many Witneſſes, that may be produced in due time, to diſcover this <hi>Hugh Derborough</hi> to be a Lyar and falſe Accuſer, who hath writ Lyes againſt his own Conſcience and Knowledge; for does not <hi>H. D.</hi> know that we have ſufficient proof, that <hi>Tho.

to the Meeting of Miniſtring Friends at <hi>Burlington,</hi> where <hi>Tho. Fitzwater</hi> himſelf was preſent, and did not deny it, nor they call him to an Accounot for it: And was not <hi>Hugh Derborough</hi> at the Monthly Meeting where <hi>W. Stockdale</hi> openly renewed and confirmed his former Charge, <hi>viz. That</hi> G. K. <hi>preached Two Chriſts, becauſe he preached Faith in Chriſt within &amp; Chriſt without?</hi> beſide, the pretended Judgment given forth concerning <hi>W. S.</hi> ſays the ſame: And the Judgment given forth by their Monthly Meeting, (which is alſo in print) clearing <hi>T. Fitzwater</hi> for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing me, <hi>That the Light within was not ſufficient without ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what elſe,</hi> that ſomething elſe being the Man Chriſt Jeſus, in whom all Fullneſs of Light, Grace and Truth is lodged, and out of whom all true Believers receive a daily ſupply &amp; increaſe of Grace; and he may remember what work we had at a Mo. Meeting a little before, where it was affirmed, <hi>That they knew but one Principle owned by Friends, and that was the Light within,</hi> which I refuted both from Scripture and Friends Books; then <hi>T. Lloyd</hi> ſaid, <hi>There was but one Fundamental Principle, which was the Light within;</hi> which alſo I denyed. From this it is evident, that they exclude the Man Chriſt Jeſus from having any part in our Salvation placing it wholly &amp; only upon the Light within; and this <hi>H. D.</hi> has heard <hi>John Delavall</hi> publickly accuſe me of <hi>Hereſie,</hi> for ſaying, <hi>The Light within is not ſufficient without ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe;</hi> yea, and H D. himſelf hath renewed this in his Paper againſt me. which he calleth, <hi>The Myſtery of Iniquity diſcovered by the Spirit of Truth;</hi> but his Paper is the fruit of the Myſtery of Iniquity, that ruleth in his heart, who is acted by a Lying Spirit. Now that ſome approved among them <hi>deny the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restion of the Body after Death, and Chriſt's Coming to Judgment without us at the great Day, &amp;c.</hi> we can ſufficiently prove; and its in vain for H. D. to tell us theſe are falſe Charges, while their Preachers are found preaching againſt theſe things, and the hearers generally arguing and contending with us againſt them; <hi>A. Jenings,</hi> a Preacher among them, has been heard, not only by me, but divers others, to deny, <hi>That any thing of</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:95826:2"/>
               <hi>this Body riſeth after Death:</hi> And <hi>Henry Willis,</hi> one of the 28 (now 27) falſe Judges, told me, <hi>That the only cauſe why he ſet his hand to that Paper, was, becauſe I had affirmed, Chriſt would come again without us at the great Day of Judgment, to judge the quick and the dead;</hi> And <hi>W. Southyby</hi>'s Letter, and <hi>J. Humphery</hi>'s Letter, and <hi>Paul Saunders</hi> Letter to me, giving an Account of <hi>William Southyby &amp; M. Hodgskins</hi> their Unbelief in theſe principal things of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> are ſufficient proof, and which Letters, with other Inſtances and Proofs, may in due time be made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, mean time, take one Sentence of <hi>J. Humphery</hi>'s Letter, which is this, <hi>I am grieved to hear ſome ſay, They expect to be Iuſtifyed by that Blood that was Shed at Ieruſalem.</hi> To which Blaſphemous ſentence I ſhall not make any Reply at preſent, but let all impartial Readers judge of it: I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of it in private to <hi>John Humphry</hi> himſelf, to ſeveral of his Brethren, to their Quarterly Meeting to which he belongs, and to their publick Meeting, ſeveral moneths ſince, and yet no calling him to account, but of late he hath writ his ſecond Letter, confirming and juſtifying his former. And therefore <hi>Hugh Derborough</hi> falſly accuſeth me, in ſaying, <hi>I have deceived him;</hi> for its the Lying Spirit in himſelf, &amp; them he now owns to be his Brethren, which have deceived him.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2dly,</hi> To his accuſing me of <hi>Extream Heat and Paſſion, when little occaſion was given me, if any, but the clearing themſelves of theſe Aſperſions caſt upon them, calling of them Hypocrites, abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Hypocrites, bidding them Cut him in pieces, Chop him, Fry him, with many more unſavoury words, which</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>appeared to him indeed, to be but Bryars and Thornes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is another Evidence of his great Hypocriſie and Lying Spirit, as well as of his groſs Prejudice and Partiality, Enmity and Malice: I called none Hypocrites or abominable Hypocrites, but ſuch whom I can well prove to be ſuch: And did not Chriſt call them <hi>Hypocrites, Serpents, Generation of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, &amp;c.</hi> who had diſcovered themſelves to be ſuch: and the Apoſtles called ſuch <hi>Hypocrites and deceitful Workers, &amp;c.</hi> How
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95826:3"/>
then is this Bryars and Thorns in me, when thoſe I ſo called were ſuch? Have not alſo our Friends called their Oppoſers <hi>Hypocrites</hi> (who were ſuch) yea, and much harder Names than ever I did to any of them, as <hi>Dead Beaſt, dark Sot, Incarnate Devils, Wolves, Dogs, &amp;c.</hi> But what ſays <hi>Hugh Derborough</hi> to his Brother <hi>Sam. Jenings,</hi> who, at their laſt Quarterly Meeting, (being the 6 of the 1ſt Month) called one of his Fellow Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, <hi>Ignorant, Idiot,</hi> and <hi>Non-ſenſical Puppey?</hi> Which Fruits are moſt like to Bryars and Thorns, to call a deceitful man a <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> or for <hi>Sam. Jenings</hi> to call a man (of as good or better ſence and underſtanding than himſelf) <hi>Nonſenſical Puppey?</hi> Let <hi>H. D.</hi> anſwer to this, and wipe off this and many other foul Expreſſions, juſtly charged on his Brother <hi>Ienings,</hi> if he can; and yet this is he who did read H. D<hi>'s</hi> Paper, and pronounce my Fruits to be <hi>Bryars and Thorns,</hi> but accounts his own Fruits (no doubt) to be Figs and Grapes, tho' at the ſame Meeting he call'd one of his Church Members <hi>Non-ſenſical Puppey,</hi> i. e. <hi>A Whelp:</hi> And yet I do not underſtand that any one in the Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting dared to reprove him, except the Perſon he ſo called. I know the Scripture ſays, <hi>That Dogs are without,</hi> but I never knew that <hi>Dogs</hi> were ſuffered to remain within the Church: if this Perſon be a <hi>Puppy, Whelp</hi> or <hi>Dog,</hi> why don't they caſt him out, or condemn <hi>S. Ienings</hi> for his Ungodly Reviling in this particular? but that I believe they will not do, ſeeing they have cloaked much worſe Crimes than this in <hi>S Jenings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that H. D. ſaith, <hi>They gave me little occaſion, if any, to call them Hypocrites, but the clearing themſelves of theſe Aſperſions caſt upon them,</hi> is a manifeſt Lye; for there are hundreds can bear witneſs, that they gave me great occaſion, as their boldly denying in publick what they have aſſerted in private before many Witneſſes, and at other times (alſo in publick) ſome of them have called God to Witneſs to manifeſt Lyes &amp; Falſhoods, whereof we have many to bear witneſs. Nor have they ever to this day clear'd themſelves of theſe things laid to their charge, tho' they have had ſufficient time and opportunity given them.

And the firſt days that the two Meetings were together, I did never interrupt any of them, but they did alwayes interrupt me, and oft many at once ſpeaking to me, ſome paſſing me by the Arm and others by the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, and patricularly <hi>Arthur Cook</hi> was moſt abuſive to me, crowding cloſe to me, &amp; ſtaring moſt inhumanely in my face, when declaring, and calling me <hi>Ranter, Ranter, Wicked Man, Ungodly Man,</hi> and interrupting me in Prayer, (tho' I have never interrupted any of them either in Prayer or Preaching) ſaying, <hi>Thou Pray, thou ought not to pray, thou art a Wicked Man,</hi> and others bidding take me away; And at another time <hi>A. C.</hi> in a Mens Meeting Curſing me, ſaying, <hi>Wo be to thee from the Lord,</hi> which afterwards he denyed; and <hi>Sam. Jenings</hi> called me <hi>Shamelſs Man,</hi> &amp; at another time <hi>Apoſtate, and worſe than Prophane;</hi> and alſo, they moſt falſly accuſed me with <hi>denying Magiſtracy, and being an Enemy to the Government,</hi> with many other falſe Charges. And another of their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers came into the Meeting, when I was ſitting ſilent, and call'd me by my Name, and ſaid <hi>I was a Roaring Lyon.</hi> To moſt of which Paſſages <hi>Hugh Derborough</hi> was an Eye and Ear Witneſs, Is it not then great Hypocriſie and Partiality in him to paſs by all theſe great Provocations, and moſt unchriſtian Uſages (to ſay nothing of the Perſecution I and others of my Friends have met with from them, by <hi>Fining</hi> ſome, <hi>Impriſoning</hi> others, and <hi>Taking away Goods,</hi> only for Conſcience ſake) and ſo boldly to affirm. <hi>That I had little occaſion, if any, given me.</hi> What can I think or ſay of this H.

            </p>
            <p>And that I ſaid, <hi>Cut me in pieces, chop me, fry me, if ye will, &amp;c.</hi> H. D. is very diſ-ingenuous wholly to conceal the occaſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which was, that they did greatly threaten me with their outward Power, ſaying, <hi>This was intollerable, this was not to be born,</hi> when I called ſome of them Hypocrites, whom I well knew, and could prove to be ſuch; and tho' I was in little or no ſeeming danger, as to the outward at that time, yet I can truly ſay, I felt the Spirit of <hi>Cain</hi> in them, and they did ſeek
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95826:4"/>
occaſion againſt me, if poſſible, to take away my natural Life, by their enſnaring words and queſtions, and charging me, <hi>That I had ſpoke againſt the King;</hi> as many can bear witneſs, who had a ſence of their <hi>Cain</hi> like Spirit, as well as I, which occaſioned me to call ſome of them, <hi>Bloody Hounds,</hi> (and had I called them <hi>Hell Hounds,</hi> it would have been but what <hi>Fox</hi> in his Book of Martyrs called Perſecutors; and one time being hot by their thronging and crowding about me, becauſe I looſned ſome few Buttons of my Doublet, to get a little Air to refreſh me, they raiſed an abominable Lye on me, <hi>viz. That in a fit of Diſtraction I ript open my Brest, and ſhowed my Naked Skin.</hi> And I can truly ſay, God raiſed me up in a Spirit of Boldneſs, to <hi>Warn them to Repent of their Lying, Hypocriſie. Unbelief and Perſecution, leſt the Judgments of the Lord ſhould break forth againſt them;</hi> telling them, <hi>I feared them not, let them cut me and roaſt me,</hi> or ſuch like words, having in my mind, the bold words of <hi>Lawrance</hi> the Martyr to his Perſecutor, the Heathen Emperor, when he was roaſting on the Grid-Iron, as <hi>Fox</hi> relates the Paſſage in the Book of Martyrs, pag. 102. <hi>This ſide is non roaſted enough, turn up, O Tyrant great! Aſſay, whether roaſted or raw, thou thinkeſt the better Meat.</hi> Which words, <hi>Fox</hi> ſaith, he ſpoke in the mighty Spirit of God. Alſo, I had in mind the words of <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> when the Tyrant was cauſing beat him in a Morter, <hi>Beat, beat</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>thou toucheſt not</hi> Anaxagoras: Which Examples I gave them to be my Apology for ſuch words, and with which ſober and impartial People were ſatisfied. And tho' from this, <hi>H D,</hi> and ſome others would inſinuate as if this was a wicked Saying, it proceeds from their great ignorance; for ſeeing Chriſt hath pronounced them bleſſed who ſuffer Perſecution for Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſake, no judicious and ſincere <hi>Chriſtian</hi> will deny but it is deſirable (in the will of God) and many faithful <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have deſired it, yea, and ruſhed towards it, and by their ſharp words that they have uſed towards Perſecutors, have procured it.

 All that can be gathered from R.

Bareley</hi>'s Books, or any of my own Books; and it is great deceit in this H. D. only in general to cite my Book of <hi>Univerſal Grace,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mentioning the words of my Book. And it is worth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing, that he exactly followeth <hi>J.

And it is another piece either of groſs Hypocriſie and Deceit, or bold and impudent Raſnneſs in him to ſay. <hi>That</hi> R.

            <p n="8">
               <hi>8thly,</hi> That the Faith of Chriſt, as he dyed for the ſins of men is univerſally neceſſary to finiſh and perfect the work of mens Eternal Salvation, doth no wiſe derogate from the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of the Light becauſe the Light is as ſufficient to work the Faith and Knowledge of Chriſt without men, as within them, when it pleaſeth God ſo to order it.
