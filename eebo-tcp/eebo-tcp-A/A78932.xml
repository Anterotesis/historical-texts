         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THis morning I received, by the hands of a meſſenger from the Generall, a paper of Votes and Reſolutions of both Houſes of Parliament, bearing date <hi>Die Martis,</hi> 16. <hi>November,</hi> 1647. relating to the ſecurity of His Majeſties per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which although they came not to me with directions from the Houſes, yet I thought it my duty to take notice of them (by what hand ſoever received) as their commands, and accordingly to ſee them put in execution.</p>
            <p>As concerning that Vote, not permitting ſuch as have been in Armes, or aſſiſted againſt the Parliament, to come into this Iſland, it tending much to the ſecurity of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties perſon, and the preſerving the peace of the Iſland, I have (as I acquainted your Lordſhips in my laſt letters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I received theſe Votes) given orders to that effect (which are carefully put in execution) commanding all maſters of Boats belonging to <hi>Hampſhire</hi> and this Iſland, that they land neither perſons nor goods, in any part of this Iſland, ſave only at <hi>Yarmouth</hi> Caſtle, <hi>Cowes</hi> Caſtle, and <hi>Ryde:</hi> at which place I have alſo appointed a guard, to whom order is given (as to the other two Caſtles) for the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all perſons ſo landing, and to detaine and ſecure any that cannot give a very good account of themſelves and their buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>As concerning your Lordſhips other Votes (now they are come to my hands) I ſhall with the beſt of my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours ſee them put in execution.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:161306:4"/>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yeſterday there came to me an Officer, belonging to the Serjeant of the Houſe of Commons, with particular war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants for the apprehending and bringing up in ſafe cuſtody the perſons of Mr. <hi>John Aſhburnham,</hi> Mr. <hi>William Leg,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Barkley,</hi> who came hither with the King. The ſaid warrants requiring my aſſiſtance to him in the execution of them, but with no order to me from either or both Houſes to that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>And finding the matter to be of every great importance, I have deſired the meſſenger to forbeare the execution of his ſaid warrants till I have given the Houſes to underſtand that in caſe the ſaid warrants ſhould be ſerved and put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it would be impoſſible for me to anſwer the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and commands of Parliament in preſerving the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the King in ſecurity to be diſpoſed by them, unleſſe I ſhould keep him cloſe priſoner, which is a buſineſſe of that nature, that it is neither fit nor ſafe for me to do, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eially of my ſelfe.</p>
            <p>The grounds from whence I gather this, are plainly thus:</p>
            <p>The King hath declared himſelfe to me, That he came from <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> for no other cauſe but for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his perſon, which was (as he apprehended) in ſuch danger, that he could not with ſafety continue longer there: That if he could have been there with ſafety, hee would not have departed thence, nor from the Army: And that he choſe this place rather then any other (when he was at liberty to have gone whither he pleaſed) that he might ſtill continue under the protection of the Army (my ſelfe being a member thereof) and that he might have conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of free entercourſe between himſelfe and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the ſettlement of a generall peace, to which hee profeſſes greater inclinations and deſires then ever, and that there ſhall be nothing wanting on his part, that may bee reaſonably expected from him.</p>
            <p>He further ſaith, that in caſe theſe Gentlemen be taken from him, and puniſhed as evill doers, for councelling him
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:161306:4"/>
not to goe out of the Kingdome, but rather to come to the place where he now is, for the ends aforeſaid, and for their endeavouring accordingly in attending him hither; he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but himſelfe expect to be dealt with accordingly; his caſe being the ſame.</p>
            <p>And from ſuch apprehenſions your Lordſhips may eaſily judge, what he will doe, by his former actings: He having that liberty which hath ever beene allowed him ſince he hath beene diſpoſed of by the Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall further let you know, that beſides the care I ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies have of theſe gentlemen, they have ingaged their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, not to depart from me, ſo that I am moſt confident of their ſecurity.</p>
            <p>And truly were not their ends the ſame with their pretences (in relation to the peace of this Kingdome) I am confident they would never have adviſed nor conducted the King to this place.</p>
            <p>Beſides, were they at this time removed from the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there would be none left for his attendance, which (beſides the offence) how great the inconvenience would be to him, your Lordſhips cannot be ignorant.</p>
            <p>And further give me leave to adde (if ſo unworthy a ſervant of your Lordſhips as I am (and that which concerns my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour were at all worthy your conſideration) whither it would not much reflect upon me in caſe theſe gentlemen ſhould be thus removed from hence: The King and themſelves having freely throwne themſelves upon mee for ſafety upon confidence (as they pleaſe to ſay) of my honour and honeſty, and the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction they expect it would have given the Parliament, The King being neceſſitated to remove.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My duty to you and the Kingdome (whoſe good and peace I moſt deſire and ſhall moſt faithfully endeavour) calls for this account, which (with my ſelfe and theſe gentlemen) I leave to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:161306:5"/>
your Lordſhips conſideration with this concluſion; That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is commanded by Authority (eſpecially that of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) though never ſo contrary to my ſenſe or honour, ſhall never be diſobeyed by.</p>
