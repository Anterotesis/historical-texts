            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WHosoever has Inspected the History of that Unhappy War which commenc'd in the time of King <hi>Charles the First,</hi> will grant that its wonderfull and various events adminster as much Subject for a Poem of this Nature as has been Grounded on former Story: However deplorable the dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity may be as to our Historical facts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions, in regard that these, from their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid effects and contrivance, appear less credible then true, and propably shall have no future Parallel.</p>
            <p>That the Character of that Sovereign, which gives a Denomination to this Poem, may with no less Magnitude (considering the Excellency and Grandeur of his Endowments) be as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown'd a figure for Heroick Poesy, as any which <hi>Homer</hi> or <hi>Virgill</hi> have attributed to the Greatest of their Heroes must be granted by all that are not Ignorant of their Nations Glory, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive from the Fame of that Incomparable King.</p>
            <p>I shall not presume to adorn my Preface by displaying the especial and various dignities of
<pb facs="tcp:50029:3"/>
Heroick Poesy which in my Case might savour of Ostentation, or not unlike an Architect that should endeavour to applaud some high perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of his Science to Insinuate his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert in a work of the same Intendment: Being rather desirous to referr my Reader to what the Judicious have Celebrately express'd, in reference to this extraordinary sort of Poesy, without giving it any other Panygerick from my Pen. However I stand oblig'd so far to Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate my undertaking as to shew that it is duly grounded and concenters with such requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites of Invention as have been allowably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded to perfect an Epique composition.</p>
            <p>That this structure has been from the Pens of the most famous Authors, rais'd on some known Historical Truth, as the Basis or fond of such a Poem, is evident from what the first Grandees or Guides of this Science have left to the World.</p>
            <p>But if known story gave rise to their design, they rely'd upon the strength of Fiction, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the beautifying and compleating the Modell and shape of their contrivance: Not unlike the skillfull Sculpturist, that out of some rough Mass of Stone polisheth and forms his several figures suitable to the representation he Intends them.</p>
            <p>True it is that known occurrences may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Agrandize a Poem, and the Readers esteem will be more pathetically moved by Transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are within the compass of Man's know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb facs="tcp:50029:3"/>
however enlarg'd by Poetical License, then what he adjudgeth to be totally Fabulous, being induc'd to accept, on that account, what could not without Intermixtures and supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Muses be elevately convey'd.</p>
            <p>Nor did the most remarkable Poets other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise deliver the essential part of Historical Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, then accompany'd with Notions whereby they rectify'd the will or practical conduct of the Mind, by improving Moralities to the most usefull and exemplary Comprehension: By which gloss and varnish of Imagination story was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably render'd, that otherwise had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained by too narrowly Circumscribing the sphere of Invention: and would be no less ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd then to expect a History instead of a Poem, and if it be simply the first it cannot deserve the name of the latter.</p>
            <p>Besides, it is very Notorious, that few Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians compile all considerable deeds or events, whose business is to observe Publique and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral occurrences, rather then the particular discovery of Personal concernments as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to Characters: Which ought to be the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking of the Poet who is Priviledg'd to suppose what he Judgeth should be emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally declar'd if possibly Cohering or Assimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to whatsoever might, by way of resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, in any respect, be held Creditable; so that any Poetical Assertion, if thus Manag'd, must have a Legitimate Pass port from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the writer, and this may be Term'd
<pb facs="tcp:50029:4"/>
the History of the Poet, without which the vulgar or known cannot have to do with the Muses. Thus it appears that Narrations taken from the <hi>Trojan</hi> War did rather enlarge then confine the Pens of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> to which they not only added the Embelishment of their Fiction, but Introduc'd what Characters they held proper to fill up and conspire with the Ornament and vigour of such as had their parts in the subject they treated.</p>
            <p>Neither would they limit their Inventions to the Ethical distributions of things, as they Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally result from humane Cogitation, but oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionally advanc'd the intellect of the Reader to the most sublime apprehension of such spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations as entertain'd with delight and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the contemplative faculty; and this they effected by grounding their Fictions on super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Causes and effects consonant to receiv'd Belief: Either as they represented Miracles and Spiritual appearances of good and bad Existen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, as also extraordinary Prodigies, Dreams, Magical<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Enchantments, Witchcrafts, and the like; that by an admirable Allegory did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr and agree with the deeds and descriptions of Men.</p>
            <p>And were this manner of Writing seperated from the most famous Poets their repure would fall to a far lower Orb of Esteem then the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of their Ingenuity have deservedly Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd; which shews us that they well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the value of this sort of Invention, and
<pb facs="tcp:50029:4"/>
how necessary it was to the Royalty of <hi>Parnassus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another supercilious Mistake has been Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd by some from their affected supposition that a Heroick Poem cannot be produc'd, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant to Christianity, with that requisite Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude that was us'd by Poets of <hi>Ethnick</hi> persuasion.</p>
            <p>To answer which conceit, whosoever shall undertake to avow it, there is nothing more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent then that all Necessary use and Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Metaphor and Allegory relating to super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural power existencies and beings, is as much ours as it was Assistant to the Ancients, tho' re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounding from their Largest Catalognes of Deities and Fictions.</p>
            <p>And this was well perceiv'd by the late Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and Learned French Critique <hi>Rapin</hi> in his admirable reflections on this sort of Poesy, to whose exquisite observations, not to insert any remarks of Mine, I think fit to referr my Reader.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, to come closer to my purpose by alledging such Authorities as have the most undoubted Modern reception: I need but mention the Great <hi>Tasso,</hi> and our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Spencer,</hi> by whose Poems, tho' the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of Latter Times, and agreable to Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical persuasion, it is very clear that neither as to Fiction or Allegory, they wanted any Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Ingredients or supplements, if compar'd with such Poets who had been precedent to Christian Belief. I shall not present my Reader with any Inspections into the Poem of <hi>Spencer,</hi> it being upon the matter wholly Allegory, and
<pb facs="tcp:50029:5"/>
therefore not so proper to the Application I intend.</p>
            <p>But as for <hi>Tasso,</hi> his Poem, tho' appertaining to Christian Atchievements, and a Modern Story perfectly known to Chronology as any extant, is Intermix'd with as many Episods and speculative Allegories as he could with any conveniency find room for in his <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bulloigne:</hi> Where in his handling of that History, we find that his Muse is conversant with Good and Bad Angells, Miraculous Shapes, Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Dreams, Fantoms, Magical Dialogues, Fas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinations, Flying in the Air, Obscure convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of the persons of Men by Diabolical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivement, the stupendious opening of Trees, that seem'd to disclose objects of wonderfull variety to entertain admiration by rendring of his Characters more superlatively ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable, all which are the main body and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of his Poem. Yet this was never made his Crime, by what the most accurate Criticks have remark'd on him: perhaps they may have tax'd him for being excessive or tedious in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and descriptions of this high Import, but never charg'd on him to the diminution of his esteem, or as an Illegitimate License, unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming a Poet. And this our famous <hi>Ben. Johnson.</hi> well understood, whose mature Judgment gave as little room to extravagancies of the Brain as any that preceded him, by his introducing <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Ghost whereby to infuse on the wicked Genius of <hi>Cataline</hi> a more Hellish and Irresistable Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to perfect his Impious design, which could
<pb facs="tcp:50029:5"/>
not have been so execrably Insinuated by any other Method.</p>
            <p>An Example that enough assures us that he approv'd the Allegorical part of Invention, and that it is as Legitimately ours, as it could be claim'd by any of the Ancients, when properly apply'd. I held it convenient to instance these particulars, that the Reader may not wonder if I have in some passages and fictions follow'd the example of so great a Poet, as well as others that famously preceded him in that manner of Contrivement.</p>
            <p>It has been erroniously suppos'd by not a few, that are less knowing then Critical, whereby they render in their Judgments an Epique Poem more difficult to be accomplish'd, that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is supernaturall, is therefore Incredible; not considering, that Fiction may imply an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary resemblance of truth, in its remotest sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, when ally'd to the Conceptions and Tenents of Men: And thus <hi>Medea</hi> might be granted as much a Sorcere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s as the Witch of <hi>Endor:</hi> And <hi>Niobe,</hi> tho' but on the Credit of the Inventor, Poetically held by the decree of Heaven, Metamorphos'd into Marble, no less really effected, then the Transformation of <hi>Lot's</hi> Wife into a Pillar of Salt.</p>
            <p>The only Author, I know of, that has totally relinquish'd Allegory, notwithstanding he gives his Poem of <hi>Gundibert</hi> a Heroick Title, was the late Sr <hi>William Davenant,</hi> a person of no ordinary Ingenuity, however he thought sit to decline
<pb facs="tcp:50029:6"/>
this manner of Writing, either because he would be singular in his way, or that he design'd to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass others by producing of something that should be great, without being of kin to the Grandeur of former Presidents: But instead of perfecting what he intended, the deficiency of his structure was soon perceiv'd by the judicious.</p>
            <p>And this appears, because that work of his is wholly diffus'd into sententious Moralities and Actions that have too constant a Tendency to the same Levell of thought, instead of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite Intermixture and Elevation of the Mind by entertaining of the spiritual or contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive faculty.</p>
            <p>I am far from making this Inference with any Intention to attract Applause to my self, or to lessen the fame of that Author, since as his Poem stands compos'd it has my value: And I well know, notwithstanding the derogations and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities of some, that it contains many exquisite and remote expressions, insomuch that I admire that his undertaking appears so well perform'd as I find it, however destitute of that refining of speculations and characters which has been the judicious and superlative Management of all that preceded him.</p>
            <p>That the Introducing of Heroins was allways held an ornament to Heroique Poesy, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the Constant usage and authority of the most Considerable Pens: And their reason I conceive was to Impress a Transcendent value on the splendors of Beauty when accompany'd

with Grandeur of mind, and thereby more suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the devoirs of their Masculine Admirers: which Celebrated instances are very frequently read in Poets of most repute, as is understood by every eye that is acquainted with their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions. And tho' the Examples are peculiar to some extraordinary Figures of Female great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, yet not dissentaneous to what has been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify'd from authentique Records, in which we may find not only the daring exploits of a <hi>Joan of Orleans,</hi> but the prowess of Queens; witness that Gallant <hi>Katherine,</hi> Wife to our King <hi>Henry the Sixth;</hi> besides many of every degree that for Martial renown are formerly register'd.</p>
            <p>This I judge may sufficiently Apologize for what is related, or Character'd by m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in that of <hi>Flavira,</hi> by whose Heroine Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I would be understood to Include the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namities of other Noble &amp; Generous personages that might otherwise deserve their particular mention.</p>
            <p>And he that has Inform'd himself of the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious Actions of some conspicuous of that Sex, besides others of lower Stations, relating to the unfortunate War I write of, will soon grant that their resemblance may claim a signal room in this <hi>Poem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next thing that I am oblig'd to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptable for, is the Liberty I have us'd by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting of Persons by such Nominations and descriptions as are not deriv'd from Historical certainty: And this method I take to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb facs="tcp:50029:7"/>
by the practice of all that have Merited the Esteem of Epique Writers.</p>
            <p>As for Proper Names, it must be Granted, if but for the advantage that is in the sound of words as they ought to run in Verse; that our English Tongue does not usually furnish us with such names as are proper for Poetry, as we may observe from every ordinary Argument and Dialogue, that has to do with the Muses, in which Authors Insert or Borrow such denominations of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as are most suitable to their purpose, and none I believe can with any colour except against the same Liberty I have used here.</p>
            <p>If we consider occurrences of whatsoever Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, as they result from story, they cannot have Latitude enough, as they relate to things and persons, to embody or Capacitate a Poem of this Quality: In respect that no Truth can of it self compleat a Poetical Character, which would on those Terms, in its utmost extent tend to no more then the known sense and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of persons, whereby the due Consummating of their figures would be Impair'd, and which can be no way perfected but by the Artifice of Feigning in their behalf to render them more exact and compleat in themselves. A License undoubtedly conceded by all approv'd Criticks, in respect that Persons are deliver'd by that means rather as they ought to be represented then as they are found, or deduc'd from Historical Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations: By which method the worthily Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous are advanc'd to a higher excellency, and the
<pb facs="tcp:50029:7"/>
depravations of others deliver'd more perfectly Evill.</p>
            <p>There is yet a farther advantage that redounds from this Liberty of personating of Characters, in regard that by the aptitude of one person, either in reference to Science, conspicuous deeds, Passions, or affections of the Mind, divers may be signify'd, or in a general Sense describ'd as to whatsoever Emergencies are to be understood that proceed from the facts or disposition of humane conduct.</p>
            <p>And this requisite is pertinent of Poesy groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on History, since without that additional supplement the most Renowned Personages would appear too solitary figur'd on the Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick account: Or like an Imperial Palace, that should Consist only of an outward shell instead of Variety of Apartments, Furniture, and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, to Illustrate its Fabrick.</p>
            <p>Nor is it a tollerable objection, if any shall undertake to avow it, that because this Poem does contain Transactions that arose within the Compass of the Age we Live in, it should there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be deny'd the Perquisites of the Muses that were the former ornaments and advantages of Writers; in respect that so much as they us'd of Historical Verity is as fully discernable in them, from what they Poetically annexed, as in any Invention I have Inserted: And there is no Eldership in Wit that can of right Challenge more freedom, in order to Legitimate Fable, then is to be conceded to Modern Ingenuity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:50029:8"/>
On our English Theatre 'tis sufficiently accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table if the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cene be laid at home, tho' the nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and facts of Characters be devis'd either as they resemble or enlarge some known Truth: And I assure my self there is no Man but will grant as full a latitude, if not a greater, in some sense, to a Poem of this contexture then he would allow to any Dramatick Composition. But I have said enough, as to the substance of what I have here produc'd, to all Candid apprehensions, or such as are not resolv'd to be perverse or Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant opposers.</p>
            <p>And I dare thus far aver in behalf of my Subject, that no Rebellious, &amp; Tragical dissentions, were ever carried on with more Hypocritical preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, Subtle and Treacherous Intrigues; or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily more famously replenish'd with Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Gallantries, or the most touching and Noble Concerns of Duty and Passion, relating to He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicks of both Sexes, then what was occasion'd by that wicked and unparallel'd War.</p>
            <p>And above all for the Eminent display of the surpassing Character of a Monarch, more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent then fortunate, as I have endeavour'd to Manifest it as highly as my Ability extends, and I wish it could deservedly Erect his Monument of Fame and Glory.</p>

                  <hi>HAving touch'd in general the construction of a Poem of this Nature, I thought fit to annex to my Preface some brief remarks that more particularly relate to the method I have us'd, and what the Critical Reader might Expect for his Satisfaction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As to my Verse, I have avoided Stanza's; and my reason is, because I conceive them not so proper, as the freedom of Heroick Measures for a Poem of this Structure; and this choice of mine is not only suitable to the manner of</hi> Virgil <hi>and other Ancient Poets, but agreeable to the most approv'd sense of Modern Criticism: I need not but instance the Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi> Rapin, <hi>who assures us that the Compiling of</hi> Stanza's <hi>was the mistake of some late Italian Poets, who first intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd them into their Heroick Poems, and that they weaken the beauty and flame of Verse in the length of their periods, on which, for the most part, the main substance of their sense does depend.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And here I cannot but acqaint my Reader, that I took care that this work, as it is of great Signification and Import, should be advantag'd by the Inspection of some few Persons, which caus'd me not only to correct but to add some hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of Lines; by which means I did, as much as in me lay,</hi> Ultimam Manum Imponere.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:50029:9"/>
                  <hi>As for the Moral of my Poem, the Soul of a work of this Consistency, it is Chiefly terminated in the exemplary greatness and virtues of the Royal Person I have endeavour'd to delineate; whereby the unity of Action and other Accessories, that ought to be Incident to such a Composition, are properly, I conceive, observed: Yet with that Regard to History that the most Considerable Battels and facts of War are either related, or instead of room for all their particular, which had been more cumbersom to read then necessary to be Inserted in a Poem, Collaterally included by some pertinent and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral mention.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And whosoever shall duly Consider what is here deliver'd, as it referrs to deplorable truth: will judge it rather a Divine then a Poetical Summons, to detest those Execrable deeds, Prophanations, and Hypocrisies, that tended to the Subversion of Holy Religion, together with all Moral Obligations of highest Import, as they were at once the Unparallel'd Misfortune, and deformity of Three Famous Nations.</hi>

For tho' I am no great Judge of Poesy (as you may see by my writing to you in Prose) yet I am an Admirer of those refined Wits, who by the sweet harmony of Verse have conserved the History of those Ancient Wars, which might have been lost had they been wrote in Prose; and the Iliads of</hi> Homer, <hi>and other Antique Writings might have ran the same fate of time, with many other excellent Histories, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The subject, Sir, on which you have chosen to Write, is worthy of an Heroick Poem; Our Wars more then Civil, with the ultimate Tragedy thereof, is such a period as is sufficient to silence all the Muses, and cause them abruptly to break off in sighs and lamentations. I know not how it comes to pass, that for these Forty Years, since which these Wars have been ended, that none of the Elevated Wits of our Age have taken upon them to describe these mighty Actions in Heroick Verse, untill you happily took up this subject so worthy of your Pen, which I wish may delight as well as inform the World; and that when Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories fail, and are exstinguish'd by time, your Poem may survive and give knowledge of what we have seen to future Ages.</hi>

               <l>Thus raging war fermented every where,</l>
               <l>By Fates decree, this most unhappy year:</l>
               <l>In which the King, tho' much his Force Impair'd,</l>
               <l>As 'gainst him had the Houses four years warr'd;</l>
               <l>Their Interest Mighty and no less their power,</l>
               <l>From <hi>Londons</hi> Endless Srength, and Treasures store:</l>
               <l>Was <hi>Northward</hi> March'd, as many did suppose,</l>

               <l>Their Persons in their colder Clime to dwell:</l>
               <l>

And <hi>Southward</hi> to Assist the Houses came,</l>
               <l>Their Friends by League, but with more zealous slame</l>
               <l>Their bold partakers as they hop'd to share</l>
               <l>Treasures and Spoyls of <hi>England</hi> by this War.</l>
               <l>Yet nearer then these, Enemies were found,</l>
               <l>That 'gainst the King, at that time did abound.</l>
               <l>Thus was great <hi>Leicester</hi> fill'd with fighting Men,</l>
               <l>That the King might not there have passage then:</l>
               <l>But be repuls'd in case he should assay,</l>
               <l>To Curb that daring City in his way.</l>
               <l>The King his Summons sends to this bold Town,</l>
               <l>Which, like to others Principled, did own,</l>
               <l>That Royal Power did not of right Command,</l>
               <l>Whilst it the Houses Arms in Field withstand.</l>
               <l>So far Allegiance badly then decay'd,</l>
               <l>As Men by Power or Interest were sway'd.</l>
               <l>Affronted thus, the King soon Storms the place,</l>
               <l>Which Stifly did resist some few hours space:</l>
               <l>Till oft attaqu'd by res'lute Foot and Horse,</l>
               <l>Like Boistrous Waves that break through Bays by force,</l>

This City they by Strenuous onset take,</l>
               <l>And with its Spoils their numbers richer make.</l>
               <l>This Action great, yet Signally must be,</l>
               <l>By the Permissive will of Heavens decree,</l>
               <l>The last Successfull that the King obtain'd,</l>

               <l>Forward the King meant to have <hi>Northward</hi> gone,</l>

               <l>And were for number and reputo the Flower</l>

               <l>For his Attendant, then desir'd to use;</l>
               <l>When standing on this Peerless Trayt'rous floor,</l>
               <l>His Royal Speech corrects their guilty power:</l>
               <l>Whilst gloriously, exceeding humane Race,</l>
               <l>Appear'd his words, his gesture, and his face.</l>
               <l>The Antick Villain, who the Axe must hand,</l>
               <l>Embolden'd was to strike by his Command.</l>
               <l>So highly great does his End raise his story</l>
               <l>Above what could have been his Earthly Glory:</l>
               <l>That even the Tragick Theatre of his fall,</l>
               <l>Adds reverence, by his death, unto <hi>Whitehall.</hi>
               </l>
