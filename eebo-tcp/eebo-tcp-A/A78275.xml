            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The <hi>CASE</hi> of the <hi>Waggoners</hi> and <hi>Carriers</hi> of Goods and Merchandizes, through the ſeveral Roads of <hi>England.</hi>
            </head>
            <head type="sub">Humbly ſubmitted to the Honourable Houſe of Commons aſſembled in Parliament.</head>
            <p>THAT in the Seſſions of Parliament 1695, the ſaid Carriers were heard (as to many Grievances and Oppreſſions impoſed on them by ſeveral pretended Informers) before a Committee of this Honourable Houſe, who were pleaſed 14th of <hi>March</hi> 1695, to make their Report.</p>
            <p>That it was their Opinion, the Petitioners had fully proved the Allegations of their ſaid Petitions, and deſerv'd Relief of the Houſe. And alſo that the Houſe be moved for leave to bring in a Bill for explaining the ſeveral Acts relating to the High-ways, and for preventing the Abuſes ariſing thereby.</p>
            <p>To which the Houſe agreed, committed <hi>John Littlehale,</hi> for oppreſſing the Petitioners, to Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody of the Sergeant at Arms, and a Bill was then drawn up, and paſt into a Law, Intituled, <hi>An Act for better amending and repairing the High ways, and Explanation of the Laws relating thereunto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which, it was (amongſt other things) Enacted, that all Carriers and Waggoners ſhould be obliged to draw with double Shafts, and a Pole between their Wheel-Horſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it having been tried, it was found by experience to be impoſſible to paſs the ſeveral narrow Roads of this Kingdom, and Gate-ways of Inns, and Paſſages of Streets, Where the Petitioners muſt Come to abide and lodge their ſaid Waggons and Wares, with ſuch double Shafts and Polls, for that they are not broad enough to contain the ſame.</p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>John Littlehale,</hi> and other Informers, have taken upon them to proſecute the Petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners for Forfeitures committed, by not driving purſuant to the ſaid Act, which is impoſſible to be done.</p>
            <p>And ſome Juſtices of Peace have been ſo civil and encouraging to theſe Informers, to grant them Warrants for Diſtreſs of the ſaid Carriers Horſes, to levy the Penalties and Forfeitures incurred by their not complying with the ſaid Impoſſibility.</p>
            <p>By which means, the ſaid Carriers have ſuffer'd very much, and are not able to go on with their Callings, unleſs theſe Grievances are redreſt. Some whereof are as follow. Particularly,</p>
            <p>That the 6th of <hi>March</hi> 1698, Seven Horſes were ſeized from Mr. <hi>Baſſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Leiceſter</note> 
               <hi>Leiceſter</hi> Carrier at <hi>Brown</hi>'s Well in <hi>Finchly</hi> Pariſh, upon Warrants granted by Juſtice <hi>Munday</hi> of the <hi>Temple,</hi> and carried away by <hi>William Hull,</hi> Brother-in-Law to <hi>John Littlehale, viz.</hi> five Horſes out of the wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, which were all that it was drawn with; one Horſe from Mr. <hi>Baſſe</hi>'s Man, which he rode on, and a Gelding which he led in his hand. And the ſaid <hi>Hull,</hi> aſſiſted by two Soldiers, demanded 10 <hi>l.</hi> of him, for non payment of which, they ſwore they would knock him off his Horſe, and in a violent abuſive manner forced all the ſaid Horſes from him, whereby he was neceſſitated to leave the ſaid Waggon, loaden with Wares and Merchandizes, in the open Road, till he came to <hi>London,</hi> to get Money to clear them, or a Replevin. And afterwards when a Replevin was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from the Sheriff of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> the ſaid perſons refuſed to obey it, and forcibly reſiſted the Officers, who came to execute it, and reſtore the ſaid Horſes.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time and place, the ſaid <hi>Hull</hi> and his Agents, by Mr. <hi>Munday</hi>'s Warrant,<note place="margin">Nottingham.</note> ſeized ſix Horſes from Mr. <hi>Wilkinſon</hi>'s Waggon of <hi>Nottingham;</hi> demanded ten Pounds of his man, and gave him the like Language and Uſage.</p>
            <p>The beginning of <hi>February</hi> 1698, the ſaid <hi>Hull</hi> and his Agents ſeized two Horſes, two Collars, and two pair of Traces from the ſaid <hi>Wilkinſon, Nottingham</hi> Carrier for four Pound, at <hi>Highgate,</hi> and the four Pound was paid to redeem them.</p>
            <p>And at the ſame time and place, the ſaid <hi>Hull</hi> and his Agents ſeized two Horſes,<note place="margin">Derby.</note> two Collars, and two pair of Traces, from <hi>Samuel Locker</hi>'s Waggon, Carrier to <hi>Derby,</hi> for four Pound, and the four Pound was paid ro redeem them.</p>
            <p>About the 21th of <hi>February,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Hull</hi> and his Agents ſeized two Horſes in the Pariſh of <hi>Finchly</hi> for four Pound more from the ſaid <hi>Locker, Derby</hi> Carrier.</p>
