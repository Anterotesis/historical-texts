            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetur ad virtutem in solitudine anima</hi>; was the the saying of a <hi>Bragman</hi> or Indian Philosopher to <hi>Alexander</hi> the the <hi>Great</hi>: and how memorable it is, you may perhaps collect from this diversion. For, the imperfect <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course</hi> I herewith send to you, my dear <hi>Friend,</hi> concerning the PASSIONS, is the product of my late ten weeks <hi>solitude</hi> in the Country. Where being remote from my Library, and wanting conversation with Learned Men; I knew not how more inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently to shorten the winter evenings, than by spending them in revising
<pb facs="tcp:62014:3"/>
some Philosophical papers of my own, wherein among other things, I had formerly, out of the best Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, made certain <hi>Collections</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the divine art of acquiring constant <hi>Tranquillity</hi> of Mind, by <hi>Wisedom</hi> or the right use of Reason. And of this serious Diversion I then made choice, both because I well understood the best part of Human Science to be that which teacheth us how to moderate our <hi>Affections</hi> to the deceiptfull and transitory things of this life, and so to regulate our <hi>Actions,</hi> as to reap from them, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their Events may be, the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py fruit of internal <hi>Acquiescence</hi> and Satisfaction: and because my accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated Misfortunes had at that time reduced me to a necessity of consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that part of Philosophy, about the most effectual <hi>Remedies</hi> against <hi>Discontent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this state and resolution then, first I remembred, that Nature hath
<pb facs="tcp:62014:3"/>
made Man subject to no other <hi>real</hi> Evil, but only <hi>pain</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi>; all <hi>Grief</hi> or pain of the <hi>Mind,</hi> though many times more sharp and intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, being created by our own false <hi>Opinion,</hi> that we stand in want of things that are in truth without the circle of ourselves, and therefore not absolutely necessary to our wel-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Then I considered, that most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly <hi>false Opinions</hi> are occasioned, and so exorbitant <hi>Desires</hi> suggested to us by our <hi>Passions</hi>; upon which all the <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> incident to us in this life, seem's to depend: as <hi>Ioy</hi> and <hi>Grief</hi> are the two points in which all Human actions end. For, though it be undoubtedly true, that the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable</hi> Soul hath her <hi>intellectual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights</hi> and <hi>Disquiets</hi> apart, such as are proper to her simple and spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al nature: yet is it no less true, that those other Delights and Disquiets that are common to her with the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:62014:4"/>
depend intirely upon the <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</hi> Which when <hi>regular,</hi> that is, moderated and directed by <hi>reason,</hi> are indeed of good use to the Soul, in that they serve to incite her to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire such objects which she well know's to be pleasant and beneficial to her, and to persist in that desire: but when <hi>irregular,</hi> by representing as realy good, things that are so only in apparence, provoke her to errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Desires,</hi> and in persuit of them, to <hi>Actions</hi> also repugnant to the dict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates of right <hi>Reason,</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to peace and <hi>tranquility</hi> of Mind.</p>
            <p>From these Cogitations it was not difficult for me to infer, that the whole art of attaining unto that internal se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity after which I was seeking, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth principaly in <hi>Directing our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires aright,</hi> that is, to things which we clearly and distinctly know to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aly Good: and that the only way so to direct our Desires, is to imploy our Understanding or Faculty of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning,
<pb facs="tcp:62014:4"/>
which God hath to that end given us, strictly and attentively to <hi>examine</hi> and <hi>consider</hi> the <hi>goodness</hi> of things recommended to us by our <hi>Passions,</hi> before we determin our <hi>Will</hi> to affect and persue them. For, most certain it is, that as our faculty of <hi>Discerning,</hi> that is our <hi>Intellect,</hi> cannot naturaly tend to <hi>falsity</hi>: so neither can our faculty of <hi>Assenting,</hi> that is our <hi>Will,</hi> be deceived, when it is determined only upon objects which we clearly and distinctly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand; and where our Will is not misplaced, there can be no just cause of <hi>Perturbation</hi> of mind.</p>
            <p>Being soon convinced of this no less evident than important verity, in the next place I considered, that if our inordinate <hi>Affections</hi> be the bitter fountain from whence the greatest part of, if not all our <hi>practical Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,</hi> and by consequence most of the <hi>Evils</hi> we suffer, flow; and if as the diseases of the <hi>Body,</hi> so likewise
<pb facs="tcp:62014:5"/>
those of the <hi>Mind</hi> may be more easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cured, when their nature and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are understood: then would it be requisite for me first to inquire as far as I should be able, into the <hi>nature, causes, motions, &amp;c.</hi> of the <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi> before I proceeded further in my research after the most powerfull <hi>Remedies</hi> against their <hi>Excesses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this inquiry therefore I dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently applied myself, both by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and meditation; by <hi>Reading,</hi> that I might recall into my memory what I had long before transcribed out of the books of such Authors who had written judiciously and laudably of the Passions: by <hi>Meditation,</hi> that I might examin the weight of what I read, by comparing it with what I daily observed within the theatre of my own breast; every Man living be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing naturaly so sensible of the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Commotions hapning in various Passions, especialy more violent ones, that some have held, the knowledge
<pb facs="tcp:62014:5"/>
of their nature and causes may be without much of difficulty derived from thence alone, without any help from foreign observations. And while I proceeded in this course, I digested my Collections and private Sentiments into such an order or <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod</hi> which seem'd to me most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, aswell to show their genuin succession, and mutual dependence, as to make the Antecedents support the Consequents, and both to illustrate each other reciprocaly. I put them also into a dress of <hi>Language</hi> so plain and familiar, as may alone evince, my design was to write of this Argument, neither as an Orator, nor as a Moral Philosopher, but only as a <hi>Natural</hi> one conversant in <hi>Pathology,</hi> and that too more for his own private satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, than the instruction of others. And thus have I succinctly acquainted you with the <hi>Occasion, Subject, Scope</hi> and <hi>Stile</hi> of the Treatise that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panieth this Epistle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62014:6"/>But this, <hi>Noble</hi> Sir is not all where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I ought to advertise you, before you come to open the Treatise itself. There remain yet <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three</hi> things more, which it imports me to offer to your notice, as Preparatives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst prejudice.</p>
            <p>ONE is, that if in the preliminary part of the Discourse, where it was necessary for me to investigate the <hi>Subjectum Primarium</hi> of the Passions, I have declared my assent to their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, who hold that in every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Man, there are <hi>two</hi> distinct <hi>Souls,</hi> coexistent, conjoined, and cooperating; one, only <hi>Rational,</hi> by which he is made a Reasonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; the other, <hi>Sensitive,</hi> by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue whereof he participateth also of Life and Sense: I did so chiefly for these <hi>two</hi> reasons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> it seem'd to me unintelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, how an Agent incorporeal, but not infinite, such as the <hi>Rational</hi> Soul by her excellent faculties and proper
<pb facs="tcp:62014:6"/>
acts appear's to be, can act physica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in and upon a gross and ponderous body, such as ours are, immediately or without the mediation of a <hi>third</hi> thing; which though corporeal too, may yet be of a substance so refined and subtil, as to approach somwhat neerer to the nature of a pure Spirit, than the body itself doth: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the more probable explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Phenomena</hi> of the Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are not raised in the Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Soul, I found myself obliged to admit her to have a <hi>Sensitive</hi> one conjoyned with her, to receive her immediate suggestions, and to actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the body according to her sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign will and pleasure; there being less of disparity betwixt the most thin and subtil bodies of Light and <hi>Flame</hi> (whereof many eminent Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers have conceived a <hi>Sensitive</hi> Soul to consist) and a substance pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spiritual, than between a pure spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and a gross, heavy body, as ours is.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62014:7"/>
               <hi>Secondly</hi> it seem'd to me no less unconceivable, whence that dismal <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <hi>intestin war</hi> which every Man too frequently feels within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and whereof even <hi>St. Paul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self so sadly complained, when (<hi>in Epist. ad Roman. cap.</hi> 3.) he cries out, <hi>video aliam legem in membris meis repugnantem legi mentis meae</hi>; should arise, if not from a <hi>Duumvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> as it were of <hi>Rulers</hi> contending for superiority within us, and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning us two contrary ways at once. For, to conceive that one and the. same <hi>Simple</hi> thing, such as the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable</hi> Soul is rightly presumed to be, can be repugnant to itself, or at one and the same time be posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with opposite affections; is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly absurd. There are indeed, who to evade this absurdity, imagine it possible, that of one and the same Rational, simple Soul, there may be <hi>two</hi> distinct <hi>Faculties</hi> or powers opposite each to other, from whose
<pb facs="tcp:62014:7"/>
clashings and contrary inclinations this civil war may proceed. But to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige us to swallow this palpable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, these Men ought to have reconciled those two repugnant noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Simple</hi> and <hi>Compound</hi>; and to have told us, why in the same sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple substance of <hi>fire</hi> there cannot likewise be two mutualy repugnant faculties, <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>cold.</hi> In a <hi>Mixed</hi> body there may be, I confess, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site faculties; and therefore the like may be imagined also in the Rational Soul, if she be conceived to be of a mixed or compound nature: but this is against their own <hi>supposition,</hi> and destructive to the natural <hi>immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality</hi> of the Soul. What then can remain to cause this dire war daily observed within us, betwixt the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements of our <hi>Sense,</hi> on one side, and the grave dictates of our <hi>Mind,</hi> on the other; but two distinct Agents, the <hi>Rational</hi> Soul and the <hi>Sensitive,</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existent within us, and hotly conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:62014:8"/>
about the conduct of our Will?</p>
            <p>But You, <hi>Sir,</hi> will perhaps tell me, there may <hi>another,</hi> and that a more probable cause be given of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stility; and that the searching wit of <hi>Monsieur des Cartes</hi> hath been so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py to discover what it is, <hi>in libr. de Passion. part.</hi> 1. <hi>art.</hi> 47. where he thus reasoneth.
<q>In no other thing <hi>(saith he)</hi> but in the repugnancy that is between the motions which the Body by its spirits, and those which the Soul by her will, do at the same time endeavour to excite in the <hi>Glandula Pinealis</hi> in the brain, consist all the <hi>Conflicts</hi> which Men commonly imagin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>inferior</hi> part of the Soul, which is named the <hi>Sensitive,</hi> and the <hi>Superior,</hi> which is called the <hi>Rational,</hi> or betwixt the <hi>appetites natural</hi> and the <hi>will.</hi> For, in us there is only one Soul, which hath in her no variety of parts: the same that is Sensitive, is also Rational,
<pb facs="tcp:62014:8"/>
and all the appetites thereof are volitions. The <hi>Error</hi> by which divers persons as it were, that are for the most part mutualy contrary, come to be imposed upon her; hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded only from hence, that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto <hi>her</hi> functions have not been sufficiently distinguished from the functions of the <hi>Body</hi>; to which alone is to be ascribed all that can be observed in us to be repugnant to our <hi>reason.</hi> So that here is no other <hi>Contrast,</hi> but that when the <hi>Glandule</hi> seated in the middle of the brain, is impell'd on one part by the <hi>Soul,</hi> and on the other by the <hi>Spirits Animal,</hi> which are nothing but bodies, as I have before decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: it often happens, that those two impulses or impressions are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry each to other, and that the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger hindereth the effect of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker. Now there may be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished two kinds of motions exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Glandule by the spirits:
<pb facs="tcp:62014:9"/>
                  <hi>some</hi> represent to the Soul objects that move the Senses, or impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons found in the brain, and use no force upon the <hi>will; others</hi> use force, namely those that make the <hi>Passions,</hi> or the motions of the body that accompany them. And as for the <hi>first</hi>; though they often hinder the actions of the Soul, or be hindered by them; yet because they are not directly contrary, there is no strife or contention ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in them: but only betwixt the <hi>last</hi> and the <hi>Wills</hi> that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to them; for <hi>Example,</hi> betwixt the endeavour by which the spirits impell the Glandule to induce upon the Soul a <hi>desire</hi> of some one thing, and that by which the Soul repells the same Glandule by her <hi>will</hi> to avoid it. And this chiefly demonstrateth this strife, that since the will hath not power (as hath been already shown) to excite Passions <hi>directly,</hi> the Soul
<pb facs="tcp:62014:9"/>
is therefore compell'd to use art, and to apply herself to the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of various things successively. Whence if it happen that any one of those various things hath the force of changing for a moment the cours of the spirits; it may so fall out, that the next thing that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs to be considered, may want the like force, and the spirits may resume their former cours, because the precedent disposition in the nerves, in the heart, and in the blood, hath not been changed: whereby it comes to pass, that the Soul almost in the same moment feels herself impell'd to <hi>desire</hi> and <hi>decline</hi> the same thing. And this hath given Men occasion of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining in the Soul two powers mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualy repugnant. But yet there may be conceived a certain <hi>Conflict</hi> in this, that oftentimes the same cause that exciteth some Passion in the Soul, exciteth also in the Body
<pb facs="tcp:62014:10"/>
some certain motions, whereunto the Soul contributeth nothing at all, and which she stops, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devours to stop, so soon as she observes them: as is manifest from experience, when that which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citeth <hi>Fear,</hi> causeth also the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to flow into the Muscles that serve to move the leggs to flight; and occasioneth the will of exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing <hi>Courage</hi> to stop them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this Objection therefore I <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer</hi> (1.) that had this excellent Man, <hi>Monsieur des Cartes</hi> been but half as conversant in Anatomy, as he seems to have been in Geometry, doubtles he would never have lodged so noble a guest as the Rational Soul, in so incommodious a closet of the brain, as the <hi>Glandula Pincalis</hi> is; that <hi>use</hi> whereof hath been demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated to be no other but to receive into its spongy cavities, from two little nerves, a certain serous Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to exonerate the same a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
<pb facs="tcp:62014:10"/>
into its vein, which nature hath therefore made much larger than the artery that accompanieth it; and which having no Communication with the external organs of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, cannot with any colour of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son be thought the part of the brain, wherein the Soul exerciseth her prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal faculties of <hi>judging</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding.</hi> (2.) This <hi>Glandule</hi> which he supposeth to be so easily flexible and yielding to contrary impulses, is not loosely suspended, but <hi>fixed:</hi> so that whoever hath once beheld the solid basis, strong consistence, and firm connexion thereof, will hardly ever be brought to allow it capable of any impulse to either side, though by the greatest Hurricano of spirits imaginable; much less by every light motion of them excited by external objects affecting the senses. (3) Though we should grant this Gland to be both the Throne of the Soul, and most easily flexible every way:
<pb facs="tcp:62014:11"/>
yet hath <hi>Des Cartes</hi> left it still uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable, how an Immaterial Agent, not infinite, comes to move by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puls a solid body, without the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of a third thing that is less disparil or disproportionate to both. Now these things duely considered, you will (I presume) no longer ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the Conflicts or Combats that frequently happen within us betwixt the <hi>Rational</hi> and <hi>Sensitive</hi> Appetites, to consist only in the repugnancy of the impulses of this little Glandule by the Spirits on one side, to those of the same Glandule by the Soul on the other. Besides, that the Soul hath power to excite Corporeal Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>directly,</hi> that is, without consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering successively various things; is manifest from her soveraignity o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the body, which in all voluntary actions is absolute and uncontrollable; and in the very instance of <hi>Fear</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged by our Author, where she determineth her <hi>Will</hi> to <hi>Courage</hi> to
<pb facs="tcp:62014:11"/>
oppose the danger suggested, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly</hi> and without running through a long series of various considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for which she then hath not time sufficient. However, evident e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough it is, that this conceipt of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant impulses of this <hi>Gland</hi> in the brain, is so far from giving light to the reason of the Conflict here considered, that it rather augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the obscurity thereof, by imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two contrary Appetites or Wills in one and the same Soul, at one and the same time: Whereas the suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of two Souls mutually opposing each others Appetites, doth render the same intelligible.</p>
            <p>Against this opinion of a <hi>Duality of</hi> Souls in one Man, some have (I well know) with not a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence urged the Sentence of some of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> yea and of whole <hi>Councils</hi> condemning all who should assert it; and more particularly <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</hi> 8. <hi>act.</hi> 10. <hi>Vienn. in Clem.</hi> VII. <hi>&amp; Lateran.</hi> 3. <hi>sess.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62014:12"/>But this, Sir, is <hi>Brutum fulmen,</hi> dangerous to none, terrible only to the Unlearned. For, to any under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing reader of those <hi>decrees,</hi> it is clearly manifest, that the edge of them is turned against first the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin of the <hi>Maniches</hi> holding two human Souls in every individual Man; one polluted with the stain of vices, and derived from an evil prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; the other incontaminate, and proceeding immediately from God, yea more, a particle of the Divine Essence itself; then the <hi>Platonics</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, and <hi>Averrhoists,</hi> teaching that the Rational Soul is not man's <hi>forma informans,</hi> but part of the <hi>Anima Mundi</hi> or Universal Soul: but not against the asserters of two Souls co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existent, one simply Reasonable, the other merely Sensitive, in every single person, in that innocent sense I deliver it. And thus have the same Decrees been judiciously interpreted by the religious Philosophers of the
<pb facs="tcp:62014:12"/>
Collegue of <hi>Conimbra</hi>; who as of all Men they have discoursed most acutely and profoundly of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; so have they with greatest moderation treated the Defendents of this opinion by me here embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. For (<hi>in</hi> 1. <hi>de Generat. cap.</hi> 4. <hi>quaest.</hi> 21. <hi>art.</hi> 2.) though they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly avow their adherence rather to the common belief of the singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Human Soul, as most consentaneous to the sense of the Church: yet they declare also, that the contrary opinion ought not to be censured as heretical or erroneous.</p>
            <p>Why therefore should I fear to espouse it? especially if to the reasons here urged, and others no less con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable alledged by me in the third Section of the Treatise to which this Epistle invites you, be added for confirmation, that so celebrated text of St. <hi>Paul (ad Thessal.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>vers.</hi> 23.) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>integer vester
<pb facs="tcp:62014:13"/>
Spiritus, &amp; anima, &amp; corpus, &amp;c.</hi> Where our most learned <hi>Dr. Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> of pious memory (in his <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations</hi> on the place) conceives the Apostle to divide the whole Man into three constituent parts, viz. the <hi>Body,</hi> which comprehendeth the flesh and members; the <hi>Vital Soul,</hi> which being also Animal or Sensitive, is common likewise to Brutes; and the <hi>Spirit,</hi> by which is denoted the Reasonable Soul originally created by God, infused into the body, and from thence after death to return to God; and this genuin exposition of his he confirms by agreeing testimonies both of Ethnic <hi>Philosophers,</hi> and some ancient <hi>Fathers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To these give me leave to super-add <hi>(ex abundanti)</hi> the concordant suffrages of three eminent Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers of our own age; namely the <hi>Lord Chancellor Bacon,</hi> who (in his 4 <hi>Book of the Advancement of Learning, chap.</hi> 3.) gravely discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb facs="tcp:62014:13"/>
of the parts of Knowledge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Mind or Soul of Man, divideth it into that which declares the nature of the Reasonable Soul, which is a thing Divine; and that which treateth of the Unreasonable Soul, which is common to us with Beasts: and then proceeds to affirm at large, that the former hath its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal from the inspiration or breath of God; the later, from the matrices of the Elements: the <hi>immortal Gassen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, de Physiologia Epicuri, cap. de Animae sede, Passionibms Animi, &amp;c.</hi> and the now flourishing <hi>Dr. Willis, in libr. de Anima Brutorum cap.</hi> 7. whose words I forbear to transcribe, out of design to increase your satisfaction, by obliging you to read them at your leisure in the places cited. Now if solid Reasons, Authority Divine, and the judgment of many sublime Wits and profound Philosophers, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well Ancient as Modern, be of any weight to recommend this neither he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical,
<pb facs="tcp:62014:14"/>
nor improbable opinion to me; certainly I need not blush to incline thereunto. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this, I recount the same <hi>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam in Hypothesi,</hi> only as a <hi>suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi> convenient to solve the <hi>Pheno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi> of the Passions; not as an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of my faith: nor had I so impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely insisted thus long upon argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to justify my approbation thereof, in this Letter; had I not, through want of Books, omitted to doe it where I ought, in the III. <hi>Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the Discourse itself. ¶</p>
            <p>The SECOND advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I owe you, <hi>Friend,</hi> is this, that the greatest part of what is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the same Discourse, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nature, substance, faculties, Knowledge, &amp;c. of a Sensitive Soul, hath been borrowed from that ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate work of our Learned <hi>Dr. Willis de Anima Brutorum,</hi> lately published. Which I hold my self bound here ingeniously to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb facs="tcp:62014:14"/>
left otherwise you might justly condemn me as a <hi>Plagiary,</hi> and that I may invite you also to the pleasure of attentively reading that useful Book. Wherein I found great part of what I had formerly read of that subject in various Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, so well collected, digested and explained; that I chose from thence to copy an image of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Soul of Man, whereupon I was often to reflect my thoughts, while I fate to describe the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable of the Passions to which it is liable: and this I did the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, because at that time I had by me no other Book of the same sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>You are not therefore to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Description of the nature and affections of a Sensitive Soul there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in delivered, as a supposition newly excogitated, and unheard of by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages. For to Men conversant in the Theories of Physiologists con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb facs="tcp:62014:15"/>
that Subject, it is well known, that all the Ancients were so far from holding the Soul of a Brute to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than <hi>Corporeal,</hi> that they for the most part taught their Disciples, that the Soul of <hi>Man</hi> was so too: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a few of them, namely <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras, Plato,</hi> and in some favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sense <hi>Aristotle</hi> (when he defined the Soul by that enigmatical term <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) and his Sectators, <hi>Aristoxe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and <hi>Dicaearchus,</hi> when they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it a <hi>Harmony.</hi> True it is indeed, they were much divided in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions about the <hi>Substance</hi> or <hi>Matter</hi> of a Soul; some imagining it to be of Fire, as <hi>Heraclitus, Democritus, Hipparchus,</hi> and the <hi>Stoicks</hi>; some conceiving it to be on the contrary, of a Watery nature, as <hi>Hippon,</hi> and <hi>Thales</hi>; others fancying it to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of Water and Earth, as <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes</hi>; others, of Earth and Fire, as <hi>Parmenides</hi>; others again, of all the four Elements, as <hi>Empedocles</hi>:
<pb facs="tcp:62014:15"/>
and yet notwithstanding they una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimously consented in these points, that this Corporeal Soul is divisible; composed of particles extremely small, subtil and active; diffused through or coextens to the whole body wherein it is contained; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced at first by generation out of the seed of the parents; perpetualy recruited or regenerated out of the purest and most spirituous part of the nourishment; subject to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction and Expansion in passions; and finally dissolved or extinguished by death. If you doubt of the truth of what I here say, I know not how more easily to convince you, than by referring you to the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable <hi>Gassendus in Lib.</hi> 10. <hi>Diogen. Laert. cap. de natura, contexturàque Animae ad mentem Epicuri:</hi> where you find the same more amply delivered.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile suffer me to recite a pertinent and memorable text of the
<pb facs="tcp:62014:16"/>
               <hi>Lord Verulam</hi>'s (of the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Learning <hi>Book</hi> 4. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.) that now comes into my head.
<q>The Sensible Soul (saith he) must needs be granted to be a Corporeal sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, attenuated by heat and made invisible. I say, a thin, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle gale of wind swell'd and blown up from some flamy and and airy nature; indued with the softness of aire to receive impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and with the vigour of fire to embrace action; nourished partly by an oyly, partly by a watery substance; spread over the body; residing (in perfect creatures) chiefly in the head; running through the nerves; refreshed and repaired by the spirituous part of the blood of the arteries: as <hi>Bernardinus Telesius (de rerum natura lib.</hi> 5.) and his Scholar <hi>Augustinus Donius</hi> have delivered it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And as for the Bipartition of this Sensitive Soul into two principle
<pb facs="tcp:62014:16"/>
members as it were, or active sour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; vix. the <hi>Fiery</hi> part, upon which <hi>Life</hi> depends; and the <hi>Lucid,</hi> from whence all the faculties <hi>Animal</hi> are, like so many distinct rayes of light, derived: I will not affirm it to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>ancient</hi>: but yet methinks, I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern more than a shadow thereof in some lines of the same most acute <hi>Lord Bacon (de vita &amp; morte, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicatione canonis quartae</hi>) which are these.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Spiritus</hi> vitalis <hi>omnis sibi continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, per quosdam canales, per quos permeat, nec totaliter intercipitur.

            </p>
            <p>This place of that Prince of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Philosophers, the <hi>Lord St. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans,</hi> conjoyned to that other of his immediately precedent, seems to me to contain a pourtraiture of the Sensitive Soul, drawn indeed as in perspective, in colours somwhat faint, and not accurately ground; yet with good judgment, and bold strokes of the pencill, such as give it no obscure resemblance of the original. And if you (Sir) please to compare it with the more ample description of the same Sensitive Soul, lately set forth by <hi>Dr. Willis</hi>: it will not be difficult to you, to observe, in how many things they agree. ¶</p>
            <p>The THIRD and last thing whereof I am here to advertise you, is, that in the description of many of the <hi>Passions</hi> likewise, I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven
<pb facs="tcp:62014:18"/>
some threds taken from the webbs of those three excellent Men, <hi>Gassendus, Des Cartes,</hi> and our <hi>Mr. Hobbes</hi>; who have all writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten most judiciously of that obstruse theme. Nor will I otherwise ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse myself for being so liberal to you, of what I owe to the bounty of those richer Wits; than by reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting what your beloved <hi>Seneca</hi> said to his dear <hi>Lucilius,</hi> in defense of his adopting for his own so many wise and memorable sentences of his, and our <hi>Oracle, Epicurus: adhuc de alieno liberalis sum. Quare autem alienum dixi? quicquid benè dictum est ab ullo, meum est. Epist.</hi> 16. I will only add, as a reason of my so frank communication of these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polished papers to you, who are my <hi>Lucilius,</hi> what the same <hi>Latin Stoic</hi> most affectionately p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Reasonable Soul of Man seems to be of a Nature so <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Excellent,</hi> that it is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Understanding all things that are in this life intelligible: but yet so <hi>reserved</hi> and <hi>abstruse</hi> withall, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not understand <hi>itself</hi>; as many most sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime Wits, who had long exercised and perplex'd themselves in enquiries into the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62014:26"/>
hidden and mysterious Essence thereof, have at length ingenuously confess'd.</p>
            <p>Well therefore may we without blush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, own our ignorance of this noblest part of our selves, from which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive all our <hi>Knowledge.</hi> Well may we without regret content our Curiosity with those faint glimmerings of light, which shine through the <hi>Operations</hi> of this Celestial guest in our frail and darksom Tabernacles of Flesh; and which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected upon our Understanding, only from the illustrious <hi>Effects</hi> of its proper Powers and Acts.</p>
            <p>What these <hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> are, and how vastly they transcend the energie of a <hi>Sensitive</hi> Soul, how perfect soever in its kind; as also in what exercises of the Mind they are chiefly observable; hath been by Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby</hi> in his Book of the <hi>Rational Soul,</hi> copiously declared. So that here they need not to be repeated. Nor indeed would such a prolix research be consistent with my present design; which principally aim's at a recollection of some notions, that have partly in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, partly in meditation, occurred to me, concerning the various <hi>Passions</hi> of the Mind, their <hi>Genealogy,</hi> their first <hi>sour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> and resorts, their most remarkable <hi>Differences, Motions,</hi> and <hi>Forces,</hi> and in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62014:27"/>
fine, by what kind of <hi>Connexion</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse betwixt two so disparate Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the one Incorporeal, the other Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, it is, that the <hi>Rational</hi> Soul is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively coaffected by them. And this with as much brevity, as the amplitude of the Subject can admit; with as much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuity, as my weak reason can attain unto, in an argument so sublime and difficult.</p>
            <p>That I may then effect this my Design, if not so happily, as in the end to arrive at the certain and demonstrative Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth I seek; yet so plausibly at least, as to form an <hi>Hypothesis</hi> by which the Nature and Reasons of the principal, and most predominant of our Passions, may be congruously and with probability explained: it is requisite I begin with these few <hi>Preliminaries.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. What kind of thing I suppose the <hi>Sensitive</hi> Soul to be, as well in Man, as in Brutes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What seem's to me most consentaneous concerning the Original, Nature, and royal Seat of the <hi>Rational</hi> Soul.</p>

predominion of <hi>that,</hi> in others; and whence their mutual consent, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
            <p>For, my present Conceptions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning these things, though I foresee, I shall not be able to establish them all upon Reasons irrefutable and cogent: are yet nevertheless to be here premised, as <hi>Postulates</hi> or Fundamentals, for intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction and support of the following Theory about the Passions.

            <p>AS for the FIRST <hi>Postulatum</hi>;<note place="margin">Article 1. First <hi>Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,</hi> that a <hi>Sensitive</hi> Soul is <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal.</hi>
               </note> the <hi>Sensitive</hi> Soul of a Brute Animal, I conceive to be <hi>Corporeal,</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Divisible, Coextense</hi> to the whole Body; of a <hi>Substance</hi> either Fiery, or meerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling Fire; of a <hi>consistence</hi> most <hi>thin</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:62014:28"/>
and <hi>subtile,</hi> not much unlike the flame of of pure spirit of Wine, burning in a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Lantern, or other the like close place.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Art. 2. Two <hi>reasons</hi> of that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</note>
               <hi>First,</hi> I think it to be <hi>Corporeal, Divisible,</hi> and <hi>Coextense</hi> to the whole Body; and that for <hi>two reasons,</hi> among many others not the least considerable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>One</hi> is this; that many, and divers Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal actions are daily observed to be, at one and the same time, performed by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Parts and Members of the Body: for instance, the Eye sees, the Ear hears, the Nostrils smell, the Tongue tasteth, and all exteriour Members exercise their Sense and Motion, all at once. For as much then as betwixt the Body and Soul of a Brute, there is no <hi>Medium</hi> (both being intimately connexed) but the Members and Parts of the Body are Instruments fram'd for the use of the Soul: what else can be imagined, but that many and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct portions of the Soul so extended, do inform and actuate the distinct Organs and Members of the Body; each in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar manner, respective to the peculiar Constitution, Fabrique, and Office there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Other</hi> this; it is observed also, that Vipers, Eels, Earthworms, and most o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Reptils</hi> being cut into many pieces; all pieces for a good while after retain a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62014:28"/>
manifest Motion, and no obscure sense; for, being prick'd, they contract and shrink up themselves, as sensible of the Hurt, and striving to avoid it. And this proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly from hence, that these less perfect Animals having their liquors, both Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and Animal, of a consistence viscous, and not easily dissoluble or dissipable; and having their Soul, if not equally, yet universally diffused, and all its parts subsisting immediately in those liquors: cannot suffer a division of their Body, without division of their Soul also; the parts whereof residing for some time after, in the segments of the Body, may perhaps for that time continue to actuate them to Motion and Sense. It hath been more then once unhappily Experimented, that the Head of a Viper hath bitten a Mans Finger, and Poysoned him too, above an hour after it had been cut off. Not by involuntary convulsion of the Nerves and Muscles of the Vipers Jaws, such as not rarely happen to Animals, in the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Death; for those probably could neither last so long, nor so regularly open and shut the mouth, and extend the two fang teeth, by contraction of their erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Muscles: but certainly by an action voluntary, regular and suggested by sense, and perhaps revenge too. Whence I am
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62014:29"/>
apt to suspect, that not only part of the Vipers Soul, but <hi>Anger</hi> and <hi>Revenge</hi> also survived in the divided head. For, it is well known, the bite of a Viper is never Venomous, but when he is enraged: the Chrystalline liquor contained in the two little Glandules at the roots of his fang teeth, being then by a copious afflux of Spirits from the Brain, and other brisk mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereupon impress'd, in anger (of all passions the most violent and impetuous) so altered, and exalted, as to become high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly active and venenate; whereas at other times, when a Viper is not offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and provok'd, the same Liquor is found to be as harmless as the spittle of a Man in perfect health. But whether from the dangerous effects of this biting, the dire Symptoms that thereupon ensued, it be inferrible, or not, that in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scinded head of the beast there remained anything of Anger and Revenge: in my poor judgment 'tis very evident from the very act of biting, there still remained somwhat of <hi>life, sense,</hi> and <hi>voluntary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Which is sufficient to verify my present supposition, that a Sensitive Soul is divisible and coextense to the whole body it animates.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:62014:29"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Art. 3. Second <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,</hi> that the <hi>substance</hi> of a sensitive Soul is <hi>fiery.</hi>
               </note> I think the same Sensitive Soul to consist of <hi>Fire,</hi> or some matter analogous to Fire: and the <hi>Reasons</hi> indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing me to be of this opinion, are many. Some I have formerly alleadged, where I discourse of the <hi>Flame of life</hi> perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arising from accension of the Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous and inflammable parts of the blood, while circulated through the heart and lungs: which therefore I abstain from reciting in this place.

                  </hi>
               </note> or <hi>Soul</hi> of Brute Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, is seated principally in their <hi>Blood</hi>; we are plainly taught even by the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of truth itself, the dictates of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wisdom that created them: and that <hi>Blood,</hi> and <hi>Fire</hi> subsist by the same princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, viz. <hi>Aliment</hi> and <hi>Ventilation</hi>; is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from hence, that a defect of either of these, doth equally destroy both the one and the other.</p>
            <p>Should you here exact from me some description of the <hi>Essence</hi> of <hi>Fire,</hi> I should adventure to tell you, that it seems to be only a multitude of most minute and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile particles, mutually touching each other, put into a most rapid motion, and by continual succession of some parts, and decession of others, renewed: which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62014:30"/>
conserves its motion, and subsistence, by preying upon, and consuming the <hi>Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous</hi> parts of its subject matter, or fewel, and the <hi>Nitrous</hi> parts of the ambient aer. For, even our sense bears witness, that from the particles of this twofold ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Sulphureous</hi> and <hi>Nitrous,</hi> resolved to the last degree of smalness, and by a most violent and rapid motion agitated, the forms of <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Flame</hi> (which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer only in degrees of density, and velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of motion) do wholy result.</p>
            <p>Nor doth the image I find drawn in my brain of the <hi>Soul</hi> of a <hi>Brute,</hi> much differ from this description of the nature of Fire. I conceive it to be no other than a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain congregation of most minute, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til and agile particles, corpuscles or atoms (call them what you please) crowded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; which being, in the very first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life, put into brisk and most rapid motion, like that of the particles of Fire when first kindled; do so long conserve that motion, and their own subsistence, as they have a continued supply of conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient nutriment; sulphureous from the blood within, Nitrous from the aer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; and no longer. For we cannot but observe, that the Souls of all Brute Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, of what kind soever, stand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually in need of a fresh supply of those
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62014:30"/>
two sorts of aliment; insomuch that so soon as the recruit fails, they languish and dye: no otherwise than the flame of a lamp grows weak and dim, and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished, for want of oyl or air. But (what is very remarkable) besides <hi>fire</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> there is not to be found in all nature any other thing whatsoever, to whose act and subsistence such a supply of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous and Nitrous matter is necessary.

Which, as the flower of the whole matter, in the formation of the <hi>Embrion,</hi> emerging out of the grosser mass, and mutually uniting; first force passages convenient for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves through the whole compage of the Body, and then constitute one continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thin, and as it were spirituous Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasis, adequate and coextense to the same. For, so soon as any matter is dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed towards animation; by the law of the <hi>Creation</hi> (not by <hi>Epicurus</hi>'s fortuitous concurse of Atoms) the Soul at the same time, which is called the <hi>Form,</hi> and the Body, which is called the <hi>Matter,</hi> begin to be formed together, under a certain species, according to the modell or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter impressed upon them. When the more agile, and spirituous particles of the seminal matter, having freed themselves from the other parts of it, quickly assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble together; and by little and little rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing a commotion, stir up, and agitate the grosser particles, and by degrees dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

them into fit postures and places, where they ought to remain and cohere; and so form the body according to the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure or shape preordained by the Creator. Mean while this congregation of subtile and active Particles, or the Soul, which by expansion enlargeth it self, and insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating her particles among others more gross, and as it were interweaving them, frames the body, is it self exactly confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the figure and dimensions of the same body, coextended and adapted to it, as to a case or sheath, doth actuate, enliven, and inspire all and all parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

            <p>Now according to this notion,<note place="margin">Art. 6. A <hi>Sensitive</hi> Soul imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be of the same <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure</hi> also with the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> wherein it is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> a Sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Soul may be conceived to be a most <hi>subtle body contained in a gross one, and in all points, of the same Figure with it</hi>; or as it were a Spectre made up of exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, such as some vain, or superstitious heads have somtimes imagined to ascend from, and hover over the graves of the dead, and called them Ghosts.

its determinate subsistence, conform to the idea or Type consigned to it by the Law of Nature. But though the same be intimately united to the body, and every where closely intertexd with all parts of it; as the warp and woof are interwoven in cloth: yet so fine and subtle are the threads of which it doth consist, that it cannot possibly by our senses be discerned, nor indeed be known, otherwise than by its own Effects and Operations. Moreover, when by any violence done either to it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, or its Copartner, the Body, the life of this Soul is destroyed; instantly the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of which it was composed, their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual cohesion being dissolved, disperse themselves, and fly away, not leaving any the least print or mark of their late subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: and the Body now destitute of its conserving inmate, the Soul, speedily tends to corruption; which sooner or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, according to the less or greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pactness of the parts of the body, dissolves that likewise into its first Principles, or Elements.</p>

be, in the very instant it ceaseth from Motion, wherein the very life of both doth consist; nor can either of the two be, by any means whatever, redintegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, so as to be numerically the same thing it was. From whence it seems a genuine consequence, that the Essence, or Being of a Sensitive Soul, hath its beginning whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from life, as from the accension or kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a certain subtile and inflammable matter. To render this yet more plain; when in the Genital matter, swarms of active, and spirituous, chiefly Sulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous particles, predisposed to animation, have met with a less number of Saline par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, in a convenient <hi>focus</hi>; being as it were kindled, sometimes by another Soul (as in all <hi>Vivaparous</hi> Animals) viz. of the <hi>Generant,</hi> somtimes by their own rapid mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as it happens in <hi>Oviparous</hi>) they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive life, or break forth into a kind of flame, which thenceforth continues to burn so long as it is constantly fed with sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous fewel from within, and nitrous from without; but instantly perisheth, when either through defect of such ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or violence from external agents, it comes once to be extinct. This Act of the Corporeal Soul, or enkindling of the vital matter, is in more perfect Animals, such as are furnished with hot blood, so
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62014:33"/>
manifestly accompanied with great heat, fuliginous exhalations, and other effects of fire, or flame; that it is difficult for even the most Sceptical person in the World to doubt, that the blood is really in a continual burning, and that life is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Flame it self, than only like it. But in other Animals less perfect, and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with blood less hot; though we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not say their Soul is properly Flame: yet we may say, it is somwhat very like it, namely a swarm of most subtile, active and as it were fiery particles, or a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Halitus</hi>: which included in the body, doth move and agitate the denser mass thereof, and inspire the whole, and actuate all the members, and in some with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable agility, even beyond that of more perfect Animals; as may be observed in some Reptils and Insects.

are of a more, others of a less perfect order; and as they are diversly configu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, according to the several places in this great Theatre of the World, in which they are consigned to live and act their several parts: so we see their Souls are, by the wise bounty of the Creator, instructed with diverse inclinations, facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and appeties, directive to the ends to which they were predestined. In a word; since there ought to be an exact proportion and congruity betwixt every organical Body, and the Soul that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms and animates it; and that for that reason, Nature seems to have diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sified and distinguished the various Kinds of Brute Animals, by an equal diversity of their bodily structures and configura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, easily discernable by the sight: we may even from thence alone conclude, that their Corporeal Souls likewise are no less various, and endowed with Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and Proprieties answerably diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62014:39"/>
from a too plentifull infusion of the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive liquor, as from a gloomy cloud overcast, seems replete with vapours; so that in sleep, the <hi>Lucid</hi> part of the Soul is wholly obscured, and envellop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped as it were with darkness.

So that we can scarcely perceive, or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine any thing without disquiet and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion: and at the apprehension of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most any object whatsoever, the whole Soul is moved, and put into a trembling, and the substance of it variously agitated, as a field of corn is waved to and fro by contrary gusts of winds.</p>
            <p>Nor do these agitations, especially if they be any whit violent, stop at the <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive</hi> part of the Soul, or spirits Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal (which I imagine to make a kind of <hi>lucid Fluidum,</hi> subject to Undulations or waving motions throughout, upon either external, or internal impulses) but, as waves rowl on till they arrive at the shore, are carried on, by an Undulating

motion, even to the <hi>Vital</hi> part glowing in the blood; and impelling the flame thereof hither and thither, make it to burn unequaly.

precedent speculations concerning the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and proprieties of a Sensitive Soul, will fall to the ground; as an arch that wants a key, or middle-stone to support all the rest.</p>
            <p>It is concerning the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of Brutes, by which they are directed in actions <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, supposing all we have hitherto been discoursing of the <hi>Origin, Substance, Subsistence, Parts, Faculties, Inclinations, Passions</hi> and <hi>Alterations</hi> of a Corporeal Soul, to be true and evident (which is more than I dare assume) yet doth it not from thence appear, what such a Soul can by her own proper virtue do more than a <hi>Machine</hi> artificialy fram'd and put into motion. To speak more plainly; tho it be granted; that first th' impression made by an external object upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of sense, doth by impelling the Animal Spirits inwards, and by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing them into a certain peculiar fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, or mode (as the <hi>Cartesians</hi> speak) cause the act of <hi>Sensation,</hi> or simple <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception</hi>; and that then the same spirits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding, as it were by a reflex undula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, outward from the brain into the nerves and muscles, produce <hi>local motions:</hi> granting this, I say, yet still we are to seek, How this Soul, or any one part of it,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62014:41"/>
comes to be <hi>conscious</hi> of Sensation, or how it can, by a <hi>reflex</hi> act (as the Schools phrase it) <hi>perceive that it doth perceive,</hi> and according to that percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is impell'd to diverse acts, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to an <hi>appetite</hi> of this, or that good, and somtimes in prosecution of the good desired, to perform <hi>actions</hi> that seem to be the results of <hi>counsel</hi> and <hi>deliberation,</hi> such as are daily observed to be done by several sorts of Beasts, as well wild as domestic. In <hi>Man</hi> indeed, it seems not difficult to conceive, that the <hi>Rational</hi> Soul, as president of all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>inferiour fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and constantly speculating the impressions, or images represented to her by the Sensitive, as by a mirrour; doth first form to herself conceptions and notions correspondent to their nature, and then proceed to acts of <hi>reason, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>will.</hi> But as for Brutes that are irrational; in what manner the percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, distinction, appetite, memory of objects, and other acts resulting from an inferior kind of reason, are in them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formd: this, I confess, is more than I can yet understand. Some there are, I know, who rather then acknowledge their insufficiency to solve this Problem; have attributed to <hi>Brutes</hi> also Souls <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material,</hi> and <hi>subsistent</hi> after separation
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62014:41"/>
from their bodies. But these conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not, that the Soul of a Brute, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever docil and apprehensive, and using organs in their structure very little (if at all) different from those in the head of Man, can yet have no capacity of Arts and Sciences, nor raise it self up to any objects, or acts, but what are <hi>Material</hi>: and that by consequence, the same is different from, and inferiour to the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> Soul of Man, and <hi>material.</hi> So that instead of solving the Doubt, by teaching us, how from a certain Modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of subtil <hi>matter,</hi> there may result such <hi>Power,</hi> which residing in the brain of a Brute, may there receive without confusion all impressions or images brought in by the Senses, distinctly speculate, judge and know them, and then raise appetites, and imploy the other facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in acts respective to that knowledge, and to those appetites: instead of this, I say, they have entangled themselves in an absurd Error, ascribing to a thing meerly <hi>material,</hi> a capacity of knowing <hi>objects immaterial,</hi> and performing <hi>actions</hi> proper only to <hi>immaterial</hi> Beings.</p>
            <p>We are therefore to search for this <hi>Power</hi> of a Sensitive Soul, by which she is <hi>conscious</hi> of her own perception, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Matter</hi> in a peculiar manner so, or
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62014:42"/>
so disposed or modified. But in what mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? this of the <hi>Soul,</hi> or that of the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>? Truely, if you shall distinctly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine either the Soul or the Body of a Brute, as not conjoyned and united in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one <hi>Compositum</hi>; you will have a hard task of it, to find in either of them, or indeed in any other material subject whatever, any thing to which you may reasonably attribute such an <hi>Energetic</hi> and <hi>self-moving Power.</hi> But if you consider the <hi>whole</hi> Brute, as a <hi>Body animated,</hi> and by divine art of an infinite wisdom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed, framed and qualified for certain ends and uses: then you may safely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that a Brute is, by the law of the Creation, or institute of Almighty God, so comparated, as that from Soul and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy united, such a confluence of Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties should result, as are necessary to the ends and uses for which it was made. Do but convert your thoughts awhile upon <hi>Mechanic Engines,</hi> and seriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the motions, powers and effects of them. They are all composed indeed of gross, solid and ponderous Materials: and yet such is the design, contrivance and artifice of their various parts, as that from the figures and motions of them, there result certain and constant opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, answerable to the intent of the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62014:42"/>
Artist, and far transcending the forces of their divided ingredients. Before the invention of <hi>Clocks</hi> and <hi>Watches,</hi> who could expect, that of iron and brass, dull and heavy metalls, a machine should be framed; which consisting of a few wheels endented, and a spring regularly disposed, should in its motions rival the celestial orbs, and without the help or direction of any external Mover, by repeted revolutions measure the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive spaces of time even to minutes and seconds, as exactly almost as the diurnal revolutions of the Terrestrial globe itself? and yet now such Machins are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made even by some Blacksmiths, and mens admiration of their pretty artifice long since ceased. If then in vulgar Mechanics, the contrivance and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious disposition of matter, be more noble and efficacious than matter itself: certainly in a <hi>Living Creature,</hi> in a <hi>Body animate,</hi> the Powers emergent from a conspiracy and cooperation of so many, so various organs, and all so admirably formed, ought to be acknowledged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably more noble, and more Ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getic. If the art of <hi>Man,</hi> weak and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Man, can give to bodies, of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves weighty, sluggish and unactive, figure, connexion and motion fit to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62014:43"/>
effects beyond the capacity of their single natures: what ought we to think of the divine art of the <hi>Creator,</hi> whose <hi>Power</hi> is infinite, because his <hi>wisedom</hi> is so? Could not <hi>He,</hi> think you, who by the voice of his Will call'd the World out of Chaos, and made so many my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riads of different Beings out of one and the same universal matter; could not He, when He created <hi>Brutes,</hi> so fashion and organize the various parts and members of their Bodies <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thereto so adjust the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and more active contexture of their spirituous Souls, and impress such moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon them, as that from the union and cooperation of both, a <hi>Syndrome</hi> or conspiracy of Faculties or Powers should arise, by which they might be qualified and inabled to live, move and act re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively to the proper uses and ends of their Creation? Undoubtedly He could; and tis part of my belief, that He did. Nor do I more wonder at the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of Beasts, by which they are directed in the election of objects, and in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution or avoidance of them; than I do at their simple <hi>Perception</hi> of them by their outward senses: since I conceive the one to be as much <hi>Mechanical,</hi> as the other, though perhaps the reason of the one, is of more difficult explication than that of the other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:62014:43"/>When you hear the Musick of a <hi>Church Organ,</hi> is it not as pleasant to your mind, as the Musick is to your ear, to consider how so many grateful notes, and consonances that compose the charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Harmony, do all arise only from wind blown into a set of pipes gradualy different in length and bore, and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively let into them by the apertures of their valves? and do you not then observe the Effect of this so artificial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument highly to excell both the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials of it, and the hand of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganist that plaies upon it? the like Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony you have perhaps somtimes heard from a <hi>Musical Water-work,</hi> as the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar calls it; an <hi>Organ</hi> that plaied of it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, without the hands of a Musician to press the jacks, meerly by the force of a stream of Water opening and shuting the valves alternately, and in an order predesign'd to produce the harmonical sounds, consonances and modes requisite to the composition, to which it had been set.</p>
            <p>Now, to the <hi>first</hi> of these <hi>Organs</hi> you may compare a <hi>Man</hi>; in whom the <hi>Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal</hi> Soul seems to perform the office of the <hi>Organist,</hi> while governing and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the Animal Spirits in all their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, she disposeth and ordereth all Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62014:44"/>
of the inferior, or Sensitive Soul, according to her will and pleasure: and so makes a kind of Harmony of <hi>Reason, Sense,</hi> and <hi>Motion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to the <hi>Other,</hi> or <hi>Hydraulic</hi> Organ you may compare a <hi>Brute,</hi> whose <hi>Sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Soul being scarcely moderatrix of of herself, and her Faculties, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in order to certain ends necessary to her nature, perform many trains of actions; but such as are (like the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous parts of an Harmonical Compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) regularly prescribed (as the notes of a Tune are prickd down) by the law of her creation, and determined for the most part to the same thing; viz. the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of herself. So that she seems to produce an Harmony of <hi>Life, Sense</hi> and <hi>Motion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this <hi>Analogy</hi> seems to be much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Brutes of the <hi>lowest</hi> order, such upon whose Souls or natures there are not many Types or Notes of actions to be done by them, imprinted; and which according to that common saying of the Schools, <hi>non tam agunt, quàm aguntur,</hi> act rather by necessary impulse, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, than freely; and of their own accord: than in more perfect Animals, whose actions are ordained to more, and more considerable uses; and upon whose
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62014:44"/>
Souls therefore more original lessons are as it were prick'd, down; and to which we cannot justly deny a power of both <hi>varying</hi> those innate prints, and <hi>compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> them one with another occasionaly. Which Power seems to be radicated in the <hi>Corporeal Soul,</hi> by nature so constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as to be <hi>knowing</hi> and <hi>active</hi> in some certain things necessary to it; and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble also of being afterward taught, by various accidents usually affecting it, both to know other things, and to do far more, and more intricate actions.</p>
            <p>All the <hi>Knowledge</hi> therefore these more <hi>perfect</hi> Brutes are observed to have,<note place="margin">Art. 17.

The <hi>Other</hi> is by little and little <hi>acquired,</hi> by the daily <hi>perception</hi> of <hi>new objects,</hi> by <hi>imitation,</hi> by <hi>experience,</hi> by <hi>mans teaching,</hi> and by some other waies: and in some Brutes, is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to a higher degree than in others.

and <hi>Cunning</hi> also (how great soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver) doth in some of them depend alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether upon <hi>instinct natural,</hi> and the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent use of it.</p>
            <p>Here it would not perhaps be very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult for me to recount, what sorts of <hi>actions</hi> done by more perfect Beasts, are referrible to their <hi>Congenite</hi> Knowledge alone; what to their acquired alone; and what to a combination of both. I could also shew how their acquir'd knowledge ariseth by degrees from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of new objects, from examples, or imitation, from experience and other adventitious helps just now mentioned. I might moreover explain in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the <hi>direct</hi> images of things brought into the common Sensory, produce first <hi>Imagination,</hi> and then <hi>Memory</hi>; how the same images <hi>reflex'd,</hi> instantly raise <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,</hi> if they appear good and agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; or <hi>Aversion,</hi> if displeasing and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; and how thereupon in the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant <hi>Local Motions</hi> succeed, for prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or avoidance of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. All these, I say, I might deduce from notions competent to a <hi>Corporeal</hi> Soul, and from the powers of a Body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and actuated thereby, both being comparated for such determinate actions by artifice Divine; without bringing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

to the scene any <hi>immaterial</hi> natures (as some have done) to solve the difficulties concerning the science or knowledge of Brutes. But because these arguments have been already handled by many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Men, and curious wits, <hi>Sir Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelm Digby, Monsieur des Cartes, Mr. Hobbes,</hi> &amp;c. and most accurately by <hi>Dr. Willis,</hi> in his late Book <hi>de Anima Brutorum,</hi> and because a further inquisition into them is not absolutely necessary to my design of explicating the reasons of the <hi>Passions</hi>: I therefore shall ad no more concerning them; but contenting myself with the hints I have given, conclude this Section with two pertinent and remarkable clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
            <p>Manifest it is,<note place="margin">Art. 18.

            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:62014:46"/>Neither are we to give credit to their opinion who hold,<note place="margin">Art. 19. Nor <hi>Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Necessity.</hi>
               </note> that all such actions arise from a kind of <hi>Material Necessity</hi> (such as <hi>Democritus</hi> fancied) and without any intention, or Scope aimed at by the Beasts themselves; merely from the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity</hi> or <hi>incongruity</hi> of images impressed upon the organ of the sense affected: as if Brute Animals were as little conscious of their own actings, as artificial En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines are of their motions, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of them. For we cannot but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that Brutes, by virtue of natural instinct, perform not only <hi>simple</hi> acts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by some one single impression made upon this or that Sensory, by an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal agent, or object; as when the scorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heat of the Sun in sommer beating upon them, makes them to retire to cool and shady places for refuge: but also ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other <hi>Compound</hi> actions, such to which a long series, or chain of subservient acts is required. For instance; in the Spring, when Birds feeling the warmth and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorating (I had almost call'd it also the <hi>prolific</hi>) influence of th' approaching Sun (that Universal Adjutant of Generation) find themselves pleasantly instigated to their duety of <hi>Propagation</hi>; then, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other impulse, or direction, but that of natural instinct, they dextrously,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62014:47"/>
and as it were with counsel and delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, address themselves chiefly to that most delightful work. First, with a kind of chearful Solemnity they choose, and espouse their Mates, all their Femals bringing love, obsequiousness, diligence and feather-beds for their dowry. Then they seek for places convenient to reside in, and there with skill and art excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the proudest of humane Architecture, they build their Nests. Which are no sooner finished, than they lay their Eggs therein. Upon these in the next place they sit with admirable constancy and patience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> untill they have hatch'd them. And that great work done, they in fine with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary tenderness and care feed, cherish and protect their young, till they are able to live of themselves. Now here, you see, is a multiplicity of actions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly and with design done in order to one grand scope, or end: such as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not possibly proceed from simple impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of external objects. 'Twere easy for me here to invite you to reflect on the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Republics of <hi>Bees</hi> and <hi>Pismires,</hi> in which all the constitutions of a most perfect Government are exemplified: yet without writen laws or promulgation of Right: but the former example is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. I conclude then, that since in all
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62014:47"/>
these, the affairs or businesses of Brutes are managed and administred always af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one and the same manner, without any variety: that is a convincing argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the enterprises and works of Brutes of this sort, are excited neither by <hi>external objects,</hi> whose impulse is ever various; nor by any internal <hi>purpose</hi> of mind, which is more mutable than the wind; but by a principle more <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>fix'd,</hi> and always <hi>determined</hi> to one thing; which can be nothing else but <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural instinct.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And how far the power and influence of this <hi>instinct</hi> may extend toward the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation of the various <hi>Passions</hi> to which the <hi>Sensitive Soul</hi> is of her own nature subject and prone; will appear more clearly from our subsequent Enquiry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their proper causes and motions: to which I now hasten; having thus long detained you in hearing what seems to me most probable and consentaneous to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, concerning the substance, original, proprieties and faculties of the <hi>Sensitive Soul,</hi> common to Man with Brutes.

            <p>This is a <hi>Verity</hi> so obvious to every Man of common sense and understanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so evident by its own splendor; that it needs neither <hi>Arguments</hi> drawn from rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

It being therefore unnecessary for me by prolix reasoning to evince, and superfluous by multiplicity of instances to elucidate the vast disparity betwixt the proper <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Operations</hi> of a <hi>Reasonable</hi> Soul, and those inferior ones of a <hi>Sensitive</hi>: I shall only in brief, and analytically recount to you a few of those many <hi>Excellencies</hi> and <hi>Prerogatives</hi> essential to the former, and by the law of nature incommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the later.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Preeminence</hi> then of Mans <hi>Reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable</hi> Soul is undeniably manifest from both her <hi>Objects,</hi> and her <hi>Acts.</hi>

               </note> true or false, real or imaginary, within or without the World, sensible or insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, infinite or finite: for, to all these can she extend her unconfined power of speculation. I doubt indeed, whether it be possible for her in this life, while she is obliged to speculate all things by the help of images, or corporeal represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, to have an adequate, and full cognition of the superexcellent nature of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62014:49"/>
               <hi>God</hi>: but yet it cannot be denied, that she is capable of knowing for certain, that there <hi>is</hi> such an incomprehensible Being as God, and that He is <hi>infinite</hi> and <hi>Eternal.</hi> I doubt also, whether the mind of Man be capable of any true notion of an <hi>Angell, Spirit, Daemon</hi> or other the like Beings which the Schools commonly (how intelligibly, let others dispute) call <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material Substances</hi>; because I myself can represent to my thoughts nothing but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der some certain figure and quantity, which are inseparable from body: and yet who dares deny th' <hi>Existence</hi> of such Beings in the World? To speculate such objects then, as fall not under the perception of any of the senses, is the prerogative of a <hi>Rational</hi> Soul: nor can a <hi>Sensitive</hi> possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have any knowledge of things above the sphere of her own nature; all her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties being <hi>corporeal,</hi> and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence <hi>limited</hi> to corporeal objects, and those too no other than what are percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible by the <hi>senses.</hi>

Moreover, it restrains the <hi>Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasy,</hi> of itself instable and prone to ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble through various phantasms; calls it away from extravagant and useless con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, directs it to others more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to reason, and at pleasure confines it within certain bounds, that it may not divert, or range too wide from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. All which Acts give clear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that there is in <hi>Man</hi> a Soul supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the sensitive, and which mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62014:50"/>
and governs all the faculties and operations of it: yea, more yet, which from representations sensible deduces ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other notions of things altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to sense, and which the Phantasy is of itself wholly incapable to imagine. For, it understands <hi>Axioms,</hi> or first prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and that by its own power alone, without recourse to corporeal <hi>species</hi>: and (what is yet more noble and sublime) by a reflex act views <hi>itself,</hi> thinks that it thinks, from thence certainly know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its' own <hi>Existence,</hi> which cannot be either perceived by sense, or imagined by Phantasy. Whereas neither the <hi>Sense,</hi> nor <hi>Imagination</hi> (for of these there are no images extant) can perceive that they perceive, or imagine. To these royal prerogatives of Mans <hi>Rational</hi> Soul, let us subjoyn the native right she hath to the whole <hi>Encyclopaedia</hi> or Zodiac of <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences; Theology, Logic, Physic, Metaphysics, Mathematics, Algebra, Geometry, Astronomy, Mechanics:</hi> which being all (<hi>Theology</hi> alone excepted) the products or creatures of Mans <hi>Mind,</hi> sufficiently attest their Author to be an <hi>Agent Spiritual,</hi> admirably <hi>intelligent, immaterial,</hi> and therefore <hi>immortal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if this be true (as most certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is) then one of these two <hi>Assumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:62014:50"/>
must be so too. Either the <hi>Rational</hi> Soul of man doth <hi>alone</hi> perform all offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces not only of <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> and <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,</hi> but of <hi>sense</hi> also, and <hi>life</hi>; and so administer the whole oeconony of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature. Or else there are in every individual Man <hi>two</hi> distinct Souls conjoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and acting together: one, only <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi>; t'other merely <hi>Sensitive</hi>; that as <hi>Queen</hi> regent, this as <hi>inferior</hi> and <hi>subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The FIRST seems to me not a little improbable.<note place="margin">Art. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Sense</hi> depend not on the the <hi>Rational</hi> Soul of man.</note>
            </p>
            <p>For, (1) all acts of the Senses, and animal Motions, as likewise the Passions, are <hi>corporeal, divided</hi> and <hi>extended,</hi> to various parts: and therefore the <hi>Rational</hi> Soul, which we conceive to be <hi>incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real, indivisible</hi> and <hi>finite,</hi> seems incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to cause or impress those motions <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,</hi> or by herself. To me (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess) it seems Unintelligible, how an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal Agent, not infinite, can physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally act in, and upon a gross body <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,</hi> or without the intervention of a third thing; which though corporeal too, is yet notwithstanding of parts so spirituous, and of a constitution so sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til, as to approach somwhat neerer to the nature of a pure <hi>Spirit,</hi> than solid and ponderous body doth. <hi>Flame,</hi> and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62014:51"/>
               <hi>light</hi> I acknowledge to be <hi>bodies</hi>; but yet methinks there is less of <hi>disproportion,</hi> or disparity betwixt them and a substance purely spiritual, than is betwixt a pure <hi>Spirit</hi> and a gross, heavy body, such as ours is. And therefore in my weak judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is more conceivable that the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable</hi> Soul should have some spirituous, and subtile thing as flame, or light is, viz. the <hi>Sensitive</hi> Soul, conjoyned with her, to be a convenient <hi>Medium</hi> betwixt herself and the gross body, to receive her immediate influence, and actuate the body according to her will and pleasure: than it is, that she should <hi>immediately</hi> move and actuate the body, betwixt whose nature and her own there is great disparity.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) As for that nice and amusing doctrine of the <hi>School-men</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>in Man the Sensitive Soul is eminently contained in,</hi> and (to use their very term) <hi>as it were absorpt by the Rational</hi>; so that what is a <hi>Soul</hi> in <hi>Brutes,</hi> becomes a mere <hi>Power</hi> or quality in <hi>Man:</hi> this I think (as many other of their superfine distinctions doe) sounds like nothing put into hard words. For, how can it be imagined possible, the eternal law of nature should be so far violated, as that a <hi>substance</hi> should be changed into an accident? that the <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:62014:51"/>
Soul which is Corporeal and extense, and which they themselves allow to be actually existent in the body, before the infusion of the <hi>Rational</hi>; should upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of the Rational, lose its former essence, and degenerate into a naked <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>? This is (I profess) a Mystery much above my comprehension.</p>
            <p n="3">(3) If it be affirmed, that the <hi>Rational</hi> Soul doth, at her entrance into the body, introduce <hi>life</hi> also, and <hi>sense</hi>; and so there is no need of any other principle of life and sense, where she is: then must it be granted, that <hi>Man</hi> doth not generate a <hi>Man animated,</hi> or endowed with life and sense; but only an inform body, or rude mass of flesh. And how absurd that would be, I leave to your judgement.</p>

law to them: for these reasons, when the Rational Soul approves some, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects others; raiseth some, and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses others of those passions, and directs them to right ends; she may also be said, by such her dictates, to exercise acts of <hi>Will,</hi> as Arbiter, and to will or nill those things, which the <hi>Sensitive Appetite</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires or abhors by her permission or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
            <p>But yet this empire of the Rational Soul is not so absolute over the Sensitive,<note place="margin">Art. 8. wherein somtimes the <hi>Sensitive</hi> appetite pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails.</note> when this proceeds to <hi>Appetite,</hi> as when it is imployed about the discernment and <hi>Knowledge</hi> of sensible objects. For, the <hi>Sensitive</hi> being much neerer allied to the <hi>body,</hi> and immediate Guardian thereof; is by that affinity and relation obliged to addict itself altogether to the gratificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, welfare and conservation of the same. And that this province may be more grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and agreeable to so delicate a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verness, she is continualy courted and presented by all the <hi>Senses</hi> with variety of blandishments and tempting delights. So that charmed by those powerful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments of sensible objects, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely taken up with care of the body, and in that respect prone to pursue pleasures: she too often proves deaf to the voice of <hi>Reason</hi> advising the contrary, and refuses
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62014:54"/>
to be diverted from her sensual to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler affections.</p>
            <p>Yea somtimes grown weary of subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, she takes occasion to cast off her yoke of allegiance, and like a proud and insolent Rebell, aspires to unbounded license and dominion. And then, then it is we feel those <hi>Twins</hi> strugling within us, that intestine war betwixt the <hi>Flesh</hi> and the <hi>Spirit,</hi> that dire conflict of the <hi>Sensitive Appetite</hi> with <hi>Reason</hi>; which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracts one Man into two Duellists, and which ceaseth not, till one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batants hath overcome and brought the other to submission. And (what is yet more deplorable) the event of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat is often so unhappy, that the <hi>nobler</hi> part is subdued and led captive by the <hi>ignoble:</hi> the forces of <hi>sensual</hi> allurements then proving too strong for all the guards of <hi>Reason,</hi> though assisted by the auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry troops of <hi>Moral</hi> precepts, and the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred institutes of <hi>Religion.</hi> When the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Politie</hi> of the Rational Soul being subverted, the whole unhappy man is furiously carried away to serve the bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish lusts of the insolent usurper, and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the triumphs of libidinous carnali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: which degrades him from the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his nature, and cassating all his roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al prerogatives, debases him to a parity
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62014:54"/>
with beasts, if not below them; for, <hi>Reason</hi> once debauch'd so as to become <hi>brutal,</hi> leads to all sorts of <hi>excess</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of beasts are seldom guilty.</p>

For, it is from the <hi>Imagination</hi> alone that she takes all the representations of things, and the fundamental <hi>ideas,</hi> upon which she afterward builds up all her Science, all her wisdom. And therefore though the Mind of one man understands more, and reasoneth better than another; it doth not thence follow, that their <hi>Rational</hi> Souls are <hi>unequal</hi> in their natural capacity of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and discourse: because the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity proceeds immediately from diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

of <hi>Imagination,</hi> mediately and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally from the various dispositions of the <hi>Brain.</hi> For, when the Animal Spirits, being either of themselves less pure, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til and active than is requisite, or hinderd in their expansion and motions, are not able duely to irradiate and actuate the Brain affected with some distemper, or originally formed amiss: in such case, the <hi>Phatasms</hi> created in the <hi>Imagination,</hi> must be either deficient, or distorted; and the <hi>Intellect</hi> being obliged to judge of them accordingly, must be misinformed. Hence it often happens, that by reason of some wound, contusion, or other great hurt done to the brain, men who formerly were of acute wit, and excellent under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, are more or less deprived of those noble Faculties, and degenerate into mere fools or idiots. For, the acquiring, and loseing the <hi>habit</hi> of intellection and ratiocination, depends totally upon the <hi>Brain</hi> and <hi>Imagination,</hi> the corporeal sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject thereof: but the <hi>Intellect</hi> it self, since it hath no parts, cannot be perfected by parts; being from the beginning, and of its own nature, a full and perfect power of Understanding.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62014:57"/>
the principal Function of the human Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect seems to be this, that it be of its own nature merely <hi>intelligent,</hi> that is knowing things, not by ratiocination, but by <hi>simple intuition.</hi> But during its confinement within the body, it is surrounded with that darkness, that it doth not simply, naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and as it were by way of intuition per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all things which it understands; but attains to most of its knowledge by <hi>reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> that is, successively, and by proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were by degrees. If therefore the <hi>Organ</hi> or instrument, by the help of which the Intellect is obliged to ratioci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, or gradualy to attain to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things, be unfit, or out of tune: no wonder if it be not able to make good Musick thereupon.</p>

               </note> namely the <hi>Manner</hi> how this Unintelligible <hi>Intellect</hi> of man comes to <hi>know, speculate</hi> and <hi>judge</hi> of all Phantasms or images pourtraid in the Imagination: I can much more easily guess what it is not, than what it is. I am not inclined to espouse their conceit, who tell us, that the Rational Soul sitting in the brain, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where near the original of the nerves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Senses (as a Spider sits watching in the centre of her net) and feeling all <hi>strokes</hi> made upon them by the

               <hi>Species</hi> of sensible objects, distinguishes and judges of their several qualities and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties, by the different <hi>modes</hi> of their impressions. Because, the supposition of a <hi>percussion,</hi> or stroke to be made by a <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal</hi> image, is manifestly repugnant to a Faculty <hi>incorporeal.</hi> But whether or no I ought to acquiesce in that <hi>other</hi> opinion delivered, and maintained by a whole army of Contemplative men, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Intellect knowes and discerns things by <hi>simple Intuition,</hi> i.e. by beholding their Images represented in the Phantasy, as we see our faces represented in a mirror or looking-glass: truely I am yet to learn from wiser heads than mine. For, though I admire the subtilty of the conceipt, and love not to be immodestly Sceptical, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in matters that transcend my narrow comprehension: yet, to speak ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, I as little understand how <hi>Intuition</hi> can be ascribed to an <hi>immaterial,</hi> that hath no <hi>Eyes</hi>; as I do how <hi>Feeling</hi> of <hi>strokes</hi> can be ascribed to a thing that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>touched.</hi> Nevertheless I will not point blanck deny this latter opinion to be true, only because I cannot perceive the <hi>Competency</hi> of such an act as <hi>intuition</hi> to the <hi>incorporeal</hi> Soul of man: for, that were to make my scanty reason the measure of truth; and to confide more in my own

dulness, than in the admired perspicacity of so many eminent Wits preceding me. Wherefore having confess'd my igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, I refer the matter to your arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: allowing you as much time as you shall think fit, seriously to consider the same; and in the interim contentedly sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending my curiosity, which hath too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten perplexed me. For, hitherto could I never drive it into my head, how those terms of <hi>infusion, connexion</hi> and <hi>intuition</hi> can be intelligibly applyed to a <hi>spiritual,</hi> or incompound essence, such as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Reasonable Soul to be: and if I have used them in this discourse, it was rather because I could think of none <hi>less improper,</hi> than because I approved them as <hi>adequate</hi> to the notions to which they are vulgarly accommodated. Besides, I hold it extremly difficult, not to speak some <hi>non-sense,</hi> when we adventure to treat of the nature of <hi>spirits,</hi> whereof we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand so little: and you (I presume) will rather pitty, than condemn a man for stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in the <hi>dark.</hi> But I have too long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd you upon <hi>Preliminaries</hi>: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deprecating your impatience, invite you now from the porch into the little <hi>Theatre</hi> of the <hi>Passions,</hi> which I design'd to erect more for your divertisement, than study.</p>

            <p>In the state of <hi>Tranquillity,</hi> it seems pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that the whole <hi>Corporeal</hi> Soul being coextens to the whole body inshrining it (as the body is to the skin envesting it) doth at the same time both inliven all parts with the vital flame of the blood, to that end carried in a perpetual round (as the vulgar conceive the Sun to be unces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly moved round about the Earth, to illuminate and warm all parts of it) and irradiate and invigorate them with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual supply of Animal spirits, for the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of Sense and Motion.

               </note> in the state of <hi>Pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,</hi> all that excellent <hi>Oeconomy</hi> is more or less discomposed.

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62014:60"/>
more, by their exorbitant manner of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux into the nerves of the Heart and Lungs, they move them irregularly, and so contribute to render the course of the blood yet more unequal. Nor doth the tempest stop here; it extends sometimes also to other <hi>Humors</hi> of the body, to the <hi>solid</hi> parts and members of it, and even to the discomposure of the <hi>Reasonable Soul</hi> her self.</p>

               </note>But however this admirable Commerce may be otherwise explained, it is lawful for us us to conceive, that the <hi>Sensitive</hi> Soul, when put into this state of <hi>perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> doth strangely vary her <hi>Postures,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the diversity of motions caused in her: and though that diversity be very great, yet that in all perturbations whatever, she is more or less <hi>amplified,</hi> so as to swell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond her ordinary bounds; or more or less <hi>contracted</hi> within her self, so as to be less ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense or diffused, than usually she is at other times, in her state of <hi>tranquillity</hi>: as will be exemplified in all the passions we design particularly to describe. Mean while it is observable, that sometimes she being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with <hi>joy,</hi> or <hi>pride,</hi> and as it were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulting above measure, doth advance and <hi>expand</hi> her self, as if she strove to be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and to stretch her grandure beyond the narrow limits of the body. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> being respectively commoved in the brain, enlarge the sphere of their irradiation, and by a more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant influx vigorously agitate the <hi>Praecor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> or <hi>vital</hi> parts, so forcing the <hi>blood</hi> to flow more copiously into all parts, and to diffuse it self more freely and speedily through the whole body. On the <hi>contrary,</hi> sometimes being surprised with <hi>grief,</hi> or <hi>fear,</hi> she <hi>contracts</hi> her self into a narrower
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62014:61"/>
compass; so that shrunk up to a scant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling less than her usual circuit of emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, she becomes of too small a size vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously to actuate the body as she ought. Whence the <hi>Animal faculties</hi> drooping as it were, perform their actions either slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and weakly, or perversly: and the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia</hi> wanting their due influx of spirits, almost flagg, suffering the <hi>blood</hi> to remain in their conduits longer than it ought, even to danger of stagnation, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of sudden death. These two contrary Motions therefore of <hi>Contraction</hi> and <hi>Expansion,</hi> I suppose to be the two <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> ones, to which all the various <hi>Postures</hi> of the <hi>Sensitive</hi> Soul, when she is pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, may be commodiously referr'd: it seeming to me, considering her to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly like a <hi>Flame,</hi> and obnoxious to the like accidental mutations, that she is not naturally capable of other besides these; and that how great soever the variety of such her <hi>Mutations</hi> may be in the vast di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of <hi>Passions,</hi> yet they are all but se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>degrees,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This being then supposed, I proceed to the first and <hi>General Causes</hi> of all Passions. Where I observe <hi>first,</hi> (what was only hinted a little afore) that it is not the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple representation of <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil</hi> in any
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62014:62"/>
object, how great soever it be, that is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to raise Commotion in the sensitive Soul; for, we usualy without perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion behold the prosperous or adverse events befalling <hi>other</hi> Men no waies rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us: and therefore it is further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to the moving our affections, that the good or evil apprehended, be by us conceived to concern <hi>ourselves</hi> in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, or our <hi>Friends</hi> at least, and near relations, who in this case are part of our selves. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that even that good or evil wherein a Man conceives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be concern'd, is not always ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by him under one and the same <hi>ration</hi> or aspect; but <hi>variously,</hi> aswell in respect of the <hi>object</hi> itself, as of the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> to which it doth more peculiarly and immediately appertain. Of the divers rations under which one and the same <hi>object,</hi> good or evil, may be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by one and the same Man, respective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the various <hi>circumstances</hi> thereof; we shall more opportunely speak anon. And as for those that respect the <hi>Subject,</hi> or Man <hi>apprehending</hi>; it is worthy our serious remark;</p>

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62014:64"/>
to her immaterial essence alone, and conformable to the dignity of the thing she speculates; but communicates her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects also to the Sensitive Soul, by whose subordinate motions she is obliged to act respectively to her end. And these mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or acts being thus traduced from the superiour to the inferior Soul, and thence derived first to the brain and imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then to the heart; produce therein, and so in the blood, the various motions that constitute such Passions, as we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve in our selves, when we are most ardently urged to acts of devotion and piety toward the supream Being. Whence it is doubtless, that <hi>Divine love, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation of sin, repentance, hope of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, fear of incensing Divine justice,</hi> and most, if not all other acts (or passions) of devotion are commonly ascribed to the <hi>heart</hi>: and that not without some reason. For, though I cannot admit the <hi>heart</hi> to be the Seat of the Passions, as the <hi>Aristoteleans</hi> unanimously hold it to be, only because of the sensible <hi>alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi> therein produced in most passions: since in truth those alterations are rather consequents, than causes of Passions; and since they are not felt by us as in the heart, but only by means of the nerves descending thither from the brain; as pain
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62014:64"/>
is not felt as in the foot, but by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of nerves betwixt the foot and the brain; and as the starrs appear to us as in heaven, by mediation of their light affecting our Optick nerves. So that it is no more necessary the Soul should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise her functions, or receive her passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons immediately in the heart, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she feels her passions therein; than it is she should be in heaven, because she sees the starrs to be there; or in the foot, because pain appears to her to be there. Notwithstanding this I say, yet the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of these devout Passions to the <hi>heart,</hi> is not altogether destitute of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. For, (for instance) when the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Soul is commanded by the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, to humble, and as it were to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> herself in adoration of the sacred Majesty of God; instantly both parts thereof, as well the Sensitive, as the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, are forced to repress and restrain their wonted emanations or effusions. Whereupon the Animal Spirits being in whole legions withdrawn from mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s
tring to the Imagination and Senses, are by the nerves transmitted in crowds to the heart: which while they closely contract and shut, they cause the blood to remain longer than is usual, in the cavities thereof, and by that means keep
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62014:65"/>
it both from being too much kindled in the Lungs, and from being sent from the heart in too great abundance into the rest of the body, and more especia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the brain; as if Nature itself had instituted, that in sacred passions the blood, or principal seat of life, should be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up to the Author of life, upon the altar of the heart, while the brain, or seat of reason, is kept serene and clear. Nor is it difficult to a man praying to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God with fervency of Spirit, to observe in himself, that his blood is more and more arrested and detained within his breast the while; insomuch that his heart seems to swell, his lungs to be opprest, and he is forced frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to interrupt his oraisons with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found sighs, for attraction of fresh aer: as if the reasonable Soul not content to devote herself alone, and pour forth her holy desires to God, laboured to make a libation also of the vital blood, for a propitiatory oblation. So that though the Soul cannot in strictness of truth be said to receive her passions in the heart; yet since the alterations cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in us by them, are greater and more sensible in the heart, and consequently in the blood, than in any other part of the whole body beside: I am not so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62014:65"/>
to vitilitigation, as to contend about the propriety of those expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in scripture, which seem to ascribe all our sacred passions principaly to the heart.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And as for Passions <hi>Moral</hi>; I refer to their classis all those that are excited in the Sensitive Soul,<note place="margin">Art. 10. And what <hi>Moral.</hi>

Concerning these in general, it is remarkable; that though the Sensitive Soul hath secret loves and aversations of her own, commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (as we have already said) <hi>Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies</hi> and <hi>Antipathies</hi>; and though she owes obedience to the commands and dictates of her superior, the Rational Soul: yet being by so strict a ligue, and as it were a conjugal union affianced to the body, she is strongly inclined to prefer the conservation of that her favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, to all other relations; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly to gratify and indulge it even in those things that are prohibited by reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and reason. So that no wonder if she be affected with pleasure, or pain, and with all other passions referible to them, for the prosperous or adverse state of the body.</p>

            </head>
            <p>NOt of all that are incident to the mind of Man,<note place="margin">Art. 11. Why Men have not been able to observe <hi>all</hi> Passions inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the <hi>Sensitive</hi> Soul.</note> which were extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly difficult, if not altogether impossible for me to do. For, seeing the objects that raise pleasure and displeasure are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable; and the various waies or manners by which they affect the sense,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62014:68"/>
and excite motions in the brain, spirits and heart, are equaly innumerable: even those Philosophers themselves who have with all possible attention of mind la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to search out the several sorts of Passions, have not been able to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice but of very few, nor to give names to all those neither. Besides, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of how subtil particles, how fluid and easily moveable a substance, and how delicate a contexture the Sensitive Soul seems to be composed; we may soon conceive her to be subject to grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter variety of impressions, commotions, fluctuations, inclinations, alterations and perturbations, than can possibly be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served and distinguished even by the most curious. It may well suffice then to enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate and describe the most <hi>remarkable</hi> of her Passions, such as like so many lesser streams, flow from the two general fountains before mentioned, <hi>Pleasure</hi> and <hi>Displeasure</hi> of sense, or motions begun in the sensory, traduced to the brain, and continued to the heart; and that are of a more <hi>simple</hi> nature.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Art. 2. The Passions best distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished by having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Time.</hi>
               </note>Which that we may perform with more of order, and less of obscurity; we are to consider, that the Passions receiving their most notable diversity from certain
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62014:68"/>
               <hi>circumstances</hi> of <hi>Time,</hi> may therefore be most intelligibly distinguished by having respect to the same Circumstances. For, since there are of <hi>Conceptions</hi> three sorts, whereof one is of that which is <hi>present,</hi> which is <hi>sense</hi>; another, of that which is <hi>past,</hi> which is <hi>Remembrance</hi>; and the third, of that which is <hi>to come,</hi> which is called <hi>Expectation</hi>: it is manifestly neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, that the condition of the pleasure, or displeasure consequent to conceptions, be diversified, according as the Good or Evil thereby proposed to the Soul, is <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi> or <hi>absent.</hi> For, we are pleased, or displeased even at things past; because the <hi>Memory</hi> reviving and reviewing their images, sets them before the Soul as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and she is affected with them no less than if the things themselves were present. So also of things <hi>future</hi>; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as the Soul by a certain provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence preoccupying the images of things that she conceives to come, looks upon them as realy present, and is according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleased or displeased by <hi>Anticipation</hi>: every conception being pleasure, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure <hi>present.</hi> This being presupposed we proceed to the <hi>Genealogy</hi> of the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
            <p>When the image of any <hi>new</hi> and <hi>strange</hi> object is presented to the Soul,<note place="margin">Art. 3. Admiration.</note> and gives
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62014:69"/>
her hope of knowing somwhat that she knew not before; instantly she <hi>admireth</hi> it, as different from all things she hath already known; and in the same instant entertains an appetite to know it better, which is called <hi>Curiosity</hi> or desire of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. And because this <hi>Admiration</hi> may, and most commonly is excited in the Soul before she understands, or considers whether the object be in itself convenient to her or not: therefore it seems to be the <hi>first</hi> of all passions, next after Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and Pain; and to have no <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>: because when an object perceived by the sense, hath nothing in it of new and strange; we are not at all moved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, but consider it indifferently, and without any commotion of the Soul. Common it is doubtless to Man with <hi>Beasts</hi>; but with this <hi>difference,</hi> that in <hi>Man</hi> it is always conjoyned with <hi>Curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>; in Beasts, not. For when a <hi>Beast</hi> seeth any thing new and strange, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidereth it so far only as to discern whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be likely to serve his turn, or to hurt him; and acordingly approacheth neerer to it, or fleeth from it: whereas <hi>Man,</hi> who in most events remembreth in what manner they were caused and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, looks for the cause and beginning of every thing that ariseth new to him
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62014:69"/>
Whence it is manifest, that all natural <hi>Philosophy,</hi> and <hi>Astronomy</hi> owe themselves to this passion: and that ignorance is not more justly reputed the mother of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, than Admiration may be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the mother of knowledge; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees whereof among Men, proceed from the degrees of Curiosity. Now this Passion is reducible to <hi>delight,</hi> because <hi>Curiosity</hi> is delight: and so by consequence is <hi>Novelty</hi> too, but especialy that novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from which a Man conceiveth an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>bettering</hi> his own estate, whether that opinion be true or false: for in such case, he stands affected with the hope that all Gamesters have while the Cards are shuffling; as <hi>Mr Hobbs</hi> hath judiciously observed.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless it seems rather a <hi>calm</hi> than a tempest of the mind. For,<note place="margin">Art. 4. Which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth no <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion</hi> in the heart and blood.</note> in Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, whereby the Soul is <hi>fixt</hi> upon the contemplation of an object that appears to her new and strange, and therefore well worthy her highest consideration; the Animal spirits are indeed suddainly determined, and with great force, partly to that part of the brain, where the image is newly formed, and partly to the Muscles that serve to hold the organs of the external senses in the same posture in which they then are, that so the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62014:70"/>
may be more clearly and distinctly perceived: yet in the <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> there happens little or no commotion or alteration at all. Whereof the reason seems to be this; that since the Soul at that time, hath for her object, not good or evil, but only the Knowledge of the thing which she admires; she converts all her power upon the brain alone, wherein all sense is performed, by the help whereof that knowledge is to be acquired. And</p>

               </note>Hence it comes, that <hi>Excess</hi> of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration sometimes induceth a <hi>Stupor,</hi> or <hi>Astonishment</hi>; and where it lasteth long, that wonderful disease of the brain, which Physicians name <hi>Catalepsis,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a Man is held stiff, motionless, and senseless, as if he were turned into a statue. For it causeth that all the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits in the brain are so vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imployed in contemplating and conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the image of the object, that their usual influx into other parts of the body is wholy intercepted, nor can they by any means be diverted: whereby all members of the body are held in a rigid posture, inflexible as those of a dead carcas, or of Man killed by lightning. Of this admirable effect of excessive Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, <hi>Nich.

And although it often happens, that <hi>Estimation</hi> is excited by <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Contempt</hi> proceeds from <hi>Hatred</hi>; yet that is not universal, nor doth it arise from any other cause but this, that we are more or less prone to consider the greatness or meanness of an object, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we more or less love it.</p>

               </note>But though Estimation and Contempt may be referred to any objects what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, yet are they then chiefly obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, when they are referred to <hi>ourselves,</hi> that is, when we put great or small va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue upon our own <hi>merit.</hi> And then the motions of the Spirits upon which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, are so discernible, that they change the very countenance, gestures, walking, and in word all the actions of those who think more haughtily or meanly of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves than is usual. But for <hi>what</hi> may we have a high esteem of ourselves? Truely I can observe but <hi>one</hi> thing that may give
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:62014:71"/>
us just cause of self-estimation; and that is the <hi>lawful use</hi> of our <hi>free will,</hi> and the soveraignity we exercise over our Passions. For (as the incomparable <hi>Monsieur des Cartes</hi> most wisely noteth) take away the actions dependent upon our Free will, and nothing will remain for which we can deserve to be praised or dispraised with reason: and that in truth renders us in some sort like unto God Almighty, by making us Lords of ourselves; provided we do not through carelesness and poorness of Spirit, lose the rights and power that royal preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of our nature conferreth upon us. Wherefore I am of the same <hi>Des Cartes</hi> his opinion, that true <hi>Generosity,</hi> which makes a Man measure his own merit by right reason, doth consist only in this; that he both knowes he hath nothing true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his own, except this free disposition of his Will, nor for which he justly can be commended or blamed, but that he useth that liberty well: and finds in himself a firm and constant purpose still so to do; that is, never to want will to undertake and perform all things that he shall have judged to be the <hi>better</hi>; which is <hi>perfectly to follow Virtue.</hi>

of ones-self without just cause, expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed chiefly by haughty looks, <hi>ostentation</hi> in words, and insolency in action; is a Vice so unreasonable and absurd, that if there were no <hi>Adulation</hi> to deceive men into a better conceipt of themselves than they realy deserve; I should number it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the kinds of <hi>Madness.</hi> But the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious aire of <hi>Assentation</hi> is diffused so universaly, and hath infected the tongues of so great a part of mankind, that even the most <hi>imperfect</hi> frequently hear themselves commended and magnified for their very defects: which gives occasion to persons of stupid heads, and weak minds, and consequently of easy belief, to fall into this Tympany of <hi>Pride</hi> or <hi>false Glory.</hi> A passion so far different from true <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity,</hi> that it produceth effects ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely contrary thereunto. For, since other Goods, besides the virtuous Habit of using the liberty of our wills according to the dictates of right reason, as <hi>Wit, Beauty, Riches, Honours</hi> and the like, are therefore the more esteemed, because they are <hi>rare,</hi> and cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to many at once: this makes <hi>Proud</hi> men labour to depress others, while themselves being inslaved to their own vicious cupidities, have their Souls unces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly agitated by <hi>Hate, Iealousie,</hi> or <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</hi>

               </note> is <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility</hi>: whereof there are likewise two Sorts; one, <hi>Virtuous</hi> or <hi>Honest</hi>; the other, <hi>Vicious</hi> or base.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Virtuous,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Virtuous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> which is properly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Humility,</hi> consisteth onely in that reflexion we make upon the <hi>infirmity</hi> of our nature, and upon the errors we either have heretofore committed, or may in time to come commit: and maketh us therefore not to prefer ourselves before others, but to think them equaly capable of using their freedom of Will, as well as ourselves. Whence it is, that the most <hi>Generous</hi> are also the most <hi>Humble.</hi> For being truely conscious both of their own infirmity, and of their constant purpose to Surmount it, by doing none but vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous actions, that is, by the right use of the liberty of the Will, they easily perswade themselves, that others also have the same just sentiments, and the same good resolution in themselves; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause therein is nothing that depends upon another. Wherefore they never despise any man, and though they often see o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to fall into such Errors that disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their weakness; yet are they still more prone to excuse, than to condemn them, and to believe their faults pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded rather from want of knowledge
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62014:73"/>
and circumspection, than from defect of an inclination and will to good. So that as on the one side, they think not themselves much <hi>inferiour</hi> to those who possess <hi>more</hi> of the goods of Fortune, or exceed them in wit, learning, beauty &amp;c. So nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do they on the other, think themselves to be much <hi>Superiour</hi> to others, who have <hi>less</hi> of those perfections; because they look upon such qualities as not worth much consideration, in comparison of that <hi>goodness</hi> of Will, upon which alone they have a just valuation of themselves, and which they suppose that every man equaly hath, or at least may have. This Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility therefore is inseparable from true Generosity: and being well grounded, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways produceth <hi>Circumspection</hi> or <hi>Caution,</hi> which is <hi>fear</hi> to attempt any thing rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Art 11. <hi>Vicious</hi> or <hi>Dejection</hi> of Spirit.</note>The <hi>Vicious</hi> Humility, which is distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished by the name of <hi>Dejection</hi> or <hi>Poorness</hi> of Spirit, proceeds likewise from an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of our own infirmity; but with this <hi>difference,</hi> that a man conceives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be so far deprived of the right and use of Fre-will, that he cannot but doe things against his inclination, and of which he ought afterward to repent; and believes himself not able to subsist of himself, but to want many things
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62014:73"/>
whose acquisition depends upon another. So it is directly opposite to Generosity or Bravery of mind, and it is commonly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, that poor and <hi>abject</hi> Spirits are also <hi>Arrogant</hi> and <hi>Vain-glorious</hi>: as the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous are most modest and humble. For, these are above both the smiles and and frowns of Fortune, still calme and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene as well in adversity as prosperity: but <hi>those</hi> being slaves to Fortune, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guided by her, are puffed up by her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable gales, and blown down again by her gusts. Nor is it a rarity to see men of of this base and servile temper, to descend to shamefull submissions, where they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expect some benefit, or fear some e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil: and at the same time to carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves insolently and contemptuously to ward others, from whom they neither hope nor fear any thing. This Ague of the Soul then, being ill grounded, doth so shake a man with <hi>distrust</hi> of himself, that it utterly Cows him, and keeps him from daring to attempt any worthy action, for fear of ill success: which Vice the <hi>Lord Bacon</hi> calls <hi>Restifeness</hi> of mind, and <hi>falling out of love with ones-self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is yet another remarkable Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that seem's to belong to Humility,<note place="margin">Art. 12. Shame and Impudence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> and that is <hi>Shame.</hi> Which ariseth from an unwary discovery of some <hi>Defect</hi> or infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62014:74"/>
in us, the remembrance whereof sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly dejecteth us, and puts us for the most part to the <hi>Blush,</hi> which is its proper Sign. That it is a sort of <hi>Modesty</hi> or diffidence of our selves, is manifest from hence; that when a man thinks so well of himself, as not to imagine another can have just cause to contemn him; he cannot easily be checkd by <hi>Shame</hi>: and as the <hi>Good</hi> that is or hath been in us, if considered with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the opinion others may conceive of us, doth excite <hi>Glory</hi> in us; so doth the Evil whereof we are conscious, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>Shame.</hi> And yet it cannot be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but that in this discouraging Affect there is also some mixture of <hi>Grief</hi> or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret regret, proceeding from apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Dispraise</hi>: because being ever accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with inward displeasure at the defect or fault uncircumspectly discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it cools or damp's the Spirits, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more wariness for the future. The <hi>Contrary</hi> to this, is <hi>Impudence</hi>; which is contempt of Shame, yea and oftentimes of Glory too. But because there is in us no special motion of the Spirits and heart, that may excite Imprudence; it seems to be no Passion, but a certain <hi>Vice</hi> opposite to Shame, and to Glory also, so far forth as they are both good and laudable: as <hi>Ingratitude</hi> is opposed to <hi>Gratitude,</hi> and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62014:74"/>
               <hi>Cruelty</hi> to <hi>Commiseration.</hi> And the chief cause of this vicious <hi>insensibility of Honor,</hi> is founded in grievous <hi>contumelies</hi> to which a man hath been accustomed in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, and which he by degrees comes to despise, as of no force to hinder his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of commodities belonging to his body, whereby he measures all <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil:</hi> thereby freeing himself from many necessities and streights to which honor would have obliged him. This therefore being no Passion, we are not concerned here further to consider it.</p>
            <p>But as for <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Dejection</hi>; that they are not onely <hi>Vices,</hi> but <hi>Passions</hi> too,<note place="margin">Art. 13.

The same may be said of <hi>Generosity</hi> also and <hi>Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> For, notwithstanding their <hi>Motions</hi> be less quick and conspicuous, and that there seem to be much less of Convenience or fellowship betwixt Virtue and Passion, than between Passion and Vice; yet no reason appears, why the same <hi>Motion</hi> that serves to confirm a conception that is <hi>ill</hi> grounded, may not serve likewise to confirm the same conception though itbe well grounded. And because <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Generosity</hi> consist equaly in <hi>Self-esteem</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:62014:75"/>
differing only in the <hi>injustice</hi> and <hi>justice</hi> thereof: they seem to be but one and the same Passion originaly excited by a certain motion, not simple, but composed of the motions of <hi>Admiration, Ioy</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well that love which is conceived for ones<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as that for the thing which makes one to value himself: as on the Contrary, the <hi>Motion</hi> that causeth <hi>Humility,</hi> whether it be Vertuous or Vicious, seems to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of the motions of <hi>Admiration, Grief,</hi> and <hi>self-love</hi> mixt with <hi>Hatred</hi> of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi> that give occasion to one to conceive a mean opinion of himself. Now what are the <hi>Motions</hi> of the Spirits or Sensitive Soul, that produce <hi>Admiration</hi> and <hi>Pride</hi>; we have formerly declared: and as to those that are proper to each of the other passions already considered; they remain to be particularly described in their due places.¶</p>

            <p>By the word <hi>Propension</hi> here used, is to be understood, not <hi>Cupidity</hi> or desire, which is in truth a distinct passion procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from love, and always respecting the <hi>future</hi>; but <hi>Will</hi> or <hi>consent</hi> by which we consider ourselves as <hi>already</hi> joyned to the thing loved, by a certain conception of ourselves to be as it were a part thereof. As on the contrary, in <hi>Aversation</hi> or <hi>Hate,</hi> we consider ourselves as <hi>intirely separate</hi> from the thing hated.</p>
            <p>According to these two opposite notions,<note place="margin">Art. 15. Defined.</note> I should define <hi>Love</hi> to be a <hi>Commotion of the Soul, produced by a motion of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which inciteth her to joyn herself, by her will, to objects that appear convenient and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to her</hi>: and <hi>Hatred,</hi> to be a <hi>Commotion produced by the spirits, that inciteth the Soul to be willing to be separated from objects that are represented to her as ungratefull and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</hi>

            <p>Of <hi>Love</hi> there are made by the Schools <hi>two</hi> Sorts,<note place="margin">Art. 16. <hi>Love,</hi> not well distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished into <hi>Benevolence</hi> and <hi>concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence.</hi>
               </note> whereof the first is commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Amor Benevolentiae,</hi> love of <hi>Benevolence</hi> or <hi>Good-will,</hi> whereby we are incited to wish well to the thing we love: the other,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:62014:76"/>
               <hi>Amor Concupiscentiae,</hi> which causeth us to <hi>desire</hi> to enjoy or possess the object loved. But this Distinction, if considered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice, will be found to concern onely the <hi>Effects</hi> of love, not the essence of it. For, so soon as a man hath in <hi>Will</hi> joyned himself to an object, of what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture soever it be; he is at the same instant carryed toward it by <hi>Benevolence,</hi> or (to speak more plainly) he in will also ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns thereunto what things he believeth conducible to the good thereof: which is one of the principle <hi>Effects</hi> of love, but doth not infer a different <hi>Species</hi> of it. And the same object, if it be judged good to be possessed, or to be joyned to the Soul in <hi>another manner</hi> than by the will alone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is instantly <hi>desired</hi>: which also ought to be accounted among the more frequent <hi>effects</hi> of love. Whence I conclude, that <hi>Desire</hi> connexed to <hi>Love,</hi> is <hi>Benevolence</hi>: as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed with <hi>Hate,</hi> it is <hi>Malevolence</hi> or ill will.

<q>
                  <hi>Love</hi> (saith He) may, in my judgement, be with good reason distinguished by the several <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>Esteem</hi> we have of the thing loved. For, when a man hath <hi>less</hi> esteem for an object, than for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and yet loves it; his love is no more but <hi>simple Propension</hi> or <hi>Benevolence:</hi> when as much as for himself, 'tis <hi>Amity</hi> or Friendship; when <hi>greater</hi> than for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, it may be called <hi>Devotion.</hi> By the <hi>First,</hi> a flower, a Bird, a Horse &amp;c. may be loved. By the <hi>second,</hi> no man of understanding can love any thing but Men, who are so properly the object<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of this passion, that one can hardly be found so imperfect, but he may be conjoyned to another in the most perfect bond of friendship, if that other conceive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be truely and sincerely beloved by him, and think him to have a Soul truely noble and generous. And as for the last, <hi>Devotion</hi>; indeed the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal object thereof is <hi>God Almighty,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward whom there is no man living, who considers as he ought, the incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible perfections of the Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but must be devote (for, as <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, Deum colit, qui novit</hi>) Yet there is a Devotion also to ones Prince, or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62014:77"/>
or City, or to any private person, whom we esteem above ourselves. And the difference betwixt these three sorts of Love, is chiefly manifest from their divers Effects. For when in each of them the person loving considers himself as joyned and united to the thing loved; he is always ready to quit or leave the least part of the whole that he makes with the same, to preserve the rest. Whence it comes that in simple <hi>Benevolence,</hi> the Lover always prefer's himself to the thing loved: but on the contrary, in <hi>Devotion,</hi> he always prefers the thing loved, so far above himself, that he fears not to dye for the conversation thereof, of which noble Love there have been glorious Examples in men who have voluntarily exposed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to certain death, for defence of their Prince, or of their City, yea sometimes also for private persons to whom they had particularly devoted themselves.</q>

That there are not so many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct sorts of <hi>Love,</hi> as of <hi>objects</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite it.</note>This Distinction being admitted (as in my opinion it well deserves to be) there will remain no necessity of constituting so many distinct sorts of Love, as they are various <hi>objects</hi> to excite it: seeing there are many Passions very different among themselves, and in respect of their several
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62014:77"/>
objects, which yet agree in this, that they all participate of Love. For Example, the Passion by which the <hi>Ambitious</hi> is carried on to Glory, the <hi>Avaricious</hi> to riches, the <hi>Drunkard</hi> to wine, the <hi>Libidinous</hi> to women, the <hi>Honest</hi> to his friend, the <hi>Vxorious</hi> to his wife, the good <hi>Father</hi> to his Children, &amp;c. differ very much among themselves, and yet so far resemble each other, that they all participate of <hi>Love.</hi> But the love of the <hi>first four</hi> aimeth at nothing but the possession of their peculiar objects; nor have they indeed any thing of love for those objects, but only <hi>Desire</hi> mixt with some other special passions. Whereas the love of a <hi>Parent</hi> to his Children, is so pure, that he desires to obtain nothing at all from them, nor to possess them in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner than he doth already, or to bring them to a neerer conjunction with himself; but considering them as parts of himself, seeks their good as his own, yea with greater care than his own, as not fearing to purchase their felicity at the rate of his own undoing. And the Love of an honest man to his <hi>Friends,</hi> is also of the same perfection. But the Love of a man to his <hi>Mistress,</hi> commonly distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished by the name of the <hi>Erotic passion</hi>; is alwaies mixed with desire of <hi>Fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the blood being more copiously diffused by the arteries, and more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly those ascending to the brain, carries with it a recruit of vital spirits newly enkindled: which being there further sublimed or refined, and corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borating the idea or image that the first cogitation hath formed of the thing lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, oblige and in some sort compell the the Soul to continue fixed upon that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation, and continually to indulge the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62014:79"/>
same. And herein, if I am not much mistaken, doth the passion of <hi>Love</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally consist. For, they who are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected therewith, have their pulse <hi>equal</hi> (the Spirits that cause it, being immit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the <hi>Cardiac</hi> nerves with an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual and placid motion) but stronger and more frequent then ordinary; they feel a certain agreable heat diffused in their breast; they find their brain invigorated by abundance of Spirits, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by grow more ingenuous; and in fine they digest their meat quickly, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all actions of life readily and with alacrity. All which may be ascribed to the free and expedite, but equal Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the blood, caused by a copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous influx of Animal Spirits into the Heart. Whence we may safely conclude, that this grateful passion is highly bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial to all parts of the body, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth much to the conservation of health; provided it continue within the bounds of moderation. But if it exceed them, and break forth into a wild and furious <hi>desire</hi>; then on the contrary, by degrees enervating the members, it at length induceth very great weakness and decay upon the whole body. For, Love accompanied with vehement desire, doth so intirely imploy the Soul in the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62014:79"/>
of the object desired, that she retains in the brain the greatest part of the Spirits, there to represent to her the image thereof: so that the whole stock of nerves, and all the Muscles are defrauded of the influx of Spirits from the brain, with which they ought to be continualy inspired or invigorated. Whence in process of time the whole <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of nature is perverted, and an universal <hi>languor</hi> ensueth.</p>

For out of <hi>Desire</hi> to obtain what we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently pursue, the Spirits are most swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly transmitted from the brain into all parts of the body that may any way serve to do the actions requisite to that end; but above all into the Heart. which being thereby dilated and contracted both more strongly and more frequently than in the state of tranquility, quickly forceth up a more abundant supply of Vital Spirits with the blood into the brain; aswell that
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62014:80"/>
they may there conserve and corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Idea of this Desire, as that whole brigades of them may be from thence dispatched into the Organs of the Senses, and into all Muscles, whose mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may more especially conduce to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what is so vehemently desired. And from the Souls reflexion upon the delay of her fruition, which she at the same time makes; there ariseth in her a <hi>solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude</hi> or trouble, whereby she is check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and <hi>contracted</hi> again, and the spirits are by intervals retracted toward the brain. So that the more subtil and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual blood being with the spirits recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from the outward parts, the heart comes to be constringed and streightned, the Circulation of the blood retarded, and consequently the whole body left without spirits and vigor. Let none therefore admire, if many of those Men whom <hi>Lust,</hi> or <hi>Concupiscence, Ambition, Avarice,</hi> or any other more fervent <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire</hi> hath long exercised and inslaved, be by continual <hi>sollicitude</hi> of mind, brought at length into an ill Habit of body, to leanness, a defect of Nutrition, Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Scurvy, Consumption and other incurable diseases.

               </note> which is directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to Love, evident it is, that when the Soul is moved to withdraw herself from any object that appears to threaten <hi>Evil</hi> or <hi>pain,</hi> instantly the Spirits are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted inwards to the brain, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipaly to that part of it which is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument or mint of Imagination; there to corroborate the idea of <hi>Hatred,</hi> which the first thought hath formed of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful object; and to dispose the Soul to sentiments full of bitterness and dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station: So that the while, very few of them, and those too inordinately and by unequal impulses, are transmitted into the Heart, by the <hi>Pathetic</hi> nerves, And from this offensive <hi>Contraction</hi> of the whole Sensitive Soul, and as it were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of the Animal spirits, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent destitution of the Heart, it comes, that in this sowr passion alwaies the <hi>Pulse</hi> is made <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>unequal,</hi> and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62014:81"/>
               <hi>frequent</hi> and <hi>creeping</hi>; that cold, mixt with a certain pricking heat not easy to be described, but sensibly injurious to the vital parts, and repugnant to their regular motions, is felt within the breast; and that even the stomach itself, diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from its office of Concoction, nausea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the meats it had received, and strives to reject them by vomit. Which often happens upon sight of an odious and abominable object. Now all these evil effects of <hi>Hate,</hi> give indisputable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that it can never be either grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the mind, or beneficial to the motions of life, upon which health so nearly depends: and this, because <hi>Hate</hi> always hath <hi>Sadness</hi> for its concomitant; and because by diversion of the Animal spirits, partly to assist the Imagination, partly to move the members for avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the hated object, it defrauds the blood of its due supplies of spirits and fewel, retards the motion and equal distribution of it, and by that means de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroies concoction, incrassates the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, heaps up melancholy, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees brings the whole body to poverty and leanness. Moreover, sometimes this disagreeable Passion is exalted to <hi>Anger,</hi> whereby the Soul, offended with the Evil or wrong she hath suffered, at first
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62014:81"/>
               <hi>Contracts</hi> herself, and by and by with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency <hi>springs</hi> back again to her natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral posture of Coextension with the whole body, as if the strove to break out into revenge: and then it is that the spirits are in a tumultuous manner, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuously hurried hither and thither, now from the brain to the heart, then back again from the heart to the brain; and so there follow from these contrary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions alternately reciprocated, aswell a violent agitation, palpitation, burning and anxiety of the heart; as a diffusion of the blood, distension of the veins, redness of the face, and sparkling of the eyes, together with a distorsion of the mouth (such as may be observed in great indignation, and seems composed of laughter and weeping mixt together) grinding of the teeth, and other symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of <hi>Anger</hi> and fury. It is not then without reason Physicians advise Men to decline this passion, as a powerful ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to health in all but such as are of a cold, dull, and phlegmatic temperament; because it inflames first the spirits, then the blood, and when violent, it puts us into <hi>fevers,</hi> and other acute distempers, by accension of choler, and confusion of humors. And I could furnish you with examples of some whom this short

               </note>Here before we proceed to other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent Passions, it is fit to make a short reflexion upon <hi>Hatred,</hi> that I may verify what was only hinted in the precedent enumeration of the evil <hi>Effects</hi> thereof, viz. that it is ever accompanied with <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> Concerning this therefore I reason thus. Forasmuch as <hi>Evil,</hi> the proper object of <hi>Hate,</hi> is nothing but a <hi>Privati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>; and that we can have no conception thereof without some real <hi>Subject</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we apprehend it to be; and that there is in nature nothing real which hath not some <hi>goodness</hi> in it: it follows of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that <hi>Hatred,</hi> which withdraws us from some <hi>Evil,</hi> doth at the same time remove us also from some <hi>Good</hi> to which the same is conjoyn'd. And since the <hi>Privation</hi> of this Good, is represented to the Soul as a <hi>Defect</hi> or want belonging to her: it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly affecteth her with <hi>sorrow.</hi> For Example; the <hi>Hate</hi> that alienateth us from the evil manners of a man with whom
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62014:82"/>
formerly we have been acquainted, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parateth us likewise from his <hi>Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> wherein we might find somthing of <hi>Good</hi>: and to be deprived of that Good, is matter of regret and <hi>Sorrow.</hi> So in all other Hatred, we may soon observe some cause of <hi>Sorrow.</hi>¶</p>
            <p>To the excitement of <hi>Desire</hi> in the Soul,<note place="margin">Art. 26. <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Fear.</hi>
               </note> it is sufficient that she conceive the acquisition of the Good, or avoidance of the Evil represented to her as to come, to be <hi>possible</hi>: but if she further consider whether it be <hi>Easy</hi> or <hi>Difficult</hi> for her to obtain her end; and there occur to her more reasons for the facility: then there succeeds that gentle <hi>Effusion</hi> or Tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Soul toward the good desired, which is called <hi>Hope</hi> or <hi>Expectation of good to come.</hi> Whereas on the contrary, if the greater weight be found in the other Scale, and she apprehend the thing desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to be <hi>Difficult</hi>; she is immediately <hi>Contracted,</hi> and coold with that ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful passion, <hi>Fear,</hi> which is <hi>expectation of Evil to come.</hi> And as <hi>Hope</hi> exalted to the highest degree, is changed into <hi>Trust, Confidence</hi> or <hi>Security</hi>: So on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>Fear</hi> in extremity becomes <hi>Despera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Again, if this Contraction of the Soul by Fear, be suddain and profound, and the Evil expected very great; then

is the passion called <hi>Terror, Dread</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation,</hi> which sometimes is so violent, as to cause <hi>Exanimation</hi> or suddain Death.</p>

            <p>And of this Animosity, <hi>Emulation</hi> is a species, whereby the Soul is disposed to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:62014:83"/>
attempt or enetrprise difficult things,<note place="margin">Art. 28. <hi>Emulation,</hi> a species of <hi>Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</hi>
               </note> which she hopes will succeed happily to her, because she observes them to do so to others. But then it is to be distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed from simple <hi>Animosity</hi> by two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties. Whereof <hi>One</hi> is, that it hath not only an internal Cause, viz. such a disposition of the spirits and body, that Desire and Hope may have greater pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in impelling the blood in abundance to the heart, than Fear or Despair can have in hindering that motion: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so an external Cause, namely, the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi> of others who have been prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in the like attempts, which creates a belief in us, that we also shall be able to conquer the difficulties occurring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as those others have done. The <hi>Other,</hi> this; that <hi>Emulation</hi> is ever accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with secret <hi>Grief,</hi> which ariseth from seeing ourselves exceeded or excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by our concurrents. But simple <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosity</hi> wants both Example for incitement, and Grief for alloy. But both these passions equaly depend upon Hope of good success. For,</p>
            <p>Though the object of <hi>Audacity</hi> be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, yet to animate us to contend bravely with that difficulty,<note place="margin">Art. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

end. Yet this <hi>end</hi> is not the same thing with that <hi>object</hi>; for, there cannot be both <hi>Certitude</hi> and <hi>Despair</hi> of the same thing at the same time. So when the Roman <hi>Decii</hi> rushed into the thickest troops of their enemies, and ran to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain death; the <hi>object</hi> of their daring was the difficulty of conserving their lives in that action, for which difficulty they had nothing but Desperation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing resolved certainly to dye: but their <hi>End</hi> was, either by their example to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire courage into the Roman army, and by them to obtain the victory they hoped; or to acquire posthume Glory, whereof they were certain.

But when we proceed to consider the Event as altogether, or for the most part depending upon our own counsel, and perceive a difficulty to arise either in our election, or execution of the means whereby to obtain our end: then there
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:62014:84"/>
immediately follows a <hi>Doubting</hi> or <hi>Fluctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the mind, whereby we are dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to deliberate and consult; and which is indeed a species of <hi>Fear.</hi> And this <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering,</hi> while it retains the Soul as it were in a doubtful balance betwixt two actions which are offered to her election; is the cause that she performs neither, but takes time to consider before she deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth which to do, for fear of erring in her choice.

affected with that disquiet of mind, which is named by the Greeks, <hi>Syntere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi>; by the Latins, <hi>Morsus Conscientiae</hi>; and by the French, <hi>Regret</hi>; which yet doth not (as the precedent passions) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the future, but present or past time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This <hi>Remorse of Conscience</hi> is no other but a kind of <hi>Sorrow,</hi> arising from a scruple interposed, whether what we are doing, or have done, be good, or not.

            <p>In <hi>Hope</hi> therefore (which we defined to be a <hi>gentle and sweet</hi> Effusion or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pansion <hi>of the Soul towards some good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to come</hi>) if we be possessed with an opinion,<note place="margin">Art. 32.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The <hi>Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of the Soul and Spirits in <hi>Hope.</hi>
               </note> that the thing desired will short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come to pass; I conceive that present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Animal Spirits, which before were imployed as Emissaries, to contemplate the image of the object, returning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Soul, give notice of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the guest expected: and that thereupon the whole Soul composing her<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>self by expansion to receive and welcome the same, sets open all the doors of the Senses to admit more freely all the good belonging thereunto; retains the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination fixt and intent upon the gratefull idea thereof; and by copious supplies of spirits dispatched into the nerves of the Heart, so invigorates and quickens the pulse thereof, that thereby the blood is more briskly sent forth into the outward parts of t

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:62014:86"/>
when we are full of Hope, we feel a certain <hi>inflation</hi> both within and without in our whole body, together with a <hi>glowing</hi> but <hi>pleasant heat,</hi> from the blood and spirits universaly diffused. But if during this comfortable emotion of the Soul, there occurr any suddain cause of <hi>Doubt</hi> or <hi>fear</hi>; she is instantly checked and coold into an anxious <hi>Retraction</hi> of herself, and a sinking of the spirits, so that the motion of the heart becomes weaker and slower, and the external parts grow languid and pale. For,</p>

               <note place="margin">Art. 33. The <hi>Motions</hi> of the Soul and Spirits in <hi>Fear.</hi>
               </note>In <hi>Fear,</hi> the Sensitive Soul, which was before expansed, being surprised with apprehension of approaching Evil, and willing to decline it, immediately withdraws herself into her retiring room, and shrinks up herself into herself; at the same time recalling her forces, the spirits, to her aid, and compressing them. If the Fear be exalted to the degree of <hi>Terror,</hi> and the Evil seem impendent; then at the same time the spirits are sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly recall'd from the outguards, the pores of the skin also are shut up by strong constriction (as if the Soul would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct and barricado all avenues against her invading enemy) whereby the <hi>hairs</hi> are raised an end, and the whole body is put into a <hi>Horror</hi> or shaking, After this,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:62014:86"/>
if the passion continue, the whole army of spirits being put into confusion, so that they can not execute their offices; the usual succors of <hi>Reason</hi> fail, and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of <hi>voluntary motion</hi> become weak; yea sometimes, by reason of a resolution of the nerves and sphincters of the gutts and bladder, the <hi>Excrements</hi> themselves are let forth involuntarily. From this damp obscuring the <hi>Lucid</hi> part of the Sensitive Soul, there quickly succeeds an Eclipse also of the <hi>Vital.</hi> For the influx of the Animal spirits from the brain into the Cardiac nerves being intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the motions of the heart must of necessity be renderd weak, and insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to maintain with due vigour and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerity the circulation of the blood: which therefore stopping and stagnating in the ventricles of the heart, causeth <hi>fainting</hi> and <hi>swooning</hi> by oppression; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (where the passion is hightned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Consternation</hi> also suddain <hi>death.</hi> And from this arrest of the blood in the heart, by strong constriction of the nerves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto belonging; we may with reason de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive that same anxious <hi>oppression,</hi> and <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling weight</hi> which men commonly feel in their breast, when they are invaded by violent <hi>Fear</hi>; and upon which the most acute <hi>Monsieur Des Cartes</hi> seems to have

               </note>This <hi>Fear,</hi> when it excludes all hope of evasion, degenerateth into the most cruel of all passions, <hi>Desperation.</hi> Which though by exhibiting the thing desired as impossible, it wholy extinguish de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, which is never carried but to things apprehended as possible: yet it so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts the Soul, that she persevering in her Constriction, either through abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute despondency yeelds up herself as overcome, and remains half-extinct and entombd in the body; or driven into confusion and neglect of all things, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts a deep <hi>Melancholy,</hi> or flyes out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a furious <hi>Madness</hi>; in both cases, seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to put an end to her misery by destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herself.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, when Fear gives place to <hi>Hope</hi>; and that Hope is strong enough to produce <hi>Courage</hi>; thereby to incense the Soul to encounter the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that oppose her in the way to her end: in this case she first dilates herself with great vigor and celerity, breaking forth as it were into flashes of efforts; then instantly diffuseth whole legions of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62014:87"/>
spirits into the nerves and muscles, to extend them, in order to resistence or striking with all their forces; and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all her powers into a brave devoir to overcome, undauntedly pursues the the conflict. Hence it comes, that the breast being strongly dilated and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted alternately, the <hi>voice</hi> is sent forth more sounding and piercing than at other times; as if to sound a defiance and charge at once: the armes are raised up, the hands constringed into fists, the head advanced into a posture of daring and contempt of danger, the brows contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the whole face distorted into an aspect full of terror and threatnings, the neck swoln, and most other parts dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended beyond their usual dimensions. All which <hi>symptoms</hi> evidently arise from a copious and impetuous effusion of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal spirits from the brain, and of blood from the heart, into the outward parts. ¶</p>
            <p>From this concise explication of the motions of the Sensitive Soul, the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and blood, that constitute the passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Hope and Fear, with their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, Animosity and Desperation, the clue of our method leads us to the <hi>fifth</hi> classis of passions.</p>
            <p>The consideration of good present,<note place="margin">Art. 35. Joy.</note> and belonging to us in particular, begets in
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62014:88"/>
the Soul that delight which we call <hi>Ioy</hi>: wherein consisteth our possession of that good, which the impressions of the brain represent to the Soul as her own.</p>
            <p>First I say, that in this delightful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion doth consist the <hi>possession of good</hi>; because in truth the Soul reaps no other fruit from all the goods she possesseth: and when she takes no delight or joy in them, it may justly be said, she doth no more injoy them, than if she did not at all possess them.</p>
            <p>Then I add, that <hi>the good is such as the impressions made upon the brain repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the Soul as hers</hi>; that I may not confound this Joy whereof I now speak, and which is a Passion; with Joy purely <hi>intellectual,</hi> which enters into the <hi>Rational</hi> Soul by an action proper to her alone, and which we may call a pleasant commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion raised by herself in herself, wherein consisteth the possession of good, that her intellect represents to her as her own. Tho realy so long as the Rational Soul continues conjoyned with the Sensitive, it can hardly be but that this intellectual joy will have the other that is a passion, for its companion. For, so soon as our Intellect observes that we possess any good, though that good be so far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from all that pertains to the body,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62014:88"/>
that it is wholy unimaginable; yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently the <hi>Imagination</hi> makes some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression in the brain, from whence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth a motion of the Sensitive Soul, and of the Spirits, that exciteth the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Joy.</p>
            <p>Of this so gratefull affection there are divers <hi>sorts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Art. 36. The various <hi>Degrees</hi> of <hi>Ioy</hi> and their <hi>names.</hi>
               </note> or (to speak more strictly) <hi>degrees.</hi> For, as various circumstances may intervene, and cause the Soul to be more or less affected with her fruition of the good she possesseth: so may we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish various differences of the passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on itself. To be more particular; as the good she possesseth, is great or small; unexpected, or long desired; durable, or transitory; and as reason moderateth the appetite, or suffers it to be unbrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: so it comes to pass, that the Effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Soul, and consequently the pleasure is greater or less, permanent or momentary, immoderate or temperate, &amp;c. And hence the kinds of more <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss</hi> Joy are call'd <hi>Complacency, Iucun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, Gladness, Exhilaration</hi>: and those of more <hi>intens, Rejoycing, Exsultation, Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, Boasting, Transport</hi> or <hi>Ecstasy, Laughter,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>By the same reason,<note place="margin">Art 37. The various <hi>Degrees</hi> of <hi>Grief,</hi> and their <hi>names.</hi>
               </note> as the Evil that causeth the opposite passion of <hi>Grief,</hi> is in the present great or little, suddain or

foreseen, long or short, and the like: so are there excited various kinds or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of <hi>Trouble</hi> or <hi>Grief</hi>; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the passion is distinguished into <hi>Discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, Sollicitude, Vexation, Sadness, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, Affliction, Misery, Lamentation, Weeping</hi> and <hi>Howling.</hi> All which belong to <hi>Grief,</hi> which is an ingrateful <hi>Languor of</hi> the Sensitive Soul, wherein alone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth the incommodity that hapneth to her from Evil or defect, which the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions made upon the brain, represent to her as her own. For, besides this, there is also an <hi>Intellectual Sorrow</hi> proper to the <hi>Rational</hi> Soul, which is not to be placed in the number of the passions, tho for the most part it hath for its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct the passion of Sorrow; by reason of the most strict conjunction betwixt the two Souls in this life.</p>

and then are <hi>offended</hi>; and so what would be to others matter only of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation,</hi> to them proves cause of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</hi> But this commotion is soon calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, because the force of the sudain <hi>Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> that raised it, continues not long: and so soon as they perceive that the thing for which they were offended, ought not to have commoved them to passion; they suppress their displeasure, and repent of it.

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62014:96"/>
Hence probably it is, that in this most agreeable passion, both the <hi>pulse</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies made equal and more frequent, tho not so intense and strong as in <hi>Love</hi>; and a certain <hi>gratefull heat</hi> is felt, not only through the Lungs and all the breast, but through all outward parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; from the diffusion of the blood in full streams into them, which is discerni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble even by the florid <hi>purple colour</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are suddainly tinged, and by the <hi>inflation</hi> or plumpness of all the mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the <hi>face,</hi> which is thereby rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red more <hi>serene,</hi> sweet and cheerful. Easy therefore it is to infer, that as this passion is most congruous to the nature of the Corporeal Soul, so are the corpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al motions that accompany and characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize it, most profitable to <hi>health</hi>; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they be <hi>moderare.</hi> For, this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion and Effusion may be so vehement and suddain, that the Soul may become weak, and unable to rule the body, or to actuate the organs of speech, yea swoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and death itself somtimes follow pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse and insolent Joy. So <hi>Lacon Chilo,</hi> an eminent Philosopher, suddainly expired in excessive joy, beholding his Sonne a Victor in the Olympic games.

The <hi>reason</hi> whereof seems to consist, not in a vehement effusion and dissipation of the vital spirits, and a destitution of the Heart consequent thereunto; as <hi>Ferneli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> would have it; because the faster the blood is effused through the arteries from the heart, the swifter must it return to the heart through the veines, so that the heart cannot be totaly exhausted and left destitute of blood: but rather in a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge and <hi>suffocation</hi> of the heart by too redundant an afflux of blood. For, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on extraordinary dilatation of the floud-gates of the heart by immoderate joy, the current of blood both out of the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na cava,</hi> and from the <hi>arteria venosa,</hi> may pour itself with so much violence, and in so great a quantity, into the ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles thereof, that the heart, unable to discharge itself soon enough of that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing deluge, by retruding its <hi>valves,</hi> may be suffocated, its motions stopped, and the Vital Flame in a moment extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished.

               <note place="margin">Art. 55. A conjecture concerning the <hi>cause</hi> thereof.</note>Concerning this Problem therefore, it is observable that in <hi>Man,</hi> there seems to be a greater consent or sympathy, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>commerce</hi> of motions betwixt the <hi>Midriff</hi> and the <hi>Heart,</hi> yea and the <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination</hi> also; than in Brutes of what or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or tribe soever: and that the <hi>Reason</hi> given hereof by the most accurate of our Modern Anatomists, is this; that the principal Nerve of the <hi>Midriff</hi> is rooted in the same Nerve of the Spine (named <hi>Nervus vertebralis</hi>) from whence there comes a conspicuous branch into the grand <hi>plexus</hi> of the <hi>Intercostal</hi> nerve; and that commonly two, sometimes three other branches more are derived from that same notable <hi>plexus,</hi> into the very trunk of the Nerve of the <hi>Diaphragm</hi> (as you may see most elegantly represented by <hi>Dr. Willis</hi> in the 9<hi>th Table</hi> of his most elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Book <hi>de Anatomia Cerebri</hi>) which are not found in Beasts. For, from this plenty and singular contexture of nerves, it may be conjectured, not only why the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragm</hi> doth so readily conform its moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to those of the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> and of the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:62014:99"/>
Animal Spirits excited in passions of the Mind, and cooperate with them; but also why <hi>Risibility</hi> is an affection <hi>proper</hi> only to <hi>Man.</hi> For (as the same most curious <hi>Dr. Willis</hi> reasoneth, in his chapter of the functions and uses of the <hi>Intercostal</hi> pair of nerves) when the Imagination is affected with some pleasant and new conceipt, instantly there is caused a brisk and placid motion of the heart, as if it sprung up with joy to be alleviated or eased of its burden. Wherefore that the blood may be the more speedily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged out of the right Ventricle of the heart into the Lungs, and out of the left into the <hi>Aorta</hi> or grand Artery; the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragm,</hi> being by abundance of Animal spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits immitted through so many nerves pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the aforesaid <hi>Plexus,</hi> briskly agitated is by nimble contraction drawn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; and so making many vibrations, doth at once raise up the <hi>Lungs,</hi> and force them to expell the blood out of their vessels into the <hi>arteria venosa,</hi> and to explode the aire out of their pipes into the windpipe; and this by frequent contractions of their lax and spongy substance, answerable in time and quickness to the vibrations of the <hi>Midriff.</hi> And then because the same <hi>Intercostal</hi> nerve, which communicateth with the nerve of the <hi>Diaphragm</hi> below, is conjoyned above also with the nerves
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:62014:100"/>
of the jaws and muscles of the face; thence it is, that the motions of Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being once begun in the brest, the <hi>face</hi> also is distorted into gestures or grimasces patheticaly correspondent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. And this is the most probable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I am able at present to give of the <hi>occasions</hi> and <hi>motions</hi> of <hi>passionate Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in general: nor can I at present think of any more plausible conjecture concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reason of the admirable laughter of <hi>Ludovicus Vives,</hi> than this; that in him the nerves inservient to the motion of the Midriff, might be after such a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar manner contrived and framed, as easily to cause quick and short recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations thereof, upon the pleasant af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his Imagination by the grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful relish of his meat, after long absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, which doth alwaies highten the pleasure of refection: But we have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted too long upon the <hi>motions</hi> of <hi>Ioy.</hi>

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:62014:100"/>
with too slow a motion. Whence the <hi>pulse</hi> is rendered <hi>little, slow, rare,</hi> and <hi>weak</hi>; and there is felt about the heart a certain oppressive <hi>strictness,</hi> as if the orifices of it were drawn together, with a manifest <hi>chilness</hi> congealing the blood, and communicating itself to the rest of the body. From which dejecting symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms it is easy to collect, that this dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full affection, especialy if it be vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and of long continuance, cannot but infer many, and grievous incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities to the whole body. For, besides this that it darkneth the <hi>spirits,</hi> and so dulls the <hi>wit,</hi> obscures the <hi>judgment,</hi> blunts the <hi>memory,</hi> and in a word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouds the <hi>Lucid</hi> part of the Soul: it doth moreover incrassate the blood by refri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geration, and by that reason immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately constringe the heart, cause the lamp of life to burn weakly and dimly, induce want of sleep by drying the brain, corrupt the <hi>nutritive juice,</hi> and convert it into that Devil of a humor, Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly. No wonder then if in men over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with this so dismal passion, the countenance appears pale, wan and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less; the limbs grow heavy and indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to motion, the flesh decays and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes through want of nourishment, and the whole body be precipated into imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillity, <hi>Cachexy</hi> or an evil habit, langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing

and other cold and chronic diseases.

Which I am apt to refer to this; that in the ventricles of the heart, tho but very slowly commoved, there can hardly be so smale a quantity of blood, but it may suffice to keep alive the vital flame burning therein, when the orifices of them are almost closed, as commonly they are by immoderate grief.</p>

               <note place="margin">Art. 58. Whence <hi>Tears</hi> flow.</note>As for the <hi>Fountain</hi> therefore whence all our <hi>Tears</hi> flow, and the <hi>Matter</hi> whereof they consist; the succesful industry of Modern Anatomists hath discovered, that in the <hi>Glandules</hi> placed at each cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Eyes, there is either from the <hi>blood</hi> brought thither by the arteries (as the vulgar doctrine is) or (as I, upon good reasons elswhere delivered, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) from the <hi>Nutritive juice</hi> brought by nerves, separated, and kept in store a certain thin, clear and watery humor, partly <hi>saline,</hi> partly <hi>subacid</hi> in tast; the <hi>use</hi> whereof is aswell to keep the globes of the eyes moist and slippery, for their more easy motion; as to serve for <hi>Tears</hi> when we have occasion to shed them. And to this some have added, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there are certain branches of nerves (like the tendrels of a vine) incir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cling the vessells leading to and from those <hi>Glandules,</hi> and by their tension somtimes constringing them: therefore it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that when the serous humor is too abundant in the blood brought into the brain, the same is by the arteries (whose pulse is quickned somwhat by the pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of these nerves) brought more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piously than at other times, into those

               <hi>Glandules,</hi> and after its separation, there detained from returning by the veins, that are likewise streightned by constricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the same nerves.

               </note> the most rational account I have hitherto met with concerning it, is this. When any occasion of <hi>weeping</hi> occurrs, and affects the Sensitive Soul; instantly the <hi>Ventricles</hi> of the heart, with all the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> are by the blood in abundance brought into them, more than usualy crowded and distended, and the <hi>Lungs</hi> also stuffed and inflated, so that they cannot perform the action of respi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration but by <hi>sobbs</hi> intermixed; and the <hi>Midriff,</hi> to give room to such distension of the heart and Lungs, is pressed down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, with a more intense contraction alternately succeeding; which great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression and brisk contraction being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peted, is the efficient cause of <hi>Sobbing.</hi> and at the same time the air being with difficulty admitted into the lungs, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:62014:103"/>
they and the Midriff are so excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly distended, and with no less diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty exploded again by the windpipe: thence comes that whining sound of <hi>cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>howling.</hi> To this affection of the <hi>vitals,</hi> the parts of the <hi>face</hi> also, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing distorted into a sad and mournfull as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, exactly correspond: because the nerves which contract the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> have a communion of continuity, and coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with those which are inserted into the muscles of the face, and which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it into the postures of weeping and laughter in passion. Nor doth the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order cease here, but extend itself to the upper region also, to the <hi>brain,</hi> where the Spirits being put into confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and the arteries surcharged with too great an afflux of blood from the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed heart; the palace of the Soul it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self is brought into danger of a purple de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge. For prevention whereof, the nerves incircling and binding the trunks of the arteries in many places, strongly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stringe them; so that the commotion of the blood is much repressed, the liquor thereof (in the beginning of the passion highly rarefied) suddainly condensed, and the serous part of it being put into a flux, is transmitted into the above mentioned Glandules of the Eyes, there
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:62014:103"/>
placed and destined by nature to receive it. And then because these <hi>Glandules</hi> are in like manner constringed, and as it were squeez'd by certain nerves that are of the same original and community with the <hi>Pathetic</hi> nerves of the <hi>face</hi> and <hi>heart:</hi> the <hi>serous</hi> liquor is expressed out of them through their <hi>excretory channels</hi> leading to the corners of the Eyes (most accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately described, with their uses, by that diligent Anatomist <hi>Nichol.

And from this variety it is, that men have distinguished Anger into <hi>Harmless</hi> and <hi>Dangerous,</hi> or simple heat of blood, and thirst after Revenge: assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moreover to each sort its proper <hi>Signs</hi> or Characters observable in the outward parts of the body, and especially in the <hi>face.</hi> For some when they are angry, look <hi>pale,</hi> or <hi>tremble</hi>; others grow <hi>red,</hi> or <hi>weep</hi>: and the vulgar judgeth the passion of the <hi>first</hi> sort to be much more <hi>dangerous,</hi> than that of the <hi>other.</hi> Whereof the <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> may be this; that when we either will not, or cannot shew our resentments, and revenge otherwise than by our change of countenance, and by words; we then put forth all our heat, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert all our force at the very beginning of the commotion; so that the blood being in this sudden effort copiously effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from the heart into the face. and there detained a while by constriction of the veines by those Branches of the <hi>Fifth</hi> pair of nerves that are inserted into the mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of that part; we are forced to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the scarlet livery of <hi>shame,</hi> that is,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:62014:105"/>
to <hi>blush</hi> out of <hi>indignation</hi> and <hi>regret</hi> or grief at the unworthy affront. And some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the first emotion of <hi>desire</hi> to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate our selves, together with <hi>commisera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of our own want of power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge more effectually, causeth us also to <hi>shed tears.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But they who on the contrary, reserve themselves for, and strongly resolve upon <hi>revenge</hi> in time to come, grow deeply <hi>sad</hi> and <hi>pensive</hi> at the present; as conceiving themselves thereunto obliged by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the injury done to them, and cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about in their thoughts how to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish their revenge: and all this while the <hi>Sensitive Soul</hi> persisting in her <hi>Contraction</hi> and revocation of the Spirits inwards, there is no extraordinary, nay but little diffusion of the blood outwards. And sometimes they also <hi>fear</hi> the evils that may ensue from the revenge they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend; which strikes them into <hi>paleness, shivering</hi> and <hi>trembling</hi>: the Sensitive Soul being then distracted betwixt the contrary motions of <hi>desire</hi> of revenge, and of <hi>fear</hi> of the ill consequents thereof; like a Sea beaten by two contrary winds. Yet after this first conflict is over, when they come to <hi>execute</hi> their revenge, then fear giving place to rage, they soon grow the more <hi>inflamed</hi> and daring, by how much
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:62014:106"/>
the <hi>colder</hi> they were during their delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: as in <hi>Fevers</hi> that invade with cold and shivering, the following heats are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes most ardent and unquenchable. You see then how the <hi>Motions,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the <hi>Efforts</hi> and <hi>Effects</hi> of this vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent passion may be <hi>diversified</hi> even by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of other <hi>affections</hi> conjoyned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. For in the <hi>Harmless</hi> and <hi>Blushing</hi> or <hi>Weeping</hi> anger, there is alwayes a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>shame</hi> and <hi>self-pity</hi>; which by allaying the desire of revenge, helpeth much to check and moderate the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the blood; and therefore such anger seldom lasteth long, and is more easily composed: when on the other side, in the <hi>Pale</hi> and <hi>Trembling,</hi> but <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous</hi> anger, there is first deep <hi>Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> then <hi>Fear,</hi> and at last <hi>Furious</hi> persuit of <hi>revenge</hi>; by which the blood being most violently agitated, and the sulphureous parts of it all kindled into a flame, is not to be calmed and reduced to temper, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less by the pleasure of revenge, or by tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in the submission of the Enemy, or by the cold damp of repentance.

               </note>The <hi>First</hi> is, that of all the Passions recounted and described in this impolite discourse, there are only <hi>six</hi> that seem to be <hi>Simple</hi> and <hi>Principal,</hi> namely <hi>Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Love, Hatred, Desire, Ioy</hi> and <hi>Grief</hi>; which are therefore said to be <hi>Simple,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they consist of only one single act or commotion of the Sensitive Soul di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed with the apprehension of things whether real or imaginary.

And it may suffice to Natures vindication, that reason obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth me to acknowledge, that her design in instituting our Passions, was in the <hi>general</hi> this; <hi>that they might dispose and incite the</hi> Soul <hi>to affect and desire those things, which Nature by secret dictates teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be good and profitable to her; and to persist in that desire: as the same commotion of the spirits that is requisite to produce them, doth dispose the parts of the</hi> Body <hi>also to those motions that serve to the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her will.</hi> And hence doubtless it is, that they who are naturaly most apt to be moved by passions, have this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage above others of duller and gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser constitutions, that they may (if they will) tast more of the pleasures belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Sensitive Soul: but then again they are likewise thereby more exposed to drink of the gall and wormwood of pain and remorse, when they know not how to regulate their passions, and when adverse Fortune invades them.

Certainly <hi>no.</hi> For it is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impious, but highly absurd, to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that <hi>God</hi> can be Author of our <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,</hi> because he hath not given to us an Understanding <hi>Omniscious</hi>: for it is of the formal reason of a created intellect, that it be <hi>finite</hi>; and of a finite intellect, that it extend <hi>not</hi> itself to <hi>all</hi> things. But that Man should have a <hi>Will</hi> unconfined or extensible to all things, this indeed is convenient to his nature: and it is a transcendent <hi>perfection</hi> in him, that he can and doth act by his own will, that is <hi>freely</hi>; and so is, by a peculiar prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, Author of his own actions, and may deserve praise and reward for them. For no Man praiseth a Watch, or any other Self-moving engine made by art, for performing the motions thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed;
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:62014:110"/>
because those motions necessarily result from the figure and construction of its <hi>parts</hi>: but the <hi>Artist</hi> himself deserves praise, because he framed the engine not by necessity or compulsion, but <hi>freely.</hi> So we by the same reason deserve the more by well doing, that is by embracing truth, because we do it <hi>voluntary</hi> or by election; than we should, if we could not but do it. When therefore we fall into Errors, occasioned by our Passions; the defect lieth in our own act, or in the use of our <hi>liberty,</hi> not in our nature: for that is the same when we make an erroneous judgement of things represented to us, as it is when we make a right judgment. And although Almighty God might, if He had thought good, have given so great perspicacity to our Understanding, as that we could never have been decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: yet by what right can we require that privilege from him? True it is (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess) that among us <hi>Men,</hi> if any hath power to hinder this or that evil, and yet doth not hinder it; we accuse him as cause of it: and justly too, because the power that Men have one over others, was instituted, and committed to them to that end, that they should use it to the restraining of others from evil. But there is not the same reason why we should
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:62014:111"/>
think <hi>God</hi> to be Author of our Errors, only because it was in His power to have prevented them, by making us superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to deception: for the power that <hi>God</hi> hath of right over all Men, is most <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign,</hi> most <hi>absolute,</hi> most <hi>free.</hi> And therefore we are obliged to ascribe to His Divine Majesty, all possible praise and thanks for the good gifts He hath out of his infinite benignity been pleased to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow upon us his Creatures: but we have no pretext of right to complain, because He hath not conferred upon us all things that we conceive he might.</p>
            <p>Besides, although the <hi>Intellect</hi> of Man be not omniscious;<note place="margin">Art. 4. But from our <hi>ill use</hi> of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding we have, in the conduct of our <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires</hi> suggest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> yet is it not so narrow, so limited, as not to extend to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of his Unlimited <hi>Will,</hi> in the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Good, and avoidance of Evil; and consequently to his exemption from <hi>Error</hi> by the violence of his Passions. For, <hi>first,</hi> by virtue of his Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, Man is capable of <hi>Wisedom,</hi> which is alone able to teach him how to subdue and govern all his Affections, and how to dispense them with such dexterity, as not only to make all the Evils they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, easily tollerable, but even to reap internal satisfaction and joy from all. And <hi>secondly,</hi> it is evident from the very nature of our Passions, that they cannot
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:62014:111"/>
carry us on to any actions whatsoever, but only by the <hi>Desire</hi> they excite in us: and therefore if we can but <hi>direct</hi> that desire to <hi>right</hi> objects, that is to things <hi>realy Good</hi>; we may by that alone pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent our being deceived, that is our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carried to evil actions by violence of our Passions: but that <hi>Right Reason</hi> is of itself able so to direct our desire arising from passions, is manifest from the known Utility of <hi>Moral Philosophy,</hi> which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth certain rules to that end. I will <hi>conclude</hi> then, that I commit Errors in passion, not because I am naturaly prone to Passions, nor because I want an om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niscious Understanding: but only because I make not a <hi>right</hi> use of that finite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, yet sufficient <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> God hath given me,<note place="margin">Art. 5. That all <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors</hi> to which the <hi>desires</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by our Passions, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose us, arise from hence, that we doe not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently <hi>distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish</hi> things that depend intirely upon <hi>ourselves,</hi> from those that depend upon <hi>others.</hi>

            <p>That I may therefore be henceforth bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to make use of my Understanding as I ought, in such occasions; it highly concerneth me to enquire in the next place, into the origin of that <hi>Error,</hi> to which the <hi>Cupidity</hi> accompanying our Passions, doth most frequently expose us: for, that being once known, will be the more easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly avoidable. This <hi>Error</hi> then doth arise (if I mistake not) from hence; <hi>that we do not sufficiently distinguish those things that
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:62014:112"/>
depend intirely upon</hi> ourselves, <hi>from those that depend upon</hi> others, as to their events: it being a general rule, that <hi>Desire is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies good, when grounded upon certain Knowledge</hi>; and on the contrary alwaies <hi>evil,</hi> when founded upon some <hi>error.</hi> Now as to things that depend upon <hi>our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi> alone, that is upon our Free-will; to know them to be good, is sufficient to assure us we cannot desire them too fervently: because to doe good things that depend upon ourselves, is to <hi>pursue Virtue,</hi> which cannot be too fervently desired, nor can the <hi>event</hi> of our desire of such things possibly be unhappy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause from the conscience that by desiring them we have rightly used the freedom of our will, we receive all the satisfaction we expected. But alass! the Error that is too commonly committed in such cases, lieth not in the over fervent, but in the <hi>overcold</hi> desire. And the best <hi>remedy</hi> against this <hi>defect,</hi> is to free the mind as much as is possible, from all other desires less profitable; and then to endeavour clearly to understand, and with due at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to examine the goodness of the thing that is represented as worthy to be desired.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:62014:112"/>As for the things that are altogether <hi>independent</hi> upon <hi>Vs</hi>;<note place="margin">Art. 6. And that they may be <hi>prevented</hi> by two <hi>General Remedies,</hi> viz. <hi>Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity.</hi>
               </note> however good they may be, yet we are never to desire them vehemently: not only because tis possible they may never arrive, and so vex and torment the mind so much the more bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, by how much the more eagerly they have been desired; but chiefly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by preoccupating our thoughts, they withdraw our study from other things whereof the acquisition depends upon ourselves. And against these <hi>vain</hi> desires there are <hi>two</hi> general <hi>Remedies</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the first is true <hi>Generosity</hi>; the other, a firm belief of, and tranquill depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon <hi>Providence Divine.</hi> For, that noble and heroic habit of the mind, which is called <hi>Generosity,</hi> and which seems to comprehend all other Virtues; though it animateth Men to great and honorable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises, doth yet at the same time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain them from attempting things which they conceive themselves incapable to effect; inspiring <hi>courage,</hi> not temerity.

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:62014:113"/>
and ready to oblige every one by good offices, when it is in our power so to do.

               </note>But do not I here propose a lesson ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard to human frailty to learn? Is it not extremely difficult thus accurrately and calmly to examine things, when the imagination is vehemently commoved by the object of some more violent passion, and the judgment strongly surprised?

And others there are, I know, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing naturaly propens to the commotions of Joy, or of Commiseration, or Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, or Anger; have not the power to refrain themselves from swooning, or tears, or trembling, or heat of blood, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their Phansy is vehemently assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by objects apt to excite those Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Nay, as if all Mankind were equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly subject to the same defect, it is held for
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:62014:116"/>
a Maxim, that <hi>the firs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> motions of our pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions are not in our power.</hi> And yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, this so universal defect is not incurable by <hi>Premeditation</hi> and <hi>care.</hi> When therefore we first feel any such strong commotion of our blood, we ought to be premonished and to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that all things that offer themselves to the imagination, respect only the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Reasonable Soul, and to perswade her that the reasons which serve to recommend the object of her passion, are far more firm and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable than in reality they are: and on the contrary, that those which serve to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it, are much weaker and less considerable than in truth they are. And when Passion comes at length to perswade us to do those things whose execution admits of any the least pause or delay: we must remember to abstain from gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving judgment concerning them, much less assent to them, and to avert our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations to other things, untill time and quiet have wholy composed the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in our blood. Finaly, when heat of passion inciteth us to actions that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low little or no time for counsel or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation; in this case we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert our will chiefly upon following those <hi>reasons</hi> that are <hi>contrary</hi> to what that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:62014:117"/>
suggesteth, although they appear less valid. So when an Enemy invades us unexpectedly, that suddain occasion permits us not to take time for delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration whether of the three is best, to <hi>resist,</hi> to <hi>submit,</hi> or to <hi>fly.</hi> Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when we feel ourselves surprised with <hi>fear</hi>; we should endeavor to avert our thoughts from the considerat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>on of the danger, and fix them upon the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for which there is greater security and honor in resistence than in flight: and on the contrary, when we perceive our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be by <hi>anger</hi> and desire of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge</hi> provoked to rush turiously upon him who assaults us; we must remember to think, that it is great imprudence to precipitate ones self into manifest danger, when safety may be obtained without infamy: and where we are <hi>infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior</hi> to the Aggressor in point of strength, there we are likewise to consider, that it is better to retreat honorably, or to consent to terms of submission, than like a wild beast to expose ourselves to certain death. This therefore I ought to prescribe to my self, as a <hi>Third Panc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reston</hi> or <hi>Vniversal Antidote</hi> against the incommodities impendent from Passions; viz. to give myself time for deliberation, where the occasion will allow it: and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:62014:117"/>
where it will not, there to convert my thought chiefly upon the reasons that contradict the suggestions of my passion: and alwaies to remember that the reasons that offer themselves to recommend the object of my passion, are not realy so va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and considerable, as my imagination represents them to be. Nor doth this counsel seem difficult to be put in practise, especialy by considerate Men and such who are wont to make serious reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon their actions.</p>
