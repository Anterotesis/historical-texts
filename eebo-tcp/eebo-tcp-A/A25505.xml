            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Anſwer of the BERMUDA COMPANY TO THE Matters Complained of in the Petition of Mr. PERIENT TROTT, humbly offered to the Conſideration of the Honourable the Knights, Citezens and Burgiſſes Aſſembled in PARLIAMENT.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He <hi>Bermuda</hi> Company having purchaſed the ſoyl of the Iſland, were incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in 1614. by the Name of the <hi>Governour and Company of the City of</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, <hi>for Plantation of the Summer Iſlands;</hi> and thereby had the ſole Government committed to them, with a power to make Laws as near as might be to the Laws of <hi>England;</hi> being the ſame power granted to all other His Majeſties foreign Plantations, and the Company are ſtill the proprietors of the ſaid Iſlands. And if any By-Laws were made contrary to their power, or prejudicial to the Iſland (as is untruly ſuggeſted) the Company here muſt needs be the great looſers.</p>
            <p>That no Lands have been taken away from any perſon without due proceedings and Examinaton had according to the Laws and conſtitutions of the Iſlands; neither have any Records or due Entries manifeſting any mans title to the ſame been razed or altered, nor have any perſons been admitted to any ſhares in the ſaid Iſlands, but upon evidence of their right and title to the ſame.</p>
            <p>That the penny in the pound upon <hi>Tobacco,</hi> is a Tax neceſſary to ſupport the charges of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, (over and above the publick ſhares ſet aſide and now imployed for that purpoſe) and is duely impoſed, and for the recovery thereof, Actions at Law are brought againſt the Petitioner Mr. <hi>Trott,</hi> whereby the validity of the ſaid Tax will be tryed.</p>
            <p>And if the Governour and Council there do impoſe any Aſſeſsment upon the Planters, without the conſent of the Aſſembly, it is without the knowledge of the Company, and contrary to the Known Laws of the place, and would be redreſſed upon complaint made to the Company here.</p>
            <p>That the managing the Trade of <hi>Tobacco</hi> in the Companies Magazin Ships, is neceſſary for the Proprietors, ſufficient for the growth and utmoſt improvements of the Iſlands, ſatisfactory to the Planters, alwaies uſed ſince the firſt purchaſe of the Iſlands, and the only way for the preventing of frauds and oppreſſions.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Whale Fiſhing,</hi> The Company having made a Leaſe thereof for Ninety nine years, to ſeveral Undertakers, who expended near four thouſand pound in Boats, Tackle, and other charges for carrying on the Trade, and having intruſted ſome perſons under them to manage the ſame for five years, and the ſaid Truſtees having ſome ways intereſted Mr. <hi>Trott</hi> therein, and the five years being expired, the ſaid Boats and Tackle were ſeized at the requeſt and for the ſaid undertakers, who are the Proprietors and owners of the ſame. And are now under the value of one hundred pound.</p>
            <p>As to the building of Ships, If the ſame were not reſtrained, there would not be Timber left ſufficient for the neceſſary ſupply of the Iſlands.</p>
            <p>And as to Appeals, Any perſon aggrieved may bring the ſame, unleſs where the Cauſe of Action is under the value of five pounds.</p>
            <p>And ever ſince the granting of the ſaid Charter, the Company have endeavoured to advance the Common and Publick Intereſt of the Iſlands, and the rights of the Proprietors there. And the Iſlands are now in a more flouriſhing condition than ever they were ſince they were firſt Planted.</p>
