         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:4562:4"/>
ſucceeding right hath tranſ-ferred the Crowne?</p>
            <p>Thou bendeſt thy browes, thou curſeſt, thou ſpighteſt, and grindeſt thy teeth to beholde all thy Magicke artes deluded, thou art ready to burſt with rage and deſpight, and deafneſt our eares with exclaimes, that thus at laſt thou art kept at a bay. The vertue, the Lawrell, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and victories of our <hi>Hercules</hi> of <hi>Gaule,</hi> the queller of ſo many Monſters thy children, makes thee ready to die with fury, ther are ſo many pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, and ſo many deſerued corrections hammering in thy head.

            <p>Theſe Armes that you haue taken againſt him (ô Rebels) will turne to your owne ruine and confuſion, ſeeing God forbids ye ſo to doe, what-ſoeuer pretence ye make of Religion. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſhould moue ye to pitty, and not to rage: to compaſsion, and not furie: to loue &amp; regard of your King, and not to rancour or hatred: to a naturall French-affection of hys ſeruice, and not to an obſtinate will, to wound, deſtroy, and take his life from him, if ye could.</p>
            <p>Now ſay my Lords and Gentlemen, if yet ye haue not ſufficient manifeſtation, that euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Tyrants, Religion cannot ſerue for anie cloake or collour? The Spanyard, hath not be declared ſo much, who tearming himſelfe in Fraunce, <hi>Protector of the Catholique Religion,</hi> hath not hee (neuertheleſſe) ſuffered Paganiſme in many places of Granado, Andalozia, and Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, for the great <note n="*" place="margin">Religion, or any thing ſerues the Spanyard, if hee may get any profit by it.</note> profit hee got by it many yeeres together? Will ye not yet bethinke your ſelues, what good affection the Spanyards haue (of old) borne to the French? Did they not (no long time ſince) kindly intreate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at Florida:
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:4562:72"/>
where they pluckt out theyr eyes, to make them die the more miſerably? Their drift is, to bee Commaunders ouer ye, and if you haue goods and faire wiues, to put you and your heyres to death, to poſſeſſe your wiues and your goods: as they haue practiſed the like in Flaunders, Naples, Millaine, and in euery place where they by force doe domineere. It is the Crowne, it is the Crowne that all this debate is for, although we hauing (as I haue proued) a lawfull ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, there cannot be gathered any occaſion for ſuch a debate.</p>
            <p>VVhen heere-to-fore there happened anie ſuch like ſtrife, they had recourſe to the eſtates of Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: as it chanced after the death of <hi>Lewes</hi> the 10. called <hi>Hutin,</hi> that the Crowne was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudged to <hi>Phillip le Long</hi> his brother. And after <hi>Charles le Bel</hi> to <hi>Phillip de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alloys</hi> his Couſin, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Edward</hi> king of England, who pretended the cauſe of his Mother, the daughter of <hi>Phillip le Bel,</hi> &amp; ſiſter to laſt three kings: but there ſhe had no right, by force of the <hi>Salique</hi> Lawe, which excludes the daughters of Fraunce from any ſucceſsion. It is now no queſtion of holding the eſtates, in this regard, ſeeing no one maketh doubt, but that the Crowne appertaineth to <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Burbon,</hi> by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for his race &amp; admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perfections, with his happy fortunes in war, amidſt ſo many trauerſes: the eſtate receiueth more honor, being gouerned by ſuch a king, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:4562:73"/>
the King dooth of the eſtate, which comes to him by ſucceſſion, as beeing the very neereſt heire to the Crowne.</p>
            <p>Then you braue Lordes and Gentlemen of Fraunce, whoſe famous Grandfathers defended this Kingdome by their vertuous ſtrength, and made their glorie wondered at through the world: ſpend not your valiant &amp; noble blood to your eternal deſtruction, but as your ſpirits are rockes of far more excellent perfection, ſo ſeeke ſuch waies as are more worthy and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable for ye. To bring again this eſtate, with the whole body of the Nobillity, who haue euer ſtood with the King, &amp; from whom through falſe impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your ſelues are diſmembred: into her former ſplendour &amp; honorable quiet. Vnite your ſelues to your king your ſoueraigne Lord, to extirpate this rebellion, and chaſe hence your entertained euils, the Spanyards, your auncient and mortall enemies: thereby to bring and re-eſtabliſh this poore afflicted Realme, into ſuch peace and tranquillitie, as all good mindes deſire, and is promiſed by your generoſitie &amp; force, with the grace and bleſſing of God: who I pray to open your eyes, to let you wade no further in the loue of thys vnlawfull League, that like a ſubtill <hi>Thais,</hi> is prouided of a thouſand baytes and ſleights to catch yee withall. But if ye continue in her ſeruice, ye ſhall find your ſelues betweene two ſtooles, wher-through (as the Prouerbe is)
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:4562:73"/>
the taile falles to ground: and too late repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, with moſt pittifull end, will be the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of your pernicious purſutes, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt pleaſures you haue had with her.</p>
            <p>Followe, followe then the ſteppes of the moſt magnanimous and valiant Princes of the blood, ſo many great Lordes, Marſhalles of Fraunce, Dukes, Earles, Marqueſſes, Barons, and Gentlemen of marke, the number wherof is infinite and innumerable, al which expoſe them ſelues and their deuoire, for the ſeruice of hys Maieſty, the reliefe of the eſtate, to preſerue you (if ye forget not your ſelues) in your goods, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueledges, and immunities, ſeeking nothing but the quiet and proſperitie heereof.</p>
            <p>God giue them grace, and you likewiſe, to make ſome profit of this fore-warning, to the end, that wee hauing occaſion more and more, to bee thankefull to the King for his infinite bountie, &amp; thoſe faithful ſubiects that attend on him: the celeſtiall fauour and aſſiſtance accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying the Kings power, your amendment and reconciliation, may turne to the happie ſucceſſe of theſe publique affayres, the reſt and re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of thys diſolate Kingdome.</p>
