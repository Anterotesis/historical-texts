            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OD hath made you the inſtrument of conveighing one of the greateſt bleſſings to this Nation that hath been beſtowed upon it in theſe latter
days; even of reſcuing our Laws, Liberties, Eſtates, Miniſters, Religion, all that is dear to us out of the hands of men, who being in their
firſt conſtitution our ſervants, had by craft and treachery made themſelves Lords over us, and deſigned to ſacrifice all theſe to their own ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But the moſt wiſe and righteous God, who raiſed you as a deliverer to this poor Nation, hath cauſed them to fall before you without
ſtroke ſtriking, filling their hearts with fear, and their faces with contempt and ſhame, for which his wonderful mercy, as thanks are rendred
to God by many on your behalf, ſo doubt not honoured Sir, but many prayers are daily poured out before the Lord for you, that he would direct
your ſteps in his ways, ſo evenly and unerringly, that that deliverance which is ſo happily begun may be perfected by your hand. Your Excellency,
(for that Title your merit gives you whether men do or no) cannot be ignorant that great perſons (as your ſelf is) in great actions (ſuch as this in
which you are now imbarqued) are attended with great temptations, which though your own deep wiſdome and much experience be ſufficiently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
both to diſcern and decline; yet will it not we hope be offenſive to your Excellency to hear what the <hi>vox copuli</hi> is concerning the temptations that lie before you.
Firſt, ſome think there is now lying before you a ſore temptation of making your ſelf great, and to take the Supream Power and Government of theſe Nations into your own
hands, and make your ſelf a Protector, a King, or what you pleaſe, and it is verily thought you might do it with a far more univerſal acceptance then <hi>Oliver</hi> did; and it is
feared there may be ſome who may ſecretly whiſper ſuch counſels to you: But ſurely Sir, it is hoped and believed you are ſo much a Souldier, a Gentleman, a Chriſtian, as
that you deſpiſe and abhor the thought of any ſuch thing, having declared the contrary as you have done. They that know you ſay you have too brave a Spirit, to purchaſe the
perſonating of a King with ſo much guilt and infamy as <hi>Oliver</hi> did, who after he had played <hi>Rex</hi> upon the Theatre of the world, for a few years hated of ſome, ſcorned by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
flattered by a few, went off with reproach and hiſſing, and his memorial is periſhed with him; who had he had ſo much honeſty in him as a Heathen, would inſtead of his
pompous Funerals (yet unpaid for) have contented himſelf with a plain Tomb-ſtone with this inſcription <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp;c. Look upon me and learn not to be Treacherous,
Falſe, Ambitious. So recent an example of Gods revenging wrath, ſhould caſt a damp upon the pride and ambition of men, but we ſee it did not: witneſs <hi>Fleetwood</hi> and
<hi>Lambert,</hi> who not thinking themſelves high enough till they were got into Phaetons (that is <hi>Cromwells</hi>) Chariot, had certainly ſet this whole Kingdom on a flame, if God by
your hand had not caſt them down as ſuddenly and ſtrangely as if they had been thunder ſtricken. But your Excellency is of <hi>another Spirit,</hi> even like that Noble Earl, that ſaid
He had rather make a King then be a King. In which reſpect we fear not much your being overcome by this temptation. That therefore which others fear, and fear more
is your being tempted to cloſe with this piece of the Parliament now ſitting at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and to aſſiſt and aid them in their ſetting up of that which they call the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
of <hi>England,</hi> though by all that ever we poor Plebeians could ſee or underſtand of it, it is but the ſetting up of themſelves; And that which makes us ſomething fear you
here is, that in many of your Declarations which you have emitted, you have expreſly and in <hi>Terminis</hi> declared for this Parliament as it was ſitting in <hi>Octob.</hi> 1659. and for the
eſtabliſhment of Government by a Common-wealth. Theſe things make us fear; but when we conſider that theſe Declarations were made by you when you were in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
or in the remoteſt parts of <hi>England,</hi> where you neither did nor could know the ſenſe of the Engliſh Nation; we hope that now God hath brought you among us, where you
may hear the ſighs and groans of your Brethren, and from our own mouthes underſtand what we groan under, and what we groan after, God may put other thoughts, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reſolutions into your heart then what you have yet publiſhed or declared to the world. Give us therefore leave to declare and Remonſtrate to you that a great part,
yea, the greateſt part of the godly people and Miniſters in <hi>England,</hi> who adhered to the Parliament in all their conteſt againſt the King from 1640. to 1648. never did
own, nor never can prevail upon their conſciences to own thoſe men that now ſit at <hi>Westminſter</hi> for the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> ſince they contrary to all Equity and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
contrary to their Truſt and Duty, contrary to their Covenants and Proteſtations, ſuffered ſo conſiderable a part of their Members to be by the Army plucked from
them. Nay, not onely ſuffered it, but we fear ſome of them contrived it, and all of them now ſince their laſt meeting abetted it. Reſolving upon a ſolemn Vote next day after
their ſolemn faſt, that theſe Members were duly excluded: a thing ſo contrary to the light of common reaſon, that every man is ready to bluſh at the reading of it; Is this the
faſt that God hath choſen? Is this to looſe the bands of wickedneſſe, and to let the oppreſſed go free? Nor, ſecondly, can we (if this were not) look upon that handful of men
ſitting at <hi>Westminſter</hi> as men to be truſted with the Lives and Liberties of the Nation, and leaſt of all with Religion. Some of them being perſons of notorious looſeneſſe
and debauchedneſs, others deſperate Atheiſts, deſpiſers of the Word and Ordinances. The moſt of them, (whether out of carnal policy, or what other principle God knows)
friends to all Sects, Errors, and Hereſies, even to Popery it ſelf; witneſs their repealing penal Statutes made againſt Popiſh Recuſants before their breaking up in 1653.
and their Vote paſſed in the Speakers Chamber before the laſt breaking up in 1659. wherby they gave Papiſts equal protection with the moſt pure and Orthodox of Proteſtants,
we hope your excellency when you are informed of theſe things, will not think it ſtrange that neither City nor Countrey can cheerfully accept theſe men for <hi>Englands</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
we hope your ſelf having expreſſed ſo much zeal for the true Orthodox Proteſtant Religion, and for the Miniſters and Ordinances of Chriſt, will not now give them up to
the mercy of theſe men. We have done with the Parliament, may it pleaſe your Excellency to give us leave to expreſſe our ſelves concerning the other particular, the changing
of the Government of the Nation into a Common-wealth. Firſt, we call to remembrance that ſaying of the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Prov. 22. 28. Remove not the ancient Land-mark which thy
fathers have ſet.</hi> Our forefathers according to the wiſdom given them of God, had very equally and juſtly bounded both the Kings Power and the ſubjects Liberty. The late King
he went about to remove the ancient Land-mark of the Peoples Liberty, and this hath been the overthrow of him and his family unto this day. Let the People now take heed of
removing the other Landmark, leaſt the Lord ſee it, and it diſpleaſe, and he lay their Liberty as low in the duſt as he hath done the Kings Authority. <hi>Extrema non durant,</hi> There
is alſo another Text that not a little troubles us when we think upon theſe changes, and that is <hi>Prov. 24. 21. My ſon, fear God and the King, and meddle not with them that are
given unto change; for their calamity ſhall riſe ſuddenly, and who knoweth the ruine of them both.</hi> Sir, you have merited ſo well at our hands that we cannot but be very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
you ſhould be involved in that calamity which we are very confident will again ſuddenly overtake theſe Members given to change. Secondly, we call to remembrance
how in the beginning of the quarrel between the King and Parliament. The King did lay to their charge that they had a deſign to alter the Ancient Governments of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to let a flood of errours and hereſies into the Church, and that thereupon he was forced to take up armes for his own defence, and the defence of Religion; and now if
theſe men do indeed alter the Government, as they intend to do; and do ſet open a door to all Errors and Hereſies, as they have begun to do; do they not thereby juſtifie the
King before God and men (for whoever yet queſtioned but that it was lawful for a King to defend Religion, and his juſt Authority againſt thoſe that ſeek to ſubvert them) and
do they not hereby bring upon themſelves the guilt of all the blood that hath been ſhed in <hi>England,</hi> and we are very loath you ſhould ſhare with them in that guilt. Thirdly,
we call to remembrance that the Parliament both in their anſwers to the forementioned Declarations of the Kings; and in all their Declarations both to this and neighbour
Nations, <hi>Scotland, Holland, &amp;c.</hi> did in the moſt ſolemn manner that could be diſclaime this altering of the Government, and looked upon it as the greateſt ſlander that could be
raiſed againſt them, and therefore they cannot alter it without falſifying their word to forrain States and Princes, and incurring the note of falſe and perfidious men. The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſuſpition of which crime we are perſwaded your noble ſoul abhors. Fourthly, we call to remembrance the many ſolemn Vowes and Covenants whereby the Parliament
bound themſelves and us to maintain the Government as it was then eſtabliſhed; and therefore they cannot alter it without incurring the guilt of Perjury or Covenant-breaking,
which God never ſuffers to paſs unpuniſhed, no not among the Heathens. Fifthly, we conſider the blood and treaſure that this attempt hath put <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
to already. The blood that <hi>Cromwel</hi> ſhed in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and the blood that <hi>Cromwel</hi> ſhed in <hi>Ireland</hi> (after your Excellency had ended the firſt War with the Popiſh Rebels)
in what quarrel was it ſpilt, but in the quarrel of this <hi>Idea,</hi> this <hi>Fairie Common-wealth</hi> (which we often hear the name of, but could never yet ſee.)
That vaſt Treaſure that hath been expended now for theſe eleven years in the maintaining of an Army here in <hi>England</hi> (neceſſary for nothing but for the cudeling of People
into a complyance with every prevailing power) whom may we thank for it but the modellers of our Common-wealth. Sixtly, we cannot but fear that the altering our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
into a Common-wealth, will be ſo far from ending that it will but perpetuate our miſeries from Generation to Generation; for ſo ſpeak as Chriſtians, the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this intended Common-wealth hath been laid in ſo much Treachery, Perjury, Blood, and there is ſuch a cry of the Fatherleſs, Widow and Oppreſſed goes up before the
Lord againſt it, as it can never be bleſt to <hi>England;</hi> and to ſpeak as men, the Maſters of this new Common-wealth know there is ſuch a ſpreading family of the <hi>Stuarts,</hi> and their
intereſt is ſo ſpread and rooted in this Nation and among Neighbour Nations, Proteſtants as well as Papiſts, that let them make never ſo many Votes, Engagements, Oaths of
Abjurations, they will never dare to truſt their Infant Common-wealth, as themſelves call it, without an Army Royal to back it. And ſo the Nation muſt
be at the charge of maintaining continually an Army of fifty or ſixty thouſand men, to pleaſe the humours, and maintain the Grandeur of fourty or fifty men that are (forſooth)
the Common-wealths Repreſentative of <hi>England,</hi> for more there are not that are ſticklers for this new device. For this, ſeventhly, we complain of as a very great grievance
and oppreſſion that ſo inconſiderable a number of men ſhould aſſume to themſelves the ſole Legiſlative Power, and impoſe Oaths and new formes of Government upon the
Free-both People of this Nation, not onely without their conſent, but contrary to the known judgement and conſcience of the People of the Nation. For, Eighthly, this
themſelves know, and we will not hide it from your Excellencie, that if it were put to the Scrutiny, whether the People of this Nation would be governed after the forme of
a Common-wealth or no, there is ſcarce one man of 500. but would give his Vote in the Negative, except Papiſts, Quakers, Anabaptiſts, and other Sectaries, or thoſe who
under the ſpecious pretence of a Common-wealth, ſeek their own private wealth, and have built their neſts upon the publick ruines. And into the ſecrets of theſe men we
hope your ſoul will never enter. And that this averſeneſſe to a Common-wealth may not be judged will and ſtubbornneſs in us to all the former Reaſons. 9. Let us adde this
(in the ninth place) that this device of changing the Government of <hi>England</hi> into a Common-wealth, it is a pure Popiſh Jeſuitical device to alter and overthrow the true
Proteſtant Religion in <hi>England,</hi> witneſs father <hi>Parſons</hi> his memorials for Reformation printed at <hi>Sevill, An. 1596. Campanella</hi> in his <hi>Monarchia Hiſpanica,</hi> and Cardinal
<hi>Richilieu</hi> in his Inſtructions. Theſe things make this alteration of Government not only ſuſpected but formidable to theſe that love the true Religion, as we doubt not but your
Excellency doth. And ſuch cannot but with grief obſerve, that under theſe men that are the Contrivers of our Common-wealth Religion, hath ſuffered more detriment then
it did in a leven years before. 10. Laſtly, we cannot but obſerve how God from heaven hath apparently fought againſt this Idol of their brain. Theſe men ſaid in the pride
of their hearts (in one of their Declarations as ſoon as they had cut off the Kings head) that they would ſpeedily ſet up in the Nation a better Government then ever was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
any, even the beſt of Kings. (Surely they might have excepted <hi>David,</hi> or <hi>Joſia,</hi> or <hi>Hezekiah</hi>) But ſee how God hath befooled them from that day to this (which is now
eleven years) they have not been able ſo much as to lay their foundation. Sometimes God divides their Tongues, and puts all in a confuſion and diſorder, as in the building
of <hi>Rabel;</hi> ſometimes he ſcatters them, ſo in 1653. ſo again in 1659. <hi>This is the Lords doing.</hi> Lord when thy hand is lifted up, they will not ſee, but they ſhall ſee, if they be
not more blind then <hi>Balaam,</hi> he when the Angel of the Lord had ſtopt his way twice, the third time deſiſted: Twice God hath ſtopt theſe men in their Eager purſuits of a
Common-wealth, Let them deſiſt in time if they will not, yet we dare not ſay a Confederacy to them, leaſt we ſhould be found deſertors of our Covenant, ſelf-condemned
and fighters againſt God.</p>
                  <p>And therefore we do humbly pray, That your Excellencie (according to the opportunity and Authority wherewith God hath betruſted you) would interpoſe effectually with
that part of the Parliament now ſitting at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> that their ſecluded members may be re-admitted, and vacant places may be filled up, then ſhall we chearfully own
them as the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and humbly acquieſſe in their declared judgements. And in ſo doing you ſhall make us happy, your ſelf Honourable to the memory of all
after ages; and oblige us, and our Poſterity after us to be</p>
