            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE cauſe of my being at preſent at <hi>London</hi> requiring ſome ſatisfaction and juſt vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication, I thought fit to ſet my ſelf in the publick view of my Country, and once more to appear with the poor and begger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Cloak of my former <hi>American</hi> Stile. The object of my diſcourſe being a Jeſuite and a Dominican, both profeſſours of a ſole fancy-pleaſing Religion, my pen ſhall drop before thee a dream, the relation whereof may peradventure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light the ſenſe and fancy of ſome, and from thence get further into the hearts of ſome others now holding the Stern of the weather-beaten ſhip of this Common-wealth. It is a moſt true and well experienced ſaying, that <hi>odia Religionum ſunt acerbiſſima,</hi> and may be inſtanced both at home and a broad, but eſpecially between the Jeſuites and Dominicans, both clothed with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward weeds of diſſembled mortification, but both inwardly <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi rapaces,</hi> ravening Wolves, with ſharp teeth of Paſſion biting and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:117847:2"/>
devouring one another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This Paſſion begun with the birth of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> founder of the Jeſuites Order, a fiery birth ſeconded ſpeedily with a fiery name; what elſe ſignifieth <hi>Ignatius,</hi> but <hi>Igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus,</hi> born for fire of miſchief and ſedition? This fire began to burn at <hi>Paris,</hi> and with it that ever ſince laſting quarrell between the <hi>Ignatians</hi> (now Jeſuites) and the Dominicans. There it was that <hi>Ignatius</hi> like a Cobler beyond his Laſt, took upon him to ſoar above his reach, and to ſearch into the myſtery of the bleſſed Trinity, which proving too hard for his weak brain, brought him to a publike cenſure and judgement, &amp; for his ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy triall the Dominicans (being the Grand Inquiſitors of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition Court) were nominated Judges; who finding <hi>Ignatius</hi> too ſaucy with the ſecret Trinity of one glorious and Immortal God, and traducing it with blaſphemous and erroneous princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, condemned him to a publike puniſhment, no leſs then whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. Laſhes they were, that did not only gall <hi>Ignatius</hi> his back, but ever ſince have cauſed laſhing and claſhing between <hi>Ignatius</hi> his children and the Dominican Whippers. And if <hi>Ignatius</hi> his name betray his fire, ſtil blown and further kindled in moſt parts of the world by his train of Jeſuites; ſo likewiſe doe the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicans in their Legend Confeſſion, acknowledge fire to be blown by them, who boaſt that when their founder Dominick was born, his mother ſaw in a dream ſtand by her a Dog with a lighted Torch in his mouth and a Globe; which, if true, may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſignifie that he and his children alſo ſhould kindle fire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion and ſedition in the world, then what they moſt fooliſhly fancy upon it. Thus Gentle Reader, if you pleaſe, you may take notice of theſe two fiery brands of Chriſtendome, the Ignatian Jeſuite, and the barking and biting dog with fire in his mouth the Dominican. But as two fire-brands laid together upon one hearth, ſtrive with the fire that is in them, not only to burn what comes neer or is laid upon them, but further are active in burning and conſuming each other. Even ſo where ever theſe two, the Jeſuite and Dominican do meet, they according to their from hell infuſed Activity indeavour to kindle not only the fire of diſcord and rebellion in the Common-wealths or Kingdomes where they live, but alſo burning paſſionately each againſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, doe indeavour like fire-brands one to conſume the other. Oh how did <hi>Ignatius</hi> his fire with a violent flame about the yeere 1620 run in <hi>Spain</hi> over all the houſes and Cloiſters of the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicans,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117847:2"/>
who by the Jeſuites then were ſo proſecuted that with weapons they were forced to defend their lives in their Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters againſt the fury of the common people ſtirred up againſt them by the fiery Jeſuites, and were like to bee baniſhed that Kings Dominions for hereſie imputed to them, becauſe againſt the <hi>Ignatians</hi> and <hi>Suarez</hi> his Crew, they held that <hi>Mary</hi> Chriſts mother was conceived in ſin, and not like <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſanctified in her mothers womb. Tedious I might be in relating their claſhings in <hi>China, Iapan,</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> yea and in <hi>England;</hi> but I muſt make haſt to <hi>Madrid,</hi> and from thence give thee, Reader, intelligence of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Combate or Duel fought before the King and his Court in the Kings Chappel between <hi>Florentia</hi> a grand Jeſuite and <hi>Domingo de Torres</hi> a Dominican, both Chaplains to that Majeſty when my ſelf was living in <hi>Valladolid</hi> in <hi>Spain. Florentia</hi> envying the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans fortune &amp; honor, who by the Laws ſof <hi>Arragon</hi> are conſtant Confeſſours to the Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> and ambitious of that place himſelf, thought if he could any wayes baniſh them from the Court of heaven, he might ſoon cauſe them to be baniſhed from the Court of <hi>Madrid,</hi> and from hearing that Majeſties Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Whereupon he plotted a feigned dream and ſleep that ſhould befall him in the Pulpit, ready to preach before his Majeſty and his Nobles. Up to the Pulpit he goes to act in publike his ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrived plot; before the naming of his Text, hee faineth a ſleep, reſting upon his hand and Elbow, the Court being for a while in ſuſpenſion, wondring what had befallen the ſleepy and drowſie Jeſuite, at laſt he awakes with a diſſembled amazement, and craving pardon of his Majeſty, relates his dream, as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Sacred Majeſty, being in a ſleep I have dreamed that I was in heaven, (Wel ſaid Jeſuite, thou mayſt dream of heaven, that is all thou art like to have) and there I ſaw the glory of all the Saints, and among them <hi>Herme, Negildus,</hi> and many other Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> with <hi>Philip</hi> your Father, whoſe glory may be your Majeſties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, I ſaw alſo of all religious Orders ſome, but above all <hi>Ignatius</hi> was moſt glorious with his train of Saints; but prying earneſtly amongſt them, and caſting a carefull eye about all the Corners of that capacious Court, I could ſee no Dominican Saint, which hath made me Judge that ſurely their lives here upon earth are unworthy of eternall life in glory, and that their ambition to be great here, eſpecially about your Majeſty, is cauſe of their loſſe of any greatneſſe hereafter in heaven. Thus having
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117847:3"/>
with a lying Dream unthroned all Dominicans from Seats in glory (who doubtleſſe without a lye may be ſaid to have none there) and baniſhed them that Court, hoping to work a baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them from the heart and affections of his Majeſty and his Nobles, he went on to his Text, ſuiting his diſcourſe with his faigned dream &amp; fancy. But the Dominicans hearing of this Jeſuiticall plot againſt them, made choice of one of their beſt Champions by name, <hi>Domingo de Torres,</hi> who might enter into Duell with <hi>Florentia,</hi> having <hi>Goliah</hi>-like defied the hoſt of the Guzman or Dominican families. Therefore upon the next Lords-day, <hi>Domingo de Torres</hi> being appointed to preach in the Kings Chappell, no ſooner gets up into the pulpit, but like as <hi>Florentia</hi> before, he fals a ſleep for a ſmall time and dreams. But awaking out of a diſſembled ſlumber before any choice of Text was made, he relates unto his Majeſty his dream thus. May it pleaſe your Majeſty, This place as it breeds too much ſleep and dulneſſe in the hearers of our Sermons (which therefore work ſo little upon their hearts) ſo it ſeems the Preachers themſelves are here ſubject to ſlumbering, yea and to dreaming, as hath appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Father <hi>Florentia;</hi> and now again in my ſelfe; who have dreamed that I ſaw hell opened before me, and that by ſome chief Devils I was carried about all the corners thereof, where I ſaw many Kings damned for their wicked lives, unjuſt commands, and tyrannizing power over their ſubjects, whoſe damnation I hope will prove a terrour to your Majeſty from acting like them: there alſo I ſaw ſome who have bin of yours &amp; of your Fathers Councell; yea let flattering of Princes be far from my mouth, I dreamed that neer unto the gates of hell I ſaw a Coach driving furiouſly, and in it your Majeſty with many of your Nobles here preſent, &amp; that the Count of <hi>Olivares</hi> did drive the Coach. I hope it will but prove a dream, and that none about your Majeſty will for the time to come drive your ſoule by wicked Counſels to that diſmall houſe of darkneſſe and eternall ruine. Further I ſaw many Fryers of mine own Order damned, yea &amp; of all other Orders with them, beſide Biſhops, Abbots, Prelates, and many Prieſts for lewd and carnall lives; yet I muſt confeſſe, that in all the places I had gone through, I ſaw not one Jeſuite, which made me wonder that they all ſhould live ſo holily that none of them ſhould goe to hell. But being at the gates ready to come out, I demanded of ſome chief devils, whither they had no Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:117847:3"/>
in their dark and horrid dungeons; and unto me they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, they had more of them then of any other Orders, and that if I would goe back, I ſhould ſee the place and number of them. I went back, and at the furtheſt part of hell was ſhewed unto me, a Wel covered with a ſtone of a vaſt and mighty bigneſſe, and for the taking of it up Legions of Divels were gathered together; the Well being opened, I ſaw a bottomleſs pit burning with fire and brimſtone, wherein were thouſand thouſands of Jeſuites; And further demanding why they were kept in hell by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under more reſtraint of ſo waighty a ſtone then others. Anſwer was made by ſome chief devils, that they feared the Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites power and liberty more then all others, and that as in the world where they have power, they are Maſters of Kings, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Laws to ſubvert and ruine all; ſo if they ſhould in hell give Jeſuites liberty, &amp; not keep them under great reſtraint, they would there alſo become Maſters; and as in the world they rule by breeding rebellion and ſedition, ſo if power and liberty were given to them in hell, they would to eternally racking torments adde a further fire of mutiny, faction and ſedition. Thus much affrighted with the ſight of ſo many damned Jeſuites, &amp; fearing they ſhould riſe up and maſter all hell before the Well were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered again, I made haſt to depart. I was not far gone out, when like as father <hi>Florentia</hi> in the way, I ſaw heaven alſo opened, and looking carefully where the Dominicans were, that could not be ſeen by <hi>Florentia</hi> in his dream, I ſaw that at the furtheſt part of heaven, they were hid under our Ladies mantle, and that as in the world they ſerve her moſt, ſo in heaven they have protection under her glorious garment and mantle. Thus <hi>Torres</hi> having delivered his dream freely, went on to preach ſuitably againſt the Jeſuites over ruling power in States, Common-wealths, Courts or Kingdomes. The Duell being ended between theſe two diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling dreamers, the event followed that <hi>Torres</hi> was promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Archbiſhoprick of Saint <hi>Foy</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-India's,</hi> and <hi>Florentia</hi> his ambitious thoughts with other his brethren were ſtopped, and with great care and vigilancy their too great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er prevented and weakned. Thus, Gentle Reader, with dreams I have pleaſed thy fancy; indeed they were dreams, but according to my true and faithfull relation they were really acted before the King and Court of Spain; Let them therefore enter beyond our fancy, to work a horrid deteſtation of ſuch fire-brands,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:117847:4"/>
diſſemblers and dreamers amongſt us, that our Nation and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may not be deluded with doctrine of mantles in heaven, nor our State and Common-wealth ſubverted with indulgence of power and liberty to them, to whom devils (according to <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi> his dream) dare not indulge too much command and power in hell. But laſtly, Reader, I muſt ſhew thee a further foil and fall of a Jeſuite in our City of <hi>London,</hi> and ſo give ſatisfaction to ſome of my preſent being here, becauſe my coming out of the country hath been miſconſtrued by ſome, who will not know that high Powers have commanded me up, and by thoſe that know it, aſperſions have been laid upon me, that for delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency and ſiding with ſome Gentlemen in <hi>Kent</hi> now priſoners in <hi>London,</hi> by warrant from high powers I was commanded to come and anſwer for ſome miſdemeanors againſt the preſent Government. Know therefore that upon the ſecond of <hi>February,</hi> 1650. at the Marques of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> his houſe in <hi>Coven garden</hi> was apprehended a Jeſuite, by name <hi>Peter Wright, alias Bele,</hi> and for high treaſon committed to Newgate; whither alſo was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from the Clink, one <hi>Thomas Dade,</hi> a long time priſoner, upon ſuſpition of being Superiour of all the Dominican fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in <hi>England.</hi> Theſe men being to be tryed at the Seſſions and generall Gaol delivery holden at the Old <hi>Baily</hi> upon the 14. 15. and 16. day of this preſent month of <hi>May,</hi> and the right hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Henry Rolle</hi> Lord chief Juſtice of <hi>England</hi> and member of the Right Honourable Councell of State, being informed that I was able upon Oath to give in evidence againſt both the Ieſuite and the Dominican, by his warrant commanded me up from <hi>Deal</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> the place of my abode. In obedience unto which Order I came up, having no thought of <hi>Peter Wright</hi> the Ieſuite, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that with ſafe Conſcience I could give evidence againſt <hi>Thomas Dade</hi> as a Fryer and Superior of the Dominicans, for that he was formerly mine own Superiour, when I profeſſed obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to thoſe ſuperſtitious wayes, and particularly to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Dominicans. Being come to town I began to weigh with my ſelf the danger on the one ſide I might be in by reaſon of the bloudy Tenents of Popiſh enemies, and the greatneſſe of the Marqueſſe his friends, whoſe cauſe muſt needs bee publiſhed with the publike triall of his Prieſt. On the other ſide I weighed the ſervice of my Country and the State, whoſe bread I eat and whoſe protection I enjoy, and reſolved that no danger could be

great that I ſhould undergoe, nor death more glorious the what I ſhould ſuffer for the Common-wealth of <hi>England</hi> as now ſetled by authority of this preſent Parliament. Being therefore commanded by my Lord chief Juſtice of <hi>England</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Mr. Clark of the Warrants, and others to viſit firſt in New-gate <hi>Peter Wright</hi> and <hi>Thomas Dade,</hi> with other priſoners there in hold, to ſee if I did know them; I was by words unci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy entertained by them, whoſe tender mercies would prove cruelties againſt me, if they could with advantage finde me here, or beyond Sea catch me within the command of their tyrannical Court of Inquiſition, inſtituted by the bloudy men of <hi>Belial</hi> the Dominicans. <hi>Thomas Dade,</hi> I found to be indeed the ſame man that he was indited for, Superior of the Dominicans, who alſo had formerly owned me, (when a Dominican) for his inferiour, and had exerciſed authority over me. <hi>Peter Wright</hi> I found to be a Grand Jeſuite, formerly Chaplain to Colonel <hi>Gage</hi> my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and to his Regiment in <hi>Flanders,</hi> who from thence came over with him to <hi>Oxford,</hi> took up Armes with him againſt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England;</hi> whom I had often ſeen ſay Maſſe in and about <hi>Gant</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> where out of a deadly inbred ſpite againſt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans he was a meanes to caſt out of my Brothers Regiment one <hi>Peter Martyr, alias Craft,</hi> a Fryer of that Order. This man was actually Chaplaine and heard Confeſſions of the Papiſt Souldiers and Commanders when one Captaine <hi>Vincent Burton</hi> of the ſame Regiment harboured Satanicall thoughts of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering my perſon, and with ſuch baſe continued thoughts (no doubt but formerly confeſſed) came from <hi>Flanders</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> where hee indevoured an aſſault upon my Lodging, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon my body, but by the watching providence of God was prevented, and himſelfe eſcaped. The Dominican pleaded for mercy and found it, the evidence not being very ſtrong to prove Orders or Maſſe ſaying, but onely to prove him a Fryer with command in <hi>England</hi> over that Order. The Jeſuite having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay againſt ſtrong evidence was caſt and condemned; and ſo let ever juſtice and righteouſneſſe ſpring forth, and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in the State and Common-wealth of <hi>England:</hi> So let men of <hi>Belial</hi> be deſtroyed, <hi>Shebaes</hi> caſt over the wall, <hi>Zimries</hi> and <hi>Cozbies</hi> be ſlain, and no doubt but the plague will ceaſe. Now, Gentle Reader, if after this my publike ſervice any untimely or violent death or miſchiefe ſhall befall me here in town or in my

return to <hi>Kent,</hi> or any time hereafter, I deſire thee from this my declaration to take notice, that through ſpite, malice, hatred and envious contrivances of bloud thirſty enemies, I have been butchered, and by their butchering of me, a doore hath beene opened unto me to let me goe through a dark and diſmall entry into a glorious place of Reſt, which I doubt not but that I ſhall enjoy it, when once I have finiſhed my courſe and fought a good fight as faithfull to the Lamb againſt all Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Abettors, and ſo I take leave of thee, well affected Reader, with the Angels Carroll and Doxology; Glory to God on high, on Earth peace, and good will towards men, eſpecially in mine and this States enemies, that they may learn with good will and affection better to affect thoſe that ſeek the glory of God, the Kingdome of Chriſt here, the inward peace of God and their Conſciences. <hi>Vale, veni, vidi, vici.</hi>
