         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

RELATION
Of some of the
Cruel Sufferings
(For the Truths sake) of
KATHARINE EVANS &amp; SARAH CHEVERS,
In the Inquisition in the
ISLE of MALTA,
Who have suffered there above three years, by the Pope's
Authority, there to be deteined till they dye. Which Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their sufferings is come from their own hands and
mouths, as doth appear by the following Treatise.</p>
            <p>These two Daughters of <hi>Abraham</hi> were passing to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi>
and to <hi>Cilicia;</hi> And thus may that part of Christendom
see their fruits, together with the Pope's, and of what birth
they are; and that those that are called Christians are worse
than Heathens: For they falling into their hands, should have
been refreshed by them with necessary things; but the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
which the Inhabitants and Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> (called
<hi>Christians</hi>) provided for them, is the Inquisition. Now it was
not so when <hi>Paul</hi> suffered shipwrack there among the barbarous
people; which is a manifest token they are not in the love of
God, whose fruits shew they are not in the true Spirit.</p>
            <p>And this is to all fellow-brethren that are partakers with them in the Power of God
and have a feeling and fellowship with them in their sufferings, that they might see
and know how it is with them, and what unkindness they find abroad among them
that profess themselves Christians.</p>

            <head>An Epistle to the Readers.</head>
            <p>MAny there be among the Nations in the world,
that in their haste have unjustly condemned
the innocent, guiltless and harmless people of
the Lord of Hosts (scornfully called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers)
viz.</hi> That they are Papists, Jesuits, and
what else, adhoring to the Whorish false Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> I
say to such on this wise, which is my advice as a man to his friend,
to whom this may come, Be not hasty to judge before the time, as
many do to their own hurt, guilt and condemnation, before they
have a clear and right understanding of the things that differ from
equity and truth, and so the nobility of the mind which should weigh
and pass true sentence of sound and perfect judgment, the same
being vailed with a hasty dark spirit of prejudice, or evil surmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
which gets up into the seat of enmity, and therein passeth sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the pure way and things of God as evil, heresie, and what
else; and thus it comes to pass, and indeed it cannot be otherwise
with such that have not their minds staied and fixed in that which
is perfect and true, and clear, and single, as is the clear manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the grace of life, which is the Light of the Lord Jesus shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in the heart and conscience of the Sons and Daughters of men;
and the same Light of the Lord which lightneth the poor and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful
man's eyes, is the true measure and equal ballance, which
all is to trie, and prove, and weigh words, thoughts, intents, ways,
and actions, whether they be justifiable or condemnable; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
with the same measure of the true Spirit of God who is Light,
is true sentence to be passed accordingly: For if that which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
true be measured with a false measure, or with an unequal
Ballance, it doth appear so to all that behold the same with an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
eye, or measure that with the same measure; save onely to
them that discern the measure, weight, or ballance; as for instance
as to the thing natural, if a deceitful man with a false measure,
<pb facs="tcp:42610:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
being guided by a deceivable Spirit (al-be-it his eyes are inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with the Light of the Lord, which is true) if he
measure a piece of cloth to his Customer,<note place="margin">Prov. 29.</note> with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful
measure, though the cloth be good, yet he not
giving it its true measure, the simple hearted is thereby deceived,
and knoweth it not till it be brought to a true measure, which doth
answer the true principle, or Light of God in the conscience to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
as doth not the false, but contrariwise; wherefore its
needful, and of absolute concernment, for the mind of every man
male and female, to be guided and exercised in the true manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Light of Jesus in the conscience; and so blessed is the
man, the people, the family that brings their deeds to the Light,
that they may be manifest that they are wrought in God who is
Light, who is Truth; and so what is here following written and
published is to be tried, and proved by the Witness of God in every
Conscience which is true, and will answer to the same things or
words that springs forth from its own clear nature.</p>
            <p>Therefore, when thou hast honestly read this throughout with a
meek spirit of sobriety and moderation that's single and pure, then
with the same spirit of singleness, and of true discerning judge honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and cease from hastiness in such matters of Eternity, least a
place of Repentance become finally hid from thine eies, not to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
but contrariwise, which I desire not, neither doth the
Lord, whose servant a living and true Witness I am, for Him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his
Truth and People, of these things and much more.</p>
            <p>Wherefore let the Reader see hereby, how that the Lord hath
chosen the foolish things of this life to confound the wise, and that
the living God Eternal hath chosen the weak things, to confound
and bring to nought the things that are mighty, subtil, and potent;
yea, base things which are so deemed despisable, and contemptible;
yet behold God hath chosen them, and things that are not approvable
in the sight of the prudent of this world, even to bring to nought
things that are: But may some say, <hi>Wherefore, or why doth
the most High, Wise, Invisible, Immortal God do thus?</hi>
my answer is one and the same as the Apostle saith, <hi>viz. That no
flesh should glory in his presence,</hi> who of God is made in us
Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification, and Redemption: And
why should it be accounted such a foolish thing in the eyes of the wise
<pb facs="tcp:42610:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
men of this world, to see the wisdom of God dispensed through a
weak Vessel? as is a free-born woman from above, a weaker Vessel
than that of the man.</p>
            <p>Now tell me, oh man of understanding, What must not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Christ, or the same that is begotten of God in the female, as
well as in the male, what must not (I say) the same spirit of life
from God speak, but be limited in the weaker Vessel, in the foolish
Vessel, in the Vessel which is not esteemed, but base, contemptible
and despised in the eyes of lofty man that must be laid low, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
in that wisdom and knowledge which is not from above, but
otherwise, bruitish, and puffeth up the fleshly mind that's enmity to
God, and is therefore to be confounded and moved backward, and
slain upon the Cross, which is the Power of God that crucifieth the
lusts and inordinate affections of the flesh, which thereby come to be
silent before the Lord, who is that one and self-same spirit that is
quick and powerful; so that not any other spirit governs or rules
over the members of the body, but that which created the body; and
every Member, which is to have the supream authority and prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence,
as well in the female as in the male; and so he the Spirit
of Truth that's to guide into all truth; he, the man, is not he to
speak, <hi>viz.</hi> Christ in the male, the same in the female, where he
is risen and manifest as King, Priest and Prophet, a Guide, Leader
and Commander in all equitable and just things which are truly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable.</p>
            <p>But the woman was in the transgression against the Spirit; <hi>Flesh
lusteth against the Spirit,</hi> saith the Apostle; and the Woman
(that's in the transgression) is to be under obedience, and to be in
silence, to learn in silence, and to ask her Husband at home; but
what if she have a disorderly, drunken Husband (and not Christ
the man, the true Husband, the true Lord) how can he teach her,
seeing the woman is to learn of her Husband in silence, and to be
under obedience (and not to usurp Authority over the man) as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
saith the Law, which hath dominion over all that are under it
in the transgression; but the Spirit of Grace and Truth that's pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
upon sons and daughters, teacheth us to deny the sin, and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
from the same, and so maketh free from its condemnation, and
from under the Law, to be under the Grace and Truth that is in
the one Seed Christ, in the Male Christ, in the Female, the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb facs="tcp:42610:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
spirit, the Lord from Heaven; and so who are lead and guided
by this, are not under the Law, which saith, the woman is not to
usurp Authority over the man, as also saith the able Minister of
the Mysterie of the glory and riches of Eternity, which is Christ
the fulness in his Saints, their hope of life and glory; but the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is to be under obedience, as also saith the Law; yea, but they
that are led by the Spirit, are not under the Law, so are the sons of
God manifest; yet under the Grace covered; the same Grace with
which the Man-Child, the holy Child Jesus was covered and filled
with; the same, and no other but that which did and doth save
the Saints from sin, and so from under the Law, and its
condemnation; and not onely so, but also the same Grace which
bringeth salvation, and appeareth to all men, it teacheth them not
onely to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, but also to live soberly
and righteously in this present world; and verily this Grace is in
them which saves and justifieth them; and it's not of themselves,
it is the gift of God.</p>
            <p>And such are the servants of the living and true God, that have
their fruits, (and possess the same) unto holiness; and not onely so,
but the end of the same, which is the pure manifestation of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
substance, to wit, everlasting life, pure, clean power, which
is the excellent Treasure in the Earthen Vessels, as saith the holy
Scripture, 2 Cor. 4.</p>
            <p>But Oh ye Congregations of the dead! ye gathered Churches of
so many Names and Heads, to you sounds my voice, saying, What
have ye done? Oh! how guilty do ye appear before mine eye that's
single (in the Lord's Light) of despising prohesying, and quenching
the tender Spirit of glory, which resteth at this day in, and upon
many sons and daughters; and behold if ye can see how they do, and
have prophesied in the Name of the Lord, and have fore-warned
you of that which is justly come to pass upon you, while many of you
despised and wondered, in the days of haughtiness, and its prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
among you. But oh my soul, how hast thou been wounded in me,
whilst I have travelled and mourned over you! And so you have
been found despising that, and quenching that Spirit of Grace
which teacheth the Saints in Light, and reproves for sin, and testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
against the World, and its deeds, because they are evil.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:42610:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And this same Spirit strived long with you, and in you, and would
have arisen up in its Authority, Power and great glory from on
high, had ye not preferred and exalted the Spirit of this World in
it's proper place in you, above the just and long-suffering, which is
but one and the same in male and in female.</p>
            <p>Oh! what have you done? Can any of you yet smite upon your
thigh, and say so yet? if ye can, enquire, enquire ye, the Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
voice is the same it was, and not otherwise, <hi>viz.</hi> Return,
come; yea, return and come to the tender Spirit of holiness, and of
the gentleness of Christ, and his yoke of self-denial, and the daily
Cross, they are the two great Ordinances which ye have left behind,
and so the vail and the Darkness has covered you, but the true <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi>
have Light in their dwellings, and their habitations is in
the best of the Land of the living.</p>
            <p>Wherefore my spirit saith, Return, come and hearken to the
Lamb's voice, and now see whether ye can follow him (or a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger)
wheresoever he goeth; that's the true Prophet raised up like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Moses,</hi> and obey his voice which savoureth not of this world; for
so his Kingdom and servants are not. Therefore beware, lest your
souls be cut off from the Land of the living, and ye perish in the
outward observations, (by which the Kingdom cometh not) among
the Congregations of the dead, where ye are yet seeking the living;
but <hi>I</hi> as a Brother (even <hi>Joseph</hi>) tell you yet again, He is not
there, but is arisen from the dead, from death to life, who is the
quickening Spirit, the Lord from Heaven, over the Earth, over
all the Land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> over the Land of darkness, the same
Lord, the same Spirit which hath done excellent things, is exalted
in the new Heaven, and in the new Earth, wherein dwelleth righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness;
and let the Virgin-Daughter of <hi>Sion</hi> publish the same,
even from henceforth to all generations, yea and my spirit it's ready to
say, <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was one that saw a little Stone cut out of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
without hands, and he well retained his sight so long until (in
the Light of the living) he saw the same which was so little, wax
so great, that it became an exceeding great Mountain.</p>
            <p>Verily, the beloved City is manifest, set upon a holy Hill; it
cannot be hid from them that see; the glory of God doth enlighten
<pb facs="tcp:42610:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>

and everlasting Joy, Happiness and Peace for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more;
We who are poor sufferers for the Seed of God, in
the Covenant of Light, Life, and Truth, do dearly salute
and imbrace you all, according to our measures, Blessing and
honour and Glory be given to our Lord God for ever, of all
who know him, who hath counted us worthy, and hath
chosen us among his faithfull ones, to bear his name and to
witness forth his truth, before the high and mighty men of
the earth, and to fight the Lords battle with his spirituall
weapons, to the breaking down of strong holds, high lofty
looks and vain imaginations, and spirituall wickedness in
high places.</p>
            <p>The Lord did give us a prosperous journey hither, and
when we came to <hi>Legorne,</hi> we were refreshed with friends
[who were there before us] and they did get a passage for
us (and lodging) but as soon as we heard of the Vessel, we
did feel our service. So we went into the City in the living

power of the Lord, and there were many tender hearts did
visit us, to their comfort, and our joy: The little time we
staid there we gave some of our Books, and one Paper: so
journying towards <hi>Alexandria,</hi> the Captain told us that <hi>Malta</hi>
was in the way, and he must put in there a small time. But
before we came there, our burthen was so heavy, that I was
made to cry out (saying,) <hi>Oh we have a dreadfull cup to
drink at that place! Oh how am I straitned till it be
Accomplished!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when we came there, the walls of the City were full
of people; some stood on the top of the walls, as if something
had troubled them: before we came there we stood upon the
deck of the ship, and I looked upon them, &amp; said in my heart,
<hi>Shall yes destroy us: <hi>If we give up to the Lord, then he is sufficient to
deliver us out of their hands; but if we d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r of man was taken
from us. The English Consul came abord the ship (as the
Captain said) but we did not see him, and invited us to his
House, it was the seventh or last day of the week: The next
morning being moved of the Lord we went a-shore, and the
Consul met us, and we gave him a paper, who sent us to
his House, with his Servant; and when we came there at the
present we well were entertained (like Princes) their <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours</hi>
and <hi>Kinssolk</hi> came in, and some <hi>Jesuits,</hi> and we gave them
Books, they read a little, and laid them down, they were too
hot; we declared our message to them in the Name of the
Lord, and we gave some Books in the Street, so they were all
set on work: Away went the Friers to the King (or Supreme
in the Island) and he would not meddle with us, but said, we
were honest women, we might go about our business, and that
night we went a-bord the Ship again, the Consul was troubled,
for their snare was laid, and we felt it; being moved of the
Lord we went in again the next day, and the Consul having
a sister in the Nunnery, desired us to go there, that she might
see us; and we went to them, and gave them a book, then to
the Consuls we returned again, and sitting to wait to know
the mind of the Lord, what he would have us to do, he said
we must give in the great Paper; and if we would go to save
our life, we should lose it.</p>

                        <p>A True Declaration concerning the Lord's love to us in all our
Voyage: We were at Sea, between <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Plymouth,</hi>
many Weeks, and one day we had some trials; and between
<hi>Plymouth</hi> and <hi>Legorn</hi> we were 31. days, and we had many trials
and storms within and without; but the Lord did deliver us out
of all: And when we came to <hi>Legorn,</hi> with the rest of our friends,
we went into the Town after we had product, and staid there
many dayes, where we had service every day; for all sorts of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
came unto us, but no man did offer to hurt us, yet we gave
them Books and having got passage in a Dutch ship we sayled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

                              </gap>us,</hi> intending to goe to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> but the Lord had
appointed somthing for us to do by the way, as he did make it
manifest to us, as I did speak, for the Master of the ship had no
business in the place; but being in company with another ship
which had some business at the City of <hi>Malta,</hi> (in the Island of
<hi>Malta</hi> where <hi>Paul</hi> suffered shipwrack) and being in the Harbour,
on the first day of the Week, we being moved of the Lord, went
into the Town, and the <hi>English</hi> Consul met us on the shore, and
asked us concerning our coming, and we told him truth, and
gave him some Books, and a Paper, and he told us there was an
Inquisition, and he kindly entreated us to go to his house, and
said all that he had was at our service while we were there. And
in the fear and dread of the Lord we went, and there came ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to see us, and we call'd them to repentance, and many of
them were tender; but the whole City is given to Idolatry. And
we went a ship-board that night; and the next day we being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to go into the City again, dared not to flie the cross, but in
obedience went, desiring the will of God to be done. And when
we came to the Governor, he told us that he had a Sister in the
Nunnary did desire to see us if we were free; and in the fear of
God we went, and talked with them, and gave them a Book, and
one of their Priests was with us (at the Nunnery) and had us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their place of Worship, and some would have us bow to the
high Altar, which we did deny; and having a great burthen, we
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42610:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
went to the Consul again, and were vvaiting upon the Lord what
to do, that we might know.</p>
                        <p>And the Inquisitors sent for us, and when vve came before
them, they asked our Names, and the Names of our Husbands,
and the Names of our Fathers and Mothers, and how many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
vve had; and they asked us, <hi>Wherefore we came into that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey?</hi>
And vve told them, We were the Servants of the living
God, and were moved to come and call them to repentance; and
many other questions, and they went away, but commanded that
vve should be staid there. And the next day they came again,
and called for us, and vve came; but they vvould examine us apart,
and called <hi>Sarah,</hi> and they asked, <hi>Whether she was a true Catholick?</hi>
She said, that she vvas a true Christian that worshippeth God
in spirit and in truth; and they proffered her the Crucifix, and
vvould have had her svvare that she vvould speak the truth; and
she said, <hi>she should speak the truth,</hi> but she vvould not svvear, for
Christ commanded her <hi>not to swear,</hi> saying, <hi>Swear not at all:</hi> And
the <hi>English</hi> Consul persvvaded her vvith much entreating to
svvear, saying, <hi>None should do her any harm:</hi> But she denied; and
they took some Books from her, and vvould have had her swear
by them, but she vvould not: And they asked, <hi>Wherefore she
brought the Books?</hi> And she said, Because we could not speak their
Language, and they might know vvherefore vve came; and they
asked of her, <hi>what</hi> George Fox <hi>was;</hi> and she said, he vvas a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.
And they asked, <hi>wherefore she came thither?</hi> She said, To do
the Will of God, as she vvas moved of the Lord. And they ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>how the Lord did appear unto her?</hi> And she said, by his Spirit,
And they asked, <hi>where she was when the Lord appeared unto her?</hi> and
she said, upon the way. And they asked, <hi>whether she did see his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
and hear his Voice?</hi> And she said, she did hear his Voice,
and saw his Presence; and they asked, <hi>What he said to her?</hi> and she
said, the Lord told her, she must go over the Seas to do his Will;
and then they asked, <hi>how she knew it was the Lord?</hi> and she said,
he bid her go, and his living presence should go vvith her, and he
was faithful that had promised, for she did feel his living presence;
and so they vvent away.</p>
                        <p>Two dayes after they came again, and called for me, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
me the Crucifix, and told me <hi>the Magistrate commanded me to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42610:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
swear that I would speak the truth.</hi> And I told them that I should
speak the truth, for I was a Witness for God; but I should not
swear; for a greater than the Magistrate, saith, <hi>Swear not at all,
but let your yea be yea, and your nay be nay, for whatsoever is more,
cometh of evil.</hi> But said they, <hi>You must obey the Justice, and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
you to swear.</hi> I said, <hi>I should obey Justice,</hi> but if I should
swear, I should do an <hi>unjust thing;</hi> for (the just) Christ said, <hi>Swear
not at all.</hi> And they asked me, <hi>Whether I did own that Christ which
dyed at Jerusalem?</hi> I answered, We owned the same Christ, and
no other, he is the same yesterday, to day and for ever.</p>
                        <p>And they asked me, <hi>What I would do at Jerusalem?</hi> said I did not
knovv that I should go there, but I should go to <hi>Alexandria;</hi> and
they said, <hi>What to do?</hi> and I said, to do the Will of God; and if
the Lord did open my mouth, I should call them to repentance,
and declare to them the day of the Lord, and direct their mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ds
from darkness to Light. Then they asked me, <hi>Whether I did trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
when I did preach?</hi> and I told them, I did tremble when the
povver of the Lord vvas upon me. And they asked, <hi>Whether I did
see the Lord with my eyes?</hi> I said, God was a Spirit, and he was spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually
discerned.</p>
                        <p>That day that vve vvere had from the <hi>English</hi> Consuls to the
Inquisition, the Consul's Wife brought us meat to eat, and as she
past by me, I was smote with an Arrovv to the heart, and I heard
a voice, saying, <hi>It is finished, she hath obtained her purpose.</hi> I did not
taste of her meat, but went aside, and wept bitterly. The Consul
did affirm to us the night before, that there was no such thing as
to ensnare us) intended; but it was in us as fire, and our souls
were heavy even unto death; for many dayes before we saw in a
Vision of our going there, (to prison) and we said <hi>Pilate</hi> would
do the <hi>Jews</hi> a pleasure, and wash his hands in innocency. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<hi>a sign of me if we were the Messengers of God;</hi> and the Lord
gave me a sign for him, that stuck by him while he lived. The same
day it was, he called me, and told me the Inquisition had sent for
us, and they had Papers from <hi>Rome,</hi> and he did hope we should
be set free; which was a lye: For he knew there was a room prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for us. And there came a man with a black Rod, and the
Chancellor, and the Consul, and had us before their <hi>Lord Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
and he asked us, <hi>Whether we had changed our minds yet?</hi> We
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42610:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
said, Nay, we should not change from the truth. He asked, <hi>What
new Light we talkt of?</hi> We said, no new Light, but the same the
<hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles</hi> bare testimony to. Then he said, <hi>How came
this Light to be lost ever since the primitive times?</hi> We said, it was
not lost, men had it still (in them) but they did not know it, by
reason that the night of Apostacy had, and hath overspread the
Nations, Then he said, <hi>If we would change our minds, and do as they
would have us to do, we should say so, or else they would use us as they
pleased.</hi> We said, The Will of the Lord be done. And he arose
up, and went his way with the Consul, and left us there. And the
man with the black Rod, and the Keeper, took us, and put us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an inner Room in the Inquisition, which had but two little
holes in it for light or air; but the glory of the Lord did shine
round about us.</p>
                        <p>After the <hi>Consul</hi> came with tears in his eyes, and said he was as
<hi>sorry as for his own flesh; but there was some hopes in time;</hi> and so he
vvent avvay, but never had peace vvhile he lived. He would have
given up the thirty pieces of silver again, but it would not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
the Witness was risen much in him, but slavish fear pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
him. This was upon the sixt day of the Week, and our sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks
were taken away from all meat.</p>
                        <p>The next second day came a <hi>Magistrate,</hi> two <hi>Fryars,</hi> and the
man with the <hi>black Rod,</hi> and a <hi>Scribe,</hi> and the <hi>Keeper,</hi> to the <hi>Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,</hi>
to sit upon Judgement, and examined us apart concerning
our faith in Christ. The Magistrate would have had us to <hi>swear,</hi>
and we answered, No; Christ said, <hi>Swear not at all;</hi> and so said
<hi>James</hi> the Apostle. He asked, <hi>if we would speak truth?</hi> We said, yea.
He asked, <hi>Whether we did believe the Creed?</hi> We said, We did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in God, and in Jesus Christ, which was born of the Virgin
<hi>Mary,</hi> and suffered at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> under <hi>Pilate,</hi> and arose again from
the dead the third day, and ascended to his Father, and shal come
to judgement, to judge both quick and dead. He asked, <hi>How we
did believe the Resurrection?</hi> We answered, We did believe that
the just and the unjust should arise, according to the Scriptures.
He said, <hi>Do you be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ieve in the Saints, and pray to them?</hi> We said, We
did believe the Communion of Saints; but we did not pray to
them, but to God onely, in the Name of Jesus Christ. He asked,
<hi>Whether we did believe in the Catholick Church?</hi> We said, We did
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42610:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
believe the true Church of Christ; but the Word <hi>Catholick</hi> we
have not read in Scripture. He asked, <hi>if we believed a Purgatory?</hi>
We said, No; but a Heaven and a Hell. The Fryar said, <hi>We were
commanded to pray for the dead; for those that were in Heaven had
no need; and they that were in Hell there is no redemption; therefore
there must be a Purgatory.</hi> He asked, <hi>if we believed their holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi>
We said, We never read (the Word) <hi>Sacrament</hi> in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
The Fryar replied, <hi>Where we did read in our Bibles</hi> Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>it was</hi> Sacrament <hi>in theirs.</hi> He said, <hi>Their holy Sacrament was
Bread and Wine, which they converted into the Flesh and Blood of Christ
by the virtue of Christ.</hi> We said, they did work Miracles then, for
Christ's virtue is the same as it was when he turned Water into
Wine at the Marriage in <hi>Canaan.</hi> He said, <hi>If we did not eat the flesh,
and drink the blood of the Son of God, we had no life in us.</hi> We said,
the Flesh and Blood of Christ is spiritual, and we do feed upon it
daily; for that which is begotten of God in us, can no more live
without spiritual food, than our temporal bodies can without
temporal food. He said, that <hi>we did never hear Masse.</hi> We said,
We did hear the voice of Christ, he onely had the words of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life, and that was sufficient for us. He said, <hi>We were Hereticks
and Heathens.</hi> We said, they were Hereticks that lived in sin and
wickedness, and such were Heathens that knew not God. He ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>about our Meetings in England?</hi> And we told them the truth to
their amazement. And they asked, <hi>Who was the Head of our Church?</hi>
We said, Christ. And they asked, <hi>What</hi> George Fox <hi>is.</hi> And we
said, He is a Minister of Christ. They asked, <hi>Whether he sont us?</hi>
We said, No, the Lord did move us to come. The Fryar said, <hi>We
were deceived, and had not the faith; but we had all virtues.</hi> We said,
that saith was the ground from whence virtues do proceed, They
said, <hi>If we would take their holy Sacrament, we might have our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or else the Pope would not leave us for millions of Gold, but we should
lose our souls and our bodies too.</hi> We said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Lord had provided for
our souls, and our bodies were freely given up to serve the Lord.
They askt us, <hi>if we did not believe Marriage was a Sacrament?</hi> We
said, it was an Ordinance of God. They ask't us, <hi>if we did believe
men could forgive sins?</hi> We said None could forgive sins but God
onely. They brought us that Scripture, <hi>Whose sins ye remit-in earth,
shall be remitted in heaven.</hi> We said, All Power was God's, and he
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42610:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
could giv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> it to whom he would (that were born of the Eternal
Spirit, and guided by the same; such have power to do the Fathers
Will, as I answered a Fryar also in the City of <hi>Naples</hi>) and they
were silent, the Power greatly working. We asked them wherein
we had wronged them, that we should be kept Prisoners all dayes
of our lives, and said, Our innocent blood would be required at
their hands.</p>
                        <p>The Fryar said, <hi>He would take our blood upon him, and our Journey
into</hi> Turky <hi>too.</hi> We told him, the time would come he would find he
had enough upon him without it. They said, <hi>The Popes was Christ's
Vicar, and we were of his Church, and what he did, was for the good of our
souls.</hi> We answered, The Lord had not committed the charge of
our souls to the Pope, nor to them; for he had taken them into his
own possession, glory was to his Name for ever. They said, <hi>We
must be obedient.</hi> We said, We were (obedient) to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Christ's Spirit. The Fryar said, <hi>None had the true Light
but the Catholicks; the Light that we had, was the Spirit of the Devil,</hi>
We said, Wo to him that calleth Jesus accursed: Can the Devil
give power over sin and iniquity? then he would destroy his own
Kingdom. He said, <hi>We were laught at, and mockt at of every one.</hi>
We said, What did become of the mockers? It was no matter.
He said, <hi>We did run about to preach, and had not the true Faith.</hi> We
said, the true Faith is held in a pure Conscience void of offence
towards God and man; and we had the true Faith. And he said,
<hi>There was but one Faith, either theirs or ours;</hi> and askt us <hi>which it
was?</hi> We said, Every one had the true Faith, that did believe in
God, and in Jesus whom he had sent, but they that say they do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
and do not keep his commandments, are lyars, and the
truth is not in them. He said <hi>it was true;</hi> but he did thirst daily for
our blood, because we would not turn, and urged us much about
our Faith and Sacrament, to bring us under their Law; but the
Lord preserved us.</p>
                        <p>They said, <hi>It was impossible we could live long in that hot room.</hi> So
the next Week-day they sate in Council; but oh how the swelling
Sea did rage, and the proud waves did foam even unto the clouds
of Heaven, and Proclamation was made at the Prison-Gate, we
did not know the words, but the fire of the Lord flamed against
it, <hi>[K.]</hi> my life was smitten, and I was in a very great agony, so
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42610:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
sweat was as drops of blood, and the righteous one was laid into
a Sepulcher, and a great stone was roll'd to the door; but the
Prophesie was, that he should arise again the third day, which
was fulfilled. But the next day they came to sit upon Judgement
again, [but I say, in the true Judgement they sate not, but upon
it they got up unjustly above the righteous, and upon the same
they sate; a child of Wisdom may understand] and they brought
many Propositions written in a paper, but the Fryar would suffer
the Magistrate to propound but few to us, for fear the Light
would break forth; but they askt <hi>how many friends of ours were gone
forth in the Ministry, and into what parts.</hi> We told them what we
did know. They said, <hi>all that came where the Pope had any thing to do,
should never go back again.</hi> We said, the Lord was as sufficient for
us, as he was for the children in the fiery Furnace, and our trust
was in God. They said, <hi>we were but few, and had been but a little
while, and they were many Countreys, and had stood many hundred years,
and wrought many Miracles, and we had none.</hi> We said, we had thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
at our Meetings, but none (of us) dare speak a word, but
as they are eternally moved of the Lord; and we had Miracles, the
Blind receive their sight, the Deaf do hear, and the Dumb do
speak, the Poor do receive the Gospel, the Lame do walk, and
the Dead are raised. He asked, <hi>Why I lookt so; whether my Spirit was
weak?</hi> I said, Nay, my body was weak, because I eat no meat, [it
was in their <hi>Lent] He offered me a License to eat flesh.</hi> I said, I could
not eat any thing at all. The terrors of death were strongly upon
me; but three nights after, the Lord said unto me, about the <hi>11th.</hi>
hour, <hi>Arise, and put on your Clothes;</hi> I said, <hi>When vilt thou come
Lord?</hi> He said, <hi>Whether at midnight, or at Cock-crow, do thou
watch.</hi> My Friend and I arose, and the Lord said, <hi>Do stand at
the Door.</hi> And we stood at the door in the power of the Lord, I
did scarce know whether I was in the body, or out of the body;
and about the <hi>12th.</hi> hour there came many to the Prison-Gate;
We heard the Keys, and looked when they would come in: They
ran to and fro till the <hi>4th.</hi> hour; the Lord said, he had smote
them with blindness, they could not find the way. And we
went to bed, there I lay night and day for 12. days together, fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and sweating, that my bed was wet, and great was our affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                        <p>

The tenth day of my fast there came <hi>two Fryars,</hi> the <hi>Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,</hi>
the man with the <hi>black Rod,</hi> and a <hi>Physician,</hi> and the <hi>Keeper;</hi>
and the <hi>Fryar</hi> commanded my dear Friend to go out of the room,
and he came and pull'd my hand out of the bed, and
said, <hi>Is the Devil so great in you, that you cannot speak?</hi> I said, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from me thou worker of iniquity, I know thee not; the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of the Lord is upon me, and thou call'st him Devil. He took
his Crucisix to strike me in the mouth; and I said, Look here! and
I asked him, Whether it were that Cross which crucified <hi>Paul</hi> to
the World, and the World unto him? And he said, <hi>it was,</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
him, and said, the Lord had made me a Witness for himself
against all workers of iniquity. <hi>He bid me be obedient,</hi> and went to
strike me: I said, Wilt thou strike me? He said, <hi>he would.</hi> I said,
Thou art out of the Apostles Doctrine, they were no strikers; I
deny thee to be any of them who went in the Name of the Lord.
He said, <hi>he had brought me a Physician in charity.</hi> I said, the Lord
was my Physician, and my saving-health. He said <hi>I should be whipt,
and quartered, and burnt that night in Malta, and my Mate too! where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
did we come to teach them?</hi> I told him I did not fear, the Lord
was on our side, and he had no power but what he had received;
and if he did not use it to the same end the Lord gave it him, the
Lord would judge him. And they were all smitten as dead men,
and went away.</p>
                        <p>And as soon as they were gone, the Lord said unto me, <hi>The
last Enemy that shall be destroyed, is Death;</hi> and the Life arole
over Death, and glorified God. The Fryar went to my friend,
and told her, <hi>I called him worker of iniquity.</hi> Did she, said <hi>Sarah?
Art thou without sin?</hi> He said <hi>he was;</hi> Then she hath wronged thee.
[But I say the wise Reader may judge:] For between the eighth
and ninth hour in the evening, he sent a Drum to proclaim at
the Prison Gate; We know not what it was, but the fire of the
Lord consumed it. And about the fourth hour in the morning
they were coming with a Drum and Guns; and the Lord said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me, <hi>

came up to the Gate to devour us in a moment. But the Lord
lifted up his Standard with his own Spirit (of Might) and made
them to retreat, and they fle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> as dust before the Wind praises
and honour be given to our God for ever. I went to bed again,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42610:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and the Lord said unto me, <hi>Herod will seek the yong childes life
to destroy it yet again;</hi> and great was my affliction; so that my
dear fellow and labourer in the Work of God, did look every
hour when I should depart the body for many days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and we did look every hour when we should be brought
to the stake day and night, for several weeks, and <hi>Isaac</hi> was
freely offered up. But the Lord said, he had provided a Ram
in the Bush. Afterwards the Fryer came again with his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician;
I told him, that I could not take any thing, unless I
was moved of the Lord. He said, <hi>we must never come forth of that
Room while we lived, and we might thank God and him it was no worse,
for it was like to be worse.</hi> We said, if we had died, we had died
as innocent as ever did servants of the Lord. He said, it was
well we were innocent. They did (also) look still when I
would dye.</p>
                        <p>The Fryer bid my friend <hi>take notice what torment I would be in
at the houre of Death, thousands of Devils (he said) would fetch my
soule to Hell.</hi> She said, she did not fear any such thing.</p>
                        <p>And he asked <hi>if I did not think it expedient for the Elders of the
Church to pray over the sick?</hi> I said, yea, such as were eternally
moved of the Spirit of the Lord. He fell down of his knees and
did howle, and wish bitter wishes upon himself if he had not
the true faith; but we denied him. The Physitian was in a
great rage at <hi>Sarah;</hi> because she could not bow to him, but to
God onely.</p>
                        <p>The last day of my fast I began to be a hungry, but was
afraid to eat, the enemy was so strong; but the Lord said unto
me, <hi>If thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink,
in so doing thou shalt heap coales of fire upon his head; be not
overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.</hi> I did eat, and
was refreshed, and glorified God; and in the midst of our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
the Lord sent his holy Angels to comfort us, so that
we rejoiced and magnified God; and in the time of our great
trial, the Sun and Earth did mourn visibly three dayes, and
the horror of death and pains of Hell was upon me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Sun
was darkned, the Moon was turned into Blood, and the Stars
did fall from heaven, and there was great tribulation ten
dayes, such as never was from the beginning of the world;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42610:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and then did I see the Son of man coming in the Clouds,
with power and great glory, triumphing over his enemies;
the Heavens were on fire, and the Elements did melt with
fervent heat, and the Trumpet sounded out of <hi>Sion,</hi> and an
Allarum was struck up in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and all the Enemies of
God were called to the great day of Battle of the Lord,
And I saw a great wonder in Heaven, the Woman cloathed
with the Sun, and had the Moon under her feet, and a Crown
of 12. Stars upon her head, and she travelled in pain ready
to be delivered of a Man-child, and there was a great Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon
stood ready to devour the Man-child as soon as it was
born; and there was given to the Woman two Wings of a
great Eagle to carry her into the desert, where she should be
nourished for a time, times, and half a time; and the Dragon
cast a Flood out of his mouth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And I saw War in Heaven,
<hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels against the Dragon and his Angels,
and the Lamb and his army did overcome them; and there was
a Trumpet sounded in Heaven, and I heard a voice saying to

another Trumpet sounding, and I heard a voice, saying, <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon

                        <p>And all this time my dear Sister in Christ Jesus was in as great
affliction as I (in a manner) to see my strong travel night and day;
yet she was kept in the patience, and would willingly have given
me up to death, that I might have been at rest; yet she would have
been left in as great danger, wo and misery, as ever was any poor
captive for the Lord's truth; for they did work night and day
with their divinations, inchantments and temptations, thinking
thereby to bring us under their power; but the Lord prevented
them every way, so that great was their rage, and they came of
ten with their Physician, and said it was in charity; I askt them
whether they did keep us in that hot room to k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

a Physician to make us alive.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Fryar said,</hi> the Inquisitor would lose his head if he should take
us thence; and it was better to keep us there, than to kill us.</p>
                        <p>The Room was so hot and so close, that we were fain to rise
often out of our bed, and lie down at a chink of their door for
air to fetch breath; and with the fire within, and the heat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
our skin was like sheeps Leather, and the hair did fall
off our heads, and we did fail often; our afflictions and burthens
were so great, that when it was day we wished for night; and
when it was night we wished for day; we sought death, but could
not find it; We desired to die, but death fled from us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We did eat
our bread weeping, and mingled our drink with our tears. We did
write to the Inquisitor, and laid before him our innocency, and
our faithfulness, in giving our testimony for the Lord amongst
them; and I told him, if it were our blood they did thirst after,
they might take it any other way, as well as to smother us up in
that hot room. So he sent the Fryar, and he took away our <hi>Ink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horns,</hi>
(they had our <hi>Bibles</hi> before) We asked why they took away
our goods? They said, <hi>it was all theirs, and our lives too, if they
would.</hi> We asked, how we had forfeited our lives unto them; they
said, <hi>For bringing Books and Papers.</hi> We said, if there were any
thing in them that was not true, they might write against it. They
said, <hi>they did scorn to write to fools and asses that did not know true La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</hi>
And they told us, <hi>the Inquisitor would have us separated, because
I was weak, and I should go into a cooler room;</hi> but <hi>Sarah</hi> should abide
there. I took her by the arm, and said, <hi>The Lord hath joined us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42610:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and wo be to them that should part us.</hi> I said, I rather chuse to
dye there with my friend, than to part from her. He was smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and went away, and came no more in five weeks, and the
door was not opened in that time. Then they came again to part
us; but I was sick, and broken out from head to foot. They sent
for a Doctor, and he said, <hi>We must have air, or else we must dye.</hi> So
the Lord compelled them to go to the Inquisitor, &amp; he gave order
<hi>for the door to be set open six hours in a day;</hi> they did not part us till
ten Weeks after: But oh the dark clouds and the sharp showers
the Lord did carry us through! Death it self had been better
than to have parted in that place. They said, <hi>we corrupted each
other, and that they thought when we were parted, we would have bowed
to them.</hi> But they found we were more stronger afterwards than
we were before; the Lord our God did fit us for every condition.
They came and brought a Scourge of small Hemp, and asked us,
<hi>if we would have any of it.</hi> They said, <hi>they did whip themselves till
the blood did come.</hi> We said, that could not reach the Devil, he sate
upon the heart. They said, <hi>All the men and women of</hi> Malta <hi>were
for us, if we would be Catholicks, for there would be none like unto us.</hi>
We said, the Lord had changed us into that which changed not.
They said, <hi>all their holy women did pray for us, and we should be honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of all the world if we would turn.</hi> VVe said, we were of God,
and the whole world did lye in wickedness; and we denied the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of the World, and the glory too. They said, <hi>We should be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored
of God too, but now we were hated of all.</hi> We said, it is an
evident token whose servants we are; the servant is not greater
than the Lord, and that Scripture was fulfilled which saith, <hi>All
this will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Upon a first day of the Week, we were fasting and waiting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Lord till the second hour (after mid-day) and the Fryars
came and commanded us <hi>in the Name of the Lord to kneel down
with them to prayer.</hi> We said, we could not pray but as we were
moved of the Lord. They commanded us the second time. Then
they kneeled down by our bed side, and prayed, and when they
had done, they said, <hi>they had tryed our spirits, now they knew what spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
we were of.</hi> We told told them, they could not know our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
unless their minds were turned to the Light of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
in their Consciences. The English Fryar was wrath, and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42610:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
us his <hi>Crucifix,</hi> and bid us <hi>loook there.</hi> We said, The Lord saith,
<hi>Thou shalt not make to thy self the likeness of any thing that is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
above, or in the earth beneath, nor in the water under the earth;
thou shalt not bow to them nor worship them, but I the Lord thy God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
He was so mad, he called for the irons to chain <hi>Sarah,</hi> because
she spake so boldly to him: She bowed her head, and said to him,
<hi>Not onely my feet, but my hands and my neck also for the Testimony of
Jesus.</hi> His wrath was soon appeased, and he said, <hi>He would do us
any good he could; he did see what we did was not in malice,</hi> the power
had broken him down for that present; they came to us often,
saying, <hi>If you would do but a little, you should be set at liberty; but you
will do nothing at all, but are against every thing.</hi> We said, We are
against nothing that is of God, but would do any thing that
might make for God's glory.</p>
                        <p>Many did think we should not have been heard nor seen after
we were in the Inquisition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the Lord did work wonderfully
for us and his Truth: For they new built the <hi>Inquisition,</hi> and there
were many <hi>Labourers</hi> for a year and a half, and the great men
came to see the building; and we were carried forth with great
power to declare in the Name of the Lord Jesus, not fearing the
face of man; the Lord was our strength. But behold they threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
us with <hi>Irons</hi> and <hi>Halters,</hi> for preaching the Light so boldly,
and they said, <hi>None ought to preach but Prelates to a Bishop,</hi> (as they
use to say in <hi>England.</hi>) Now their <hi>Lord Inquisitor</hi> (so called) and
the <hi>Magistrates</hi> were kept moderate towards us, and gave order,
<hi>we should have Ink and Paper to write to England.</hi> But we were hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
still; and vve do believe they would have set us at liberty,
had it not been for the Fryars; it was they that wrought against
us still to the <hi>Pope</hi> and to the <hi>Inquisitor;</hi> and we told them so. They
sought three quarters of a year to part us, before they could
bring it to pass; and when they did part us, they prepared a bed
for <hi>Sarah,</hi> and their own <hi>Catholicks</hi> lay upon the boards, that had
not beds of their own. When we were parted, the Lord would
not suffer me to keep any money, I knew not the mind of God
in it. Their Fryars came and said, <hi>We should never see one anothers
faces again, but the Inquisitor should send me my food.</hi> But the
Lord would not suffer him to send it. <hi>Sarah</hi> did send
me such as she could get neare three Weeks: then the
Fryar came and askt me, <hi>what I did want?</hi> I said, one to wash my
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42610:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Linnen, and something hot to eat; I was weak. He sent to <hi>Sarah</hi>
to know <hi>if she would do it for me.</hi> She said she would. And by that
means we did hear of each other every day. The Fryar said. <hi>You
may free your self of misery when you will; you may make your self a
Catholick, and have your freedom to go where you will.</hi> I told him,
I might make my self a Catholick, and have a name that I did
live, when I was dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and said, he had Catholicks enough alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
he should bring some of them to the Light in their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
that they might stand in awe, and sin not. He said, <hi>He would
lose one of his fingers if we would be Catholicks.</hi> I said, it was <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>
that was built with <hi>blood, <hi>Sion</hi>
                           </hi> was redeemed through <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
They would have had me to a Picture set at my beds head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for a representation. I askt them if they did think I did lack a
Calf to worship? And whether they did not walk by the Rule
of Scripture? The Fryar said, <hi>They did, but they had traditions too.</hi>
I said, if their traditions did derogate or discent from the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals
of Christ's Doctrine, the Prophets and Apostles, I deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them in the Name of the Lord. He said, <hi>they did not.</hi> I askt
him where they had their Rule to burn them that could not join
with them for Conscience? He said, <hi>St.</hi> Paul <hi>did worse, he gave
them to the Devil, and that they did judge all damned that were not of
their Faith.</hi> And he askt whether vve did judge them so? <hi>I</hi> said,
No, We had othervvise learned Christ. <hi>I</hi> askt him vvhy they did

Peter <hi>was the Pope of</hi> Rome, <hi>and did build an Altar there; and the
Pope was his Successor; and he could do what he would. I</hi> denied that,
and said, We never read any such thing in Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for <hi>Peter</hi>
Christ's Apostle had no money to build Altars, he himself did
offer Sacrifice upon the Altars made vvithout hands. And he
said, <hi>We were but a few, and risen up but late, and they were many, and
had stood fourteen hundred years, and God was a lyar if they had not the
true faith; for he had confirmed it to them by a thousand miracles. I</hi>
said, the fevv number, and the little Flock is Christ's Flock. He
askt if vve vvere? then all the World, said he. <hi>I</hi> said, our saith

was from the beginning. <hi>Abol</hi> was of our Church; and <hi>the world
by wisdom did not know God.</hi> He went to <hi>Sarah</hi> with the same
temptation, and she told him also, that <hi>Abel</hi> was of our Church.
He said <hi>Abel was a Catholick, and</hi> Cain <hi>and</hi> Judas <hi>were so.</hi> She said,
Then the Devil was a <hi>Catholick,</hi> and she would not be one He
threatned her, and told her <hi>how many they were.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>She said, <hi>Daniel</hi> was but <hi>one;</hi> and if there were <hi>no more</hi> but <hi>she</hi>
her self, she would not turn; but took her fingers and shewed
them, if they would tear her joint-meal, she did believe the Lord
would enable her to endure it for the Truth.</p>
                        <p>So they went from one to another thinking to entangle us in
our talk; but we were guided by one Spirit, and spake one and
the same thing in effect, so that they had not a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

say so; otherwise they would use me badly, and I should never see the
face of</hi> Sarah <hi>again, but should dye by my self, and a thousand Devils
should carry my soul to Hell.</hi> I asked him if he were the Messenger
of God to me. He said he was. I said, What is my sin? or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
have I provoked the Lord, that he doth send me such a strait
Message? He said, <hi>Because I would not be a Catholick,</hi> I said, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thee and thy Message too, and the Spirit which spake in thee,
the Lord never spake it. He said, that <hi>he would lay me in a whole
Pile of Chains, where I should see neither Sun nor Moon.</hi> I said, he
could not separate me from the love of God in Christ Jesus, lay
me where he would. He said, <hi>He would give me to the Devil.</hi> I said,
I did not fear all the Devils in Hell, the Lord was my Keeper;
Though he had the Inquisition, with all the Countreys round
about, on his side, and was alone by my self, I did not fear them;
if there were thousands more, the Lord was on my right hand,
and the work they could do, was but to kill the body, they could
not touch my life no more than the Devil could <hi>Job's.</hi> He said,
that <hi>I should never go out of that Room alive.</hi> I said, the Lord was

to them, the Light of the Lord Jesus in the Consciences of every
one, to lead them to a pure life, and did ask them where the pure
and holy life was, and what all of them did do, that the people
did live in sin and all manner of wickedness? And whether words
and forms would serve without life and power? He was as bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
a fiery Serpent, as ever was born of a Woman, and did strike as
hard at our lives, &amp; would hold up his hand often to strike us, but
had never the power, he would quickly be cut down, that he would

to work for us sometimes, and would say it was for God's

those that did any thing for God, did not look for a reward from
man. He said, <hi>We were the worst of all creatures, and we should be used
worse than any; the Turks, Arminians, Protestants and Lutherans
should be used better than we.</hi> We said, the pure Life was ever coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

vvere bold and valiant for God's Truth, that vvhatsoever we did

neither fire nor candle in that time above two hours, none did

                        <p>The Fryars went to <hi>Sarah,</hi> and told her, <hi>if she would, she should

said no; I did not see him. They said, they did think he would be

and made a Catholick of him. <hi>Sarah</hi> wrote a few lines to me of
it, and said she did think the English Fryars were the chief actors
of it, (we had a private way to send to each other.) I vvrote to
her again, and after my Salutation, I said, Whereas she said the

the glorious manifestations of God to my soul, for her comfort,
so that I was ravished vvith love, and my Beloved was the chiefest
of ten thousands; and how I did not fear the face of any man,
though I did feel their arrows, for my Physician is nigh me; and

bring <hi>many good things,</hi> and said them down by us; so that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
we witnessed fulfilled, <hi>Our Enemies treated us kindly in a strange
Land, said I.</hi> But we were afraid to eat, and cryed to the Lord,
and said, We had rather dye, than eat any thing that is polluted
and unclean. The Lord said unto me, <hi>Thou mayest as freely eat, as
if thou hadst wrought for it with thy hands; I will sanctifie it to thee
<hi>through the Cross.</hi>
                           </hi> And he said to <hi>Sarah, Thou shalt eat the fruit of

praise and glory of our God for ever. We did eat but little in two
Months; and they did bring us what ever we did speak for, for 8.
or 10. dayes; and afterward we were so straitned for want of
food, it did us more hurt than our Fast. Yet the Lord did work
as great a Miracle by our preservation, as he did by raising <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
out of the Grave. The Fryars did say, <hi>the Lord did keep us alive
by his mighty power, because we should be Catholicks.</hi> We said, the
Lord would make it manifest to us then; they should know the
Lord had another end in it one day.</p>
                        <p>But still they said, <hi>There was no Redemption for us.</hi> We said, with
the Lord there was mercy and plenteous Redemption. VVe bid
them, take heed ye be not found fighters against God. They said,
<hi>We were foolish women.</hi> We said we were the Lord's fools, and the
Lord's Fools were right dear, and precious in his sight, and wo to
them that do offend them. He said, <hi>they were the Lord's fools,</hi> and
shewed us their deceitful Gowns, and their shaven Crowns, and
said <hi>they did wear it for God's sake, to be laught at of the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> We
said, they did not wear it for God's sake, unless they were moved
of the holy Spirit of God to wear it. He said, <hi>it was no matter,
they did wear it because of their Superiors.</hi> [mark, and before it was
for God's sake, as he said] He thought to bring us under him for
our food, and did make us suffer a while, though the Inquisitor
and the Magistrates had taken a course we should want for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
But the Lord did torment him and all the rest, till they
did bring us such things as were fitting. Then he did work all that
he could to send me to <hi>Rome,</hi> and was coming two or three times
(for what I know) to fetch me forth, but the Lord vvould not
suffer them; and vvhen they savv they could not prevaile that
vvay, they said vve should go both; but the Fryar should go first,
because he vvas not vvell; he got leave to go, he vvas so vveary
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42610:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of coming to us, that he did beseech the Lord Inquisitor he might
come no more to us. He told <hi>Sarah, I was a Witch,</hi> and <hi>that I knew
what was done at London,</hi> and he vvould come to me no more, he
said, Because vvhen he did tell me a company of lyes, I said, <hi>I had

                        <p>The Diviners did vvax mad, and did run as at their vvits end,
from Mountain to Hill, and from Hill to Mountain, to cover
them: They ran to the Inquisitor, and vvrit to the Pope, and
vvent to him; their King did not hide them at all; some of them
did gnash vvith their teeth, and even gnavv their tongues for pain:
Yet the rest vvould not repent of their blasphemy, sorcery, nor
inchantments, but do post on to fill up their measures; Oh! the
Lord revvard them according to their vvorks. A little before the
Fryar vvent to <hi>Rome,</hi> he came to the Inquisition Chamber vvith
a Scribe, to vvrite concerning us, to carry it vvith him; <hi>I</hi> savv
him, as God vvould have it; the Lord said, <hi>There is thy deadly foe.</hi>
They vvere vvriting part of three dayes; and vvhen they had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it, the Lord would not let me eat till the Scribe did come
where I was, that I might pronounce vvo against it, and defie it,
which I did do in the Name of the Lord, and it did wither vvith
all the rest: After it vvas gone, the <hi>English Consul</hi> came to us with
a Scribe, and he brought us a doller from a Master of a Ship that
came from <hi>Plymouth;</hi> I told him, I did receive my Countrey man's
Love, but could not receive his Money. He askt me, <hi>What I wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

do if I would take no money?</hi> I said, the Lord was my portion, and
I could not lack any good thing. I said to him, We were in thy
House near 15. Weeks, didst thou see any cause of Death or Bonds
in us? He said, <hi>No.</hi> I askt him, how he would dispence with his
Conscience for telling us, <hi>He would have us before the Inquisitor,</hi> and
thou didst know that Room vvas provided for us; and had not we
been kept alive by the mighty Power of God, we might have been
dead long since. He said, <hi>How could</hi> I <hi>help it!</hi> I said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We are the
Servants of the living God, and were brought here by permissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and in the Spirit of Meekness gave in our Testimony for the
Lord in faithfulness, and told you the truth as it is in Jesus, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
you all to repentance, and fore-warned you in love to your
souls, of the evil the Lord is bringing upon you, if you do not

repent. He said, <hi>However it be, it will go well with you.</hi> [Mark that.]
I told him, he required a sign of me when vve vvere at his house,
if we were the servants of the Lord God; I gave him a sign from
the living God, and my friend gave him another from the Lord,
to his shame and destruction for ever. I askt him, Whether it were
not true we spake to him, he said it was, <hi>but how should he help it?</hi>
I said, Thou art a condemned person, and stands guilty before
God; yet nevertheless repent, if thou canst find a place. He
smil'd upon the Scribe in deceit, but his lips did quiver, and his
belly trembled, and he could scarce stand upon his legs. He was
as proper a man as most was in the City, and full, and in his prime
age. O! he was consumed as a Snail in a shell, which was a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
sign for the whole City, if their hearts were not harder than
Adamants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He said, <hi>How should he help it?</hi> He might have helpt
it, but he was as willing to prove us, as any of them all. He was
sworn upon his Oath to protect the <hi>English;</hi> and their Ruler bid
him let us go about our business, and said, <hi>He were honest women;</hi>
and then he might have let us go before we were under the black
Rod.</p>
                        <p>Then he went to <hi>Sarah</hi> with the Doller; she told him she could
not take the Money; but if he had a Letter for us, she should be
free to receive that. He said, <hi>he had not any.</hi> He askt her <hi>what she
did want?</hi> She said, the Lord was her Shepherd, she could not
want any good thing; but she did long for her Freedom. He said,
<hi>That you may have in time.</hi> He told us, <hi>we should have ink and paper
to write:</hi> But when he was gone, they vvould not let us. The next
time we heard of him, he was dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We could have rejoiced if he
had dyed for righteousness sake; for the Lord delighteth not in
the death of a sinner.</p>
                        <p>The Fryar was gone to <hi>Rome,</hi> and they said, <hi>he must stay there
till we came.</hi> There was great working to send us there, but the
Lord did prevent them, that they could not send us there. Then
the Lord did work to bring us together again after so long time
we had been parted. There vvere five doors between us with
Locks and Bolts, but the Keeper had not power to make them
fast, but as <hi>Sarah</hi> could undo them to come where I could see her,
but could not speak to her; for there were them that did watch
us night and day; yet she being moved of the Lord, did come to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42610:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
my door by night; she must come by the Fryars door, he and the
Doctor of Law were together, and they did set a trap to take her
in, and many did watch about the Prison, and would complain.
Then she was lockt up again; but they had no peace in that, till
the doors were open again; then we did sit in the sight of each
other, to wait upon the Lord, so that our voices were heard far;
the Magistrates vvould hear and bow to it sometime; then the
complainers were weary, and did work to have us brought toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and we did wait and pray, and the Magistrates would come
in and look upon us many times, but would say nothing to us:
There were of divers Nations brought into the Inquisition Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
and the Fryars, and the rest that were great, would go in
their way to make Christians of them; and we were made to stand
up against them and their vvays, and deny them in the Name of
the Lord, and declare the truth to the simple-hearted continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if vve did suffer death for it; We could not endure to hear
the Name of the Lord blasphemed, nor his pure Way of Truth
perverted, nor the ignorant deceived. They did vvrite all they
understood of vvhat vve spake, and sent it to the Court-Chamber
before the Inquisitor and Magistrates, but the Lord did blast it
vvith the Mildevvs of his vvrathful indignation, and burnt it up
vvith the brightness of his Son, and vve rejoiced in our God; but
still our burdens continued very heavy, and our righteous souls

Glory, honor and praises be given to our God for ever. O they
would not let us know of any <hi>English</hi> Ship that came into the

but we knew not what it meant; the arrows of the Wicked did
flye, so that my soul was plunged and overwhelmed from head to
feet, and the terrors of the unrighteous had taken hold of us, and
the flames of Hell compassed us about; then the Lord appeared
unto me in a dream, and said, <hi>There were two English Friends in the
City which did plead for our liberty in our behalf, and he had taken all
fear away from them, and made them bold.</hi> And in a little while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

did not tell us of any <hi>English</hi> that were there; but there was one
<hi>Francis Steward</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> a Captain of a Ship, and a Fryar of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> which came to the City together (for what we know) and
they did take great pains for us, and went to their Ruler, and the
Inquisitor, and to several Magistrates and Fryars, and the new
English Consul with them, and wrought much amongst them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that
all were willing to let us go, save the Inquisitor; they said; and he
said, <hi>He could not free us without an Order from the Pope.</hi> But we had
many heavy Enemies besides, which vvould not be seen; but they
obtained the favour to come and speak with us, which was a great
thing in such a place.</p>
                        <p>They sent for us to the Court-Chamber, and the <hi>English</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul
askt us, <hi>if we were willing to go back to</hi> England? We said, if it
were the Will of God we might. The Captain spake to us with
tears in his eyes, and told us what they had done for us, but could
not prevail; It is this Inquisitor (said he) the rest were made free;

they took us out of our way, and put us into the Inquisition, and

or chop us as Herbs to the Pot. The Fryar said, <hi>We did not work;</hi>
which was false; we had Work of our own, and did work as we
were able. We told him, our Work and Maintenance was in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
And they said, <hi>it was true.</hi> He said, <hi>We would not accept of the
Inquisitors Dyet.</hi> We did not know who did prepare for us; we did

there were many English ships that way; but the Captain saw it
was a very hard thing; so that it grieved him to the heart: He
prayed God to comfort us, and he went away; and we do beseech
God to bless and preserve him unto everlasting life, and never to
let him nor his go without a blessing from him, for his love: he
did venture himself exceedingly in that place. But after he was
gone, they arose up against us with one accord; the Inquisitor
came up into a Tower, and lookt down upon us as if he would
have eaten us, and they did try us for our lives again, and did shut
up our doors many Weeks; we could not tell for what; at length
the Inquisitor came into the Tower again, and <hi>Sarah</hi> was moved
to call to him, to have the door opened for us to go down into
the Court to wash our clothes. Then he gave command for the
door to be opened once a Week; and in a little while 'twas open
every day. But great was our affliction indeed; and she told him,
if we were the Popes Prisoners, we would appeal to the Pope, and
he should send us to him. But them in the prison with us, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Fryar, were mortal Enemies to us, but yet they would have
fed us with the choicest of their meat, and would gladly give us
whole Bottles of Wine, if we would receive it, and were great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
troubled because we did refuse to eat and drink with them, and
did persecute us exceedingly; but the Lord did visit them with his
dreadful Judgements, the Fryar was tormented night and day, his
body did perish, the Doctors and Chyrurgions did follow him a

And there were two or three <hi>English</hi> Ships there, came into

heard a Voice, saying, <hi>We could not go now.</hi> So we were made wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

                        <p>Then they sent for us forth when the Ships were gone, and askt
us <hi>if we would be Catholicks:</hi> And we said, we were true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,

We did think that Fryar was too tender-hearted to stay
among them; he did take a great deal of pains for us (the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

the blessing of God would be upon him for any thing he should
do for us; for we were the Servants of the living God, and he

wicked men:</hi> I said, They are wicked men that work wickedness.
The Fryar would say still, <hi>We had not the true Faith.</hi> We said, By
Faith we stand, and by the Power of God we are upholden; dost
thou think it is by our own power and holiness we are kept from
a vain conversation, from sin and wickedness? He said, <hi>That was
our pride.</hi> We said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No, We could glory in the Lord, we were

                        <p>Now the Lord said, <hi>Fear not Daughters of Sion, I will carry you
forth as Gold tryed out of the fire.</hi> And many precious promises did
the Lord refresh us with, in our greatest extremity, and would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in his glory, that our souls would be ravished in his presence;
I had the Spirit of Prayer upon me, and I was afraid to speak to
the Lord, for fear I should speak one word that would not please

                           <hi>Fear not Daughter of Sion, ask what thou

nothing of the Lord but what would make for his glory, whether
it were my liberty or bondage, life or death, wherein I was high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                        <p>The Room wherein I was separated, was near the Chancery,
where all the Bishops Courtiers did resort, and would come into
the Inquisition Courts, and I had Work amongst them daily; they
would come on purpose to their condemnation; some would be
smitten, and run as if they hunted; and some would be set on fire,
and cry, <hi>Caldere, caldere,</hi> and <hi>fuoco, fuoco,</hi> and many would pitty
us because we were not Catholicks; the Fryars would say, <hi>We

                        <p>But as for the poor Workmen, they were willing to do any

                           <hi>And because I said I did talk with</hi> G. F. <hi>he (the Fryar) asked,</hi>
Whether <hi>G. F.</hi> did bring me money to maintain me in prison. <hi>I said, no,
but though I was absent in body, yet I was present in spirit, and
was refreshed in him, and in hundreds more besides. They said,</hi>
I had seen Revelations, and had talkt with <hi>G. F.</hi> and he was God's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.

                        <p>What they would have done to <hi>Sarah</hi> if they had taken her

he is worthy to be glorified for ever.</p>
                        <p>The next time he came to me, he came in sheeps clothing, but

a Spear in his hand, when they speak most fairest, then beware of
them.</p>
                        <p>He desired us <hi>we would not think so hardly of him, as if he were the
Author of all our wrongs and troubles; he was not</hi> (he said) <hi>but would
do any good he could for us, were it with his blood.</hi> But we thought he
had been the chiefest that cast the poor man in prison, but he was
the man that hope him out without any punishment at all, though
the Inquisitor did say he should be severely punished. I told him
he did well, he would have peace in it, and would never have cause
to repent it. He did entreat us, <hi>he might not bear all the burthen.</hi>
We told him of many wicked things he did act against us, and of
his lying and cruel words. He bid us, <hi>take no notice what he did speak.</hi>
But we did feel his spirit, that what he spake, he would do, if he had
not been chained. I did use to tell him, My Conscience was not
feared with a hot iron. J was not past feeling. At last he was so
weary of coming to us, he did entreat the Jnquisitor he might
not come to us any more; the Judgements of the Lord did

they were so tormented, that they did run to the Hills and to the
Mountains to cover them from the presence of the Lord, and
from the Wrath of the Lamb which sits upon the Throne to judg
them righteously, and to condemn them for all their wicked deeds
which they so ungodlily had committed against him.</p>

which vvould lead them to repentance, but they would
not hearken to his counsel, but turned his laws behind their backs,
and hated to be instructed by them; therefore the Lord did laugh
at their destruction, and did mock when their fear came: Their
wickedness was so great, and my burthens so heavy to bear it that
I cryed to the Lord, and said, It is better for me to dye, than to
live; and would gladly have given up my life in testimony against
them all; I vvas (as 'tvvere) compell'd to declare against all their

with her; I did yeild she had been slain: And afterwards this
great tribulation being ended, then they said my (dear and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful)

<hi>Malta,</hi> which did so encrease my sorrow, and wrought upon my
spirit to try and examine wherefore the Lord should deal so hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with me, as to leave me behind; or whether he did not count
me worthy to go and give in my testimony vvith her to <hi>Rome,</hi> and
offer up my life for the Testimony of Jesus, than to have my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty

trials were unspeakable. Oh the unclean spirits! they vvould
speak to us at noon-day; but the Lord did give us power over
them, that we did not fear the wild Bores out of the Wood, nor
the vvild Beasts out of the Field.</p>
                        <p>Then there vvas one came and said, that <hi>Catherine and I must
be sent both to Rome;</hi> Which did rejoice my soul, and renevved my
strength, because the Lord did count me Worthy to go and give
in my Testimony for his Truth, the Word of his Prophesie, before
the great and mighty ones of the Earth. The Lord said, <hi>I should not
be afraid;</hi> and he shevved me in the Light how he had bowed them
down before us, and saw them in the Light of Christ, how the Pope,
the Fryars and Sorcerers stood in ranks, bowing down before us.
So we saw our Dominion in Spirit: They did work to send us to
<hi>Rome,</hi> but the Lord did blast it, and fought against them, that they
could not send us.</p>

stampt with my foot and said, Cursed be all Images and Image-makers,
and all that fall down to worship them, Christ Jesus is the
express Image of his Fathers brightness, which is Light and Life,
who doth reveal the mysterie of iniquity, the cunning working
of Satan, to draw out the mind to follow him, from the pure life,
and to veil over the Just One from beholding the Presence of the
Lord. But glory be to the Lord, who hath made him manifest in

me in the shadow of his hand of Almightiness, which stopt
the mouths of devouring Lyons, and chained and limited the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening

spotless and unexpressible Love: And as I lay upon the deck of the

his presence, who with his mighty hand and outstretched arm of
Dignity and excellent Power, is defacing and staining the pride

the ears &amp; hearts of the Hypocrites, &amp; surprized the double-min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

poured out my soul to our everlasting Father for you, with Rivers of tears,
night and day, that you might be kept pure and single in the sight of our
God, improving your Talents as wise Virgins, having Oyl in your Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,

and <hi>Amen</hi> to those that fear his Name; he will comfort the Mourners in
<hi>Sion,</hi> and will cause the heavy-hearted in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to rejoice, because

his praise and my eternal comfort, who hath not been wanting to us in
any thing in his own due time; We are Witnesses he can provide a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

I could not wish I had not come over Seas, because I knew it was my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal

all afflictions and miseries, the Lord remembred mercy, and did not leave
nor forsake us, nor suffer his faithfulness to fail us, but caused the sweet

                  <p>my life is given up to serve the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God, and to obey his pure Call in the measure of the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation
of his Love, Light, Life and Spirit of Christ Jesus, his onely
begotten Son, whom he hath manifested in me and thousands, by
the brightness of his appearing, to put an end to sin and Satan, and bring
to light Immortality through the preaching of the everlasting Gospel by
the Spirit of Prophesie, which is poured out upon the sons and daughters
of the living God, according to his purpose, whereof he hath chosen me,
who am the least of all; but God who is rich in mercy, for his own Name
sake hath passed by mine offences, and hath counted me worthy to bear
testimony to his holy Name before the mighty men of the Earth. Oh the
love of the Lord to my soul! my tongue cannot express, neither hath it
entered into the heart of man to conceive of the things that God hath
laid up for them that fear him.</p>
                  <p>Therefore doth my soul breath to my God for thee and my Children,
night and day, that your minds may be joined to the Light of the Lord
Jesus, to lead you out of Satans Kingdom, into the Kingdom of God,
where we may enjoy one another in the Life Eternal, where neither Sea
nor Land can separate; in which Light and Life do I salute thee my
dear Husband, with my Children, wishing you to embrace Gods love in
making his Truth so clearly manifest amongst you, whereof I am a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
even of the everlasting Fountain that hath been opened by the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers
of Christ, who preach to you the Word of God in season, and out
of season, directing you where you may find your Saviour to purge and
cleanse you from your sins, and to reconcile you to his Father, and to have
unity with him and all the Saints, in the Light, that ye may be fellow-Citizens
in the Kingdom of Glory, Rest and Peace, which Christ hath
purchased for them that love him, and obey him: What profit is there
for to gain the whole world, and lose your own souls? Seek first the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

of God, and the Righteousness thereof, and all other things shall be
added to you; Godliness is great gain, having the promise of this life
that now is, and that which is to come; which is fulfilled to me, who have
tasted of the Lords endlesse love and mercies to my soul, &amp; from a moving
of the same love and life do I breath to thee my dear Husband, with
my Children; my dear love salutes you all; my Prayers to my God are for
you all, that your minds may be joined to the Light wherewith you are
lightened, that I may enjoy you in that which is Eternal, and have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
with you in the Spirit: He that is joined to the Lord, is one
spirit, one heart, one mind, one soul, to serve the Lord with one consent.
I cannot by Pen or Paper set forth the large love of God in fulfilling his
gracious promises to me in the Wilderness, being put into prison for God's
Truth, there to remain all days of my life, being searched, tryed, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
upon pain of death among the Enemies of God and his Truth;
standing in jeopardy for my life, until the Lord had subdued and brought
them under by his mighty Power, and made them to feed us, and would
have given us money or clothes; but the Lord did deck our Table richly in
the Wilderness; the day of the Lord is appearing, wherein he will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
every deed of darkness, let it be done never so secret; the light of
Christ Jesus will make it manifest in every Conscience; the Lord will
rip up all coverings that is not of his own Spirit. The God of Peace be

staid in the measure of God's Grace, that is able to make thee wise unto
salvation, and to give thee an inheritance with the rest of the Children
of Light. My tender lamb, fear and dread the living God; keep in his
presence, go not out to let in the Enemy, to break thy peace and to darken
thy understanding, and to vail over the pure, from beholding thy Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our:
Incline thine ear to him, give up to a daily Cross to thy own will:
Stand single, empty; wait upon the Lord to be fill'd with his fulness; let
him be all thy treasure, ask of him, he giveth liberally. Believe, and
thou shalt receive; his promise is large, I have found it so. Having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
yet enjoying all things. I have tasted, handled and felt of his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
love, and indurable Riches; my life is wrapt up in it; I have found

hitherto, even to this day, upheld and preserved you in
the innocency, and its testimony against the contrary; although
sometimes (I know that) you have tasted the sentence of death
in your selves, and even (as it were) ready to despair of life; yet
in the living testimony of innocency, in the answer of a good
Conscience, I <hi>Daniel</hi> bear you record, (in the Covenant of Life)
the same remaineth with you, and you are in it a good sweet sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour

                  <p>Wherefore my dear Friends, be faithful, full of Faith, and the

                  <p>Oh! I am moved in the Bowels of my Father's love, as one with
you (in trials, and in the exercise of manifold temptations) to stir
up your pure and innocent minds by way of remembrance, and
also to beseech you to take heed to the Testimony of Life that's
undefiled, and manifest in you, and to dwell in the same which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
the joy and comfort of the Lord, and his peace, which you
know is not of the World; and so to watch and beware of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
that is near to tempt to make shipwrack of Faith and a
good Conscience, and to despair, and so to betray not only your
own innocent long-sufferings, but also the Testimony of the
Lord God of our Life, for which you have so long suffered, and
by the pure Divine virtue of the same have you been to this day
preserved; so that the Lord (who is and will be your reward)
hath not been wanting to you on his part. Oh faint not, but lift
up your heads, and be faithful still as I am not otherwise perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

Covenant and Way deliverance will come to the Seed; and ye
know, if the same come not in his own Covenant of Truth, in

            <p>ANd when this, with other Papers I had through not a little
difficulty communicated to their hands over the heads of
our Enemies, I was moved to speak my Message as from the Lord
of Life to them after I had offered up my body, and to lay down
my life for these poor innocents, my dear friends; and so with my
voice I saluted them in the Lord's Truth, as they stood at the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son-Grates
with these words in the behalf of the general Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of the Saints in light, to wit, <hi>The whole Body of God's Elect,
right dearly, owneth your Testimony, and you are a sweet savour unto
the Lord and his people:</hi> And forasmuch as one of these poor affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
Lambs replied, and said on this wise, as if it was a trouble to
them that they could not be more serviceable. Then my heart
being melted, and my bowels of pity, mercy and compassion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
moved, I said, That it was a wonderful mercy of the Lord, in
as much as they were preserved in their own measure of Truth
and pure innocency, for which my heart praised the Lord for
what mine eye saw, which right dearly affected my heart, and we
were well refreshed at that season, in the sweet presence of our
living God, albeit our bodies were at a distance, but so as we
could behold each others face through the Prison bars of Iron,
in the Inquisition.</p>
            <p>Now for so much as in the Wisdom of God it is seen meet that
the fore-mentioned and following Writings which came from
their hands, might appear to publike view, that thereby every
Member of the one Body may have a right understanding, and
not onely so, but also a sensible feeling not onely of the trials and
sufferings in part of these innocent Lambs, but also of the conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
of each other, as fellow-Members of the infinite Body of

which Christ Jesus the Lord is both King and Head, in whom be
endless dominion and pure glory, and eternal salvation, <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so I being as it were constrained to publish the acceptable
Words that sound and savor of pure innocency and clear truth,
for the Elect's sake, in the same Love and Life I am the more free
hereunto, even as a Child, that differs but little from a servant, as
I am in the Father's Love, Power and Grace of Life, fitted to
serve the undefiled Life of the least in the Kingdom of Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and to administer comfort or what else I have received from
the Eternal Fountain or Fulness, for the use or service of either
Body, Mind, Soul or Spirit, of my own Flesh or Family, seeing

did flye as dust before the Wind; for which we do entreat all
Friends to glorifie our God on our behalf; for never did the Lord
our God work greater deliverance for any, than he hath done for
us from time to time, who are the least and weakest for what we
know, that ever the Lord our God sent forth in so great &amp; weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
a Work; but all things are possible with him, who made and
created all things; it is he alone which carrieth on his own work
by his own mighty Power, and the glory shal be his own for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
<hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oh our dearly beloved Friends, did you know but the third
part of the afflictions the Lord our God hath carried us through,
you would say, The Lord hath wrought as great a Miracle in our
preservation, as ever he did in raising <hi>Lazarus</hi> out of the Grave:
And in the greatest of our afflictions we could not say in our
hearts, Father, would thou hadst not brought us here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but cryed
mightily to our God for power to carry us through whatsoever
should be inflicted upon us, that the Truth of our God might
not suffer through our weakness: And the Lord did hear us, and
answered us in righteousness, and carried u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> on with all boldness,
and made our fore-heads as Flint, and our Brows as Brass, in the
faces of our Enemies; that whensoever we were brought forth
upon trial, all fear was taken away, that we stood as Iron-Gates,
and Castle-Walls in the faces of our Enemies, so that they said,
<hi>we would fain be burned;</hi> but we answered, No, we would not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
be burned; but if our Heavenly Father doth call us to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
in that kind for his Name sake, he will give us power to go
through it; and we have great cause to believe it; for our Lord
God never called us to do any service for him, but he gave us po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
and made way for his own Work; glory and praise be to his
holy Name for ever.</p>
                  <p>Dearly beloved friends, marvel not why <hi>Israel</hi> is not gathered
in all this time; it is not for want of labour, nor travel, nor grief,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:42610:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nor pain, fasting, nor mourning, nor weeping, nor love to their
souls; but it is because of the great oppression: For here are a
willing people, but they dare not until the Lord make way for
them. Truly Friends, we have not been idle since we saw your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
nor have we had much ease to the flesh, but do travel night
and day for <hi>Sion's</hi> prosperity and perfect joy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for the repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and her pure praise; though our sorrows are
deep, and our afflictions grievous, yet we do wait with patience
to reap the peaceable fruits of righteousness, and enjoy the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of our uprightness; Praises be to our God for ever, he hath
kept us by his power and holiness, that our Enemies have not one
jot or tittle against us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but for the Truth of our God, and that
we could not join with them; so they would not suffer us to have
one line of refreshment, but stript us out of all, so that we could
not expect one drop of mercy, favour nor affection, but what
our Heavenly Father did distil upon us from his living presence,
and work for us by the operation of his own Arm of strength
and power. But dear Friends; though a long Winter, and many
sharp and terrible storms have past over our heads, so that we
cannot express our sorrows; so likewise we cannot declare our
joys. Oh! in the midst of all our affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ctions, our God did draw
nigh unto us, an did speak comfortably unto us with many sweet
and precious promises, and did never suffer his faithfulness to fail
us, nor was he wanting unto us in Visions and Revelations. Oh
how doth he appear in his glory, beauty and brightness, so that
our souls are ravished and wrapped up with his living presence
and glory many times, so that we do not dare to look out at our
long sufferings nor trials, but do press forwards towards the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of joy and blessedness which our Eternal Father hath prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for all them that love him, and walk in obedience to him; and
we know, the deeper our sorrow is, the greater our joy shall be;
and the heavier our Cross; the weightier our Crown, as we abide
faithful: And we do believe, that neither Principalities nor Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers,
nor sufferings, nor imprisonment, nor pesecution, nor life
nor death, shall be able to separate us from the love of God in
Christ Jesus our Lord and Saviour, <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Dearly beloved Friends though our bodies are bolted up in the

and steadfastness of your faith and labour of love, and are daily
refreshed in all the faithful-hearted. Oh dear hearts! the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the least of you is precious. Oh! the Rivers of tears
that have distilled from our eyes, whilst we do think upon you,
for joy, because of your growth and flourishing in the Truth. Oh!
you are Virgins indeed, who have Oyl in your Vessels, and your
Lamps burning, and are cloathed with the long white Robes of
Righteousness, and are adorned with the Ornaments of pure
Beauty and glorious brightness (abundance of you) to our joy
and comfort; and we do pray night and day. That every Babe of
our Heavenly Father's begetting may prosper, even as we desire
our own souls should prosper; and that every one may be kept
out of incumbrances, and use the World as if they used it not;
but every one's mind, spirit, heart and soul, may be exercised in
the Eternal, by the Power of God, out of the earthly, out of the
visible, out of the carnal and perishing things of this life, (so as
to trust in it) into the heavenly, into the spiritual, into the invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
into that which never changeth, sadeth, nor waxeth old, where
every one may dwell in the enjoyment of the presence of the
Lord; for in the presence of the Lord is fulness of joy, and at his
right hand is pleasure for evermore. Oh! that every one may be
emptied of your selves, and unbottomed of your selves, that you
may build wholly upon the sure foundation, and anchored so fast
upon the Rock of Ages, that neither the swelling Seas, nor the
foaming Waves, nor stormy Winds, though they beat vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
may ever be able to remove you. Oh dear Brethren! in the
life and power you may feel the issues of Love and Life, which
stream as a River to every soul of you, from the hearts of us that
are wholly joined to the Fountain; Glory and everlasting praises
be given to his holy Name. Our whole souls, spirits, hearts and
minds, are given up to serve the Lord in whatsoever he requireth
of us, as he shall make it manifest unto us. And we do blesse his
Name for ever, that he hath found us worthy of so high
a calling, as to bind Kings in chains, and Nobles in fetters of Iron<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>Dear and precious Friends and Brethren, pray for us, that we
may finish our Testimony to the glory of God, and to the praise
of his holy Name, and to the comfort of all that love his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and to our own eternal salvation, and to the shame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
of all that hate the Lord Jesus, and persecute his Truth. So
in the pure Vnity of the Covenant of Light, Life, Peace, Love,
and everlasting Righteousness, do we take our leaves of you all
at this time, hoping and believing we shall see your faces once
again, before we go hence, and be no more seen. Dear Friends,
pray for us.</p>
                  <p>Though we were in many streights and hardships by reason of
the oppression; yet whilst our minds were staid upon the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,

not in his own time, will nor strength, but in the Will and
time, Strength and Power of the Almighty God, at whose pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
the Mountains were removed, the tall Cedars were made
to bow, the strong Oaks to stoop. Oh wonderful! He went to
the Lord Inquisitor, (the Popes Deputy) to demand our lawful
Liberty, which would not be granted, unless he and we would
write to <hi>Messaena,</hi> or <hi>Legorn,</hi> to some <hi>English</hi> Merchant to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
for four thousand Dollers: Which Proposition being out
of the Covenant of Light we durst not stoop to it; but our dear
Brother in Christ Jesus offered his body for our liberty, but it

would not be granted; nothing would serve but one to engage
for four thousand Dollers to be paid, if ever we come into

                  <p>Oh dear Friends! greater Love was never heard of, than
for a man to lay down his Life for his Friend: Oh! it is

which is never to be forgotten.</p>

                  <p>NOw in short time after we were taken Prisoners,
we were stung with Flyes called <hi>Muskatoes,</hi> in
our faces and our heads, as we lay in our Beds, that
were swollen as if we had the small-Pox, so that all people
were afraid of us, save the <hi>English</hi> Consul; they thought we
had been unclean persons, so that a Fryar told <hi>Sarah</hi> he saw
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42610:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
an evil spirit in her face, which was a great trial; they could not
sleep in their beds in the house, they were so tormented, &amp; we were
told, that they had seen them that did pray and preach every day
were burnt for Witches in a short time; and they would keep us
to see our lives and conversations; and so they have: And glory
beto our God, they cannot lay guilt to our charge, but are made
to confess the truth.</p>
                  <p>In a few days after we were there, in a Vision, in the night, the
Lord appeared unto me, and shewed me, that round about us, and
above and beneath us, there were many Magicians of <hi>Aegypt;</hi>
and the Lord smote me, and said unto me, <hi>The Devil hath desired
to winnow you as Wheat; but pray that your faith fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

sight was very dreadful and terrible; and the voice of the Lord
did awaked me with much trembling and amazement, and a great
War for the space of twelve hours, before I could get the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
and we did witness but little ease to the flesh night nor day.
We went in obedience to the Lord to one of their Tower-Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
in time of their Worship, and stood trembling in the midst of
them; and I was made to turn my back to the high Altar, and
kneel down, and lift up my voice in prayer unto the Lord, and he
that was saying Service, drew off his Surplice, and kneeled a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
beside us till I had done: and he reacht forth his hand to us, to
come to him, and offered me a token; and the Lord shewed me it
was the Mark of the Beast: And I refused it; and he put it into
<hi>Sarah</hi>'s hand, and she gave it him again, and shewed him her
Purse, that she had to give, if any had need. And he asked if we
were <hi>Calvinists</hi> or <hi>Lutherans?</hi> And we said, Nay And he asked if
we would go to <hi>Rome</hi> to the Pope? But we denied. And he ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
if we were <hi>Catholicks?</hi> And we told him, We were true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
the servants of the living God. And many of them were
amazed, and came round about us; We having but little of their
Tongue, gave our Testimony (for the Lord) in words and signs,
as well as we could; and they were made subject to the Power at
that present, praises be given to our God, and we departed in
peace.</p>
                  <p>And since that the Lord laid such a heavy burthen upon us,
that we did question what he would do with us, before we knew
the mind of God in it. And upon a set-day they had a great
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42610:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Meeting to take their holy Sacrament, (as they call it) in a high
place; but we knew nothing of it, nor where it was, but what
the Lord revealed to us. And we were made to go in, and stand
in the midst; and there were many lights in divers places, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Christs, as they call them, and much costliness and abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Earth; they had so many sorts of holy Garments (as
they call them) of so many colours, that it would make one won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how the Devil did invent it. And there we were made to stand
in the midst for the space of three parts of an hour, as near as I
can judge, in great power, trembling and quaking, and bitter
mourning, so that they were all amazed, and some removed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for fear, but knew not what to do; for I never did witnesse
such an Earthquake. In the end one came soberly, and spake to
us to go <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

door trembling and mourning, to the astonishment of them, and
being so overcome with their abominations, we went along the
street reeling to and fro, and staggering like drunken men; so that
we were a wound to all that saw us: It was the wonderful Power
of God that made way for us to go forth to them, and kept us.
They have used all the Craft they have day and night to Inchant
us as the Lord hath made it known unto us, Glory and prayses bee
to his everlasting Name for ever more. We know that there is
no Inchantment against <hi>Jacob,</hi> nor divination against <hi>Israel.</hi>

Fryars, Jesuits and Magistrates, nor great women. Here are some

                  <p>The Lord Inquisitor sent to us, that if we would (being we

but we denied them in the Name of the Lord, and all their dead

here we have cruel mockings; and the same contradictions, trials
and temptations that ever the servants of the Lord had, &amp; Christ

and because they cannot have any just thing against us, they
do invent lyes against us; but the Lord is on our side, for else the

their threatnings and cruelty is more than our tongues can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press;

of the Lord Jesus, and Wisdom of Words to stop the mouths of
the gain-sayers, that they vvould be made to say we spake truth;
they could never say otherwise: But they vvould say, We had not
the true faith, but we had all virtues. Oh dear heart! if it be our

the Night, and smote me on the Arm, and said, <hi>Look, there is the
Pope, he will not hurt thee;</hi> Where he stood in the Room, as one
forsaken of God and man; this was at the <hi>English</hi> Consuls, when
there was some fear upon me concerning him. Now here is a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
in the Prison which came hither upon some account, he is a
a Doctor of Law, and differs from them in many things; but they
are all of one spirit: He doth constantly affirm, that the Pope
hath sent an Order to set us free; and he saith, they are lyars and
false blasphemers if they do say the Pope sent any such Order as
they speak of. They do meet every day concerning us, we do feel
them; some would have it one way, and some another, and so
they cannot agree, because they do act contrary to the Will of
God; the Lord sets it all on fire, and hath burned all they have
done these three years concerning us. Now where they will look
a Reward of their charges, we do not know; the wise are taken
in their own craftiness, and the subtile in their own snare. There
have twelve of them sate in Judgement upon us three years, and
some have struck hard at our lives, so that we have been even at
death's door. I have lain very weak three Weeks at a time. There
are many for us, as far as they do dare. The Lord says, there were
two with the Inquisitor for us, and did plead much with him: I did

would lend us five pounds when we did want<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but when our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney

not take any of any one. We did not know the mind of the Lord
in it; but had we had money, we had not known the mighty Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of God. Now we are able to trust the Lord where-ever he
shall carry us without money. We do question the money in the
Consul's hand. It will be hard for him to part with it. Our Life
is with thee.</p>

            <p>THe intent of the Spirit of the Lord within my heart and

travel from my Native Countrey, Kindred and Father's House,
being freely given up to serve the Lord, his Truth and People, in
the Power and Gospel of God; I having no imposition or neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
at all laid upon my Conscience, as from any mortal man, but
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:42610:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
certainly it was a pure necessity from the living God of Heaven &amp;
Earth, many of his faithful servants, Messengers, sons &amp; daughters
that were, &amp; are as dear &amp; precious to me as my own life, may beat
me record on the Lords behalf unto the truth of what I write on
this wise; &amp; surely in the counsel everlasting, the thing was hid from
me then whether ever I should return to my Native Countrey or
not. However in the love and favour of God, and in his fear set up
within my heart, was I given up, with my body also offered as a
living Sacrifice, which was but my reasonable sacrifice, to give a
sound to the Nations afar off, of the mighty day of our God,
and his blessed Truth, the Light of Jesu-manifest in every Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
in which Light we have most assuredly believed unto salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
And verily the Power and pure Presence of his Eternal
Strength was with me, through many hardships, trials and tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations;
the right hand of the hiding of his Power did sweetly
guide, strengthen &amp; support me, even as it did, and doth his Lambs
whom he so send forth as among Wolves, in his Dovelike innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
harmlesness &amp; wisdom, which is as wise, or rather wiser than the
Serpents. And this Scripture have I well witnessed fulfilled whilst
travelling from one Nation to another people, as my Father did in
the ancient days. And on this wise, with three more Brethren, so
freely given up with one consent in the behalf of the Gospel ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting,
that is now preaching again to the Nations, Tongues and
Kindreds.</p>
            <p>We set forward the <hi>16th.</hi> of the third Month, and we sweetly
parted with our right dearly beloved Friends, Brethren, Fathers
and near Relations, that were flesh of our flesh and bone of our
bone, and from all our outward acquaintance, and Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
in the Will, Love and Spirit of our God, in the same day
from <hi>Gravese<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d</hi> we set forth; and at the end of 44. days, we arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at <hi>Legorn</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> where we gave a certain sound of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
service, and Message of Salvation; and of-its life and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness,
coming upon the Nations as a weight either to condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
or justification, as the same is received or rejected among
them.</p>
            <p>And thus as we had opportunity, among the men of our own
Nation, the <hi>Jews</hi> and others, we gave a sound and the blessing of
the God of Heaven, and his Presence was with us, whether the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:42610:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Nations of men did hear or forbear; but the Witness of God in
sundry was reached; and the same answered in us. And herein we
are so far well satisfied, whilst others were hardened, who defied
us and our Testimony, as their uncircumcised Fathers always did
resist and gain say the truth that saves from sin, and so finally
from its condemnation.</p>
            <p>And it came to pass after that we had waited upon the Lord to
understand his good will and pleasure, he answered us in the joy
of our hearts, and we received his counsel, and communicated of
the same to each other's satisfaction in the love of God, in which
we were wel confirmed to obey the same until the death, as the
Lord our God might have permitted for his Name's sake, who
then further ordained us to be separated, <hi>viz John Stubs</hi> and <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Fell</hi> to pass on towards <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and my dear brother and
companion, <hi>Richard Scostrop,</hi> with me, to pass <hi>Eastward,</hi> to <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
and <hi>Constantinople,</hi> in <hi>Asia;</hi> and after a little season we parted
in the goodness of God. And when 24. dayes were finished, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
(in the mean time) touched a little season at the Island <hi>Zant,</hi>
we arrived at <hi>Smyrna.</hi> But behold it came to pass, immediately
at out coming there was not a little stir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> together with the evil
surmizings, and what else arising up as a flood, with threatnings
breathed forth from the Apostate Christians, especially men of no
small degree (of our own Nation) against us, when <hi>Turks, Jew,
Greeks, Heathens,</hi> and others, were not altogether so evil affected
as to let us from the exercise of our Conscience void of offence
towards God and man, and so to hold forth the example of the
harmless Life, and unblameable Conversation, in all equitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in Doctrine, Life and Practice, of what we professed in the
midst of them. But oh! how the Christians (by Name) in <hi>Asia</hi>
(who should first have received the Word of saving-health) how
did they defie and reproach not onely us, but our living Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
and Message of Blessedness, which day by day was sounded
in their ears notwithstanding; the Lord God lay not what they
did against us, to their charge, when they have most need of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Peace with God, if happily repentance unto life be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed
by them, who know not what they did; yea and my spirit
is ready to say <hi>Amen,</hi> for their sakes that hated us without a
cause, as the same unbelieving nature did our Lord and Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>er,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:42610:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whom we love, serve and honor in the same, and therefore keep
his sayings, which are not grievous to us in that one and the self-same
Spirit which reproves the World for sin, in which we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him as the Father, the which guideth into all truth, from all
evil, concerning which we wel admonished their minds to subject to
the one, and to avoid and turn from the other, each having their
proper effects attending them; as anguish, woes, judgements
and disquietments upon the soul and conscience that doth evil;
and contrariwise, blessings, peace, glory, honor, and the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God attending the soul of man which worketh good, in
the Light of the same excellent Spirit of God which exerciseth
the Conscience in temperance and sobriety, meekness, and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christ.</p>
            <p>And on this wise we besought the men of our own Nation, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with many more in them parts, that they may become a
sweet savour of the pure life of Christ and Christianity, indeed
and in truth, which tends to answer the Witness of the Eternal
God manifest in <hi>Turks, Greeks, Jews, Heathens,</hi> and Apostate Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
among the dark Nations, where they have their conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Yet I am constrained to express somewhat of their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of dealing with us to our good; Wherefore men of reasonable
and honorable understanding, may bear with me, to the end that
the honest-hearted may be informed to beware of a persecuting
Spirit, which is not of God, neither ever was it born of him.</p>
            <p>Their threatnings encreased daily, and they burthened them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
exceedingly with us, whose deportment and behaviour they
were made to confess to, as did the Consul and divers others,
which in truth they could not say otherwise, but that it was tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate,
innocent, harmless and unblameable in our conversation;
Magnified be the Lord, and blessed be his Grace of Life, by which
we in submission to the same were guided herein: But because our
Testimony was not for, but against whatsoever might be said in
truth to be evil, unjust, or unequitable, (<hi>which is dishonorable</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
were we hated of the high and lofty, to the disquieting of
their own rest day and night, because they burthened themselves
so with the truth and innocency of the Lord's Testimony, which
our Life held forth among them who received not the same in his
love that they mig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the wrath to come. So they forthwith sent a Message from <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
to the great City <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to the King's Embassador of
<hi>England,</hi> and besought him to expel us out from among them of

And forthwith this Warrant was dispatcht with a Messenger
from the Embassador's Court at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to <hi>Smyrna;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
the Merchants of the Earth, and others that could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
to hear of the sound of Truth, received the same not with
little gladness, (poor me! wo and alas for them!) the end of which
will not be peace, but contrariwise, wo and misery; and they put
the same Warrant in execution, and sent a <hi>Turkish</hi> Janisary, and
a <hi>Drugerman,</hi> that were Officers under the Consul of the <hi>English</hi>
Nation; and they came with <hi>Harmols, (viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> called <hi>Porters</hi>) with
<hi>Cain</hi>'s Weapons, and fetcht us from our Lodging before the
Consul; and the man was courteous and moderate, and had his
car open then to what we in the reverence and fear of the Lord
then said unto him, which was his honor who then saw over and
beyond that foolish Ceremony of the Hat, neither did he bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
himself with the same, as many unwisely do, the cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or veiling of the nobility of a good understanding, which

respect of persons in them, where it is set up in its proper and

men of Wisdom, yet he desired that we might not take it ill
as from him (in his place of Authority) in doing as he was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in the prosecution of the Warrant, which summoned all Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
and Members of the Factory, with Masters and Officers of
Ships, to be aiding and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> to surprize and banish two inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
naked, harmless men, that had neither Bow nor Sword, nor
any such like material, or visible Weapon of War to resist evil, as
<hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> had not, against whom the hard-hearted <hi>Jews</hi>
cryed out with the same voice, <hi>Help men of Israel,</hi> &amp;c. and such
like stir there was; and we let the Consul first know at our first co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
that we owned his place of Authority, and were ready to
submit to any thing that was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> or equitable; and at last in this

               </gap>ing, forasmuch as in the
uprightness of our heart, and in the innocency of the same were
we come so far to do the Will of God, and to suffer for it, as his
hand permitted.</p>
            <p>So with many other expressions I cleared my Conscience, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
by Words. Sufferings and Writings, to the whole Nation there;
and the Consul seemed to be unwilling to use violence against us
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:42610:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that at our departure prayd for them that hated us without a caus,
knowing not what they did; we seeing it could not at that season be
otherwise, but what the Lord had permitted them to bring to
pass, not to their justification, but as a Judgement among them
from the living God, who did not onely dispence the visitation of
his Love and Salvation day by day among them, but he visited
them also with the strokes of his displeasure, even unto death and
destruction: And surely he smote and took away of the chiefest,
and others of them daily. And verily my heart often cryed, and
besought the Lord for them (in secret more especially; though I
was constrained not to cease uttering my voice openly among
them, and for them) while they sought my hurt; as many of them
(I know) by the Witness of God in them may remember. And
so we were sent away as Prisoners, or rather as Lambs driven
from the Dens of Lyons, or from the barren Caves of ravening
Wolves, whose Nature wooried them.</p>
            <p>Now we had spoken for a passage by a <hi>Dutch</hi> ship, to have gone
from thence to <hi>Constantinople;</hi> but before the ship departed <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
the Warrant came to the Consul's hands, which thou mayest
see came not from either them called <hi>Turks, Jews, Heathen, Greeks</hi>
or <hi>Barbarians,</hi> but even from the men of our own Nation. Alas!
alas! yea wo and alas for them.</p>
            <p>So the Reader may see what a stir there hath been in the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Asia</hi> against the appearance of Tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h, and its innocency,
in plainness, to expel and banish it, together with its Message and
Messengers, out of their coasts or borders; and not to have any
entertainment, or at least to come within the extent of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
whatever becomes of them, let them go where they will,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> So as in effect they say, We will not have this man, the Light,
Truth, Temperance Innocency, its Life and Wisdom from above,
to rule, or have its preheminence over us in our Consciences; We
will rather chuse to live in the practice of our own evil hearts
and ways; and therefore thus to their own hurt they
say unto God,<note place="margin">Job. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Depart from us, for we desire not the
knowledge of thy ways; and as for the Word of the Lord,
we have no delight in it.</hi> Lo they have rejected the Word of the
Lord, and what Wisdom is in them? And such the
holy,<note place="margin">Job 24. 13</note> perfect and upright man saw rebel against the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:42610:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Light, and said, They are of those that rebel against the Light,
they know not the wayes thereof, neither abide in the paths
thereof.</p>
            <p>And so with consent they joined together to banish Truth, its
Message, and Messengers of Peace, which provoked them to jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie
that believe not, who scorned us as fools, and what else, not
honestly considering, how that God is provoking the Nations to
jealousie and wrath with a foolish people, as in the ancient days,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 22. was prophesied: And such besought our Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
even Jesus, to depart out of their Coasts or Borders, who
loved and fed their Swine upon the Mountains, even the <hi>Gada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renes</hi>
besought him to depart, who saith, <hi>He that loveth Father or
Mother, or what else, more than me, is not worthy of me;</hi> and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Mother, and such Relations, are of of more honourable
esteem than many Swine. And to his Disciples he also saith (that
was dead, and is alive and liveth for ever) <hi>As they have done unto
me, so will they do un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o you; if they have persecuted me, they will also
persecute you.</hi> These are his faithful and true saying; <hi>He that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
you, receiveth me; and he that receiveth me,
receiveth him that sent me;</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 13. 20</note> [mark that:] <hi>Verily, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily

me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He that despiseth you, despiseth me; and he that despiseth me,
despiseth him that sent me.</hi> And it's to be understood, that such like
dealing <hi>J. S.</hi> and <hi>H. F.</hi> our Brethren, found at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> from
whom they also were banished.</p>
            <p>And on this wise being rejected, despised, banished out of <hi>Asia,</hi>
from <hi>Smyrna,</hi> in about eight dayes we arrived at the Island <hi>Zant,</hi>
where my dear Brother and Companion in sufferings, and not
onely so, but in the Kingdom and patience of Christ, he was visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with sickness <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>igh unto death; but the Word and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lord ordered me to pass through part of <hi>Italy,</hi> and
my face was set towards <hi>Venice;</hi> and we weighed the thing in the
fear and counsel of the Lord, and were both given up in one to
travel; yet it was so that the poor Lamb was not capable in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to travel with me, by reason of weakness; and he being fully
perswaded and satisfied in his own mind, that I was to pass on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
in the tender Love of our God he did the more constrain
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:42610:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
me; I finding some unwillingness to leave him in that condition,
which was not a little cross unto me. But in the Heavenly Will
and Peace of our God, and joy of the Lord, out of all visibly
we parted asunder; and it came to pass, that he laid down his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
there in about two days after.</p>
            <p>There being a Ship of <hi>Venice</hi> ready, I embarqued on the same,
and had a good passage through the Gulf of <hi>Venice.</hi> After three
Weeks were finished, was I admitted (together with the Ships
company) to receive Product or Admission to come into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as their manner is; and there I continued about eight days as
a sign and wonder among many, and gave somewhat of a sound
of the Lord's Day (in truth) among them; and from thence I
travelled to <hi>Legorn,</hi> and my face was as if it were set towards
<hi>England,</hi> I being alone, as a Mourning-Dove in a desolate Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness:
Yet it came so to pass, when I arrived at the same Port or
City, that the everlasting Love of my God did fill and overcome
my heart, and mine eye right dearly affected the same, and verily
the living Word and Commandment of my God sounded in mine
ear, and mine understanding was quickened in the Spirit of Life
from God, so that I was made willing, and not to rebel against
the Heavenly Voice, [And what if I testifie, that mine eye saw
the Angel of his presence?] which was expresly for me to give
up, and pass away from thence, to visit his long suffering Seed of
Innocency, shut up in the Inquisition, in the Isle of <hi>Malta,</hi> under
the Pope's Authority, and to communicate to their necessities;
and verily the sweet promise of the Lord entered and possessed
my heart, and my God made my way prosperous; for in the Light
of his countenance he had often set these poor, afflicted, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suffering
innocents before my face: Wherefore my body and
mind was freely offered up as my reasonable service, to serve his
Truth, and the least Member of it; and so to the death of the
Cross, whereto I became obedient in uprightness of heart, as if I
should never see Kindred or Native Countrey more.</p>
            <p>A Vessel of <hi>France</hi> being ready to depart from thence East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
I embarqued thereon for the Isle of <hi>Cicilia</hi> to <hi>Musena,</hi> and
from thence to the Isle of <hi>Malta</hi> in a Vessel of the said Island;
and in my passage the Vessel did bear in to <hi>Syracuse,</hi> where <hi>Paul</hi>
abode three days in his passage to <hi>Rome,</hi> (after he had suffered

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42610:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
abode three days in his passage to <hi>Rome</hi> (after he had suffered
shipwrack on <hi>Malta;</hi>) and at <hi>Syracuse</hi> I abode five days, where I
gave a sound of the Lord's Truth and Life: And so we imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
sailed from thence, and within 24. hours we arrived at the
Island of <hi>Malta;</hi> and within some hours after I came upon the
said Island, I had admittance to the Pope's Lord Inquisitor, to
whom I delivered my Message in the <hi>Italian</hi> Tongue, on this wise,
<hi>I am come to demand the just Liberty of my innocent Friends, the two
English women in prison in the Inquisition:</hi> And he asked, if I were
related to them as a Husband or Kinsman, and whether I came
out of <hi>England</hi> on purpose with that Message. And I answered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I came from <hi>Legorn</hi> for that same end; and he replied at last, They
should abide in Prison till they dye, except some <hi>English</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
or others that were able, would engage or give obligation
for the value of three or four thousand dollers, conditionally,
that they should never return again into those parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>On this wise was his reply divers times, with the Consul and
many others, together and asunder; but in the Name and fear of
the Lord God I withstood the same unchristian-like demand and
cruelty, in the Word, Power and Travel of the Lord in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
suffering Lamb; behalf, albeit they daily threatned me
with their cruelty and Inquisition of darkness, and followed me
to and fro with their Officer and Black-Rod, and the Popes De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty
would have bound me that I should neither speak good nor
evil to any one while I was on the Island, as the Consul said, save
to him; neither to come to the Prison alone; except the Consul
came also with me, or some of his Family at least: But their snares;
Bonds and Covenants, in the Name of my God I defied, because
the Spirit of Life from the Lord gave me Dominion through suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
in Spirit, First, over their unjust, dark Impositions; yea;
and in the same good authority, in the innocency and upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of my heart, I travelled through, and over the darkness,
over its works, and ceased not to publish the end of my coming;
which they would not have known abroad, &amp; the sound of Truth,
and its dread and same struck terror in their hearts, that both
high and wise great men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> together with the Popish Priests
and Jesuits, knights them called of the Nobility, of the Pope's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and of many Nations; they did not
burthen themselves a little with my bodily presence, my clear te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:42610:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Friends in general, all which they defied and withstood, as it
doth appear by the words of Truth in this Treatise.</p>
            <p>And thus it comes to pass among the Nations, because we are not of this
world, as our Life and Testimony also is not for, but against the same; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we marvel not if the world hate us, knowing its birth which is from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath,
earthly and sensual, persecuteth that which is from above, heavenly
and spiritual, and so the Lord hath made me as a burthensome stone among
them. My heart blesseth his Name that wonderfully preserved me. Yet some
of them came to see somewhat of my innocency.</p>
            <p>About 24. dayes I abode upon the said Island, they daily continuing their
threatnings against me as aforesaid, and many times attempted me to take my
passage to <hi>Cicillia,</hi> or to some parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> to produce the unreasonable and
unchristian-like Obligation demanded by them; but in the fear of God I,
with my dear friends, withstood them, and they were freely given up, rather
to suffer, then to hurt God's truth and people thus to gratifie them, who (as
it doth appear) the Spirit of the Lord God of truth rules neither in Pope,
nor in any of his Lords, Priest or Jesuits, that exerciseth such Lordship over
the innocent, long-suffering Heritage of the everlasting God. The time ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steneth,
and behold it cometh to pass, that the weight of eternal Vengeance is
coming over them, which the man of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, and his sons of perdition will not
be able to bear: For the doleful cry of the Innocent, it sighs and groans with
tears, hath long uttered its voice, which hath ascended into the ears of the
most high, who is higher hen the highest, yet hath he respect unto the needy, to
uphold them, yea and to such as are of an upright, contrite, lowly, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
heart; What if I should say, the God of love and long-suffeering dwels
in such? and verily their sacrifice is acceprable in his bosome that liveth for
ever; and I am a living witness, that the sweet testimony and innocent suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of these his long-suffering Lambs, is right dear and precious in his eye,
which is the light of his countenance; and so is is not otherwise, but the same
in oneness with his people concerning them.</p>
            <p>And so in the endless Mercy, Blessing and Peace of our God we parted, and
I came away with the love and peace of my God within my heart, having the
answer and living testimony of a good Conscience; and in the wisdom of
God brought away these their words and writings, which testifieth somewhat
of their sufferings and faithfulness unto the Lord, his truth and people, which
I right well know, cannot be shut out of the Record of life Eternal, unto
which I bear record again, that they have been, and are a sweet savour unto
the Lord God of faithfulness, and so their reward, which attends the same,
in not onely with them, but with all the sons and daughters of truth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency,
that are so travelling in their long-sufferings, which are but light and
momentary in competition to the Eternal weight of glory which afterwards is
to be revealed in the same that suffered in all gener<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tions, even from righteous
<hi>Abel,</hi> unto this day of our God, to whom be wisdom, glory, salvation, and
everlasting thanksgivings and dominion, for ever, <hi>Amen,</hi> saith my soul and
spirit, even so <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it came to pass in the third month of the year 1662. also after my
God had well preserved me in my passage, and in his work and service from
<hi>Mal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> to diverse places in <hi>Italy,</hi> till I came to the Straights Mouth (of the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:42610:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Mediterranean Sea) at the place called <hi>Gibralter,</hi> it was the pleasure of the Lord
God to suffer the wind and weather to continue contrary well nigh about 30
daies, in which season I suffered many trials and tribulations in spirit, having
little or no rest in the same, because of the Vision and words of the Everlasting
which sounded often up to my understanding, even as the roaring of a Lyon,
which mine eye saw, and mine ear heard also [in the year—61. when I was a
Prisoner for the pure Word and testimony of God and his Truth, in <hi>Worcester</hi>
City Jayl, before I departed <hi>England]</hi> and the place was the high Mountain
of <hi>Gibralter</hi> that stands within the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Dominion, which was the
subject of the Vision; and ofen as I cast mine eye upon the scituation of the
place, the pure life and power of God's Eternal presence did arise up in me,
in the Word of Life, so that I saw clearly that some great exceeding weighty
service for his Name and eternal Truths sake was to be done by me, which
was so terrible and dreadful to me, when as I entred into reasoning, so that I
was brought down even to the jaws of death in dust and ashes; and as <hi>Jonah</hi>
turned his back upon <hi>Niniveh,</hi> the same temptation attended me also, to my
wounding, before I could give up; for I fled often from the place to escape
with my life from among such an unreasonable and bloody generation, and
the Lord would not be intreated to let such a bitter Cup pass unfulfilled, but
behold with the sound and stroak of his eternal Word, his Spirit of Life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
awakened, quickned and mightily revived in me, in his Wisdom, over
all fear of the Nations of men, and the same brake through the snares and
bonds of death, and over destruction and the true seed that mourned, cried,
<hi>Not my will, but thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven;</hi> and so it was a hard
thing to part with little <hi>Isaac</hi> which is received again in the Covenant of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of Life, and that was offered up which fled so often (but at last was
caught in a thicket). When the ships of diverse Nations attempted to pass
through; but the God of heaven, whom the wind and sea obeieth, suffered
them not, but they knew not what the matter was which was revealed within
my heart, as the displeasure of God was against them, to humble them also,
as I told them often by words and writings to clear my conscience; albeit
they strove, being perplexed in their minds, and attempted often, to wit 7 or
8 times in about 21 daies, and could not pass but about 2 or 3 leagues, and
on this wise it happened, it would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ther prove calm, and then the currant
would drive them back into the Streights again sometimes, and otherwhile
storms and tempests would scatter them, as a figure of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Hoste
of Egyptian darkness, so that the Charet-wheels mine eye saw struck off, so
that they drove but heavily, within, and without; and at last I gave out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, that God had service for me to do at that place, and my life was
given up to do his will, if I never saw my Native Country, Kindred, or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
house at all any more, and therefore the pleasure of the Lord in his
mighty power had made me wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ling and also gave me dominion through and
over the bonds and snares of death and destruction, as it were to lay down my
precious life, that I may take it again, together with the body, which through
his righteous judgments he had prepared to perform the good pleasure of his
Almightiness, for his Truth and Names sake. Now the heavenly voice was
often founded within my heart on this wise, saying; <hi>O Jerusalem, cut off thine
hair,</hi> and further more to <hi>gird sackcloth on my loins, As to the</hi> Prophet Jeremy, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 29.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42610:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and so I became obedient in the singleness and innocency of my heart, unto
the God of Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of my life, as a dre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dful sign against the Whorish Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and against all her Heads and Horns throughout the world: And I
then signified to the Master of the ship in which I was a passenger, how that I
did believe that God would soon give opportunity for the Fleet of ships to
pass away after this service of God was performed &amp; after I had used many
perswasions, to the end that he might suffer my body on that wise to be cast
among the wicked idolaters, lyars and murtherers, which
are like the troubled sea.<note place="margin">Isaiah 57. 20.</note> So the ship-Master let my body
be on this wise <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> over board from the ship, [God having
provided a great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> to swallow up that which sled from his presence so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten]
and so it happened, that it was upon one their called Holy-dayes, or
Saints days, namely, the day called <hi>Holy-Thursday.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So I being cast on dry land, passed through their streets directly, until I
came into the Mas-House or Idolater temple, among the Idolaters, where I
found the Fryer, or Priest, at the high Altar, down upon his knees, in his
white Surplice, ado<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing of the Host<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (which is a <hi>Chalice,</hi> or a piece of bread,
which they call the real substance of the body of Christ, after their unclean
spirit of darkness hath muttered some words over it, which they call <hi>Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>)
and after I had stood a season viewing this Idolatry with the indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Eternal God set up within my heart against the same, I turned my
back-part upon the Priest, and his dead God, and dumb Idols, at the high
Altar; and in the holy Commandment of life eternal, my face was set to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the people, and I be held them a certain season in the power of God in
which I stood; I saw the multitude of ignorant people upon their knees also,
worshipping the dark inventions and imaginations of their sottish leaders, and
blind guides, and they know not what; and in the Lord's time (which mine
eye had a circumspect heed unto) I then spread forth my arms, and stript off
my Vesture, and rent the same from top to bottom, in divers pieces, and cast
them from me with indignation. And then I took my Hat off my head,
(which was the uppermost covering of the outside of a man) and cast the
same under my feet, and stamped upon these things; and the nakedness ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
with the sack-cloath covering, to their astonishment; and then with a
clear voice I sounded Repentance three times, and gave testimony as the
sound of a trumpet among them, that the life of Christ and his Saints was
arisen from the dead; and so passed away, sounding the same words of the
Lord's Message, with Repentance, through the streets, as it were, flying from
the Idols temple, and from Idolatry, and Idolaters, until I came to the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
and there was I moved to kneel down and pray, and give thanks to the
living Lord, who had so wonderfully preserved me in doing his pleasure and
good will on earth; and he suffered no man to touch or do me harm,</p>
            <p>And the next day following the Lord God gave opportunity according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as I had let the Ship-master know I believed would come to pass, and it was
so, and all the Fleet did partake of the blessing: But how many of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
me (men of my own Nation, to whom I also continued a sign, which
they spake bitter things against) the Lord my God saw the same, and smote
them with rebuke and astonishment in his displeasure, who in his wise deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
Counsel, ordained me for many dayes and nights to be tryed on this
wise, and to fall among divers temptation afterwards, the which as a mighty

               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> of surrounded and beset me on every hand, immediately after I had done
the good will in his all-sufficient power and strengths thus the Enemy with his
subtilty in a mysterie was suffered to compass me about, to steale away my
peace and reward with my God, in whom the same is hid; and then I was in a
blessed condition, though sometime veiled for a little season, and then the
Fathers countenance was hid from mine eye, and therefore was I troubled:
Yet blessed are ye when you fall among divers temptations, saith one; and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
they were even as thorns in my flesh, yea as Messengers of Satan suffered
to buffet me for a season, even as the servant of God witnessed, who was wrapt
up into the third Heaven: What if I should somewhat testifie, so was it with
me, lest I should be exalted above measure, so that I was made to bow and
fall upon my face, and cry day and night to the Lord of Eternal life, that had
respect to the tears of the innocent, and bowed the strength of his arm to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the lowly: And so his Almightiness gave ear to the sighs and groans of
my distressed state, and had respect unto the voice of my mourning, as a Dove
or Pelican in the Wilderness; and verily his Grace I found sufficient to save
and preserve my innocency, in its sweet life of holiness to the Lord, through
all this, and that which letted, salvation to his Name, <hi>Amen.</hi> So his strength
is made perfect in weakness, even so it is in truth, in which I set to my seal of
my right hand, that God is true, in which life J give thanks to his Name of
Power and Defence, the which over all Nations is to be exalted in the hearts
of his Saints, as in the ancient dayes, yea and much more abundantly in the
Light of his bright-shining countenance, in which his Eternal and excellent
glory, and pure dreadful Majesty, for ever hath his holy habitation; to whom
be endless Dominion, with praises living and everlasting, over all, <hi>Amen.</hi>
