            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PUBLISHER TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough the worthy Authour of this Book hath in the Prefaces belonging to each Part given some account of the occasion, manner, and method of Writing it, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to justify the order in which it is laid; yet since we live in a captious age, wherein persons are apt to value themselves from the skill they pretend to in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the faults of others, and to judge before they have taken time to consider, or even to read what they so boldly disparage and traduce, it may be necessary to prevent that inconvenience at the beginning, by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Reason of the following order, <hi>viz.</hi> of placing the Discourse upon Sorrow before that which treats of the Nature, the faculties, and the operations of the Soul. A method, it's confessed, that is not usual or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, to set the particular before the general; but yet will appear to be very proper and convenient here, with respect to the occasion upon which they were penn'd; which was the disconsolate condition that this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was reduced unto by the loss of several Children in a short time; a condition that tried all the powers and force of his Soul, and which as it gave him the opportunity, so it made it necessary for him to find out and to consider the arguments and ways that might tend to the quiet and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of his own mind, and to arm him against the violent assaults of that melancholy passion. These make up the First Part, relating to the particular case, which consists of <hi>Considerations against immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate care,</hi> &amp;c. By this means his Soul by degrees began to feel it self, his thoughts were more his own, and he had some leisure to reflect upon the strength, violence, and influence of that passion; and from thence was led to the contemplation of the wonderful Effects, Powers, and capacities
<pb facs="tcp:50605:3"/>
of an human and reasonable Soul; a subject that he thought would abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly requite his pains, if he took it into serious consideration. This at his leisure he did so successfully improve, that he from thence compos'd his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Book, or the general discourse <hi>de Animâ.</hi> Having thus arrived at some degree of quiet, he then thought himself not the only, afflicted person in the World, but that there were others that might need, and yet not have leisure or opportunity to think, or if they had, might not hit upon the same arguments; and that what was a diversion and satisfaction to himself in the considering and composing, might be so to others in the reading; this inclined him to make them publick. This was a new consideration; and however qualified by his Genius, Temper, and Education, yet being distrustful of himself, he resolv'd to submit it to the judgement of another, and of one that was a Stranger to him, from whom he might therefore expect the freer censure. This brought him to the Reverend the Dean of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> a person well known to the world no less for his integrity than accurate judgement, who with his wonted freedom did communicate his thoughts to him about it, and encouraged him to proceed in his design. This candour with which that Iudicious Person treated him, did at once both encrease his esteem for him, and induced him to think over his Arguments again, and try what he could further add for their confirmation and improvement. This by times and in several ways he did prosecute, and sent his thoughts in so many Familiar Epistles to the Dean, whom he had now made his Friend; which being furnished with many peculiar observations serving his former design, and tending more especially to the further illustration of his Treatise <hi>de Animâ,</hi> it was not fit to separate them from the other: These make up the Third Part of the Book. But now having ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured thus far, he began to retract what he had done, and to think that he had done too much, and after the Papers were sent to the Press would have recalled and stifled them, had he not been restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at last by better Reasons: And now they are published, thinks it best to conceal his name, that he may more unconcernedly abide the censure, or more easily obtain the pardon of his Readers, and that more especially for the <hi>5</hi>th Epistle, which respects the <hi>Imagination</hi>; a subject truly nice and intricate, and which as it cost him more pains to trace and examine, so upon examination he was most distrustful of it, and most unwilling to publish what he had composed upon it; designing it rather to be perused, than Printed as it is: And therefore he cannot so well own that to be his, as if it had been reviewed and corrected to his own mind. If there should be any <hi>Errata</hi>'s that have escaped the Corrector's hand, the Author's distance from the Press will, I hope, excuse them.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is, I think, the Saying of <hi>Terence, Facile om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes cum valemus, recta consilia aegrotis damus.</hi> But in no distemper shall a man find more Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitants with their prescriptions, than those of the mind. Let him be but oppressed with grief or sorrow, he shall have many, like <hi>Iobs</hi> friends, <note n="(a)" place="margin">Job. 2.11.</note> 
               <hi>come every one from his place,</hi> and perhaps with less modesty (not attending silently seven days) shall forthwith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their remedies, before the humor be gathered to an head. But if to any of these when seized upon by the same dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper, the Proverb should be retorted, <hi>Physician heal thy self,</hi> 'Tis to be doubted, most of them would prove like to a late famous Physician, and sink under that distemper, for the knowledge and Cure whereof he had at the same instant a Treatise in the Press.</p>
            <p>The Mind of man is a Labyrinth, but it has four chief passions, from whence indeed all others do flow, as from their native Heads, or Fountains, and those are <hi>Desire</hi> and <hi>Ioy, Fear</hi> and <hi>Sorrow.</hi> The first being or proceeding from an opinion of a future Good; the second of a present; the third from an opinion of a future Evil, and the fourth of a present. Now since <hi>it is Opinion</hi> (as Sir. <hi>Walter</hi> 
               <note n="(b)" place="margin">In his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the History of the World.</note> 
               <hi>Raleigh</hi> has prettily said) <hi>and not Truth that travels the World without a Passport,</hi> and these passions which hurry us headlong, we know not whither, are grounded in opinion and fancy; 'Tis not barely application of Truth from without, but se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious consideration of Truth within, must cure us; And every one perhaps will do it best, in following <hi>Cicero</hi>'s
<pb facs="tcp:50605:4"/>
way (when he could receive no comfort from his friends, upon the death of his Daughter <hi>Tullia</hi>) and compose a cordial <hi>de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solatione</hi> himself.</p>
            <p>This was the way of my cure, and this I conceive is best for every man. But he who cannot do this of himself may yet think well of that medicine, the operation whereof has been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented by the Author, and rather take his <hi>probatum est</hi> than anothers opinion; and to such do I propose my case and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations respecting it. And because the perfect knowledge of the cause may be sometimes thought as material and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary as the disease it self; and men being apt to take up that exclamation in relation thereunto,<note n="(a)" place="margin">Lament. 1.12.</note> 
               <hi>Was ever sorrow like my sorrow? &amp;c.</hi> and think another mans cause but trivial; I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent whoever sees this, should know and judge of mine.</p>
            <p>It was thus, My Ancestors having continued many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scents, possessed of a small but competent Estate, under the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of antient Gentlemen, left me the eldest, and I fear the last, of the family to struggle with, and retrive their several former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances; which my care and assiduity, with God's blessing, performed. I married the daughter of a Gentleman of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient honourable Family, and by her had several Sons and Daughters, to reap the fruit of my care, as I thought; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I was ready to say, I had all that my heart could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire. And though I might place my Affections on some other things, more than was either becoming in bare so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, or requisite in prudence; yet these stole away the strength thereof, and I took greatest complacency therein. After I began to sing this earthly <hi>Requiem</hi> to my Soul, it pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God to put some stop thereto, by taking away one or two of my children, and at length to leave me (a pledge of his mercy I trust, and not a subject for his future trial of me) one only Daughter remaining. The death of each of my children, were arrows which stuck fast in me, and pierced me sore; but the last coming on the suddain, upon the most healthful and least expected, and in the neck (as I may say) of another, made so deep a wound in my Soul, that it caused me to despise all other his worldly blessings, and to begin to question with him like <hi>Abraham,</hi> 
               <note n="(b)" place="margin">Gen. 15.2.</note> 
               <hi>Lord God what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless</hi>? Such an overflowing frothy sorrow it begat in me, that the very allaying thereof in some measure I have Reason to impute to the merciful lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kindness of a bountiful, good, and gracious God, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
<pb facs="tcp:50605:4"/>
and strengthening me. 'Tis true, there yet remain such reliques of the Disease, that whenever either the countenance, or pretty Sayings of any of my Children offer themselves to my thoughts, it causes a chillness over all my Spirits; which I look on as remediless in any one, who carries about him the least bowels of natural Affection, and such, I trust, may well consist with Grace; But I have brought it to that, that the smart is no greater than the <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Flagran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tior aequo non restat dolor ille meus, nec vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere major.</hi>
               </note> Wound requires in any one, whose bowels are not petrified, and whose heart is not wholly senseless and mortified.</p>
            <p>Next and immediately under God's grace, this cure has been thus far effected, by my own thoughts and considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (if they may be said to have been mine): And after the cure, I was willing to make them publick, that I might not <note n="(b)" place="margin">Ps. 40.10.</note> 
               <hi>hide his righteousness within my heart,</hi> or <hi>keep back his mercy and truth, but declare the same to those who come after.</hi> Indeed I cannot but here acknowledge that these thoughts or Meditations brake forth very abruptly (and it may be in many particulars blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy) from the heat within; But to hear one man speak feelingly, may sometimes work deeper impressions upon an Auditor, than another eloquently; and a poor Prisoner who has found out a way to free himself from his Fetters, may gain more attention from his discovery, than a great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor in the Art. My thoughts have been too much busied, God knows, about the World, (and besides that, my Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Profession never required Books adorned with Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick, as some of those who may chance to see this, know) to make their <hi>exit</hi> in any artificial dress: and if in a plain garb, they shall work any good Effect upon any other, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring under, or in danger to labour under, the same or the like disease; Let that person then assuredly know, that God had a design for his good, as well as mine, in my particular Affliction. And indeed such is the universal care he has of Mankind, that every one might if he would, reap some benefit in anothers loss. He who is not at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent assaulted, may yet prepare himself for a defence, and he who beholds the bruises of another may walk more carefully and <hi>take heed lest he fall.</hi> He who has lost no Children, or has none to lose, may yet see and consider the vanity of disquieting himself,<note n="(c)" place="margin">Psal. 39.6.</note> 
               <hi>in heaping up riches, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not who shall gather them.</hi> These my rude thoughts, which have eased me, may possibly incite another to more sober
<pb facs="tcp:50605:5"/>
considerations of God's Wisdom and Providence, and Man's folly. And then, I hope, that man will not blame me for thinking only according to those abilities God has given me; since every one of us will confess, that the wisest of us are but the best <hi>conjecturers,</hi> and 'tis God only that <hi>knows</hi>; and though I have thought rudely, and amiss, yet it being not willingly, I hope my want of Learning or Wisdom may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Pardon from God, and at least a charitable Censure from man.</p>
            <p>I was somewhat the rather induced to commit these my rambling Thoughts to Paper, from some hopes, that such as chance to see them would not look on them, as the Cry, or Trumpet of one that indeavours to drive men into the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary from a gainful Art, and yet stays himself without the Vail, but the genuine search and effect of trouble and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, which never finds Rest till it enters there. Here are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed some little Essays of our own sufficiency, but tending and pointing to a better Physician of our Soul and Body; to one that is able to shew us the true method of cure, and without whom, we shall never be able to find the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of any certain rule, but groap about, till wearied and fainting, and find our Errors only on the other side of our Graves.</p>

That the way to convince such is by the practice of Religion. That opposition doth often conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, that which if neglected would fall of it self, as men of sharp wits delight to find Antagonists. <hi>page 1</hi>

                  <label>EPIST. II.</label>
                  <item>Wherein he treats of the cause of action or motion under the notion of Spirit. That a Spirit conscious of its own work is durable. That the flashes, thoughts and actions of our own Spirits are often mistaken for, and applied to the operation of the Spirit of God. Four ways of Gods operation with respect to man, <hi>1.</hi> By his common Providence. <hi>2.</hi> By his merciful Providence, or restraining Grace. <hi>3.</hi> By his bountiful Providence, or common renewing grace. <hi>4.</hi> By his Spirit, or special renewing Grace. How God according to all these may be invocated. The danger of applying the operation of the Spirit to every work in man; And how fit it is to clear the mind of such Errour. Of the use of solitude in some particular Seasons, as the most ready and likely way to discover Truth. <hi>page 13</hi>

                  <label>EPIST. III.</label>
                  <item>Wherein he sets down some further grounds and Reasons of his opinion of the Mortality, or utter annihilation of the Souls of Brutes upon their death. No durable Spirit in any visible Creature but man, of Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies and Antipathies in Plants and Animals. The soul of Beasts es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential with the Body, and so subject to the same fate. The Intellect in them in its height at the first, whereas that in man is gradual. Acts peculiar to reasonable Creatures, as desire of dissolution, and volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry abstinence. The Spirit of Brutes determined by Sense. No Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb facs="tcp:50605:8"/>
besides man lays up more than is sufficient to maintain it self. We attribute greater gifts and Sagacity to mere Animals than they have, as in Ants. That there may be as much Intellect in Creatures we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse not with, as those we do. The opinion of the utter annihilation of the spirit of Brutes hath no tendency to Atheism. <hi>page 39</hi>

                  <label>EPIST. IV.</label>
                  <item>Wherein the Author Treats of man's ignorance, in his search into the most ordinary work of Nature, and concludes how much more dim-sighted we are when we look into the frame and structure of man's Soul. <hi>Solomon</hi>'s knowledge of Nature not universal; much in Nature found out accidentally. No one work of it fully to be understood. How Nature doth change in its operations. Of change in Colours, and that the variety in them is unaccountable. That there is a transcendent Wisdom ruling and appearing in all far above our reach: And so there is great Reason for caution in our enquiries or affirmations. <hi>page 60</hi>

                  <label>EPIST. V.</label>
                  <item>Wherein he further illustrates the inherent or native Power and Predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy of the Affections above the other faculties of the Soul; but more particularly treats of the Imagination, its deception in us, our miseries thereby, and the remedies against its delusion. Imagination in Brutes ariseth only from Sense; That in them receives its objects in their proper Nature; they are seldom mistaken in the face of the Heavens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they cannot revolve in their mind, or recall Imagination; Imagination in them changeth according to its objects; Imagination in us sometimes supplies the place of Reason, as in the case of Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> deceives the Affections, Imagination, and in Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with them, is the cause of Error, as in malice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The good man the only rational man. The difference 'twixt Reason and ratiocination. Reason deceives not, and is the chief principle of governing the Thoughts. The advantage of sorrow in curbing the Imagination. The Imagination subject to infection from the humours of the Body. When we are answerable for its transgressions? Thoughts cannot arise from Sense. <hi>page 68</hi>

                  <label>EPIST. VI.</label>
                  <item>Wherein he treats of the various impress of the Divine Power upon each particular created substance, much more upon the Souls of men (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is great dissimilitude) And further shews how prone we are
<pb facs="tcp:50605:8"/>
from thence to mistake in judging of the temper of others and our own. Thence he proceeds to discourse of the Nature, grounds, measure, and ends of Friendship. <hi>page 128</hi>

                  <label>EPIST. VII.</label>
                  <item>Of the different pursuits of the Souls of men, wherein we are ready to accuse each other of folly, though not our selves, and yet in a degree are all weak and foolish. That no pursuit of the Soul here, is praise-worthy or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, further than it intentionally advanceth God's glory, which is the mark set before us, and which if we do not behold in all our tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails, our labour in the issue will prove of as little profit as comfort. <hi>page 156</hi>

                  <label>EPIST. VIII.</label>
                  <item>Compleat Happiness here is merely in speculation. That natural endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Soul do conduce to the ease, peace and quiet of it, and are therefore desirable though we attain not happiness thereby. Learning and Knowledge, Wisdom, Prudence and subtilty considered. That even Prudence, the most likely conduct to Happiness was never yet the constant concomitant of the clearest human Soul. No satisfaction without the belief of a Providence. <hi>page 166</hi>

                  <item>Wherein the Author maintains a divine Wisdom, and Providence, ruling in and over the Soul of man, more especially, and more apparently (if considered) than any work of Creation: And that the Affections in the heart of man seem that part of the Soul, whereon God more especially exerciseth his Prerogative, moulding and changing them on the sudden, to his secret purposes beyond and even contrary to any foresight, conjecture, or Imagination of the Soul it self. <hi>page 185</hi>

            <head>CONSIDERATIONS AGAINST Immoderate care for a Man's own Posterity, and sorrow for the loss of Children.</head>
            <div n="1" type="section">
               <head>SECT. I. Of Afflictions in general, their Usefulness and Necessity; and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, the loss of Children considered, with the use and end of it.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE first thoughts which presented themselves to me (and what I ever before firmly believed) were these; That, first, as there is one Eternal wise God, Creator of Heaven and Earth, and all things therein; So, secondly, the same God has a care over all the works of his Creation, and continually rules, and disposes all things, according to his infinite wisdom, which act of his we call <hi>Providence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To doubt of this, were not only to deny all Scripture, and relinquish my profession of Christianity, but even to abandon my very Reason; For, from this first part of my belief, I think there are few dissenters, and although this Age affords a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>David</hi>'s jolly sanguine Fools, who at some time think otherwise in their hearts, yet those same hearts from afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, will think the same with mine, unless they have hardned them on purpose, to shut out all Deity; and since at first they would have none to serve, now they are resolved to let in none (so long as they can oppose it) to punish.</p>
               <p>As to the second part of my belief, opposed by the more moderate Atheist, I think it has, and might be made good; not only by Scripture, but Reason: Yet seeing it is not the thing, I am about to take in hand, nor whereof I doubt; let other men seek their satisfaction from more Learned hands. I, for
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50605:10"/>
my part think, that if God take care of the Sparrow, he will take care of me; and if the hairs of my head are numbred, God will not take less care about my Body, than the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scencies thereof.</p>
               <p>All that I shall say hereabout further, is, I cannot conjecture, by what new methods the Devil has brought in Proselytes for open Atheism, since his ancient method was to nooze men by Polytheism; but I am verily perswaded, that since his Trade failed him therein, and the Temples of Idols began to be thrown down, so as he could not reap so large a Crop that way; it has been none of his slightest policies, nor the least covert Trap or Ginn to take men in, to infuse slily into the brains of a number of men, (who account themselves Sages) That God has allotted the Government of Sublunary affairs, to inferiour Powers; and from hence have increased and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied, the strange opinions and notions of Fate, Destiny, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, Fortune, Chance, and the like. Now if he can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade us to ascribe to these, any sole or chief operation in our actions, he obtains by consequence, e're we are aware, what by express terms he could not so easily do; For if we attribute any ruling Power to ought else then one Eternal God, we do in effect deny such an Existence; because Unity is the insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and essential attribute of Deity, and by acknowledging more than one, we do in effect deny that there is any.</p>
               <p>I will not dispute what Influences, or benign or malevolent Aspects coelestial Bodies have over us: But this I am assured of, and am no whit afraid by God's assistance to maintain, That there is a Superior Power ruling in them, one <note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 147.4.</note> 
                  <hi>who telleth the Stars, and calleth them all by their names,</hi> that doth order and determine them according to his good will and pleasure, from whom we are to look for all our good or evil in this World. And thither it is, that the Apostle St. <hi>Iames</hi> directs us plainly, when he tells us, <note n="b" place="margin">Jam. 1.17.</note> 
                  <hi>Every good giving, and every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of Lights, with whom there is no variableness, nor shadow of turning.</hi> On which place, says one, would not any man have thought it a more proper attribute of God, for the Apostle to have said there, <hi>From God the author of all good things,</hi> or the like, then, <hi>Father of Lights?</hi> No, says he, there is something more in it: He would have us look higher than those Lights, (from whose influence so many place their good or evil) and think, they have not their wisdom from <hi>Mercury, &amp;c.</hi> And upon that

               <p>But having granted this to my self, That there is nothing happens here on Earth, but what is ordered and disposed by the first Creator, who by rooting up one, and planting ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> does, as the Psalmist says, in that ravishing subject of his providence, <note n="e" place="margin">Psal. 104.30</note> 
                  <hi>Renew the face of the Earth,</hi> my thoughts in the next place, tended unto this; whether the loss of my Children were an <hi>angry correction</hi> of God, against which, <note n="f" place="margin">Psal. 6.1. &amp; 38.1. Jer. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>24.</note> 
                  <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Ieremy</hi> so pray. If it were, I thought even then, I had little reason like a sullen Ass to lye down under the burthen, but rather to get up, and bear it with patience, lest the same Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster should lay a greater weight upon me, and not only so, but even draw forth his Sword and slay me too; nay Reason prompted me, rather to examine my self, wherein I had more chiefly provoked him to wound and pierce me through with these Darts, and to stay his hand if it were possible, not barely by a sincere repentance for the same, but a full purpose and resolution to depart from every evil way; and certainly in all God's ways and methods, this is the chief end and design, to <hi>make us wise unto Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But since as the Prophet says, <note n="g" place="margin">Psal. 36.6.</note> 
                  <hi>His righteousness is like to an high Mountain,</hi> visible to every Eye, but his <hi>Iudgments are as a great deep,</hi> past finding out, or fathoming; I thought it not good, to make too curious an enquiry thereinto, nor dive into his secrets, nor despair of his mercy and loving kindness, but to purpose and resolve of amendment, and to trust, though <note n="h" place="margin">Jer. 30.11.</note> 
                  <hi>he will not leave us altogether unpunished,</hi> yet that <hi>his correction may be in measure</hi>; and since he has been pleased to promise, <note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 8.28.</note> 
                  <hi>that every thing shall work for the good of them that love him,</hi> it may not be presumption in us to think, that whatsoever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, is not only what he sees best for us; but that we may
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50605:11"/>
turn the Perspective, and look on his Judgments sent in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, not in wrath: And, seeing he has given us the grace to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it is his doing, we may therefore conclude with <hi>Manoah</hi>'s Wife, <hi>If he were pleased to kill us,</hi> 
                  <note n="k" place="margin">Judg. 13.23.</note> 
                  <hi>he would not have shewed us these things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now first, let us look on afflictions, losses, crosses, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, in general so termed, and see whether there be such evil in them, as men generally opine. Indeed so wonderful are the goods of affliction, as <note n="l" place="margin">
                     <hi>Bacon</hi> in his Essays.</note> one of the learnedst of our Nation has highly admired <hi>Seneca</hi> for that saying of his, <hi>Bona rerum secundarum optabilia, adversarum mirabilia</hi>; That the good things that belong to prosperity are to be wished, but the good things which belong to adversity, are to be admired: And indeed although the Apostle tells us, that <note n="m" place="margin">Hebr. 12.11.</note> 
                  <hi>no affliction for the present is joyous, but grievous</hi>; yet if we look (as wise men should) upon the end, we shall find cause to glory in tribulation, <note n="n" place="margin">Rom. 5.3, 4, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>knowing</hi> (as its said) <hi>that tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience, and experience hope, and hope maketh not ashamed.</hi> Now if from tribulation, as the first seed sown, there is once grown up in us, a well-grounded hope, and our <note n="o" place="margin">Rom. 8.20.</note> 
                  <hi>subjection to vanity</hi> becomes a subjection in hope, we shall <note n="p" place="margin">Vers. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>reckon the sufferings of this present life, not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us</hi>; then have we got on an <note n="q" place="margin">Ephes. 6.17.</note> 
                  <hi>Helmet,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it; then have we an <note n="r" place="margin">Hebr. 6.19.</note>

                  <hi>rejoycing</hi> (as he terms it) <hi>in hope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> (stiled the man after God's own heart) could find <note n="t" place="margin">Psal. 23.4.</note> 
                  <hi>comfort in his rod and his staff,</hi> and was both sensible of the goods of <note n="u" place="margin">Psal. 119 67, 71, &amp; 75.</note> 
                  <hi>affliction,</hi> and that God out of very <hi>faithfulness</hi> sends it. But beside these Cordials to be extracted; Adversity has other natural fruits, and is a School, wherein more have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited many ways, than Prosperity; it is indeed the fire most apt to refine the whole nature of man, and take off those drossie humours, which disquiet the mind. We shall find lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, either purity or virtue, in our settled Waters; there must be certain seasons, for the Angel of affliction to come down and trouble us, like the Pool of <hi>Bethesda,</hi> before virtue shall arise from us. It is a common old Fable (but has a good Moral) of the Wager between the Wind and the Sun, which should soonest rob the wayfaring man of his Cloak; all the stormy blasts which came from the first, made him but to hold it the faster, and closer to him; but the bright shining rays of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50605:11"/>
the later, did so insensibly melt him, that he was forced to throw it off, and expose himself as it were naked to danger: Our moral virtues are our coverings, which we embrace in adversity, and cast off in prosperity. It has been observed, that <hi>Rome</hi> never had braver, or better men, than at that time, when <hi>Hannibal</hi> stood before the Walls. And the best man of <hi>Rome</hi> (if we may take the Oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi>'s word for it) <hi>Scipio Nasica,</hi> did afterwards oppose <hi>Cato</hi> in open Senate, against the razing of <hi>Carthage,</hi> for this very reason, that it might stand as a bridle against <hi>Rome</hi>'s exorbitances; since peace and prosperity, would as well destroy them, as it had done other Nations, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the <hi>Persians, Graecians, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And although prosperity was the blessing promised in the Old Testament, and God's peculiar people the <hi>Iews,</hi> possessed in peace a Land flowing with Milk and Honey, and <note n="x" place="margin">Deut. 6.11.</note> 
                  <hi>Houses full of all good things, which they filled not, Wells digged which they digged not, and Vineyards and Olive-trees which they planted not</hi>; that Kings bowed down unto them, and their Posterity mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied like the Sand of the Sea: yet not only <hi>David,</hi> who had his particular affliction in his Children, tells us 'tis good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but in the full height of their prosperity, his Son <hi>Solomon,</hi> their most flourishing King, who enjoyed as many worldly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, as any man whatsoever, and wanted none of those things, the World calls felicities; when he had considered all things, and sufficiently described the vanity thereof, and told us they are not only vanity, but vexation of Spirit; he gives adversity (as we term it) the preheminence, and tells us, that <note n="y" place="margin">Eccles. 7.2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3, &amp; 4.</note> 
                  <hi>it is better to go to the house of mourning, than to the house of feasting</hi>; that <hi>sorrow is better than laughter</hi>; that <hi>the heart of the wise man is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools in the house of mirth. Solomon</hi> has, in the Christian part of the World, obtained the reputation of Wise, and surely we may justifie him in these sayings to the residue of it; if men would consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the nature and quality of each of these kind of passions apart. For joy or mirth (Worldly) is a dilatation or relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the faculties of the Soul, and so, apt to loosen or slacken the reins of Reason, and give the Soul a free range over the World and Worldly objects; when as, sorrow is a summoning of them into the heart, holds them in for a time, draws, and contracts again the reins of Reason, and, unless it degenerate into fearful despair, never breaks them, but has at length a kind of inward joy to accompany it: so as, if <hi>in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50605:12"/>
laughter the heart may be sorrowful,</hi> (which I doubt not many have experimented) men want but the contrary motion, or sorrow barely and simply, without other ingredient, to expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, that in tears, the heart may be joyful.</p>
               <p>If we descend to the New Testament, which is our chief Tenure, there we find no benediction on prosperity, but the contrary; and a wiser than <hi>Solomon,</hi> our Saviour himself, (whom the Scriptures term to be <hi>vir dolorum</hi>) in his Sermon on the Mount, begins with a blessing on adversities, <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 5.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted</hi>; and <note n="b" place="margin">Luk. 6.21.</note> 
                  <hi>Blessed are ye that weep now, for ye shall laugh</hi>; nay in <hi>mundo pressura,</hi> hath been thought so sure a mark of a Christian, that some of the Ancient Fathers and Saints, have earnestly prayed for it, and have been ready to doubt of their Sonship for want of <note n="c" place="margin">Hebr. 12.8.</note> 
                  <hi>chastisement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Prosperity it self, is in no kind exempt from vexation of Spirit; neither <hi>Solomon</hi>'s great Estate, nor his honour, nor his very increase in wisdom excused him; even there he found, the <note n="d" place="margin">Eccles. 1.18.</note> 
                  <hi>increase of knowledge</hi> to be the <hi>increase of sorrow.</hi> Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity at the best, has its cares, and its troubles, its anxious thoughts and fears, and there we are generally our own Lictors and Tormentors. And when we once take up the Cross in that sence, and become our own Executioners upon the Rack, we can find no Physician to fly to, but <note n="e" place="margin">Psal. 39.6.</note> 
                  <hi>disquiet our selves in vain,</hi> as the Psalmist says; whereas, whenever the Cross is laid on us, we have recourse to God, the Physician of our Souls, who is ready to sweeten and allay those troubles, he sees not fit, wholly to remove: And indeed the one is the ready cure of the other, and often, I doubt not, in mercy sent, to take us off from afflicting our selves, and to teach us to throw down that burthen which is so heavy, and take up his, which in comparison thereof, through his gracious and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful assistance, is <hi>light and easie.</hi> So true is that of <hi>David,</hi> 
                  <note n="f" place="margin">2 Sam. 24.14.</note> 
                  <hi>'tis bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to fall into the hands of God, than into the hands of men,</hi> whether others, or our selves.</p>
               <p>Having somewhat considered Afflictions in general, my next step was, to descend to the particular loss of Children, who, being the express Image of our selves, and in whom we expect to live after we are dead, are most apt to creep insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly into our hearts, and to steal away the strength of our affections from all other objects; wherefore the loss of them usually works so deeply upon us, that thereupon we are ready
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50605:12"/>
to think, God is very angry with us, and that therefore he will blot out our name and memorial from off the face of the Earth. Yet as in Afflictions in general, so in this here, I thought it not amiss for every one, who professes himself a Christian, to look in the first place, how far Children are, or may be as a blessing to us. These we find in the front of blessings in the Old Testament, <note n="g" place="margin">Gen. 1.28.</note> 
                  <hi>Be fruitful and multiply,</hi> which is also repeated to <note n="h" place="margin">Gen. 9.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Noah</hi> immediately after the Floud; and <hi>Abraham</hi> is brought to look on the Stars, and told, <note n="i" place="margin">Gen. 15.5.</note> 
                  <hi>so shall thy seed be.</hi> Fruitfulness in this kind is all along promised as the reward of a virtuous life, and <note n="k" place="margin">Gen. 20.18 2 Sam. 6.23.</note> 
                  <hi>barrenness</hi> pronounced as a curse, and the taking away a mans posterity, the severest Judgment, (not only all, Male and Female, but even Male alone, as that of <hi>interficiam de Ahab mingentem ad parietem</hi> 
                  <note n="l" place="margin">1 King. 21.21.</note>) as may be seen, by the destruction of the <note n="m" place="margin">Exod. 12.29.</note> First-born throughout the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in the case of <note n="n" place="margin">1 Sam. 2.33, 34.</note> 
                  <hi>Ely, Ahab,</hi> and others. Yet even during the Law and the Prophets, beside the instances in that particular affliction laid on good men, as <hi>Iob</hi> and others; <hi>David</hi> himself, who had as large a promise as any man, for the continuance of his posterity on an Earthly Throne, did not look upon it, as the only special mark of God's favour: For in that 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Psalm, where he speaks of the men of this World, who have their portion in this life; he says of them, <note n="o" place="margin">Psal. 17.14.</note> 
                  <hi>they are full of Children,</hi> or <hi>have Children at their desire, and leave the rest of their substance for their babes.</hi> And his Son <hi>Solomon,</hi> the wisest of men, has made a counterpoize of that Earthly gift, whether they are given us as a blessing always, or as a punishment; for if <note n="p" place="margin">Pro. 10.1.</note> 
                  <hi>a wise Son make a glad Father, a foolish one is the heaviness of his mother,</hi> and <note n="q" place="margin">Pro. 17.21, 25.</note> 
                  <hi>Father</hi> too: And even in that sense, his saying may be verified, that <hi>if a man beget an hundred Children, and live many years, yet an untimely birth is better than he.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in the New Testament, where we claim as Legatees only, we find no promises of the inheritance of an Earthly Kingdom, or Children to inherit it, but are rather comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Christ, to <hi>forsake all to follow him, to set our affections on things above</hi>; with this threatning caution, that <note n="r" place="margin">Mat. 10.37.</note> 
                  <hi>he that loves father or mother, more than me, is not worthy of me; and he that loves son or daughter more than me, is not worthy of me</hi>: nay St. <hi>Luke</hi> uses the word <note n="s" place="margin">Luk. 14.26.</note> 
                  <hi>hate</hi> in the case of comparison; and 'tis obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable that those who seemed to express it as a happiness in our very Saviour's parent, with this acclamation, <note n="t" place="margin">Luk. 11.27.</note> 
                  <hi>Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps that gave thee suck,</hi> received a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50605:13"/>
very short and sharp reply from him. And indeed this ought above all things to be our Sovereign comfort in this affliction of loss of Children, that <note n="u" place="margin">Rom. 8.32.</note>

               <p>And now if this severe punishment be no sign of God's for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking us, but may be taken as a Fatherly correction as well as others, why then should we not look on it, as an Alarm to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance? An intent to wean us from the World, and make us yield up our hearts, and place our affections on that true ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of love, himself? An invitation to more fixed joys then this World affords, to find out, and taste, and see, how good and gracious he is?</p>

                  <hi>resignation</hi> of our will to that of the Divine power. According to that saying of <hi>Iudas Maccabeus,</hi> 
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Mac. 3.60.</note> 
                  <hi>Nevertheless as the will of God in Heaven is, so let him do</hi>; or that of good old <hi>Ely,</hi> 
                  <note n="g" place="margin">1 Sam. 3.18.</note> 
                  <hi>It is the Lord, let him do what seemeth him good.</hi> Indeed our little knowledge as Children, might properly acquiesce in God our Father's infinite wisdom; since we our selves would take it as a character of stubborn wilfulness from our own, not to do the like, between whom, and us, there is not so vast a disparity.</p>
               <p>And God beside his written Precepts to instruct us, has given to most of us, so much natural light and knowledge, as a spark from his infinite wisdom, though not to comprehend him, yet to admire him: And though the knowledge that he hath given us, does in some sort quicken our sufferings, by discussing all natural dulness, and stupefaction upon every event; yet our reason is not given us only, to argue our selves into sorrow, nor purposely to <note n="*" place="margin">Eccles. 1.18.</note> 
                  <hi>increase</hi> it by our knowledge, according to the wise man's Essay thereof, but to bend and incline our wills by its dictates. For though they are free faculties (and <note n="h" place="margin">Rom. 7.18.</note> 
                  <hi>to will is present with us</hi>) not to be forced, yet thereby they may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to yield, and surrender up themselves, and cease to be in a manner. Now does not reason dictate this to us? That when we do see a will working contrary to ours, and which there is no <note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 9.19.</note> 
                  <hi>resisting,</hi> that our commissionated wills should cease, and yield themselves up in the presence of the greater, and not combate with God's will, contrary to our daily prayer: And indeed our Saviour (besides that form of prayer to direct us) has given us a most excellent pattern thereof, <note n="k" place="margin">Luk. 22.42.</note> 
                  <hi>Nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This intire, perfect, and absolute resignation of our wills to the free working of an infinite wisdom, and uncontroulable po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, is a thing we cannot deny in very reason: And it is so co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>essential
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50605:14"/>
to our content and happiness here, that the one can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver really subsist without the other. But because in opposition to it, there happen often strong reluctancies of flesh and bloud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to calm and quiet that, we may do well, not only to consider God's wisdom, and goodness in his Elections for us: But,</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Our folly in our Elections and choices for our selves: We cannot in reason deny, but that in truth all outward goods are rather imaginary than real; and if so, we vainly place our affections thereon, and falsly think our selves happy in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment. Let us take but a view of all the goods this World affords, and we shall find them truly reduced to these three heads, <hi>Bona animi, Bona corporis,</hi> and <hi>Bona fortunae</hi>; and those of Fortune, we shall ever find, amongst wise men, placed in the foot of the Inventory, as the last, and least necessary towards man's happy being; because, without them, we have all those goods which go to the composition of a perfect man, Soul and Body: and the Apostle remembring us, that <note n="l" place="margin">1 Tim. 6.7, 8.</note> 
                  <hi>we brought nothing into this world,</hi> and how <hi>sure</hi> it is <hi>we can carry nothing out,</hi> advises us to be <hi>content with food and rayment,</hi> as the only necessary things of keeping the Soul and Body united together with their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral goods in this World; as if, these were only the pursuit and prey of reason, and the other of imagination. For the goods of our mind, <hi>viz.</hi> our natural dispositions, as promptness of wit, quickness of conceipt, fastness of memory, clearness of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, soundness of Judgment, readiness of Speech, and the like; As also the goods of our body, <hi>viz.</hi> beauty, strength, or the like, being the gifts of God with the very form of us, they become our own as it were by Birth, are inherent in us, and grow up together with us; for we might be said to have them in our very Infancy, <hi>in potentia,</hi> and so in right reason we might look for them, and endeavour to improve and preserve them as our own, and be sensible of the loss, as a proper part of our selves. But the goods of Fortune, amongst which Children are reckoned, are of an after distinct acquisition or grant, and so, not so properly our own, nor in truth therefore so much to be valued by us. Now why the loss of an accidental acquisition, or gift external and extrinsick to the mind and body both, should raise greater storms, and work more upon the mind, then the loss of its own goods, or the Bodies, wherein it resides or cohabits, would receive some disquisition; and as it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver happen otherways than by false Opticks, so must be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to folly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:50605:14"/>Surely the Soul of man is out of its proper Region, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes regardless not only of it self, but its present Mansion too in some sort, by its struggling to unite it self again to somewhat out of the Body, from which it is at present disjoyn'd, and would settle and take up its rest in somewhat, it knows not what at present, for want of a renewing of its light, or at least a dissipation of those mists and foggs which arise before it from the Body. Well, it is agreed by some of the ancient and most learned Philosophers, as well as Divines, that it has not its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal from any of the four Elements, but is immediately from Heaven, and breathed into us from the Almighty, whereby we become in a sort after his similitude and likeness. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore until that Soul return to God who gave it, it can never be in perfect and true complacency, but being inclosed in a Body of flesh, has only now and then (besides the hope and assurance of a perpetual rest hereafter) some little delights as in a weary Pilgrimage. Now according as this lump of Earth will suffer, it finds out its several pleasures, which we properly call, <hi>terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas consolatiunculas</hi>; which are as various, as there are objects in the World, and these are pointed out to us, by a roving and wandring fancy or imagination, (especially as to outward things) according to our cloudy constitution and frame; not that there is any more real good in one of them, than another, but that we accept it so, from our fancies dictates. The Poet has, methinks, very well described this various roving fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of ours, in matter of our delights, and begins his Book with, <hi>Sunt, quos curriculo pulverem Olympicum Collegisse juvat, &amp;c.</hi> And truly he might have filled a large Volume, with inserting the various vain joys and pleasures of men: For as to outward things, there is such a dissonancy therein, as that there might be found out, a <hi>Sunt quos</hi> for every thing under the Sun. Otherwise a man would wonder to see some persons as fond of their Dogs, Monkeys, and Parrots, as of their Children, and have made as sad lamentation for the loss of them. And certainly, though I for my own part, should never agree to stay with the <note n="m" place="margin">— <hi>Manet sub Iove frigido Venator, tenerae conjugis immemor.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Hunter</hi> in that first Ode of <hi>Horace,</hi> yet, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, such an one might wonder almost as much at me, (as I at him) to see me play with a Child, or to place any exuberant affection thereon, since the one, no more than the other, doth add to a man any thing of real worth.</p>
               <p>Now since all outward things please, <hi>quatenus</hi> fancy or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination approves or dictates, why should not I by reason en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50605:15"/>
to stop the current of my fancy? Why should I be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed, or almost distracted, for the loss of that very thing, which many wise men have not only contentedly wanted, but desired to want? Our imagination will never find out the <hi>sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum bonum</hi> here, which Philosophers so much talked of, and never found themselves. For surely if there were any thing here on Earth truly good, it would be universally desired of all men; which no one thing, which is perfectly to be attained to in this World, ever was; and as to these goods of Fortune, (as we call them and define them) surely in the general opinion of men, Children are the least desirable. The <hi>Italians</hi> (it has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served) make no difference between Children and Nephews, and near Kinsfolk: And, so as they be of the same lump with themselves, they are not desirous their particular Bodies should be the Conduits of them. And, amongst us we daily see men more forward to venture their Bodies (and their Souls too, often) for the obtaining of Riches and Honours, than for Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and a great Dowry, though with assured barrenness, shall be sooner courted by most, than the bare promising hope of a fruitful Stock. So that doubtless in relation to the loss of the one, and the other, as well as to the obtaining, the Poet might (though I have wondred at the expression, as disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with my temper) speak the <note n="n" place="margin">
                     <hi>Majore domus gemitu, majore tumultu Planguntur nummi, quam funera.</hi>

                  </q>
Certainly there is little honour, if we consider it, in barely being Fathers: If the care of perpetuity possesses any man's thoughts, he should endeavour to raise that structure, in some nobler acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than Generation, which is common with him, not only to the meanest Man, but the Beast; nay inanimate Plants have a peculiar property of bringing forth Seeds, and Fruits according to their kind. The <note n="o" place="margin">Luk. 8 15.</note> 
                  <hi>fruit</hi> a Christian Soul should endeavour <hi>to bring forth,</hi> is by <hi>hearing the Word and keeping it</hi>: This is it, on which Christ pronounceth a blessing, rather then on the womb that bare himself, and the Paps that gave him suck. We should beget and travail in birth like St. <hi>Paul,</hi> which will prove a more lasting monument and glory to us, than our Children: For even in very inanimate Bodies, that Tree which becomes a beam or rafter in the Temple, is of greater esteem and value, than one from whose slips or seeds, have proceeded a thousand branches.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>our Children continue like Olive-plants about our Table</hi>; have we any assurance there may not spring up from themselves a Bramble, that may quite hide and deface all their beauty; or from others, that shall choak and wither them? And if we did consider it, have we not as much reason to weep over them, when we enjoy them, as <hi>Xerxes</hi> had over his Army, to think we were the certain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailers of miseries, as well as death upon our Children; and might we not think our selves happy to see them have finished their course, and be at rest before us? Is there any of us, now the time is past, would not have thought our King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, more happy in following his Sons to the Grave, than to have left them to be murther'd by their own Uncle; with the loss of thousands of others, and the danger of his Kingdom? This was a Judgment not so remote, but that his own Queen saw it. And were there an exact Chronology of every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from their first Plantation; the highest now, might rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily find, how likely they are to fade and wither away in time: For doubtless as the poorest Beggar might derive himself from Kings, so must the greatest Monarch too, from a Beggar; and this, from the wise providence of him, <note n="r" place="margin">Psal. 113.7, 8.</note> 
                  <hi>that taketh up the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple out of the dust, and lifteth the poor out of the dunghill, that he may set them with Princes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It has been already well observed of the greatest Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs, that have thought not only to make themselves, but their Issue too, Masters of the World; that neither <note n="s" place="margin">Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> in his Preface to the History of the World.</note> 
                  <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, Persia, Aegypt, Syria, Macedon, Carthage,</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> have either fruit, flower, graft, or leaf remaining of those Seeds. Indeed it pleases God in few Ages so to transplant, and metamorphose all Nations; that notwithstanding all our Histories and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogies, we shall quickly be at a loss and confusion, and as if Heaven and Earth were to pass away, and not one jot or tittle of his Word; it has, and will be verified, <hi>that the Name of the wicked</hi> (for some have so been of every Family) <hi>shall perish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Iews</hi> themselves, God's peculiar people, (whose Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy the Pen of the Holy Ghost has for many Ages descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed) though yet possibly some of them will vaunt, of their direct descent from Kings, yet further than Christ's day, their Father <hi>Abraham</hi> would scarce rejoyce to see; but might rather

have been troubled, and wept over them (as Christ over <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>) to have foreseen them a miserable people, hated of all Nations, and dispersed and scattered over the face of the whole World.</p>
               <p>The memory of our first Ancestors of this Nation is already lost with us, and ours shall be lost with our Successors, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding any care of perpetuities. And the wise Preacher's saying will hold true, that as <note n="t" place="margin">Eccles. 1.11.</note> 
                  <hi>there is no remembrance of former things,</hi> so, <hi>neither shall there be any remembrance of things to come, with those that come after</hi>; for though <note n="u" place="margin">Vers. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>the Earth abides for ever,</hi> yet <hi>one generation passes away, and another comes.</hi> Which is true, even of all Creatures: for let a man for one ordinary Age, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it in the generation of Beasts, and be as careful as he can, to preserve a breed; he shall find (as to locality or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) so quick an extinction, that he need not wonder at the fate of the white Hens, or Laurel with the <hi>Caesars,</hi> but may see that every Soyl quickly loses its Inhabitant, and as if the Earth were weary of the same Creatures for any long continuance, (as 'tis experimented she is of Seeds) we all so pass away, as, at least, <hi>the place knoweth us no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as if God were more particularly angry with us, in thinking by generation to get us a name, he has to industrious builders in that way, usually sent a more speedy confusion than others; whereof every one might find instances in his own, and others times: if not, our last <hi>Henry</hi> may suffice; or <hi>Herod</hi> the Great, who although he had many Wives together, and a numerous Issue, besides Brothers, Sisters, Nephews, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet <note n="x" place="margin">Josephus de Antiq.

               <p>Now let a man seriously consider, how some of the very Heathen loved Virtue for it self, and admired it in its native dress; and how little she allures us, when she is daily presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us, adorned with the promises of a Temporal, and of an Everlasting happiness: When notwithstanding the terrors and threats of the Lord on the one hand, and the alluring passionate invitations on the other, we do provoke, and as it were challenge God to strike, by the most trivial acts which profit us nothing: And he will find little reason to wonder at his stripes, unless that they are so mild and so few. Of which, although every man can keep a perfect Inventory, and is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to declare them with enhansement and aggravation; yet if he be questioned of the causes, his sins, he would be forced to answer with <hi>David</hi>'s exclamation, <note n="g" place="margin">Psal. 19.12.</note> 
                  <hi>who knoweth how oft he offendeth?</hi> And can any man expect, even in this World, to separate God's two great attributes of Justice, and Mercy? Indeed the latter is here in this World usually <note n="h" place="margin">Psal. 145.9.</note> 
                  <hi>above all his works,</hi> and 'tis <note n="i" place="margin">Lam. 3.22.</note> 
                  <hi>his mercies that we are not consumed</hi>; but if we would separate them, 'tis best for us to feel his Justice in our life, and his Mercy at our death.</p>
               <p>Let us I say consider our own deservings, and we shall find
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50605:17"/>
but little reason for complaint, but may well cry out, <note n="k" place="margin">Micah 7.9.</note> 
                  <hi>I will bear the indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against him.</hi> Are not all his Temporal blessings on condition? and shall we be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed at the loss, when we voluntarily commit the forfeiture? If we sell our Inheritance for a Mess of Pottage here, or a less thing, we should rather grieve, and be troubled at our own fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, than our want. Let us turn our thoughts upon the first cause, which is indeed the right way of cure, and instead of being grieved at our loss, be grieved at our sins, the causes of our loss; and there I suppose it will be no offence, to wish with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, our <note n="l" place="margin">Jer. 9.1.</note> 
                  <hi>heads fountains of tears.</hi> This will prove the properest method for our cure, to try to effect it by diversion, or revul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and by pouring out our tears for our sins or provocations, stop the perpetual dropping and distillation of our losses.</p>
               <p>Besides our general, let us search out our particular provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations: I am perswaded there are but few men, but, with a very little search, might find our their sins, in their very pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar sufferings; I do not mean only where their sufferings are the very native consequent effect of their sins, (as pain is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from Intemperance, and poverty from Riot) but in the case of God's more immediate hand, as the <hi>death of Relations and Friends</hi>; whether we even in reference to them, have perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med our duties as we ought; whether we have been true Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and true Friends, in respect of their Eternal welfare; or at least, whether we have not rather loved them for our own sake, than his, and rejoyced more in the gift, than in the giver. I have often thought on that saying, storied of Cardinal <hi>Woolsey</hi> when he was arrested for his Tryal, That <hi>if he had taken so much care and diligence to please his God, as he had done his King and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster he would not then have left him in his old age.</hi> And I am sure, did but any of us place his affections aright, and take delight and complacency in the Author and giver, as much as in the gift, we should never find such perturbation in the loss of the latter, but comfort our selves in this, that we yet enjoy him, who is able to give us all things: Nay we that have lost our Children, or perhaps some of us that never had any, have yet had thoughts or desires, our Families should endure for ever, and would have our Lands called after our own Names; and it is but just therefore, we should have no <note n="m" place="margin">Psal. 49.13.</note> 
                  <hi>posterity to praise our</hi> (foolish) <hi>sayings.</hi> Perhaps we have like St. <hi>Peter,</hi> said, <hi>It is good to be here,</hi> (and wot not neither what we said) and have had thoughts of building Tabernacles; and therefore are our
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50605:17"/>
Houses become desolate. When we have directions on whom to cast our cares, when we have had instructions or informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of another Kingdom, and another Inheritance, with cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions not to set our affections on this: when we love our Wife, or Children better then Christ, shall we think our selves wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of him? No; It is rather fit, if we forsake not them, they should forsake us, that we might follow him; and since we cannot, or will not wean our selves, God should wean us, and embitter our delights we so much lowe after.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And now, if the sight of our viciousness does not, yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the very goodness of God might put a stop to the current of our passions, from the consideration in the last place, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding our sins, <hi>our remaining enjoyments yet, surmount our sufferings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To convince us in this, there needs nothing but a recolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or rubbing up of our memories; which indeed are like to Tables of Brass, covered over with dust; whereon, all the benefits we receive from God, we write with our Fingers, and all his chastisements we engrave with <hi>aqua fortis,</hi> that it may eat deep enough; and in the doing the one, quite wipe away the other. Otherwise the multitude of those slighter chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, might keep us from complaint, nay they would so fill up the Table, as that there would be no room left for the other: That <note n="n" place="margin">Psal. 51.1.</note> 
                  <hi>multitudo misericordiarum,</hi> as the Psalmist calls it, would so fill us, as that we should turn our Psalm of <hi>Deus ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionum,</hi> or <hi>Domine ne in furore,</hi> into <hi>Benedic anima mea,</hi> and cry out, <note n="o" place="margin">Psal. 103.2.</note> 
                  <hi>Praise the Lord, O my Soul, and forget not all his benefits.</hi> Indeed in this notion we may extoll his attribute of Mercy above all the rest, without hurting our selves; and if we knew in what particular to begin, I am sure we knew not where to make an end of God's bounties towards us; but that has been so well particularized by divers Pens, that every man may find enough to satifie himself. I for my part, in general have cause to bless God with <hi>Iacob,</hi> and say, (though I cannot say <hi>I am become two bands</hi>) that, <note n="p" place="margin">Gen. 32.1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>I am unworthy of the least of all the mercies, and the truth which he has shewed me</hi>; and in particular, amongst the multitude of blessings I still enjoy, I have this ready at hand: That he has given me, and yet left me, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort, so every way virtuous, and so helpful a sharer in my sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, that without ostentation, or just cause of reply, she might well put the same question to me, that <hi>Elkanah</hi> did to <hi>Hannah,</hi> 
                  <note n="q" place="margin">1 Sam. 1.8.</note> 
                  <hi>Am not I better to thee then ten Sons?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:50605:18"/>Now if any other man want that blessing, I am sure he may joyn with me in thanks for this, (for the dead do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain) that he is yet living, and on this side the Grave, which is the sole benefit that renders him capable of either having, or desiring. Indeed adversity has made many men <hi>Stoicks</hi> in words, and to commend death to us, but I doubt upon tryal, every man would find Satan the truer Naturalist, <note n="r" place="margin">Job 2.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Skin for Skin, and all that a man has, will he give for life.</hi> And if I should so far Catechize any man as to ask him, to what end he was created; I suppose the answer would be, to serve God, and save his own Soul. Now so long as he enjoys all those helps and means, which tend to the end for which he was created, he has little reason to complain. But if there be any man, <note n="s" place="margin">Job 3.21, 22.</note> 
                  <hi>that longs for death, more then hid treasure, and rejoyces to find the grave,</hi> and thinks that <hi>there only the weary are at rest:</hi> yet until he obtains that desire, if he have but <hi>reason</hi> left him, (which is the gift of God too as well any thing) he would hardly cast that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, and be willing to part with it, to save or regain all his other lading, however he might value it before his losses.</p>
               <p>But to descend to any mans particular losses: It is a rule, that every privation presupposes a habit, and from that every man may find reason with <hi>Iob</hi> to be content, and <hi>bless God;</hi> since he that <hi>takes away,</hi> first <hi>gave.</hi> 'Tis true the word <hi>habit,</hi> in no good sence, is made the phrase of the World: Every one can look upon his tenure of <hi>Habenda &amp; tenenda,</hi> without the premisses of <hi>dedi &amp; concessi</hi>; but <note n="t" place="margin">James 1.17.</note> St. <hi>Iames</hi> calleth those <hi>gifis,</hi> which the Heathens called <hi>habits</hi>; and we ought to look upon all our goods as gifts. This was the voice of <hi>Iacob</hi> upon his Brother's question, (when he saw the Women and Children) who are those with thee? <note n="u" place="margin">Gen 33.5.</note> 
                  <hi>The Children which God hath graciously given thy Servant;</hi> though <hi>Esau</hi>'s reply, in case of the Cattel, only was, <note n="x" place="margin">Vers. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>I have enough my Brother,</hi> without reference to the gift. St. <hi>Paul</hi> joyns the having and receiving together, <note n="y" place="margin">1 Cor. 4 7.</note> 
                  <hi>What hast thou, that thou didst not receive?</hi> Let us interrogate our selves with St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s question, and likewise whether concerning al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all goods of Fortune, (as I may call them, because it was the old denomination) there was not a time, when we wanted them, and were content without them; and when we have so done, and looked for what is left, we shall find a remnant, perhaps a surplusage of enjoyments; for there is not the meanest person but hath plenteous enjoyment. In the case of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50605:18"/>
privation by death, there are but few that lose a Friend, but may reckon too, they have lost an Enemy; which may be in some sence accounted a benefit: and certainly there are but few, from whom God has taken a Child, but he has before taken away some Relation from the same person, who living, might have interposed between him and his (it may be most delightful) enjoyment. And can we be content to part with the one, but on no terms to be deprived of the other? Shall others make room for us, and ours none for others, whom per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps God has designed to advance, by our seeming loss? And shall we make our Eye evil, because his is good to others; who is Judge of all the Earth, and as the Psalmist says, <hi>pulleth one down, and setteth up another?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But admit we cannot, or will not, see our enjoyments else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, yet God is so gracious to us, that they may be found even in our very sufferings, and we might even in them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce. What greater cause of joy can any man have, than that it hath pleased God to make him instrumental, in adding Saints unto his Kingdom of Heaven? and undoubtedly such are all Children baptized and dying before wilful sin. So as a man in this case, might make the like reply to any one who should pity him, as <hi>Cornelia</hi> Mother of the <hi>Gracchi,</hi> after the loss of all her Children, twelve in number, did to her condolers; <hi>That none could account her an unhappy woman, who had born the</hi> Gracchi <hi>into the World.</hi> And 'tis a right rational inference for us to conclude, that we are no ways unhappy, by the translation of our Children into Glory, where they are at rest, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the evil to come. But this happiness is the peculiar prospect of a Soul disjoyned from the Body, and through the casement of the Flesh, introduces but a weak and faint light: and therefore let us endeavour to look every way for comfort. And having considered seriously, as I said, 1. God's wisdom for us in our choices, and our follies in our own Elections. 2. That the very foundation of our sorrow, we thus build on, is but Straw and Stubble; and 3. That notwithstanding our sins are the cause of all. 4. That we have yet left us variety of Worldly objects, sufficiently pleasant and comfortable, (if we would but make them so) not only to support us from faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but also to go on rejoycing in this our Journey: Let us not, by moaning, or lowing after what we least need, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relish all our other (more necessary) comforts; expecially, let us not take up <hi>Iacob</hi>'s resolution, of <note n="z" place="margin">Gen. 37.35.</note> 
                  <hi>going down into the grave
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50605:19"/>
mourning, and refuse to be comforted.</hi> That resolution of, <hi>noluit consolari,</hi> applied to <hi>Rachel,</hi> is, in my opinion, a stubborn tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and methinks every one who is diseased in mind, should as readily seek out, and hearken after all means of cure, as if he were diseased of body, (unless his Reason be infected too) because, of the two, the wise man concludes the first is harder to bear <note n="*" place="margin">Prov. 18.14.</note>. And therefore, although I thought the foregoing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations of force enough, (if duly applied) to put a stop to this head-strong passion of sorrow; yet I was willing to search and try all ways and means to be thought on, for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, and look into, and examine every usual prescribed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote against it.</p>

               <head>SECT. III. Of the Nature and Origine of Sorrow: That the rise of all Passions is from Love; this particularly demonstrated in that of Sorrow.</head>
               <p>IN order to which, I did in my troubled thoughts endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, as to define <hi>Sorrow,</hi> what it is; so, to find out the right and true origine thereof, and other turbulent passions of our mind. I think it has been truly defined, that Sorrow (with the rest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) is <hi>Animi commotio, aversa à recta ratione, contra na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turam</hi>: And so they are not natural, but consequential (as I may say) from somewhat that is good, implanted in our nature, although misguided and mislead. For that God, who is goodness, and has attested every particle of his Creation to be very good, would not naturally implant in us our turbulent passions, which are evil. But they are raised by our <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Has perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones, stultitia quasi quasdam emittit furias.</hi>

                  <hi>follies</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in forsaking <hi>that Good,</hi> with respect to which we were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Now <hi>that Good</hi> is God, and God being <hi>Love,</hi> (as St. <hi>Iohn</hi> has defined him) has in us, <hi>his Image,</hi> naturally implanted Love, the tendency of which should be chiefly towards him, and all other his Creatures in reference to him. And this is the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of our whole duty, and that great natural Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of which the Law and the Prophets are but the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Explanation.</p>
               <p>But this natural plant of Love, rooted in us from our Birth, and growing in us, necessarily finds out some object or other, whereon to lodge its branches, and to be the support and prop thereof: which, if it be wholly or chiefly lodged upon some Worldly object, the decay and fall of that object, leaves it
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50605:19"/>
withering on the ground, and this is <hi>Sorrow.</hi> But if it fix it self aright, and spread its branches over mankind in general, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it may more especially lean on some one or more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars; yet, those failing, it holds it self fresh and verdant, and obtains the blessed title of Charity, whose property is, <note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 13.7.</note> 
                  <hi>to bear all things, and to endure all things</hi>: so as I cannot define immoderate sorrow to be other, than <hi>a drooping withering love,</hi> or <hi>the spurious off-spring of a misguided love, in the absence of perfect love and charity.</hi> Neither can I resemble the product thereof, to any more proper thing, than <hi>Esau</hi>'s Vine, mentioned of God's planting, <note n="c" place="margin">Isa. 5.2.</note> 
                  <hi>who looked it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes</hi>; that which is planted in us for joy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, when mislead produces only misery and sorrow.</p>
               <p>Now if in holding this natural Love, mislead (or rather misguided) by opinion and fancy, to be the source of all our evils whatsoever, and in talking thereof I shall seem to differ from the Judgment of the Learned, and betray my ignorance in terms of Art; all that I can say for my self is, that I both thought, and speak according to that ability of understanding God has endowed me with, (without any great improvement of it by study, or much reading) from a desire or endeavour to ease my self, if I could, in finding out the readiest and shortest way of cure; which undoubtedly is best found out, by discerning the original defect of some part of Nature out of order, and not performing its office aright, and so hindring and obstructing that perfect Harmony which otherwise might be in the Soul of man. And whether that be it, I leave to other men to weigh and consider from their own reason, without any endeavour to confine them unto mine.</p>
               <p>God has, as I said, in us, and I think in every sensitive Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (being the workmanship of his hands too) implanted some seeds and sparks of Love, that they might have in them all some image, or at least some impress of their Maker: and as his universal love (who is himself termed Love it self) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it self towards all the works of his Creation; so, every particular of his Creation has its bending and inclining, by way of Love, to somewhat according to the capacity given it. This inclination of Love is visible in the most Savage Beasts towards their young ones, and their Mates, and others often of the same <hi>species</hi>: And in some of them, their Love is not terminated in their own kind and <hi>species,</hi> but extends it self to others of a different kind; as is observable, and we have seen
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50605:20"/>
in Lions to Dogs, and other Creatures bred up with them; but especially in Dogs to Men.</p>
               <p>Now this Love works and moves only in these Creatures by a natural instinct or fancy, and is terminated upon a few objects, and is not capable to extend it self beyond sense, and therefore is not found to be extreme upon any thing, so as to work any great disturbance, or to be of long continuance; yet I think we may affirm, that their mourning or their sorrow (if I may so term it) proceeds from their love to their young, or the like, and so their rage and fury to those who rob them thereof: And so their fear must needs proceed from a love they have for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, whereby every Creature has an inclination to self-preservation.</p>
               <p>This same natural Spring or Fountain does man bring with him into the World; which, though it lie longer hid under ground, usually breaks out into more various and rapid streams, by reason of a more quick and roving fancy to help and assist it, if not to stir it up: yet 'tis not long e're it be seen, and the first discernible effect of the Soul, besides motion, is a love to it self, by crying when any thing offends it; and to its Nurse who nourishes it, by cleaving to her, and avoiding others; which after by degrees shews its more peculiar inclination or tendance. For whatsoever may be storied of <hi>Timon</hi> the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> 'tis sure he loved himself; and besides there is no one so inhumane, but his love will find some other receptacle or reposure than himself, though it be but some one person, to whom he may shew that rancour or poison he bears to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others.</p>
               <p>But man also, being the more immediate hand-work of God, and created more expresly after his own Image, has not only this natural Spring of Love in him moved by sense and instinct, and also by a roving conceit of imaginary goodness, beyond that of other Creatures; but Reason, and Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also, to guide and direct this Love, and bend and incline it towards that chief good, for which it was created: That it should not stand as a Lake, like that of Beasts, nor yet water some adjacent parts only, by violent out-lets, but diffuse it self into several Streams and Channels, leaving its fruits and effects towards the whole good of mankind, and yet tending to that infinite Ocean which gave it its first being.</p>
               <p>Now when it thus has its free passage, although it may have some lets and stops, that disquiet it somewhat in its course, yet
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50605:20"/>
they never cause any great Billows or Surges to arise: But when by opinion and fancy, we too much confine it to some particular, and <note n="d" place="margin">Jer. 2.13.</note> 
                  <hi>forsake the fountain of living waters,</hi> (as <hi>Ieremy</hi> expresses it) <hi>we hew us out Cisterns, broken Cisterns, that can hold no water</hi>; so as from the ill-husbandry of this native Spring of Love, arises the chief disquiet of the mind.</p>
               <p>Love will be hunting after some good, and often takes an imaginary one for a real: For indeed nothing being properly good but God only, and all other things in reference to him; if they be aimed at in any other respect, they lose that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness they had, as to us.</p>
               <p>Now according as we by our foolish fancy direct this Love, it obtains its denomination from the World: If it be chiefly center'd in any man, from the good opinion he has of himself, we call it Pride; if it chiefly run after the applause of men, we call it Vain-glory; if the common vain pleasures of the World, Voluptuousness, or Epicurism; if Women, Amorous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; if we lodge it in our Children, Fondness or Dotage; if in Riches, Covetousness; and so for the like.</p>
               <p>Now if this Love be exercised in the obtaining, then it is termed Desire; if in the fruition, Joy; if in the losing, Fear; if in the loss, Sorrow. For why does a man desire any thing, but because he loves it? or why does he rejoyce in the fruition, but because he loves it? why does he fear the losing it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he loves it? or why does he sorrow for the loss, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he loves it? This one thing <hi>Love,</hi> is the <hi>primum mobile</hi> (as I may call it) of all: the other passions are but its ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Attendants; and whatever definitions are made of our Animal faculties, 'tis this, like the principal Spring in a Watch, that sets them all on going, and whatever evil hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to us, is from the ill motion, or ill setting of the Spring, for want of reason; for as our Love is good or bad, so are its Attendants.</p>
               <p>If we chiefly place it on God and goodness, it has its desires, its joys, its fears, and its sorrows; from which, Philosophy need not exclude a wise man. Surely a man may, with St. <hi>Paul, desire to be dissolved</hi>; he may desire to persevere to the end, and receive the crown of his warfare; he may rejoyce in hope; he may fear to offend; he may sorrow for sin; and all this, without committing evil or folly: for affects arising sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply from the love of good, cannot have any thing of evil in them. These good affects or passions, we see in the man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50605:21"/>
to God's own heart: <hi>His soul brake out for very fervent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire; he rejoyced as one that found great spoils; his flesh trembled for fear, and he was afraid of God's judgments; he was horribly affrighted for the ungodly that forsook God's Law; his soul melted away for very heaviness; he was troubled above measure; his eyes gushed out with water, because men kept not God's Law; trouble and heaviness had taken hold on him; it grieved him when he saw the transgressors.</hi> And all this, proceeding from <hi>Love,</hi> as it appears by the often expression of it, in word, in that excellent 119<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Psalm, (the title of one part whereof is, <hi>Quomodo dilexi</hi>) wherein he professes what he loved <hi>above gold and precious stones,</hi> and what was <hi>dearer unto him, then thousands of gold and silver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if our Love be chiefly placed on other things, and too much wander and stray from the chief good, though it take along with it the same concomitants of <hi>Desire, &amp;c.</hi> yet they are in an amazed, distracted, and uneasie dress, and can own no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a misguided Love, to be their principal Captain and Leader. For although, as I said before, <hi>Love</hi> may take its deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination from the thing it pursues, yet still its proper attribute and name is <hi>Love.</hi> And not only the Poet, in case of Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, cries out, <hi>Amor nummi</hi>; but St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself gives it its true and proper definition, for the root of all evil, he plainly terms, <note n="e" place="margin">1 Tim. 6.10.</note> 
                  <hi>the love of money</hi>; and when he reckons up a number of the greatest Vices, Pride, Blasphemy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he begins them thus, <note n="f" place="margin">2 Tim. 3.2, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>men shall be lovers of their own selves</hi>; and concludes with these words, <hi>lovers of pleasures, more then lovers of God,</hi> as if some sort of love were the mother of all Vices. Indeed, when any one Worldly thing has taken possession, and as it were monopolized a man's heart, it brings with it a number of disquiet Inmates, as solicitous cares and fears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and amongst the rest, sorrow shall never be wanting: For in that case, of love of money, as it causes men to <hi>err from the Faith,</hi> by St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s rule, so it causes them <hi>to pierce themselves through with many sorrows</hi>; and he might well say, <hi>many,</hi> for even in its first desire of obtaining (besides what attend it in the fruition and loss) sorrow often goes along with it, as may be instanced in <hi>Ahab,</hi> whose <note n="g" place="margin">1 King. 21.4.</note> 
                  <hi>heart was sad, and he could eat no bread,</hi> in the very primary effect of this covetous Love, <hi>viz.</hi> desire of <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vineyard And I think we may affirm, vexing sorrow never yet entred into any mans heart, without some precedent love to usher it in: For take sorrow in both St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s sences, <hi>Worldly</hi> and <hi>Godly sorrow,</hi> apart, or both together, the rise thereof is from Love; for if we are first sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50605:21"/>
for our sins, it is because we shall one day feel the smart of them; that proceeds from the love of our selves: and then if we be further sorrowful, that we have offended a gracious God, though there were no punishment attending sin, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the love of God; so as Love is the motive of all, and we cannot but conclude, that sorrow has its being and exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence from Love.</p>
               <p>But herein, as to a vain sorrow from a misguided Love, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the inferiour and more brutish part of man, the sensual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, or the will, (which is in some sort in Brutes, for they have choices as well as we, though those choices are necessarily determined by their appetite, for want of reason) or the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing be most to be blamed, is to be enquired into. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, we must first acknowledge, that the three prime fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the Soul, to wit, the Understanding, the Will, and the Affections, do all concurr in every fault we commit; yet so, as though they be all faulty, the chief obliquity springeth most immediately from the more special default of one of the three. As in the present case of sorrow, however the other faculties may be concerned, yet the understanding is most to blame, and this our error is through ignorance. Indeed our ignorance is so far wilful, that there being imprinted in us the common princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Law of Nature, (as well as the written Law) if we had but carefully improved them, we might in right reason have discerned, that our Love ought more chiefly to tend to our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Governour, than our own natural product; but yet I think no man will arraign the <hi>Will</hi> as principal, unless in that case of <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luit consolari</hi>: where notwithstanding a mans reason inform him he ought not, yet he is resolved, like <hi>Iacob, he will go mourning to his grave.</hi> Neither are the affections chiefly to be blamed, because Love of it self is good, and only misled through ignorance; and sorrow, as I have said, is but the consequent of a misguided Love.</p>
               <p>Now then towards the cure, our ignorance is to be discussed, and our understanding cleared, that so our wills and affections may become obedient, and follow its dictates. This right <hi>understanding,</hi> is indeed an immediate influence of the Almighty, by whose powerful rays there is a gracious dissipation of these sublunary Mists and Fogs, which hinder and obstruct the clearer prospect of our Souls. And, as I so in all humility own it, I cannot rationally expect any one should take it barely by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberation from me, or by looking into these Papers. He who is Brightness, and the Mirrour of wisdom, grant unto me, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50605:22"/>
every man, so much of true reason and understanding, as that while it is time, we may in some sort behold the errors and follies of our own ways; For, though I and others may cry out, <hi>Why art thou so troubled, O my Soul! and why art thou so disquieted within me?</hi> yet they and I shall never argue our selves into patience, without trusting, that <hi>he is the help of our counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and our God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if I may in humility present my thoughts to others, (who may by his gift believe with me) I cannot think any rule herein, or hereabout, to be observed of so much weight as this one, in two words, <hi>custodi cor.</hi> The wisest of men, after he has partly shewed us the manner of <hi>wisdoms entrance into the Soul,</hi> and her excellencies; that <hi>the merchandize thereof is better then silver, and the gain thereof then gold; that she is more precious then Rubies, and all that can be desired,</hi> in the three first Chapters of his Book: And after divers commendations of her, and exhortations to attention in the fourth, he does as it were lay the first ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of attaining her in this precept, <note n="h" place="margin">Prov. 4.23.</note> 
                  <hi>Keep thy heart with all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, for out of it are the issues of life.</hi> Surely God has placed that in the midst of us, to be the magazine and treasury of our Soul, and has required it for himself of every one in express terms, <hi>My Son, give me thy heart.</hi> I will not here in this place, and upon this occasion, enquire whether the functions of the intellect, or the affections, do follow the cogitations, or the cogitations are actuated and stirred by them, or which is the most proper seat of either: The Soul is of so subtle a compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, that it self could never yet find out the manner of its own operations; but this I hope may be affirmed here, that if the heart be the more peculiar seat of the affections, and Love the chief of the affections, the aim thereof must be good; and what that good is, our Reason, under God, will certainly best direct us. For Reason as in a Watch-tower beholding as well absent as present good, and the affections only beholding the present; it is Reason only that must reclaim the imagination, and bring it in subjection to it self, and place the affections upon a right object there. And surely, Reason tells every man that has her, that, That from which the Soul it self had its primary being and existence, is the chief good, and ought to take up the chief room in our Soul. I, for my part, with my little reason, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find any such Engine, as will remove the whole World, unless it be the Love of God; nor any place to fix this Engine in, more proper then the heart. If this Love do once possess
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50605:22"/>
the Citadel of our Soul, we are safe; we all too truly find, that while we are cloathed with flesh, it will let in sometimes other more visible and sensible objects, which may make some mutiny in her, but still she has this Love as a safe and sure Captain, that will keep her from taking. Surely methinks if Reason be but consulted, this Love must be the predominant affection: Were it possible for us to give be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to some Creatures, and to endue them with Reason too, should we not desert them for deserting us? and for too close an union amongst themselves, and to other Creatures without respect to us? And if God had never instilled into us by his Word, that <hi>he is a jealous God,</hi> who would punish for admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of a Rival to his love, could we expect less? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought not we in reason, as much as may be, to keep out all Rivals? 'Tis a strange fascination in us to confine all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness (which is the aim of Love) within our own bowels, and sometimes the bowels of the Earth too. No wise man will think, neither can we justly own, the affections in us to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from any habitual or inherent goodness in our nature, or that we do thereby express any similitude or likeness to that Image, whose goodness is universally diffusive to all. Since our Love (though it be owing to the whole Race of mankind, as we are made of one lump from one Eternal power) is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centred in particulars: From which cause, as our Love does often thereby, upon our loss, convert into sorrow; so should that sorrow, in reason, convert into shame. For to say (I think) the truth, we excessive mourners in this case, may be defined to be persons who have locked up our hearts from the love of God, and shut up our bowels from mankind in general, and confined them to work only within our own imaginary Sphere. And were we accosted with that rough speech of <hi>Ioab</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> 
                  <note n="i" place="margin">2 Sam. 19.6.</note> 
                  <hi>That we hereby declare, that we regard neither Princes nor Servants,</hi> but that the World may well perceive, that if our <hi>Absalom</hi> had lived, and an hundred else had died, <hi>it had pleased us well</hi>; we could find no sufficient reply to justifie our selves, but must confess our own error.</p>
               <p>And now if our gourd be withered, shall we sit down in a sullen mood? And if that perfect love, that should have held place in us, be dispossessed, shall not reason and understanding struggle for her? Sure the most rational way of cure is, since we have given up our hearts to follow that which flies from us as a shadow, to leave the pursuit, and catch hold on something
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50605:23"/>
else if may be. Though our Children are gone, the World is yet full of various objects of delight: But that which makes all or any of them so, is God, and from that original, must they so glide into the heart; and therefore we most of necessity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce and bring back our wandring love to its proper state and original, for which 'twas first implanted in us, and fix it upon that delightful object, and through that Mirrour, all things will have a more lovely aspect.</p>
               <p>Understanding, and the Love of God, are always so coupled and linked together, that the one cannot be, or subsist without the other: If a man love not his God and Creator, 'tis for want of understanding; and if a man has not a right understanding of his present and future well-being, it is alone because he wants that love. For that love will infallibly fix every mans thoughts upon a hearty endeavour to perform the whole will of God. Thus hath St. <hi>Iohn</hi> truly defined the love of God to be, a keeping of his Commandments; <note n="k" place="margin">1 John 5.3.</note> 
                  <hi>This is the love of God, if we keep his Commandments.</hi> And our <note n="l" place="margin">John 14.15.</note> Saviour himself has made that the test and tryal of love: And both <hi>David</hi> and his Son <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> the wisest of men, have assured us in sundry positions, that <hi>understanding takes her possession</hi> of the Soul with it, and that <hi>through his Commandments it is, that we are wiser then our Teachers.</hi> And surely if there were not some defect in every man of these Graces, by the intetposition of Sin and Satan, he would, sooner or later, hear that gracious and effectual Eccho resound in his Soul, from the Spirit of all true love and comfort, <note n="m" place="margin">Vers. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled.</hi> This is the only rational way I think of cure, <hi>Redire ad cor</hi>; and to get that clean swept and garnished, that the Spirit of true love may enter in, and keep possession against all unruly passions, and I dare say, whoever tries it, will sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe his <hi>probatum</hi> to it.</p>

               <p>BUt as I said, let us not altogether reject every prescribed alleviating Medicine: Indeed there are many from our common undertaking comforters, and we are ready to catch at them like Reeds in a sinking condition. Although they are
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50605:23"/>
firm Truths, and such as have been used by the greatest Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers and Divines towards the cure; yet barely and simply considered, all or either of them, have not the efficacy to bring a man to any safe or quiet Harbour. They may keep a man from drowning, but withall they may and do often leave him plunging in the deep, without the co-operation of some more Sovereign Medicines; and are, some of them, fitter ingredients for a complicated disease, where murmuring and repining are joyned with it, than bare sorrow: which I bless God, I never was infected with, for I own his Judgments just, and am more apt to have St. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s noise in my ears, <hi>Tu vero, bona tua, in vita tua, &amp;c.</hi> than the contrary. But I mention them, as I thought on them, and leave them to others to make their best use of them, which are these following.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That death is a common thing, and a debt we all owe to Nature, and must shortly pay, and therefore it should not so much trouble us, to behold it in another.</item>
                  <item>2. That we cannot recall our Friends and Relations by our mourning, and therefore our sorrow is vain.</item>
                  <item>3. That they whom we love are at rest, and happy, which is rather cause of joy.</item>
                  <item>4. That 'tis not our case alone, we are not single, but others daily suffer the like.</item>
               </list>
               <p>As to the first, the thing is very obvious to the meanest capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and perhaps if we did in our serious thoughts oftner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold death, he might prove like <hi>Aesop</hi>'s Lion to his Fox, not altogether so terrible; but yet he will be a Lion still, and as <hi>Aristotle</hi> calls him, <hi>omnium terribilium terribilissimum</hi>: and further, if we did look upon him at hand, ready to seize us; then, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with us, all worldly things would change their hue, and put on, as it were, another face. 'Tis sure, that <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 5.12.</note> 
                  <hi>Death passeth upon all men,</hi> (but as St. <hi>Paul</hi> says) because <hi>all men have sinned</hi>; and from thence it is, that death hath such a sting. And 'tis sin that has made sorrow and trouble attendants on death, as well as death on it, both for our selves and others: And therefore the contemplation of the primary cause of our sorrow, should rather take up our thoughts, as I have already said, than the secundary. For the thought of death certainly was never wholly absent from any man in his sorrows, nor ever cured any; but the true sense of his own deserts have.</p>
               <p>As to the second, every man knows it as well as the other,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> neither was there ever any man yet, that had his reason left him,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50605:24"/>
who thought to revive his Friend or Relation thereby, or to awake him with his shrieks and cries. It is every mans deepest corrosive, that there is no redemption from the Grave: And though in truth it be a vain thing, to persist in that which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth us nothing; yet that vanity will not be driven away, by anothers barely telling us so, or our own thinking or knowing it so: The faculties of the Soul will not cease to work, though there is knowledge that the operation is oft-times in vain; 'tis in vain we know to fear death, but that knowledge will not cure a man of his fear. Certainly the wounds of the Spirit are sharper and more malignant, than those of the Body, and 'tis the same reason must argue us into patience of both: But, let her set us upon the Rack, 'tis in vain to cry out, it will profit us nothing; we shall scarce hearken to her, and keep silence. This advice best comes when we begin to be weary of our mourning, and not before, and then only will this reason be hearkned unto. In the mean time, let us consider, if we can, <hi>All things are vanity,</hi> which are the causes of our <hi>vexation of Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> As to the third, I look on it as a good Christian contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and may in the declination of the disease, prove a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Cordial, but in the state thereof, of little prevalence to a cure; because it is a thing we never doubted of, but, upon the first departure of the Soul of him or her, who lived well, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> think it received into Eternal bliss: And therefore if these thoughts had in them any present sanative virtue, they would rather keep us from sorrowing at all, since they possess us as soon as our sorrow, and are contemporary with our distemper. The wise Son of <hi>Syrach</hi> allows us a moderate sorrow, bids us <note n="b" place="margin">Ecclus 22.11 &amp; 38.17.</note> 
                  <hi>weep for the dead, but not over-much,</hi> because he is at rest: And St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s advice or caution is, that we <note n="c" place="margin">1 Thes. 4.13, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>sorrow not as others, which have no hope</hi>; that is, with a desperate, faithless sorrow, as if they were eternally lost, and that Christ should not <hi>raise them up at the last day.</hi> But surely no man will charitably deny, but that a strong Faith, and a deep worldly sorrow, may sometimes possibly subsist together, and that there may be <hi>spe dolentes,</hi> as well as <hi>spe gaudentes</hi>: For I cannot so discard my own charity, as not to think some very good men have gone sorrowing to their Graves, and yet have rejoyced too, in the hopes <note n="d" place="margin">1 Thes. 4.14.</note> 
                  <hi>that God will bring with him, those that sleep, and they shall meet together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for our present pensive thoughts and mourning, 'tis sure
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50605:24"/>
they arise not only for want of this belief, or from any suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed detriment happened, or like to happen to our Relation or Friend, (whom we once enjoyed, and now are deprived of) but to our selves from our present loss. For 'tis most certain with every man, that whenever any object has stollen into, and possessed his heart, and taken root there, if the same be eradicated and snatched away, (though he suppose it planted in a more pleasant Soil) there will immediately spring up in the room thereof; grief and sorrow; and the <note n="e" place="margin">
                     <hi>Quem res plus nimio delectavere secundae, Mutatae quatient</hi> —</note> greater and deeper root the one had taken, the more stubborn and fixed will be the other. And therefore I think the Poets advice, by way of caution and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, (if we could but warily observe it) more of weight, than these thoughts have at present by way of cure, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>Quicquid amas, cupias, non placuisse nimis.</hi>
                  </note> That we take great and diligent care, that these worldly objects of joy and delight, do not creep in, and too strongly possess our hearts, lest if they should be cast out against our wills, there enter in and spring up that bitter root of sorrow, which will make our last thoughts more heavy, than our first were lightsom.</p>
               <p>Sorrow is a wound that is made, by the separation of the thing beloved, from the lover; and though it be but tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary, and that we believe with some, that we shall again at the last be united together, with the knowledge of each other, where we shall sing <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> together, and <hi>all tears shall be wiped from our eyes</hi>; yet in the mean while, our hearts may be troubled, and <hi>sorrowful even unto death.</hi> And since we have lost our present comfort, the wound will not be healed, but by sending another and better comforter. We may still mourn for want of the enjoyment; our affections never be absolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, by believing the former subject of their Love is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; nor like mourning Widows, forget the old, but by find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a new subject of delight and complacency. Therefore let us, as well as hope in future, presently recall them, and endeavour, as I said, to fix them on some more stable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, than they placed themselves on before. Tell them, there is nothing truly amiable but God, and him we may enjoy here in measure.</p>
               <p>And for the last of them, the thoughts thereof, as I have said,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> are more proper to prevent murmurs, than asswage sorrows: For though fellowship in adversity, be proverbially turned into, and administred for comfort; yet really to a good mind,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50605:25"/>
it has no such operation. If another man loses his only Child, as well as I; I have thereby wherewith to stop my mouth from complaining of injustice, but in no case to rejoyce my heart, because I ought rather to rejoyce at anothers good, than his evil. And sure the true method of the cure of the mind, does in many things resemble the cure of the body. How far will it asswage my pain, to see another more grievously tormented with the Gout? very little, I think; unless as 'twill enforce me to acknowledge God's mercy and goodness to me, that I suffer in a less degree. Nay if the beholding of another mans mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, should be of effect to mitigate mine; by the same conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, the beholding anothers felicity (which is as obvious to every man) must increase mine, which naturally few men have found true.</p>
               <p>Many other prescriptions there are against sorrow, but since I look on the continual presentment to our thoughts of the thing we take delight in, and the rouling and chewing thereof in our mind, to be the chief Pillar or Basis which supports and upholds our sorrows, or the chief Spring which keeps them fresh and verdant; I could not but think it worthy considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, how far it may be good for any man to endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call his thoughts from his present subject of grief, by fixing them on, and pleasing them with, any other terrestrial ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; wherein my shallow Judgment has inclined me to think this:</p>
               <p>That no such diverted thoughts whatever, being properly efficient of a cure, but Anodynes and Stupefiers for a time, (for then only can a man be said to be cured of his grief, when he can think on the cause with comfort, or at least without reluctancy of Spirit) it is not good for any man in this case, to hunt after a divertisement, but rather suffer that to call on him, and find him out. I would advise any man in this case to embrace an old lawful vocation or imployment, but not seek out a new one for that end and purpose, nor by any means endeavour to charm his grief with the most innocent (much less sinful) recreation. For whatever it may be for cares in general, 'tis a foolish thing to think, forthwith to drown sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in the River <hi>Lethe</hi>; for though it be an heavy passion, yet none of the mind will get above it. We shall often find it rise, to verifie the Wise mans saying, that <note n="g" place="margin">Prov. 14.13.</note> 
                  <hi>even in laughter, the heart is sorrowful</hi>; and it will cause us to conclude with him, that <note n="h" place="margin">Prov. 25.20.</note> 
                  <hi>Songs sung to an heavy heart, are like Vinegar poured upon Nitre,</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:50605:25"/>
do rather sharpen and exasperate, than cure the disease. This way of laying sorrow to rest, is but to give it strength, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with us with greater force when it awaketh, as doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it may.</p>
               <p>But besides the incertainty and danger this way, we do not thereby at all answer God's designment in sending it: Did he ever yet punish any man, for no other end, than that he should forget his strokes and rejoyce; and not rather that he should think on it, so far as to amend his faults or errors? Can any man think there is an <hi>hand-writing on his walls,</hi> to the end that after his beholding it, he should forthwith avert his Eyes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, and leave his House, and betake himself to the Fields or the Tavern? If it be God that wounds us (as we generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, permissively at least, as in <hi>Iob</hi>'s case) by his fiery Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, it must be he that must heal us; which will not be, by flying from the sight of the Serpent, but <note n="i" place="margin">Numb. 21. vers. 6, to 10.</note> 
                  <hi>beholding</hi> it. If it be he that casts us down, it must be he that shall build us up. And whatever <hi>Iob</hi>'s Friends might otherwise fail in, they gave him excellent sound counsel in this, <note n="k" place="margin">Job 22.23.</note> 
                  <hi>That if he returned to the Almighty, he should be built up</hi>; but forgetfulness of his calls is not the means to return; and the Prophet <hi>David</hi> has told us, that disregard is the ready way for us to lie buried in our ruines, and has shewed it as the very cause, <note n="l" place="margin">Psal. 28.5.</note> 
                  <hi>Because they regard not the works of the Lord, nor the operation of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build them up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we think wilful forgetfulness be the way of cure, it is but just God should forget us, and leave us unbuilt, or at least tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering and ready to fall again upon the least blast. For I dare say, by that way, and without him, there is danger that our hearts from melting, may become frozen, but never reduced to any calm or serene temper. For besides and above what the World affords sometimes, to wit, a transmutation of passions, (that is, her objects may cause the mind to lay aside its sorrow for a time, and be wholly possess'd with another passion, which may be almost as troublesom, or is at best a light flashing joy) we are capable of obtaining a conversion of passions, of having our <hi>sorrow</hi> (as 'tis expressed in <note n="m" place="margin">John 16.20.</note> St. <hi>Iohn</hi>) <hi>turned into joy</hi>: we may rejoyce in that very thing we sorrowed for, and our waters of <hi>Marah</hi> may become sweet and pleasant, by our drinking.</p>
               <p>Afflictions are sent to exercise <hi>Our Faith,</hi> by believing most assuredly God's promises of his deliverance from them; <hi>Our
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50605:26"/>
Hope,</hi> by assuring our selves of the reward promised to them that suffer patiently; and <hi>Our Charity,</hi> in suffering willingly for his sake, who loved us, and suffered for us. And shall this be performed by our endeavours to find out means to forget our sufferings? But besides Theological virtues, there are Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral too, to be exercised thereby; and even one of them is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to awaken us, and rouze us up from this dull passion of sorrow. Let us consider a little, the worldly esteem of a noble undaunted Spirit, beyond a degenerous and poor one. Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is that Heroick Moral virtue, which can never shew it self so illustrious as in Adversity. There are none of us, but would willingly be thought to have it inherent in us, and then is the proper time to shew it; for it must be a tempestuous, not a calm Sea, which shews the excellency of a Pilot. Fortitude has already been owned to shew more of its reality in a passive, than an active dress, and oftner appears with the Shield, the Buckler, and the Helmet, than the Spear and the Sword. Let us think with <hi>Theophrastus,</hi> that the World is a great Theatre, and that each of us is often called forth upon the Stage, to fight with poverty, sorrow, sickness, death, and a number of other miseries, (rather then with one another) and besides our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren Spectators, God himself from above beholds every one, how he performs his part; and that (besides an hiss, or a <hi>plaudite</hi> here) we must expect a Crown, or Prison hereafter: And then let us fight valiantly, and think, through him that will assist us, to master and subdue all adverse Fortune; that is in two words, to <hi>contemn the World,</hi> and that is truly the definition of <note n="n" place="margin">Fortitudo, <hi>est animo magno, elato<expan>

                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:50605:26"/>But if neither Honour nor Glory, nor the sight of God or man, will herein move us, but that we are ready to yield, and let our affections carry us away like Captives and Slaves, there is yet this reserve left us; to become at last resolute from fear, and tell our selves, what <hi>Ioab</hi> told <hi>David,</hi> that if we do not <note n="a" place="margin">2 Sam. 19.7.</note> 
                  <hi>Arise from our sorrow, and speak comfortably again, it will be worse unto us then all the evil that befell us, even from our youth until now.</hi> And that worst evil, is death, if Satan be not deceived in our sense of humane evils, who says, <note n="b" place="margin">Job 2.4.</note>

               <p>Immoderate sorrow will macerate these beloved Carcasses of ours; and although, before pain makes us sensible of our follies, (and it be generally too late) we are apt to take some kind of pleasure in nourishing and feeding our diseases; yet methinks, in this, where we have none of our senses to please, (which is chiefly looked on in the World) we might take the words of wise and experienced persons. <hi>David</hi> telleth us, <note n="c" place="margin">Psal. 31.9.</note> 
                  <hi>his eyes were consumed with grief, yea his soul and his belly</hi>; and he tells us of those, who are <note n="d" place="margin">Psal. 107.39.</note> 
                  <hi>brought low through oppression, affliction and sorrow.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <note n="e" place="margin">2 Cor. 7.10.</note> 
                  <hi>Worldly sorrow worketh death. Solomon</hi> hath told us, that <note n="f" place="margin">Prov. 15.13.</note>

               <p>I do agree with him who said, <hi>Nisi sanatus sit animus, quod sine Philosophia non potest, finem miseriarum nullum fore, quamobrem tradamus nos ei curandos,</hi> if <hi>Deo</hi> were placed in the room of <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophia.</hi> For now at length I must conclude, that although Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Philosophy may be sometimes admitted as an Handmaid and Attendant on Divinity, and 'twas not for nought that St. <hi>Paul</hi> termed Religion <note n="k" place="margin">Rom. 12.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Our reasonable service</hi>; yet we must take care we look upon the one in no other respect, than under the precepts and dictates of the other. I for my part am apt to think, and do indeed rest convinced, that no man ever yet cured these wounds of the Soul, by the bare strength of natural Reason and Argument, (though even that be the immediate gift of a Divine power) without some more special Light, or influence from above. For although many of the ancient Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers

and Sages, who perhaps knew not God aright, have seemed from their profound knowledge and reason, to reduce their minds unto a most constant calm serene temper; I rather think that tranquility of mind in them, was the gift of that God they rightly knew not, as a reward of their Moral virtues industriously acquired, than the native off-spring of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. I my self am a man like other men, and I have been ever sensible by intervals in my serious thoughts, of the vanity of this World; and I may truly say, there is nothing in these Papers, but what at some time or other occurred to my thoughts before; and in those thoughts I have, <hi>Goliah</hi>-like, contemned a pigmy sorrow: but find, as contemptible a thing as it may seem to the best humane reason, being sent from the Lord of Hosts, who alone is he that <note n="l" place="margin">Job 5.18. <hi>Una eadem<expan>

                  <hi>we are not sufficient of our selves, to think any thing as of our selves</hi>) our wills were present with us, and those wills could command our cogitations, and our reason to attend them too; we might however think what we would or could, and dig about, and water all our days this crabbed root of Nature, and never cause it to produce more, than an harsh, unpleasant, and not lasting fruit. <note n="n" place="margin">Gal. 5.22.</note>

If we have learn'd to tred the waters, and to walk upon a tempestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sea for some steps, we shall notwithstanding find cause with St. <hi>Peter</hi> to cry out, <hi>Lord, save me, or I perish</hi>; which cry, is yet my cry. For I do declare unto the World, that I have not at any time found the recovery from a disease, to be a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient charm against its return.

                  <hi>his comforts</hi> alone, which <hi>must refresh our Souls in the multitude of the sorrows we have in our hearts.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> is pleased to stile him, <note n="q" place="margin">2 Cor. 1.3, 4.</note>

                  <hi>the God of patience and consolation,</hi> with a kind of inference, that God ever crowns his Grace of patience, with his Blessing of consolation And he does declare God to be the sole proper and peculiar Fountain of comfort, in an instance of his gracious working upon himself; <note n="s" place="margin">2 Cor. 7.6.</note> 
                  <hi>Nevertheless,</hi> says he, <hi>God that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of</hi> Titus.

                  <hi>I, even I am he that comforteth you.</hi> From the diversity of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in our natural temper, has arose that Adage of, <hi>fortui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum est placere</hi>; and from the same diversity we may inferr, (and change the word) <hi>à Domino est, placere</hi>: Because we daily see men affected and delighted not from any inherent quality in the subject, because to effect that, the thing <hi>per se</hi> must have somewhat of good in it, but properly and peculiarly nothing is good save God only; and therefore to make a thing seem good and delightful to us, it must first have his stamp and impress upon it visible to us.

I must acknowledge I ever found some comfort in my sorrows, by reading those Divine spiritual Soloquies of his, and do not think but that every other man may; and that however they may upon the reading in prosperity, glide over his heart, in adversity they will fix and settle there.

                  <p>I have seen and read the destruction of other Families, how their name has perished; how thou pullest down one, and raisest up another, and yet my heart has rather inclined to the World, than to thee, my God and advancer.</p>
                  <p>But grant, O Lord, that neither the cares of this World, nor the deceitfulness of Riches, may choak any good Seed of well-doing, either sowed or sprung up in my heart.</p>
                  <p>Thou hast commanded us not to set our hearts upon them; O shew me thy ways, and <hi>incline my heart unto thee, and not unto covetousness!</hi> And if I must part with all to follow thee, give me an heart to do it.</p>
                  <p>I trust thou hast not increased my outward accessions, to suffer me to be deceived therewithall; or given me Riches, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou sawest I should not have been innocently poor.</p>
                  <p>I confess, O Lord, they are Briars and Thorns yet growing, and ready to choak every good Plant, but do thou raise in me from thence a plentiful Harvest of good works.</p>
                  <p>Make me a faithful Steward of what thou hast committed to my charge, or else leave me naked as I came into the World.</p>
                  <p>For thou knowest I have ever acknowledged what I enjoy to be from thy gift, and never sacrificed to my own Nets.</p>
                  <p>Thou hast given me what I never asked, and bereaved me of what I most desired; but who is able to comprehend the methods of thy Judgments?</p>
                  <p>Surely there is something to which our affections ought to tend, in which the desire of man can have no excess.</p>
                  <p>Is there nothing to be found amiable, but what is corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? shall charity abide when all things cease, and for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent know not where to fix it self?</p>
                  <p>Shall we at best behold the chequered and bright Clouds raised from the Earth, and forget the Sun which gives them brightness, and cause him at present to withdraw his beams, and leave us in obscure darkness?</p>
                  <p>Shall he that gives us all things withdraw himself, for want of our beholding him in that notion? when we cannot do that, but by his immediate gift too.</p>
                  <p>When thou, O Lord, dartest forth the light of thy counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, those little Rays we are capable to behold through the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50605:30"/>
Vail of this flesh, make all things amiable; and particulars on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seem so from a false light of our own imaginary creation.</p>
                  <p>He who endeavours to behold thee as thou art, or further than thou hast been pleased to shew thy self, deservedly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes blind, and perishes by his too near approaches.</p>
                  <p>We cannot behold thy light but by reflexion, only let us see so much as that we may admire and love thee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The invisible things of thee, are understood only by the things that are made</hi>; and thou art seen only by the beauty and greatness of thy Creatures, or thy immediate free gift.</p>
                  <p>O shew me the light of thy countenance in some measure, stablish me again by thy free Spirit, and send some Balm into that Soul, which thou hast wounded!</p>
                  <p>I know the Creator of all things cannot altogether shut up his mercy and loving kindness from his Creatures in displeasure: I am as much the work of thy hands, as the greatest Monarch.</p>
                  <p>Thy ways and methods, and thy decrees, O Lord, are hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, but wilt thou refuse a present desire of return?</p>
                  <p>Shall I think of being forgot, when I can say, Lord remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber me and all my troubles? O let me not be forgot in the Land of the living!</p>
                  <p>If I have loved too much, divert the current of that affection, and let it return like a River to the Ocean of Love, thy self.</p>
                  <p>Turn, O Lord, my affections as the Rivers in the South, then shall I have hopes, though I sow in tears, to reap in joy!</p>
                  <p>Let me only desire thee, rejoyce in thee, fear thee, and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row only for thy absence, if but a moment.</p>
                  <p>Thou who assumedst flesh, knowest how frail and weak our nature is; thou hast said, <hi>the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thy Servant <hi>Paul</hi> by thee hath said, <hi>There is a Law of the flesh warring against the Law of the mind; and that in him that is in his flesh, there dwelt no good thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thou art the only Physician of the Soul and Body; thou canst enliven my Spirit towards thee; thou canst mortifie my lust; thou canst allay all the unruly passions of the mind, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed from the humours of the body, and actuated by Satan.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O make me a clean heart, and renew a right Spirit within me!</hi> a Spirit of meekness, working by true love and charity, and in all things a contented Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Let all my inherent passions move only towards the good of community, and thy glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:50605:30"/>Thou hast made all things chiefly for thy glory and praise; and cannot I look upon the praising and magnifying thee, a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient and satisfactory end of my peculiar being, without either Children, Riches or Honour?</p>
                  <p>Thou hast given me understanding, which is the greater gift, shall that be for nought? or that my condemnation should be the greater? can he that goes down to the pit praise thee?</p>
                  <p>But I will praise thy name; O let me live, and declare thy merciful loving kindness to my Brethren! Let me after death praise thee with thy glorious Saints and Angels! for to that end didst thou make man of nought.</p>
                  <p>Though thou slay me, yet will I trust in thee: Let me lay so fast hold on thy mercy, that no terrours whatsoever loose me therefrom.</p>
                  <p>Rather in this World wound and afflict me, but be thou merciful unto me, and deliver me at the hour of death, and in the day of Judgment.</p>
                  <p>Prepare me, O Lord, for greater Judgments; and if thou hast decreed to bereave me of all Worldly comforts, yet be thou my comforter.</p>
                  <p>And if thou seest it good to punish me, let me only be as it were a Sacrifice for my Family, and let them praise thee in the Land of the living.</p>
                  <p>But if herein I know not what I ask, grant only what thou knowest good for me; whose care and love never forsook them, who did not first forsake thee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thy will, O Lord, be done</hi>; thy will be done, yet thou canst draw me to thee by the cords of Love, and spare the remnant which is left.</p>
                  <p>Out of the remnant which is left raise up a branch unto thy self, that may be an example of piety and virtue unto others.</p>
                  <p>One who may fear thy Name, and think it a Kingdom to govern himself, and rule his passions: One that may look on all Graces and Moral Virtues, as the greatest Riches and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, so as he may flourish likewise here on Earth.</p>
                  <p>O accept of the perfect obedience of thine own Son, who suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for me and mine, in the room of my disobedience!</p>
                  <p>It was not for my Childrens sins, I know, O Lord, thou so soon reassumedst those Spirits of thy giving, to leave the filth and rottenness of the flesh proceeding from me.</p>
                  <p>They were indeed conceived and born in sin, but received a new generation by thy gracious washing in Baptism.</p>

                  <p>It is wisdom to know what is pleasing to thee, it is wisdom to depend on thee, and <hi>in Christ are hidden all the treasures of wisdom.</hi>

                  <hi>Know my self.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The knowledge of the Soul (if it might be known) and its strange manner of operation, has been that kind of worldly knowledge, which by fits (as it were) I have most of all aspired after; and my Soul seemed to will now and then to behold it self: but being in conjunction with a Body, it has in me (as in others) run wandring abroad to fulfil the lusts thereof; spent the greatest part of its time of residence here, in the supporting, adorning and beautifying that its case and habitation; willing too, from its ashes and cyndars, there should arise another Bird of the same kind, and in the mean time neglected to consider, how well it was prepared for its own flight.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:50605:32"/>This outward prospect, as I say, had drawn aside and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed my cogitations upon the pleasures of the World, and the deceitful Riches, Pomps and other Vanities thereof; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the obtaining and enjoying of which, I could not but adjudge the too narrow search into ones self, and beholding ones own composure, rather obstructive than conducing. But now again of late (and when indeed it may seem too late) in my elder years, having had some more disquietness of mind than ordinary from the loss of my Children, for whom it may be my thoughts had too far straggled before; I began again to reassume my pristine desire, with somewhat more earnestness than formerly; and my mind, somewhat again re-settled and calmed, became more industriously inquisitive into her own defects, and more willing to search out the causes of her pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations, and to apply the best remedies she could towards the allaying and quieting the same.</p>
               <p>Thus once again moved with this desire, in my procedure to its execution, this consideration offer'd it self to my thoughts; whether now at the last I should spend some time in finding out, and perusing Authors who before had wrote any learned Tractates <hi>de Animâ,</hi> or the like, to instruct and guide me, (which hitherto I was altogether ignorant of, and had ever neglected, by reason of my pecuniary study, though little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to me) or spin, or weave out like a Spider, the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials of my own weak Brain, and take some view of my Soul by the strength of its own intellect, without the help of any Perspective: And after some little demurr, and some doubt of splitting my own Barque against other mens, or rather fear of being lost in a Labyrinth or Maze of other mens framing, I neglected the first, and resolved on the latter; and to try how far my Soul could shew her self unto her self, as from her own Idea, and find the ready way to amend and rectifie her self.</p>
               <p>In this undertaking I cannot but foresee and except very va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and different censures, from the variety of mens inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and opinions in their Souls; but I am not now so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with my own, as to foresee them with any trouble of mind, or without charity; no, not if the <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Thou art be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side thy self.</hi>
                  </note> censure given on St. <hi>Paul</hi> (without the <note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Much learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hath made thee mad.</hi> Act. 26.24.</note> cause added) were one. If any man deceive his own expectation, in looking for somewhat that is new, it is he that goes about to confute <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Aphorism, and not I. Inded I began it not, nor intended it, to imploy
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50605:32"/>
or please the curiosity of wise men, but to satisfie a Fool, (I mean my self) who could not rest well contented, till he saw some cause of his vagrancies and infirmities set down to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in writing, which his memory and intellect could not so well retain, but catch at a little by turns and fits. I have done it, I say, to gratifie my self, make me legible to my self at any time, and that in the plainest and easiest dress I could, for such a subject; for he who thinks to put himself into an artificial Garb, may be sooner admired than known, and with the same device at once deceive himself and others.</p>
               <p>I am enforced to use some Metaphors, and to resemble the Soul to various things, because I well know not to say what it is; for if any man shall ask me yet what I think of the Soul, I can give him no other answer than what <hi>Symonides</hi> did <hi>Hiero</hi> upon his question, What he thought of God, and that was, The more he thought on it, the more difficult he found it to be known.</p>
               <p>What this wandring Soul of man is, or whereto it may be likned, cannot be expressed otherwise than from it self, and then it is very apt to express it self in such terms, as it is most familiarly acquainted with; so as if <hi>Tully</hi>'s Musician thought the Soul to be an Harmony, or a Mathematician think it to be made up of Numbers; why may not I think the Soul to be a Law, and its faculties Bandyings in several Courts, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be the Chancellor, which holds a Court of Equity and Conscience, whereto all others ought to submit: and herein I should not altogether vary from St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who terms the contracombatant faculties of his Soul, <note n="d" place="margin">Kom 7.23.</note> 
                  <hi>A Law in his members, warring against the Law of his mind.</hi> Indeed the Soul of man is from its several faculties in perpetual warfare, and therefore I hope I shall not be blamed in my ensuing discourse, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it to an Army with Banners, which may be no less pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per than any of the other. In the mean while, and for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, I hope I may here take the liberty to compare it to, and think it a fruitful piece of Inclosure, while it remains here on Earth, best dressed and manured by it self, and most fructife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous from it self, where Native Seeds thrive and flourish better than Foreign: And therefore I think it becomes every man to be a good Husband at home, not be like some Travellers, who know most Countries better than their own, but first search into the nature of his own Soil, as the most ready way and means to discover others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:50605:33"/>There is something like a Tree of Knowledge in every man, and therefore it were best, according to my thoughts, to let it have some good rooting first, and that the strings thereof may extend and spread themselves to every Angle, before a man think of transplanting any part thereof to another Soil; for we are too willingly apt and prone, either to have that Tree of so large a dimension and circumference in its Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that it should drop its Fruits, and influence rather upon any Foreign Soil, than it self; or else we would have it raised to that excessive height, that it is in great danger of blasting. We usually think to improve our intellect very preposterously, we grasp at Heaven, and think to comprehend our Maker, and all his secret and unfathomable decrees, by our Reason, (whose goodness and mercy it is at last, if we can apprehend any thing of him by Faith) and so while we would know him, forget our selves, and while we forget our selves, become quite uncapable of knowing him. Therefore first let us muster up all our intellectual powers, seriously view their abilities, find how little power we have over them, see how weak they are, consider they are precarious and lent us; and then perhaps we shall at last perceive and know, He is, what we are not, nor capable to comprehend, nor conceive his ways, and begin to pray for a second <hi>Emitte Spiritum,</hi> of Sanctification, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that of his Creation. Let us first, I say, take care of the root, look within, see that that canker not or consume, dig about and dress it: For though it be requisite our knowledge extend further than our selves, yet there I think it ought to begin; there we should first plant and water, and expect the increase.</p>
               <p>I am somewhat convinced, that had we no other light than that of Reason (the Lieutenant, if not the Captain and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of our first created Souls) first imprinted in our Nature, to guide us in this Vale of misery, we could not justly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of a total insufficiency: And I am convinced further, that we have in some sort and degree, ability to blow up this covered spark to some light and flame, and by its help to make a fair progress on our way; and therefore that it is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, if not necessary, that every man try how far this light will direct him; or if he make not use of it as a light, make use of it as a Staff, to feel out his way, put some stress upon it, and when he feels it weak and bend, then cry out for other help and assistance; but by no means lay his whole weight
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50605:33"/>
on it, lest it break under him, and wound him with its Splinters.</p>
               <p>I am afraid it is too common an error amongst us, wholly to reject the Lawyers maxim, which suffers or <hi>allows no man to disable himself</hi>; and when we are bid to work out our Salvation with fear and trembling, expect it should be done with a bare contemplative Faith of ours, without any other co-operation at all; that we abolish and smother all Law written in our hearts, and expect Grace should be sent us as a hoodwink to Reason; as if that must necessarily obstruct Reason from see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing her self, which in truth is only to enlighten her anew, and in that part only wherein she remains defective. For though for want of such Grace, the old Philosophers might be said not to see aright, or so clearly as they might, and so fail in the main; yet if, like some of us, they had trusted only to a supernatural Light, they might have failed in the mean, as well as the end: whereas the best of us might wish to tread in the same steps with them in Moral Virtues, whatever they met with at their Journeys end.</p>
               <p>I think we are apt and in danger to destroy our Souls by an extreme hot, or an extreme cold Poison, absolute power, or absolute impotence; whereas if we beheld our power and our impotence at one view, and joyned the exercise of our past gift, with the invocation of new, we might make of them both together a Sovereign <note n="e" place="margin">— <hi>faciet discreta venenum, Antidotum sumet qui sociata bibit.</hi>
                  </note> Cordial. Indeed though I do look upon it as impossible, that we should be perfectly restored again to the first image of the Father, but by him only, who is the Eternal image of the Father; yet I think it very necessary to observe the character of his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner and Harbinger St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> to <note n="f" place="margin">Luk. 3.4, 5.</note>

               <p>The nature and original of the Soul, its faculties and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, its power and strength, or weakness, is the sight I have desired to behold; it is the Jewel which I have held fit to be solely trusted with none but my self, and its proper Physician; (as fot rhe Caskonet or Carkass, I am very willing to leave it to the common Physician, without great care or thoughts of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50605:34"/>
knowing its composure or disposition;) I am willing to see its defects, and have it healed, and yet while I am a going about that, I do not think my self capable of dissecting it, so as to lay every part of it open to my own or others view, or to find out every winding, turn, or motion of it. I believe it to have originally so much of the image of its Maker, that we shall confess upon search, it is inscrutable; and now since its defection, is become such an obliterate and blurred Copy of that image, that 'tis scarce in part legible: But yet withall, it hath such marks of a Divine work still remaining in it, as it is able in some measure to behold its own defects. And I bless God mine is not so far in love with the first transgression, as to repeat it over again, or <hi>desire to know</hi> any thing further than may tend to God's glory, and its own and others good and well-being; and therefore what I aim at, or desire to see or know, is with all humility and submission, and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my wants and needs of supply.</p>
               <p>Yet if in the disquisition and search, after my plain way and manner, I shall prove any whit profitable, or helpful to any other hereafter to know, and thereby somewhat better to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern himself, that God may be glorified thereby, I shall not think I have herein exercised my little Talent altogether vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and amiss.</p>
               <p>I have in my search into this curious and admirable work of the Divine power, (the Soul of man) endeavoured to move by the light of Truth; a thing of which the Soul by and from the Divine goodness, now and then receives some glimmering light, or lively glance only, even in the very inferiour works of Nature, and things of a lower Orb than it self: How much more Divine is that light, which ariseth upon the search into her self! If I have failed of this light, or strayed from the truth, I most humbly beseech that God of truth, and Fountain of light, <hi>which lightneth every one who cometh into the world,</hi> to shine more graciously upon some other, who may hereafter correct and amend my simple-meaning errors. It is certainly the chiefest honour, and highest dignity (if not the greatest happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness) Humane Nature is capable of here in this Vale below, to have the Soul so far enlightned, as to become the Mirrour, or Conduit, or Conveyer of God's truth to others. And if men were able to discern her aright, Truth would be readily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced by all, in any dress whatsoever, nay plain and naked, as she most often appears and presents her self. But there are so
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50605:34"/>
many false lights, and such a strange and various impression on, or representation of things, that neither he that gives, nor he that receives, can rest fully assured the Coin is pure, however it may pass, or become currant.</p>
               <p>I dare not in any case recommend my thoughts or opinion, as void of falshood and absurdity, or seeming contradiction; yet this I presume to say, I have scraped together some such Materials, as rightly placed and taken, or a little better mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shalled or beautified, by some wise, sober and judicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, might open a way in some measure to let in the light of God's truth into the Soul of men. And to such a person I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend and dedicate these my Papers, (without borrowing for a Patronage any Great man's name, or daring to affix my own) as a ground-work for him to build on; and I should rejoyce to rest assured any one would undertake or undergo that labour.</p>
               <p>I have but this (I think reasonable) request, to any man about to quarrel with these Papers, That he take some consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and bethink himself, whether he may not wrong or prejudice his own Soul: Because I will affirm nothing in them, as a matter of truth, with so much confidence and assurance, as this one thing here, that is, if he desire tranquility and peace of mind, (the greatest worldly blessing imaginable, and the thing I seek after) he shall never so readily attain it, by any narrow search into the errors and extravagancies of my Soul for dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation sake, as by passiug them with pity and commiseration for God's sake, who best knows whereof we are both made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> remembreth our frame, and how subject we are to mistakes. And I hope that no man will before-hand, from the Spirit of pride and contradiction, raise up a Tower or Fortress for his own intellect, from thence to summon all others to vail and come in; but let mine (or other such like) pass as a poor Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, that chiefly intends to see Countries, bring back some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what it may be for its own support, and possibly too for the support of some others, of a like or little inferiour capacity; though its Wares have no such flourish or signature on them, as may make them vendible, or prized by the Merchants of this Age.</p>

                  <head>SECT. I. How far the Soul of man is similar with that of Brutes.</head>
                  <p>I Think it may appear somewhat plain and obvious to the meanest capacity, that the Soul of man is endowed with three distinct prime or principal faculties, whereby it appears to work; and those are, 1<hi>st<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> the Affections, 2<hi>ly.</hi> the Will, and 3<hi>ly.</hi> the Intellect or Understanding: which last is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly reduced to, and made to terminate in these three facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, 1. Imagination, 2. Memory, 3. Reason. For to say more, or make any further enumeration at present, were to fall upon my second limited subject, which I intend to handle more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in its proper place, and might perhaps confound my self and others with strange notions in the beginning, which I intend not.</p>
                  <p>All these distinct faculties or operations, we cannot well deny to be inherent and discernible in the wiser (if I may so say) sort of Brutes: The two first, <hi>viz.</hi> Affections and Will, I suppose every man will grant to be apparent in the less seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intelligent Animals, and therefore I'le not trouble my self to demonstrate after what manner they love, and fear, or the like, nor dispute about their voluntary motions, nor whence that voluntary motion may proceed, whether from sense or passion, or sometimes intellect. For though I believe there is not a Sparrow that lighteth upon the House-top, without a Divine providence, yet I think it had a will to light on the House-top, as well as I to write, and could not be said to have an involuntary motion, like an Arrow shot thither out of a Bow, for in all involuntary motion, there is requisite a second discernible working cause, as well as a first cause. But my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry concerning them, shall be only in those three faculties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the intellect <hi>viz.</hi> Imagination, Memory, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; none of which, I know well how to deny to be in several kinds of creatures, in some sort, beside man.</p>
                  <p>And first for Imagination, which is the representation of some image, or apparence in the Soul, not at present intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by sight, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore may as well be sleeping as waking: Though otherwise there appear no ground to us of their imagination, (which is internal) yet such an effect there is often seen in them, as cannot proceed from any other cause,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50605:35"/>
but some internal image of an outward object: And this is discernible in sleeping Hounds and Spaniels, whose bodies from thence are moved and agitated, with such kind of motion and accompanied noise, as if they were in pursuit and quest of their imagined prey or game.</p>
                  <p>For Memory, he who denies its being in the Soul of Beast, either believes not, or has forgot the story of <hi>Darius</hi> his Horse; or has not seen or observed the common course of Dogs, and other creatures, in hiding and covering their acquired food, and upon occasion going as readily or dexterously, as I may say, to the place, as any man could; or has not been himself a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Master or Rider of Horses, some of which in a maze of ways and turnings, shall with the liberty of his Rein, bring his Master to his accustomed home; and indeed it's strange to see divers creatures brought from their usual and accustomed place of residence, after some time of stay by reason of some let and hindrance, to return again many miles to their old abode; which they could never so readily do, nor could be effected, as I suppose, without the aid and help of what we call Memory.</p>
                  <p>Our chief enquiry will be, whether we shall in any case allow them Reason, which we have already so appropriated to our selves, that we have differenced our Nature and Being from theirs in that only notion. Toward the resolution of which, we must enquire and define what Reason is; now if Reason be only a conception by speech, whereby we are able to explicate our minds and thoughts, as some would have it, we may well deny it to all creatures but our selves: but if it be a discerning faculty of the Soul, by which we judge with any election or choice, what is or may be good or hurtful to it, or to the body; what is good, and what is evil; what to embrace, or avoid, we cannot deny it, in some measure, to be in meer Animals. Whatever distinction is made between In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct and Intellect, when the word Reason is taken away from them, and the word Fancy allowed to supply the place, I do not think it amiss to admire God in them; and though the best of their faculties quite differ in the extract from ours, yet they are the work of the same God in a different manner; and wonderful it is, to see such faculties, as we must needs allow them by some title or other, to proceed from a corporeal substance, only attenuated and rarified (as I shall say anon) and so similar to ours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:50605:36"/>They were created with us, for our use and service, and all for God's glory; and if we made a right use of our own ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal faculty, we should neither sometimes vilifie them as we do, nor at other times extoll and enlarge their faculties beyond their due limits and bounds, seeming rather desirous of having our own understanding admired among our selves, by am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification of theirs, than making any true state of our diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent cases, thereby shewing our invention rather than our knowledge.</p>
                  <p>This we cannot but truly acknowledge, that they (having had no such lapse or fall as we) work more wisely, regularly and orderly, in reference to the end they were created, than we; and whoever shall duly look into their manner of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and more narrowly observe what kind of cunning, or stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem some of them use either in acquiring their food, or else preserving or saving themselves from dangers, must needs afford them the attribute of Reason, or somewhat tantamount to it. What subtle ways do some of them use towards the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining their desired prey? what intrigues and fetches (to let pass ordinary stories) may a man see in a poor imprisoned Fox, how he will sometimes counterfeit himself dormant, till a prey be within his reach? what ways have many Fowls to uncase a poor Shell-fish? I my self have seen a Crow, not able to swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a large Acorn, nor break it with her Bill, leave the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture Fields where she first found it, and mounting with it a considerable height, let it fall in a Stony ground, as if the very place were chosen out of Reason, and repeat that action near twenty times, and till I have disturbed her in it. I have credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly heard, (and once saw it at a Chalk-pit) that a Hare in a course, has taken directly to a precipice, and upon a sudden stopping at the edge thereof, has cast down head-long her pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing Dogs, and that this poor creature has repeated this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on again at other times: And what origine of this cunning or sagacity can I give, but something like Reason; it being a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct act, and not deducible from the common natural instinct of that creature, whose every days and nights work for the preservation of her self (visible in a Snow) seems so prudent, that it would puzzle the wisest of us to find out or contrive so safe ways of artifice.</p>
                  <p>Well, if we cannot afford them Reason, let us not take from them those attributes the Scripture has allowed them, of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty and wisdom, which in our selves we esteem but as the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50605:36"/>
effects and fruits of Reason. The Serpent in the beginning was said to be more subtle than any Beast of the Field; and our Saviour has admonish'd us, to assume the Serpent's wisdom, with the Dove's innocency. The <hi>Ant is an exceeding wise creature,</hi> says <note n="a" place="margin">Prov. 30.24.</note> 
                     <hi>Agur,</hi> and to her <hi>Solomon</hi> sends his <note n="b" place="margin">Prov. 6.6.</note> 
                     <hi>sluggard</hi> to School; and some Philosophers have termed that creature (amongst others) Political. And we are told in other places of Scripture of the Ox, and the Ass, and the Crane, and the Turtle, and the Swallow, by way of exprobation, as if those creatures did often exceed us in the foresight and knowledge of those things which tended towards their own preservation. And surely there is such a kind of forecast and wisdom in most, if not in all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures besides Man, that I cannot well tell how to appropriate the word Reason to Man alone; unless we distinguish our selves in the very work of our creation, and allow our whole Soul to be a coelestial durable flame, and Reason to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native inherent light therein, given to guide and direct all the other faculties, towards the attainment of some ultimate end, or enjoyment of some future permanent bliss and happiness; and not barely for the preservation of the visible Body, nor arising or springing merely from any passion of mind, by the bare inlet of sense. Such a Reason (I may call it Right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son) as beholds things at a distance, and weighs future events, and distinguishes us from all other creatures, as <hi>Aesop</hi> has distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd one of his Frogs from the other. That is, by our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son we are capable to foresee a possibility of failure of all things here, and thereby prevent our falling into those gulfs (for the satisfaction of our present lusts) from whence we cannot after get out, which no other creature is. Indeed many other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures besides our selves, from that natural instinct of self-preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, (common with us) and fear of destruction, have had some short flashing light of ratiocination, (if I may so call it) and by that sudden flash (quickly extinct) elected or chosen the most likely place, for a present continuing preservation, and upon failure of water in the Brook, have got down into a Well; but no creature, save Man, ever yet beheld events at a distance, and so weighed time and place, as before-hand to take care, upon failure of water in the Well, how to get out again, as <hi>Aesop</hi> makes his later Frog to do; which thing indeed, is properly and peculiarly an act of Right Reason.</p>

                  <p>NOw at present to leave all other creatures acting accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their abilities, more regularly than our selves; it would not be amiss here humbly to search into, and behold our own, and see how we act by a distinct and separate gift, with abilities beyond and exceeding the natural capacities of any other visible creature. In search of which, it will be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that we have recourse to our original frame; and because that is already set down to us (according to my capacity) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the invention, or just exception or correction of the most subtle opponent, I will search no furthet than the Books of <hi>Moses,</hi> and behold the Creation as he has described and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neated it; wherein it is observable, that after the Creation of Heaven and Earth, and the separation of light from darkness, and the gathering together of the Waters, and the appearance of dry Land, when he speaks of the formation of living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, 'tis not expressed as before, <hi>Let there be Light,</hi> and <hi>Let there be a Firmament, &amp;c.</hi> but <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 1.24.</note> 
                     <hi>Let the Earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, &amp;c.</hi> plainly intimating, that in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position there was no addition of new Matter or Spirit added, but only together with their Earthly visible Bodies, a <hi>product</hi> Soul of a corporeate substance, attenuated and rarefied, and so not capable of acting beyond its native original. But when he comes to the formation of Man, it's said, <note n="b" place="margin">Vers. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>God created him in his own image,</hi> and <note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 2.7.</note> 
                     <hi>breathed into his nostrils the breath of life,</hi> and says the Text, <hi>Man became a living Soul.</hi> So as there seems to be from thence, not only a gradual, but a specifick difference, between the Soul of man, and that of all other creatures; for that of other creatures, being immediately made out of the same Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with the Body, is no other than a fluid bodily substance, the more lively, subtle and refined part of the Bloud, (called Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) quick in motion, and from the Arteries by the branches of the Carotides carried to the Brain, and from thence conveyed to the Nerves and Muscles, moves the whole frame and mass of the Body; and receiving only certain weak impresses from the senses, and of short continuance, hindred and obstructed of its work and motion, <hi>vanishes into the soft air.</hi> But the Soul of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50605:37"/>
man being <hi>breathed into him by God,</hi> and the main principle of his life being derived from that infusion, must be consequently of the like nature with that breath it proceeded from, and so be immaterial and immortal. And we shall find this difference further confirmed by the same Authority: For whereas <hi>Moses</hi> gives no other Life or Spirit different from the bloud to other creatures, but saith, <note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 9.4. Levit. 17.11. Deut. 12.23.</note> 
                     <hi>the bloud is their life,</hi> (or Soul) and <hi>their Soul in the bloud</hi>; when he speaks of that of man, he calls it <note n="e" place="margin">Gen. 9.5.</note> 
                     <hi>the bloud of their lives,</hi> signifying by this variety of phrase, the difference of the thing, and that in man the bloud has rather its motion from the Soul, than the Soul its origine from the bloud. And in the ensuing verse, where he forbiddeth the shedding mans bloud, by a retaliative Law, he adds again the words used in the Creation, <note n="f" place="margin">Vers. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>For in the image of God made he man</hi>: So that the Souls of Brutes only appear, as the Tongues mentioned in the Acts, <hi>as it were of fire</hi>; but that of Man, as a spark of that Eternal Light, real and durable, and as <hi>Solomon</hi> says, after <note n="g" place="margin">Eccles. 12.7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>NOw though this Earthly rarified Spirit of Brutes, may to sense often outshine the other, and several other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures may outstrip some such particular men, as we call Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, in knowledge; that diminishes nothing from, nor renders the Soul of man to be of a less noble extract than in truth it is, but that the one still remains Divine, and the other Natural: For although real Fire may by hid, and by reason of some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, impediment or interposition, dart forth little or no light to the senses, and an <hi>ignis fatuus</hi> may shew it self, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more lucid and bright to them; yet Fire is no less Fire when covered, and the nature and quality of them still remains different. The outward appearance does never infallibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate the inward excellency of things, and there may be a change of our common Proverb, and Gold found that glisters not.</p>
                  <p>It seems to me rather some Argument of the immortality of mans Soul, that it sometimes remains so darkly, as it were, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed in some one particular trunk or carcass, without any the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50605:38"/>
least symptom of its being there, more than outward heat and motion; as well as that in some others, it shews forth its won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful capacity, and faculties beyond that of all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: For if it did arise naturally, or had its production from the flesh, or the more fluid substance of that flesh, the Bloud, as that of Beasts, there never could happen or be such a dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, such a distance and disproportion in its effects, as now and then there appears. The faculties of the Souls of Beasts, wherein they are similar to those of Man, do not much exceed or outshine one another of the same <hi>species</hi>: For although one Horse may be more docible than another, more lively, quick, or better spirited (as we term it) than another; yet there never was that, or any other kind of Brute, so brutish (as I may say) but had some knowledge of his Feeder, and like the Ox and the Ass (none of the wisest Animals) could know its Owner, and its Master's Crib; none that would not shew some endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to nourish and preserve it self, be sensible of what was noxious and destructive to it self, careful to avoid Fire and Water, or the like, know its Young (if Female) and love and nourish them, and be somewhat useful in its kind to man, and other creatures; as if the Souls of Beasts only dwelt in their native and proper Country, and were at liberty; and ours were here Prisoners in Chains and Fetters, and sometimes in a Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, waiting for their deliverance.</p>
                  <p>I knew a man born in a Village near me, living to the age of twenty years, very heathful, of a good stature, of perfect outward lineaments and features, endowed with the senses of Hearing and Seeing, of a sage countenance, (if at any time without motion) and yet never, as I or others could discern, knowing any one person about him more than another, never making any signs for meat or drink, though greedily swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them when put to his mouth; never could he be made sensible of the passage of his own ordure, or of Fire or Water, and yet might be kept at any time from the danger of those Elements, by the interposition of Stools, or a Line or Cord, and within that circumscribed Sphere would move all day ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously. Certainly if this inclosed Soul had its being from the Bloud, and not the Bloud its motion from it, (whatever Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians may alledge, and however they may guess at some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions or defect in some part of the Brain, and they can but guess at the one, more then I do at the other, for they can shew me nothing in a dissection) it must in some degree equal
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50605:38"/>
that of Brutes, in outward appearance. But seeing there is such a disproportion in degree of knowledge, as well by comparing the most stupid Man with the most stupid Animal, as the wisest Man with the wisest Animal, and Man is found to exceed both ways; that very excess on our parts, does more demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the immediate work of God in our creation, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what different from Natures ordinary course, (which though his working too, usually produces the same effects in all indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals of the same <hi>species</hi>) and might prove a Medicine to allay our fears on the one hand, and our spiritual pride on the other; and shew what the Soul of man is capable of, and yet how obscure it may be here on Earth, till it shall please that Inspirer to receive it into Glory.</p>
                  <p>I do not look on knowledge in the Soul of man as a bare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, or that the mind of man is at present, and while in the Body, merely thereby let and hindred from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all things; yet some such notion may not seem to arise and be fixed now and then in our conceptions, altogether without the allowance of Reason: since as often as we attain to any intellectual knowledge of things, that is from causes whereof we were, or seemed before ignorant, (and that either from the bare labour and search of our intellective faculty, or from others information through sense, with its attention) it will seem to us rather a recovery from some disease, than any new being, or existence in the Soul; rather a dissipation of some Cloud, than any new Light, and that we knew as much before, if we had but minded it, as we are wont to say. And besides the usual native weakness, or blindness in the Soul of man, (which is a thing almost perpetually labouring and working in some men as it were for a cure) if it recovers in some sort and measure, yet it's afterward very incident to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapse, and subject to an adventitious weakness or blindness, doth contract infirmities, and often lives long in the Body, blinded with a <hi>delirium,</hi> dotage or frenzy: whereas in all other creatures, their life terminates quickly after the beginning of any visible <hi>delirium</hi> in them, or decay of their native or natural homebred intellect, as I may call it.</p>

For though Beasts see as we do, hear as we do, tast as we do, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and have the like passions of desire and joy, fear and sorrow, with their concomitants, yet their senses may be satisfied, and their passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons circumscribed, within the same Elements from whence they have their Original.

                  <p>For I find no sufficient ground to think or believe, that Man is endowed with two Souls; the one consisting of motion, sense, passions or affections, and natural; the other rational, supernatural, and Divine: For though while annexed to a Body here, it shews its divers faculties, whereof in another World it may not make the same use, and some of the senses will need no imployment about such objects as they receive into them here; yet so far forth as they can add any thing to our happiness hereafter, we may imploy them, and they are an essential part of this Divine, and never-dying Soul; and that in some sence and manner we may <hi>tast</hi> and <hi>see</hi> how good and gracious our Lord and Maker is. We often term the inferiour faculties of the Soul brutish, sensual, and filthy, not that they merely arise from the flesh, but for the like reason as St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls Envy, and Pride, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

But they are still faculties of the Soul, and, as such, are neither extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished in the regeneration of it here, nor (as far as is consistent with the perfection of it, and its state of separation) in glory hereafter. I think the Soul of man to be an Host or Army, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in its march for the recovery of its proper Country; in which march, though some of the Rascal multitude will be laggering behind, and be busie to make provision for the flesh; yet they are accounted as part of the Army, and triumph with the rest after Victory, and acquiring their native Soil, or else suffer with the rest upon an expulsion. Undoubtedly we may love and joy (and I know not why one kind of <note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 28.8.</note>

Now because the very restlessness and inconstancy of the senses and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons here, shews them part of a Soul, that will have being and continuance after death; I will therefore a little behold man in comparison with other creatures, and try first how far our very senses and affections differ from those of Beasts; and after see what more noble kind of faculties there are in us, which they want.</p>

I speak thus much for this cause only; that viewing the Soul of man in its very inferiour faculties, and finding it so various and disagreeing, so little at a stay or at rest, so fighting and combating, so snatching and catching at it knows not what, things neither useful nor profitable for the body, or the mind; it somewhat convinces me, 'tis a thing very capacious, and that there is a place of fulness of joy, or fulness of sorrow for it hereafter.</p>

                  <p>BEsides this, some enquiry might be made into the different qualities of the Souls of men, beyond those of Beasts, in their ordinary workings; though they inhabit or actuate Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which have their being from one and the same producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For if the Soul of man were the ordinary work of Nature only, a fine rarified vigorous quality in the Bloud, Man recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his body from his Parents, by the ordinary course of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as other creatures do, his Soul would always somewhat resemble that of his Parents too; and Brethren (twins espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially) would resemble one another, in the faculties of their Souls, as well as 'tis often seen they do many ways in the Body. But there is generally found (as between <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Esau</hi>) such dissimilitude in the Spirits of Brethren, and those of Father and Son, Mother and Daughter, as greater is not to be found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween meer strangers in bloud; which thing daily experience will not only demonstrate upon search, but may be readily found in the Histories of Princes in all Ages. Now the Soul of Beast being the bare product of flesh only, and necessarily ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king its rise and essence from the substance of its Parents, (if I may so call them, for the word may be proper enough, <hi>pario</hi> being only to bring forth, or produce) never varies much, or

And besides this variation of the Souls of men from Birth, there sometimes happens on the sudden a strange kind of total Metamorphosis of the Soul of man, so as one would scarce adjudge it the same, but according to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture phrase, that one becomes <hi>a new man</hi>; and this without any alteration at all of the Bodies constitution. Now if the Soul of man were not a substance of it self, capable to be wrought on <hi>ab extra,</hi> by somewhat, without any introduction by the senses, then no such alteration (without the Bodies alteration) could be made but through the senses; and if such alteration were made from sense, through the Organs of the Body, then upon the shortest obstruction, or letting in of <hi>prior</hi> forms again, the Soul would consequently return to its pristine state, according to that simile of <hi>the dog to his vomit, &amp;c.</hi> which change, or alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the Soul of man, we see sometimes settled and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, notwithstanding all interposition during a long fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing life.

                     <hi>perfect hatred,</hi> that which was formerly their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; which kind of hatred, never yet happened, or was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernible in Beast.</p>
                  <p>Now if any man shall ask me, At what time the Soul of man, being a substance of it self distinct from the Body, enters and possesses the Body? I can make him a reply with as diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult a question; At what instant doth this other arising product Soul from the Bloud, begin its circulation and move? If we know neither, why should it seem more wonderful and strange to us for the God of Nature, upon man's conception in the womb, to create and have ordained a Spirit, to actuate that conception, (which Spirit should continue for ever, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that conception should decay and perish for a time) as well as that there should arise a Spirit from the Bloud, to actuate, move and govern the Body, for a certain period of time? which time we could never define certainly, from any course of Nature. And further, that the wise Creator and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50605:41"/>
of all things, should ordain, that if the first created Spirit to inhabit a Body (both together being Man) should wander in disobedience from its Creator; all others, sent and entring into Bodies, product from the Loyns of the first Body, should be infected with the same wandring disease, and have no cure, but by Grace from the first Creator? But I would not wander too much my self, nor desire to pry into any of God's secrets, further than he has thought fit to reveal by his Holy Word; and so shall lay aside my thoughts of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Man's creation, every way wonderful, (as the <note n="c" place="margin">Psal. 139.14.</note> Psalmist expresses it) as also the consideration of the inferiour faculties for the present, and try and see if there be not some sparks in the Soul of man, which give such a light, as can by no means naturally arise, from any thing barely and simply terrestrial.</p>

                  <p>WHy has the Soul of man in all Ages, when it has been at any time withdrawn from that quick intromission of worldly objects by the senses, and has not been hindred or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed by some mists, fogs, or lets of the flesh, wherein at present 'tis confined to work, hunted after, wearied and tired it self, to find out and comprehend, what it is not able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend? The first sin of man shewed at once, the Soul's er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and its extract and being: For the very innate desire of some distinguishing knowledge of good from evil, could not have its motion from sense, nor ever was introduced by sense. There is a kind of knowledge springs it self from sense, as the Ox knows his owner, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but knowledge by causes, such as it is, is peculiar to Humane nature, and has no relation to sense: Know indeed, so as to comprehend, we cannot, knowledge in the abstract being the peculiar of the Divine nature. If we had been capable to have known good and evil absolutely, the Devil had used no Hyperbole in telling us, <note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 3.<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Ye shall be as Gods.</hi> But the very desire of knowledge, even such a knowledge as the Soul is in some measure capable of, that is by causes, shews a Divine spark in us, tending towards the cause of all causes; which exercised about God's revealed will here, might be more clear, but mounting in desire, is apt to lose its light, and vanish.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:50605:42"/>Nay not only our desire, but our fear or doubt of somewhat we know not, nor can perfectly attain to by our search, nor is reasonable fully to demonstrate, must necessarily have its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine from somewhat more than sense. If we (at least) fear a future being, and continuance for ever, and future punishment, that very fear is either native, and natural in our Souls, or else arises in us from the Tradition of some others; if from Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then sense being the Port and Inlet, I allow to be Parent too; but yet while we allow it to spring from Tradition in our selves, we do by consequence allow it to be native in some one particular person; and he who allows it native in any one, must allow the Soul to be a substance of it self, and not a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultance from the Body; for thoughts of infinity could never first spring from a bare temporary finite existence. I said I would lay aside the inferiour faculties of the Soul from my thoughts: Desire and fear are affections, I agree, common to Brutes; I know they desire and fear, but I dare say never any one of them, yet, desired knowledge, or feared any thing to happen after this life; and therefore these (as they are in us) being, in respect of the object, no such affections as are led by sense, or work by sense barely, and so not having their essence from the Body; are not to be accounted amongst the other inferiour faculties, common with Brutes. But to proceed and go a little higher.</p>
                  <p>Whence arise those <hi>accusing or excusing thoughts</hi> (mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 2.15.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi>) in the Soul of man, though wholly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Scripture, and having no accession of new Light, so much as by Tradition? Certainly it must be some glimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that coelestial native spark of Justice implanted in every Humane Soul. I dare leave it without further pressure, to any quiet, sedate, reasonable Soul to determine, whether if there had never been any Divine or Humane Law, written or divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by Tradition, against Murther, but that that same fact by the Laws of his native Country were allowed, and approved, if done against meer Strangers; whether, I say, in case of that man's private imbruing his hands in his Brother's bloud, with no other colourable pretence or provocation, than some slight worldly gain; he should not, upon the consideration that we men made not our selves, but that every one was a fellow-member with other of the visible Universe, and of equal native extract, expect to find some inward regret, disgust, trouble, or vexation of mind? If he determine that he thinks he should;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50605:42"/>
the question will be, about that consideration, how it could arise? For we find that or the like consideration has risen, without the help of any outward Engine, or sense; nay when all the Spels imaginable, have been used and applied to allay it. Now no disgust or trouble, or sorrow was yet perceived in any other <note n="c" place="margin">

                     </note> Creature beside Man, upon the destruction of his fellow creature, or Man, the Sovereign of creatures. And whence is this, but because their Soul is not extensive beyond its original, nor has any motion but from sense, that is, it is not capable of any consideration: For consideration, weighing or pondering of a thing, whether it be good or evil, is a proper act of a reasonable Soul, distinct from a Body, and is somewhat more than desire of knowledge by causes. 'Tis the very exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of Reason; 'tis the Soul's waving of its senses for a time, and summoning its noble powers to tryal, which have some little native ability. This trying, considering, or weighing good from evil, by Reason, the ballance of the Soul, is, I say, the Soul's peculiar act, from which act there may be very proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (the <note n="d" place="margin">Hebr. 12.3.</note> Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> uses the like words) <hi>a weariness of the mind;</hi> and so it's distinguished and is different from such acts of the Soul, which <hi>Solomon</hi> saith are <note n="e" place="margin">Eccles. 12.12.</note>

                  <p>THe Soul of man does not only shew it self, and its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, by the aforesaid manner of withdrawing it self, or as it were by separation from the Body, to be above the capacity of a Soul extracted or springing from the flesh; but even by pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar actions and motions, through bodily Organs, which a bare earthly, or fleshly Soul does not. There are three things gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally held and esteemed proper and peculiar to Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and no ways incident to any other living creature whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50605:43"/>
and those are, Tears or weeping, Laughter, and Speech; in each of which, or from each of which, may seem to appear somewhat more in Man, than a product Soul part of the Body, or extracted or raised from the Body, though never so curiously or admirably framed. I do not alledge each of them apart, as any infallible demonstration of a Spirit, distinct and separable from the Body; yet coupled and joyned together, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of some seeming weight and strength to me, to confirm my opinion.</p>
                  <p>It does not seem much wonderful at any time, to behold a distillation from the Eyes; that thing is to be found in Beast, as well as Man, not only from a disease, or some distemper in the Bloud, but upon every offensive touch of the Eye; yet when neither of these are present, or can be alledged for a cause, to have the Body as it were melted on the sudden, and send forth its streams through that unusual channel, makes it seem to me no less than the quick and violent agitation of some Divine flame, thawing all the vital parts, and drawing the moisture through the chief and clearest Organ of the body, the Eye; and not to be caused by any thing, which is part of it self.</p>
                  <p>I do agree that every living Soul, whether arising from the Body, or by a greater Divine gift infused into, or sent to actuate a Body, has equally in either, some influence upon the visible Body, and according as the affections with the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are moved, worketh visible effects therein; and that Man and Beast, such as have their parts similar, may and do equally tremble for fear, and the like. But yet as to this kind of motion, or extasie mentioned, that is, weeping, (for I know not how to term that, or laughter either, a passion, but both strange atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants or consequents of some kind of passions) I cannot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge it to arise from the acceptance of a bare representation of an offensive object through sense, but by some inward distinct conception of a Soul, as of it self; though at the same time agitated or rouzed by passion. For if it were from the first barely, then the same effect could never proceed from any pleasing object; the contrary whereof we find, and men to weep as well upon the predominancy of joy in the Soul, as sorrow; nay weeping is a concomitant often of a weak anger, which not able otherwise to satiate or satisfie it self, has this help to vanish and resolve into tears, as may be observed in Women and Children.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:50605:43"/>Now tears being the attendant (the effect, as may seem to some) of clean contrary passions, such as joy and sorrow are, they cannot really be the proper, and bare effect of any passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; nor the sole work of any such Spirit, as is no other than the refined and most curious part of the Bloud: For that were able to cause only different effects, upon different occasions or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations, and still the same effect upon the same occasion, so far forth as we are able to look into the ordinary works of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

                     </note> wonder in searching after the original Spring-head of them in the Body.</p>
                  <p>If I should alledge or affirm Laughter to be some denotation, or demonstration of a pure intellectual Spirit, separable from a Body, and no ways arising from any other single or primary cause then such; I hope I should not incur the censure, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the subject of laughter to all men, though I might to some. By Laughter I do not mean a bare dilatation or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the mouth or lips, and other parts of the face; such a kind of grinning as is incident to Apes, and no less to Dogs, and such as in the latter we term fawning; a kind of habit, or faculty, some men take up for peculiar purposes, as seeming pleased with others actions, and sensible of some such involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary motion, voluntarily counterfeit one; nor yet any <note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>Perpetuo risu, pulmonem agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare solebat</hi> Democritus.</note> 
                     <hi>agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the lungs,</hi> with expulsion of breath, and other odd motions of the Body in others, whereby perhaps they would seem to please themselves: But I mean an absolute, involuntary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon some sudden slight pleasing touch of the Spirits, by some bare conception in the intellect, different in notion from what is represented by the senses.</p>
                  <p>It is a thing that differs much from true joy, and is often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted from men in their greatest griefs, and sometimes tortures of Body; as is storied of that Villain, who murthered the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> that in the midst of his pains, and while he was tormented with burning Pincers for a confession, laughed at the fall of a number of Spectators from a Scaffold. It is one of the first unnecessary (as I may say) motions in Infants; it is incident to wise men, as well as foolish, and old, as well as young, though not in the same measure or degree; and is, and happens sometimes, as well sleeping as waking.</p>
                  <p>Now I do take it to arise properly and peculiarly from the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50605:44"/>
intellect's judging on the sudden (though that Judgment is not always aright) of somewhat of folly, lapse, or oversight, in a rational creature; or some ill, or shrewd turn happening there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, which from prudence might have been prevented, and have been done or acted otherwise; and I do not judge it to arise (unless we will allow something of voluntariness in it, after the manner I spake before) upon any sight, or action pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from an irrational or brute creature. Therefore I do think, that I my self should not with <hi>Crassus</hi> the Grandfather of <hi>Marcus,</hi> that wealthy <hi>Roman,</hi> (as is so storied of him, and that he never laughed but that once) have laughed at the beholding an Ass eating of Thistles; (I think the Beast does it with a great deal of Art, to save the pricking of his mouth) but had I seen a man smelling on a Thistle, to gratifie that sense, and thereby in pricking his Nose, much more offended another, I do think I should have laughed.</p>
                  <p>Now though laughter be a thing more incident to the Fool, than the Wise, whose clearer Judgment is best able to correct its rise; yet it proceeds from apprehension of the intellect, ready to judge at all turns, and quickest often, in that notion, when weakest; and may denote at once, some kind of inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent wisdom, together with folly or frenzy in man; that we, being created to act most regularly and prudently, from a disturbed intellect, become often the most giddily erring, and foolishest of creatures; so as if <hi>Solomon</hi> said of mirth, <note n="c" place="margin">Eccles 2 2.</note> 
                     <hi>what doth it?</hi> he might well say of laughter, <hi>It is mad.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for Speech, which is a power or ability the Soul has, so to move the Tongue and other Organs of the Body, that from thence shall result such a modulation of the Air, that each ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Soul from an articulate voice, might apprehend others meaning and intent. This formation of words, made to be the Idea of the mind, appears not, nor could ever break out, from the earthly extracted Soul of other creatures: not that there is any absolute defect in their Organs, (for then no other Spirit could frame an articulate voice by them, and we must deny the Devil's speaking in the Serpent, and some other Spirit for a time in <note n="d" place="margin">St. <hi>Peter</hi> (2 Pet 2.16.) calls it man's voice, (<hi>the dumb Ass, speaking with man's voice, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad the madness of the Prophet</hi>) as if an articulate voice were man's peculiar here on Earth.</note> 
                     <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Beast) for they have curious and admirable Notes, and some of them have framed as plain a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, (with many other words) as man can utter; which has been a resultance from the ear, when they were taught, but no Index of the mind. This gift and power of Speech, I say, is the chief outward li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50605:44"/>
badge or cognizance of the Soul, by which Mankind is distinguished from, and hath the advantage of all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Brutes do indeed fellow together, and apprehend, and (if I may so say) understand one another by signs and inarti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate voices. And so we find Trade and Commerce main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained betwixt us and the <hi>Indians,</hi> and that Mutes do act and understand by signs to admiration. But whatever faculty is in the Beasts, or whatever necessity may have taught and brought Men to, (that could not converse by words) yet all the dumb signs in the World, though managed to the best advantage, can never equal the benefit we enjoy by Speech, when we can thereby communicate our thoughts, and maintain converse with freedom, ease, and pleasure. This indeed is the Soul and life of Society, and by the means of which we do as much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the other creatures in the happiness of it, as in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that guides it, which is our Reason.</p>
                  <p>We often abuse this Heavenly gift, (as other noble faculties of our Soul) and not only say in our hearts, (that is, silently by our actions) but some of us in our tongues, and by our Pens, That there is no such thing as an Immortal Soul in man, but 'tis a <hi>Chimaera</hi> first forged in some melancholick brain, and by consequence that there is no God. For I must agree that if it can be made out, that the World is a fortuitous juggling of Atoms, and our Souls are only a natural fine product from thence, and to vanish again with our Bodies; Nature, as we call it, and term it, is no such revengeful Deity, that we need fear the disobeying of her private dictates, but may safely challenge our tongues for our own, and say, Who is Lord over them? But surely we must want sense, to let in so many vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous works of Nature into our Souls view, or any thing of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to consider or judge of them after they are let in, or else we should be convinced from the wise disposition thereof, that there is somewhat more than chance, and that Nature it self (which is but a Law made by God to work by) has depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon some infinite eternal wise Being, (call it some men what they please) which we call God. And for our Souls im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, the seeds thereof sown in our hearts, and arising now and then in every one, into doubts and fears, if not more, must be strangely trampled on by some evil one, who is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to let self-valuation in man grow as rank as may be in any case, but this of the Souls immortality, when all besides it is vanity.

This <hi>Desire</hi> I suppose all men will agree to be no ways incident to Beasts; and therefore I beseech men for God's sake, that if at any time there arise a desire in them, or they wish, or would that others should speak well of them rather than evil, after their death; then, at that time, they would seriously consider, whether those motions are not from some Spirit, to continue a Spirit, after it leaves its earthly habitation, rather than from an earthly Spirit, a Vapour, which cannot act or imagine, or desire, or fear things beyond its continuance: For if the desire or fear of Posthume Glory, or Posthume shame or punishment, be congenial and connatural to all noble minds; it is a pregnant, and, I think, undeniable hint of their (possible at least) sempiternal existence after death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:50605:46"/>Now a probability of our Souls being and existence, and a possibility of its Eternal being after death, being as much as native reason can suggest, or inform any man, (for I do not think that any man from reason ever thought himself to be a God, and of Eternal existence <hi>à parte ante,</hi> as men say, but had a beginning, and by consequence if he had a beginning, his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, support and conservation, must necessarily depend on the same Eternal power that gave it beginning, and that from the withdrawing that conserving power, all things created have an end;) this probability and possibility from reason, methinks should create some prudence and watchfulness in man, and cause him (whensoever he feels some inbred light glowing in him, and yet after it has stirred, burns so dimly in him, that he knows not well which way to move) to implore the aid of the Author of our own and all other beings; and feeling some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing native, to seek after somewhat of Tradition too, to help it. And that if there may be collected from reason, some such thing in man, as a capacity of Eternal life, to make a <hi>quaere</hi> like him in the Gospel, what shall I do to know it, and inherit it, that is, enjoy it, or live it with joy; for fear at least otherwise we may so live, as that we would desire to die, and be extinct; and find cause, when nothing will help us, to call on inanimate creatures, even the Hills to cover us from his presence, with whom there might have been fulness of joy.</p>
                  <p>All men living agree the Creator of the Universe to be good and gracious, and loving to his creatures; therefore let us search into that, which the whole Christian World have always acknowledged to have been his Word; and if we find not from thence assurance of Eternal life, and by his Grace comfort from it, conclude it is not to be found, but not conclude before we have sought.</p>

                  <p>I Am now about to take the best view I can, or my Soul is capable to do, of its several faculties or operations, distinct and apart one from the other, and which together working in the Body, we call the Soul of man. What I have elsewhere said, is an intricate maze, full of little windings and turnings, not to be traced out, or fully discovered to it self. I may here further say, it is a brightness issued or darted from that glorious light; so shining, as somewhat to be seen and admired, not at present wholly comprehended. I never thought nor hoped to set down all that it is, but only somewhat that it is; we are not able to dissect the very case of it, so as to find out the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredth entry or passage for this Soul into the Body, whereby that <note n="a" place="margin">

The Soul must needs be of a more subtle nature than the Bloud, from which some would have it to arise in Man as well as Beast; and if that were granted, we could scarce discover all the motions of the one, without a perfect knowledge of the other; which it seems is yet wanting, and I am not desirous to lose my self in finding. All that I desire to find, is the cause and occasion of the Souls billows, rage, and tempestuousness, and what helps there may be towards the allaying them; to see whether our madness and folly, does not with the raging of the Sea, necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily require one and the same stiller and quieter.</p>

breathing, concoction, nutrition, excretion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And also ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of motion, not always, but admitting intermission, and this arising from an introduction by some sense, <hi>viz.</hi> the pressure of an external object, upon each peculiar Organ of the Body proper; and by the mediation of Nerves or Fibres, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed inward to the chief domicils of the Soul, (from whence in its primary motion, we are said to see, hear, feel, tast, or smell) and so receives some counterpressure or resistance, by stirring some Limb, and making some noise: which because seeming to depend upon some precedent fancy in our mind, and capable of intermission, we call <hi>Voluntary motion.</hi>

Now herein we often give several names, to one and the same
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50605:47"/>
Affection, according to its degree in working, or the subject matter upon which, or from which it worketh. We have Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sillanimity, Timorousness, Dastardliness, Cowardliness, Fear, Amazement, Dread, and Terrour, as well as the Latines have <hi>metus, formido, timor, pavor, tremor, terror, horror, exanimatio</hi>; and we have Love, Fondness, and Lust, as well as they have <hi>amor, dilectio, libido</hi>; and we have Anger, Wrath, Fury, as well as they have <hi>ira, excandescentia, furor</hi>; and we have Sorrow, Grief, Pensiveness, Mourning, as well as they have <hi>dolor, moeror, aerum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, luctus</hi>;<note place="margin">

But if we either sorrow at the apprehension of another's happiness,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:50605:48"/>
(which effect hath with us appropriated the word Envy to it self) or rejoyce at the apprehension of his unhappiness, which we may call <hi>malum mentis gaudium,</hi> then is our affection wrong-tuned and evil; yet all terminates in joy or sorrow; and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is indeed but a privation of joy, and those other many words are Coins made by us, to express our selves in. For Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, Malice, or the like, I cannot apprehend there is any such thing as either in Nature, that is, subsisting by it self, separate and diverse from other passions; that which we call Malice or Hatred, is but an evil desire, or wish, tending to the weakning or depressing, or removing that object, which we imagine ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structs the joy or comfort we would have, or should arise from the excessive evil Love of our selves, or others. And for Anger, which always has for his object to work upon, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing or other offensive, 'tis defined but <hi>ulciscendi libido,</hi> a desire of revenge; and according to the height of that act, (unless where it lights on inanimate things, and so accounted Folly) it may be termed Hard-heartedness, Oppression, Cruelty, or the like.</p>

                  <head>SECT. III. Of the rise of the Affections.</head>
                  <p>COncerning the rise of our passions or affections, my thoughts and conjectures, at present, are these: That there naturally is, in every thing and every creature, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially out of its place, some secret hidden appetite, desire, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, propension, proclivity, inclination, tendence or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, called which you will, to some place of rest, quiet, or good, but often receives lets or impediments in that its ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. And the Soul of man being an emanation from a Divine Essence, and God (as I may say) being the Center to which naturally it tends, until it come to that beatifick vision, it cannot be at rest. Now a rational Soul naturally working by Love, and Joy, in its fruition, for want of that fruition, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily and by consequence Desires and Sorrows; so as I do think Love and Joy, Desire and Sorrow, to be of the Essence of a Soul, wholly disjoyned from a Body, and rational acts of it, not properly passions; but when the Soul works in that manner through a Body, then are they called passions.</p>
                  <p>Now the Soul conjoyned to a Body, may have yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50605:48"/>
some love purely intellectual and rational, by some reflexion, and drawing in some amiableness as through the imagination, though it cannot fully, by the imagination, reach the proper object of love to it self; and this may be upon some consideration (a proper and peculiar act of an Humane Soul, as I have said) of some infinite power, goodness, and wisdom, in the creation and preservation of the Universe, of which it is a minute particle. And certainly the Soul of man may be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned now and then, to act in the Body, as if it were out of the Body, summoning its powers, and drawing its forces together, from some tending affection; as if it were about to take its flight, ravish it self from the Body, lay aside its senses for a time, and have no manner of commerce with them, but did see with other eyes, and seem to it self for a while as disjoyned from a Body. Which kind of motion has undoubtedly been selt (as I may say) and observed by some, in a pleasant healthful state, and more especially after waking from quiet rest. These gracious kind of prospects of the Soul, are cause sufficient to make any man cry out with St. <hi>Paul, cupio dissolvi, &amp;c.</hi> but these kind of extasies are short and rare, and the Soul is straightways forced to a return, and act again as usually, in and through a Body.</p>
                  <p>Now were it granted that no affection can move, but from the imagination, and that sense is the general Port and entrance into the imagination, (which thing at present I cannot grant, but believe the imagination may receive some stroke from that thing which I call a pure intellectual rational love, of which I shall have fitter occasion to speak, when I shall enquire which of the faculties of the Soul may seem primary in operation) yet I think even native reason in some men, is able so to throw a Vail over the senses, and frame the imagination, that there may be conceived in the imagination some more glorious and amiable thing, than it can well conceive; and from that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception it shall have readily attending it a sensitive love, as we call it, that is, a motion of the heart from some Nerves or Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, at least a fixation of the heart, not to move too extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but be readily obedient to the dictates of reason; and I see no ground why we should with reason hope, to quite dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>card them from its obedience, or have our passions and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons clean rooted up; lest by avoiding that, which one kind of Philosopher resembled to the Itch, that is, be always desiring and joying, loving and fearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we do light upon a kind
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50605:49"/>
of felicity, which another Philosopher resembled to the felicity of a Stock or Stone. I would not indeed willingly grieve, but I had rather sorrow, than never joy, and the one can never be inherent without the other, either rationatively or sensitively. Reason, I say, has some ability and power yet left since our fall, not only to correct and reduce the imagination, but to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and point it, to seek after somewhat; so that if all men should deny a pure rational love, they may grant there may be a good sensitive love. 'Tis true, the imagination from sense shews us no living creature better than our selves, and we are apt to see through it, as in a false glass, some amiableness in our selves, and so we become lovers of our selves more than lovers of God; yet that little strength of reason, does sometimes hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and stop the imagination from presenting that false glass, stays the affections from looking too much into it, wins the imagination to take part with it self for a while, in conceiving our vileness, and then by consequence forces it to represent to the affections some amiableness in that being, from whence all other things have their being, and without which we cease to be any thing; so as about some amiable good, do the affections always move, if they move.</p>
                  <p>From one of these two Mirrors, I say, do I think is the rise of the affections, <hi>quatenus</hi> working in a Body; the one of these Mirrors is clear yet false, and only of the imaginations framing from sense; the other is dark and cloudy, (unless amended by special grace) but true, and of reasons correcting. The root of each Tree of affections (whether bad or good) springing from hence, is Love. Neither can I upon my review, find cause to alter my opinion in my Treatise of comfort against loss of Children, but do think that some innate faculty of love, is the primary mover in the affections; and thus I think it may sprout up, and bring forth Trees of divers colour'd branches.</p>
                  <p>If we look in that false glass mentioned, and by reflexion have a good opinion of our selves, (which is from a love of our selves) there shoots out a branch, called Pride, or in short that is Pride. If we become mounted in thoughts to exceed others, that is Ambition; if we see some cause, as we think, that others should have a good opinion of us, that is Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory; if from this sight we are troubled that any other should seem to exceed us, and withall there be an endeavour in us to exceed them, that is Emulation; but if it be only to supplant or hinder them, that is Envy. If we espy any opposition in
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50605:49"/>
another, and behold that person as mean, and not able to hurt us, that is Contempt, which is a kind of contumacy or immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the heart; but if otherwise we discern an ability to hurt, it is Frowardness, Impatience, Fretting, Anger, Hatred, Malice, or Revenge, according to the nature of the Soil. And here certainly Love must be agreed to be the root, and to give being on either side. There is no man ever opposes, or does wrong for the wrongs sake; it is to purchase to himself pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, pleasure or repute, and that is from the love of himself; and therefore says <hi>Bacon</hi> wittily, If a man do me wrong, why should I be angry with him for loving himself, better than me? But to go on; If we look after, or espy ways or means to adorn, beautifie, and sustain our beloved selves, be it by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, Lands or Goods, that is Covetousness; if we espy a fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure in others of love mutual and reciprocal to our beloved selves, where 'tis expected, that is Jealousie; if we apprehend future danger or loss, it is Fear; if present, Heaviness, Sadness, Sorrow; if we espy any probable way or means of our acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, or adding to our acquisitions, Hope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And after this manner might I reckon the springing or growth of all evil affections whatsoever.</p>
                  <p>On the other side, if that true but dim glass be at any time presented, or set before us, and we receive any distant sight of an excellency and goodness in the Creator, and continual preserver of the Universe, our Love a little moves another way, and raises a Tree of other manner of affections: If we behold in that, his Power, his Justice, or his Love, there arises Fear; if his Mercy, then Hope, Joy, Comfort: If we apprehend him a Protector against all injury, Courage, Trust, and Fortitude; if a Revenger of wrong, Patience: If we espy his providence and care, there arises Contentedness; if we discern our own inability, Humility; if our own evil dealings to others, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; if our failings and errors, Trouble, Grief, and Sorrow; if affliction fallen on our Brethren, Pity and Compassion; and the like. And were my opinion asked of the ground and cause of the most Heroick, worthy, or pious particular action ever done in the World, I for my part should determine it in short, to be the parties love to God or himself; for if it be not the one that has made a man die willingly for his Country, (as the phrase goes) I am sure 'tis the other; if not Charity, some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of a perpetual lasting Fame of his memory, which is a love to, and of himself.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:50605:50"/>Now whatever men pretend, there neither is, nor was, nor will be any created Soul within a Body, wholly exempt from any one passion or affection whatsoever. And though some affections seem very contrary, so as not to subsist together at least in any height, or excess, (and therefore it was not without some wonder observed of <hi>Nero,</hi> if I remember aright, that he who singly beheld his Cruelty, would believe he had no Lust; and he who beheld his Lust apart, would believe he had nothing of Cruelty in him) yet they can, and do subsist together: And though some men may take their denomination from some one faculty or affection, chiefly and most commonly predominant; as for instance, it may be said <hi>Moses</hi> was a meek man, <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi> a proud man, <hi>Ionathan</hi> a loving man, <hi>Nabal</hi> a chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish man, <hi>Iehu</hi> a furious man, <hi>Ionah</hi> a pettish angry man, <hi>Ieremy</hi> a sorrowful man, <hi>Iob</hi> a patient man, and <hi>David</hi> a valiant man; yet for <hi>Moses</hi> the first, besides what some may collect from his slaying of the <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> we find sometimes <note n="a" place="margin">Num. 16.15.</note> 
                     <hi>he was very wroth;</hi> and for <hi>David</hi> the last, we find most kind of passions in him, at the full height and growth. And surely every living man may rightly cry out upon occasion to another, in the language of <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> 
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Acts 14.15.</note> 
                     <hi>I am a man of like passions with you</hi>: For 'tis but want of prospect from the imagination, (or otherwise God's grace) that any one affect or passion is silent and lurking, and shews not forth it self in man. Passions are not only acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental, but inherent, as <hi>David</hi> himself seems to hold, when he says, <note n="c" place="margin">Psal. 58.3.</note> 
                     <hi>The ungodly are froward from their mothers womb</hi>: And which our Saviour when in the flesh, was not exempted from; for though passion were in his power, I do not think those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, to be only seeming ones, but real effects; <note n="d" place="margin">Mark 3.5.</note> 
                     <hi>He looked on the Iews, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts;</hi>

                     <hi>He began to be sore amazed and very heavy, and his Soul exceeding sorrowful;</hi>

                     <hi>He sighed deeply in Spirit,</hi> which is an effect of sorrow; he <note n="h" place="margin">John 11.35.</note>

                     <hi>Ierusalem</hi>; and he commends passions, arising from a right spring and head, to us in his Sermon on the Mount, and pronounces a blessing <note n="k" place="margin">Mat 5.4.</note> 
                     <hi>on them that mourn</hi>; and therefore Humane Nature (however it may imprison and confine them) must not think to expell or banish them.</p>
                  <p>What part of the Body is the chief seat or receptacle of the affections, has been agreed by most men; and doubtless they rightly approve the heart to be their most frequented Cell, and I am of that opinion; but yet there is some doubt left for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50605:50"/>
whether some kind of passions do not principally move elsewhere, as Frowardness and Peevishness in the Spleen and Stomach, (and we use the word Stomach often for that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though <hi>Solomon</hi> indeed apply it to the heart, and says a <note n="l" place="margin">Prov. 17.20.</note> 
                     <hi>froward heart</hi>) Anger in the Liver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Scripture men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>bowels of compassion,</hi> and <hi>yerning of the bowels</hi>; and whoever has been a Father, has sometimes I suppose sensibly found a stroke deeper than his heart, and a heaviness that has imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately gone down to the very bottom of the belly. This is certain, that many passions are in an instant visible in all parts of the Body, as Fear in all the outward parts, Anger in the face, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> mentions a <note n="m" place="margin">Prov. 6.17.</note> 
                     <hi>proud look,</hi> as well as a <note n="n" place="margin">Prov. 21.4.</note> 
                     <hi>proud heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to leave all the Affections for a while, let us make some enquiry about their general supposed Father, from whence they are said to have their being and original, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Imagination,</hi> a faculty of the Intellect more nobly seated; and define and describe that.</p>

                  <p>THe <hi>Imagination</hi> I do take to be,<note place="margin">Imagination defined.</note> 
                     <hi>A strange admirable, though roving faculty of the Soul, more peculiarly scituate in the Brain, always working, sometimes,</hi> as it were, <hi>vainly working of it self</hi>; but more properly, <hi>the purveyor or hunter of objects for the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, sometimes set on work by them, controuled or recalled by them, and sometimes by Reason; sometimes obeying one or both, and sometimes neither; sometimes inciting and inticing the affections, and leading them away captive without regard of Reason, and sometimes won to take part with Reason against the affections.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now according to its manner of working, do I think, there are several names bestowed on it, or titles appropriated to it. When 'tis eagerly set on work, or working to find something, <hi>Invention</hi>; when it has it, and brings it forth to the affections or reason, <hi>Conception</hi>; when it suddenly turns about on things past, for the introduction thereof into memory, <hi>Reflexion;</hi> when it suddenly takes in an object, whereabout reason at hand is somewhat consulted, <hi>Apprehension;</hi> when it goes on metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically or rovingly without interruption, <hi>Cogitation</hi>; when rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and the affections seem most distant from it, or it from
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50605:51"/>
them, <hi>Fancy,</hi> or <hi>Phantasm.</hi> It is all and every one of these, and we often call it the one, or the other; but because there is always framed from it, some image of things from Soul, I rather treat of it in general, under the notion and title of <hi>Imagination.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well, I have defined the Imagination to be not only a ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving unstable faculty in its working, but <hi>always working;</hi> yet surely that may receive some little exception. Some indeed have defined man to be <hi>substantia cogitans,</hi> and have thus argued themselves into manhood, <hi>cogito, ergo sum</hi>; as if that were the very essence of a man. It does indeed work, when all other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties are, or at least seem, still and quiet; the Affections, the Reason, and the Will too. It works in sleeping, Lethargick or Apoplectick persons, and for ought I know or can conjecture to the contrary, it may move in an Infant in its Mothers womb, though the impress it then makes is so weak, that nothing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of remains. But in all these there is a motion of the Bloud, and a pulse; and that helps their <hi>sum.</hi> Now with submission, I do think, a man may be said to be a living creature, and <hi>be</hi> for a time, without any cogitation at all; and that in case of an absolute Syncope or swoun, when there is a total cessation of the hearts motion for a while. And men of perfect intellect, who have suffered under that distemper, or obstruction, have observed presently after, that the most quiet sleep was not like it, and thought then, that they thought not at all during that space; which is an equal argument to me, first, that the life or Soul, not moving the Bloud, and yet existent in the Body, is separable from the Body, and Eternal; next, that the Bloud in man, is not the life of man, as 'tis of other creatures; for if it were, then upon a total cessation of its motion, would the Spirit vanish, as it docs in every other creature upon a cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For this kind of distemper (if I may so call it) never happens in any other creature but man; in man it does, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in an healthful state of body, from a violent passion, it may be with the assistance of the imagination. And lastly, that if the imagination do at any time cease to work, and yet life remains; then is not the imagination amongst the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Soul primary in operation, but rather some other la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent faculty, to remain when (as <note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 146.4.</note> 
                     <hi>David</hi> says) <hi>all our thoughts perish</hi>; which I shall have occasion to speak more of, in my third general enquiry.</p>
                  <p>Whenever the Imagination moves at any time, without some
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50605:51"/>
discernible concurrence of the Affections, and Reason; we are at that time little otherwise than in a sleep or dream, and the impresses it leaves in us, not much greater, sometimes not so great: Nay often when it seems wholly to go alone, unless by the first guidance of some outward sense, yet in that very case, as there is an assent of the Will, and Affections too; so its very ramblings, windings and turnings, may be orderly unravelled, like the hanging together of Links and Chains, though of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous forms, as if some reason for its very wandrings were to be given. For though in short space it run from the greatest State, or Monarch in the World, to the smallest Insect; there is still some concatenation of them together, and it never skips wholly from its subject matter, without some sudden new introduction from sense, or the Affections or Reasons recall; as if some of them set it on work, or at least it wrought not for it self.</p>
                  <p>As for instance, I walk into my Orchard, and there I espy Fruit-trees in their tender bud spoiled and devoured by Cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillers, upon which I seek in my mind somewhat of the cause, how these Insects are bred, as from drought, Easterly winds, or the like: Now if Fruit were one of my chiefest delights, and a thing in desire, Reason would somewhat fix my thoughts, and busie them in finding out with its assistance, some way or means for the prevention or destruction of this creature; but being not, forthwith from them my thoughts are carried rambling after all those peculiar Trees, on which these Insects usually feed; straightways experience informs me the Oak for one, then I think how that Tree amongst the Heathen was sacred to <hi>Iupiter</hi>; then it may be I think on the story of the Royal Oak, and the miraculous preservation of our Sovereign; from thence my thoughts travel to, and ramble over the greatest Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies in the World, and from thence mount to Heaven, and think on him who is the establisher of all Monarchies, and by whom Kings reign; anon Reason puts a stop to this career of the Imagination, and perhaps fixes it for a while in some regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar course, and then perphaps for want of better imployment, it unravels it self backward again to the Caterpiller, finding out all the ways and steps it went before, and all that to as little purpose as its former journey and travel. And thus do we often, more litterally than those of whom <hi>David</hi> speaks, <note n="b" place="margin">Psal. 2.1.</note> 
                     <hi>imagine a vain thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This faculty seems only able to behold it self, and its own
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50605:52"/>
vanity; and this is the faculty over which Reason has the least power, and for whose extravagancies we may readiliest expect pardon, since it casually works for others, and cannot be at rest. Free-will and power, and a kind of dominion over every of our faculties, nay our whole selves as well as others, seems to be in some degree or measure inherent in our (I will not say our nature) desires, and therefore the very power of reducing to subjection this one faculty, to what we call our Wills, may now and then seem to please us in imagination, or wish; and that if it were so, we might govern our selves (alone) as we pleased, and so become wise and happy; for we would then think of nothing but good. This perhaps is now and then our desire; but surely hitherto every man's Imagination has been and is the framer of his Will, rather than that any man's Will ever was or can be master of his Imagination, or else there would never have been forged and framed in the Soul, such a Will as now and then there is: And 'tis the goodness of a wise and gracious Almighty power, that there is no absolute power in man over this faculty; or such a Will in him, as were able at all times to bring it to subjection or obedience. Indeed when the heart seems well tuned, and to be <note n="c" place="margin">Psal. 108.1.</note> 
                     <hi>fixed,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> says, and we are praising God <hi>with the best member we have,</hi> it is an unhappy thing our thoughts should be rambling (as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member St. <hi>Hierom</hi> said of his) as far as <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Carthage.</hi> But the natural course of its rambling (duly considered) is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly a great mercy to us; for 'tis to be feared <note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 7.21.</note> 
                     <hi>Evil</hi> would be as often <hi>present with us,</hi> as our <note n="e" place="margin">Vers 18.</note> 
                     <hi>Wills,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, and then a power over the imagination would little avail. In the main, it is our great advantage, and happiness too, that this one faculty of the Soul cannot possibly be fixed long on any one thing, without wavering to and fro, or be made the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant attendant of any predominant affection; if it could, it might, I fear, often prove to us an Hell upon Earth, rather than an Heaven; and by gratifying even one of our affections, should it alway hold a glass to sorrow, (and sometimes we seem to will that) or rather fear; how miserable were we. Even the poor Prisoner going to Execution, hath this happiness, that his imagination is a wanderer, without any absolute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul; and that every moment almost, his thoughts are for some short space diverted from death, towards other things, by some sense or other, (though they presently return again) or else it would be truly said, from the steadiness of the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50605:52"/>
that the pomp or usher of death (and so of all other evils) would be far more powerful than the hand of the Executioner. The Psalmist seems to me to have had some such thoughts, when, beholding death in himself at some further distance, he suddenly crys out, <note n="f" place="margin">Psal. 79.11.</note>

                  <p>We cannot well think or imagine how, and after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, this faculty works in Beasts; we may conjecture perhaps, that it's chiefly according to sense, or is more easily turned about by sense, and therefore makes not so pleasing or irksom impressions, nor yet so lasting, as upon our selves. This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, in our selves 'tis not always readily diverted by sense, but is now and then so intent and fixed upon some peculiar object, as that at that instant we may be said neither to see, hear, tast, feel or smell, though indeed we do. And how rambling and volatile soever it may be in it self, yet it makes and sometimes leaves in the Soul such an Impress or Effigies, as is for conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, which we call <hi>Memory,</hi> and that I shall now consider.</p>

                     <hi>some remaining mark, impress, or footstep in the Brain, or a collective faculty there, of somewhat before rouled over by the Imagination, or examined by Reason; whether introduced by sense, sent thither and actuated by the affections, or native in the Imagination; and becomes a treasury or storehouse, for the Imagination and Reason to resort unto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Generally I think that according to the strength of the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, those marks or strokes it makes do remain; and that he who hath a smart conception or invention, and a good super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendent, (that is, Reason) seldom has a bad or weak me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory: And therefore those men of parts (as we term them) who often pretent forgetfulness, rather pretend it, than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, and are not to be trusted too far, in that pretence. And according as the Affections and Reason have gone along with the Imagination, to make that impress, so it is still more dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and less subject to be worn out. He who has ever been terribly affrighted, will scarce ever forget the object, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of his fear; neither shall we easily find out a man,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50605:53"/>
that ever forgot the hiding of his Treasure, being a work that his affection led him to.</p>
                  <p>So that as the quick and lively inlet of the senses, strengthens the Imagination, so the strength of the Imagination, is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally that which makes and fortifies a Memory: And when it treasures up things springing from the proper strength of our own imagination, or invention, well ruminated by Reason, and having the concurrence of well-governed affections, it helps again to incite and strengthen them, (seeming to be a faculty as well active as passive) and so is a more proper and fit Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery for our own off-spring, than a strangers. For when it only or chiefly is a treasury by sense, (<hi>viz.</hi> reading or hearing) let it be never so vast and spacious, 'tis not of so great use or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; it being hard to find a wise or good man so made, from other mens documents, though from the largeness or capacious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his memory, he were able by once reading to repeat over the whole Works of the most voluminous Author. And therefore as he that is affected with what he knows, is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily sure of a good Memory; so that Memory is always best, most useful, and likely to hold, which is the fruit of our own conception, imagination, and observation.</p>

                  <p>Right Reason, that Divine gift, and Humane enjoyment, is a thing which does, or may bear or produce many Leaves, and some most excellent both Flowers and Fruit; as Temperance, Justice, Prudence, and the like; and besides such its natural Fruits, as I may call them, I hope I may without offence think too, it is on its proper Boughs and Branches only (though it is impossible they should naturally spring from thence) that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Graces are ingrafted. For he who has his Faith only pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in a light and airy speculation, or imagination, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed and held fast bound within the verge of his Reason, or

otherwise some way imbraced or allowed by his Reason, will find it upon every occasion apt to fade of it self, as well as to be loose, and blown away with every wind of doctrine; but this requires another place.</p>
                  <p>Here if we seriously behold it in our selves as natural men, and view not what it is capable to imbrace and nourish, but what by good husbandry 'tis able to produce of it self, we may and do find, and now and then undoubtedly tast, most excellent pleasant Fruits from it; but then we must esteem them as gifts, or else they quickly lose their savour.</p>
                  <p>Reason in us may be likned to some Plants of the Earth, which in the shade grow rank enough, and increase to a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient magnitude or dimension, yet have no pleasant tast or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, nor ever bear good Fruit, though large they may: and therefore it is good to have it ever in the light of the Sun, tending and looking that way, and then never fear increase will hurt us.</p>

                  <p>I look on my own Will, as I sometimes do on my self in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; whilst I am at home within doors, and look no further, then do I take my self to be some petty Prince without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul; but whensoever I look abroad into the World, then do I find my self restrained as a common Subject, to act no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the Laws of my King permit; cease that Law, and my power ceases. My Will may be free respecting my self, but 'tis sure dependent respecting God; or else I must by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empting my Will, think his power finite, which God forbid! Such a thing there may be in us, from his Eternal wise disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as is sufficient to render our actions good or evil, and yet that sufficiency is involved in the whole Creation subject to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50605:54"/>
Divine power. What power we have, let us endeavour to use well, without questioning the extent or utmost bounds of our Commission. 'Tis said to be the perfection of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to know good, and to will it: For the first we all agree, that we are for the present imperfect in; if we can do the other, let us always do it, and (which is good) let us ever pray, <hi>His will be done,</hi> without enquiring farther or beyond what is plainly revealed to us; of his Will, or of our own.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Will</hi> in us does seem much to exceed that of Brutes, and to be of another extract than theirs, as all other faculties of our Soul do; for though I cannot behold them as meer Machines or Engines, yet I cannot rationally perceive or conjecture, that there is any Will in them, other than such as receives an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate impression from sense, or that has its rise barely in and through sense; such a Will as necessarily springs from, or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows their thoughts, not such an one as is able at any time to correct or put a stop to their thoughts; neither do I believe there is so much as a Wish in them at any time, that their thoughts were other than they are. But such a kind of <hi>corrective Will</hi> most of us now and then perceive, and find in our selves; and yet we cannot but conclude that such as it is, it wants a special Divine assistance to co-operate with it, even to make it ours. Howsoever when we find or perceive a desire or a will (be it what it will) in us, that our thoughts were other than for the present they are; it may assure us our Soul is not part of our Body, or naturally extracted out of our Body, for then it would not be prone and apt to resist and controul such thoughts, as, while they were, travelled to please the Body.</p>

                     <hi>COnscience</hi> is a Latine word, from <hi>con scire,</hi> to know toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and I think the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, is to the same effect, from <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>simul videre</hi>: As if there were now and then some stop, or consultation held amongst the faculties of the Soul. This consultation, demurr, or dispute in the Soul, is from the glowing of some spark of a primitive purity, which though raked up and covered, ever since our Fall, with all manner of infirmities and blurs, that our imagination is able to invent or bring in, so as it gives not that clear light it should,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50605:54"/>
to lead us and conduct us aright, yet it often produces a light to warn us or inform us, when it is that we go right, and when wrong; and blessed be God 'tis not quite extinguished in any man.</p>
                  <p>I have sometimes in my thoughts resembled the faculties in mans Soul to a Law or Judicature, and Reason to the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor; which though not alike in all men, but in some stronger and in some weaker, and in some one man sometimes stronger, sometimes weaker, yet still remains of some Authority at some times, to put some stop to those inferiour Courts of the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereto the <hi>Will</hi> is, as it were the Sheriff or Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. And therefore I do take <hi>Conscience</hi> to be, (and cannot in short define it better than) <hi>A reverberation of that light of Reason God has given us,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Conscience defined.</note> 
                     <hi>into the innermost recesses of the Soul</hi>: whereby, or from whence, there becomes a perswasion for some demurr, stay or hesitation for a while, of the other faculties; though they often forthwith again disobey and proceed. And I cannot but think the Poet has well enough defined it, and no ways worded it amiss, in this verse, <hi>Stat contra ratio, &amp; secretam gannit in aurem;</hi> as if Reason perswasively and convincingly, did se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly whisper in its injunctions. I know this our Chancellor here, as I call him, is subject to error, and I doubt too, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally (in which case he is not able to determine either way) very weak; yet obedience and disobedience to his whispers, are the two things wherewith we usually entertain our selves by way of reflexion; and the one is pleasant, and as the Wise man calls it, a <note n="a" place="margin">Prov. 15.15.</note> 
                     <hi>continual feast</hi>; the other is bitter, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual remorse. For though the error of this Vicegerent of God, do not at all alter the nature of good and evil, but that they remain as they are in themselves, and if we do evil from his error, we are punishable; yet that gives our offence no worse a title than erroneous, and is properly the Understandings fault, whereas the other is stigmatized presumptuous, and is the Wills, or the Affections, indeed the whole Souls fault.</p>
                  <p>Now by the way, if I have guessed or defined it aright, that Conscience is a result from Reasons whispers, or the inward reverberation of that best natural light we have to guide us; why, since we all daily offend, and do wrong, do some of our high-pretending Rationalists seldomest feel its strokes; and why are the same most felt, or most pretended unto, by men of weak Intellects or Reason? Why truly in one case, I think man may become <hi>a deaf Adder, charm the charmer never so wisely;</hi>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:50605:55"/>
and on the other side, I think that a weak Reason may be so dazled by the flame and zeal of the affections, that it knows not how to discriminate between them and it self; and that the flashing and light of the affections, is often mistaken for the light of Reason; or at least Reason seems to enjoyn and command as a Captive, whenever the affections would have him; or else they only colourably set him up, as their Authority, against a Foreign Authority: For against Authority it is, that Conscience is ever most pretended.</p>
                  <p>What is the meaning of the word <hi>Tender</hi> Conscience, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and strictly taken, I do not well understand: yet if there be such a thing, I am not about to rake or harrass it in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, having enough to do to look after my own. Weak indeed it may be, Reason is very weak in the best of us, and wants assistance; but sure methinks, men should not pretend tenderness in it too, and such a tenderness as no man must come near it, so much as to inform it, or guide it, but let it go which way the affections please. I hope men only mean here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by tender affection, or tender heart, (which I pray God grant to every one, and that it never become hardned, stubborn, or obdurate in any man) and then we shall not fear but Reason will suffer information without offence. Well, be we as ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as imaginable in all parts; be Conscience a post-cordial, or a post-wound, (as truly 'tis the latter, whenever we act against the tryed light of our Reason) we shall do well to endeavour by all means to avoid this wound, not only in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility exercising this our best faculty, but hearkning to others reasons, and praying God to assist us: For there is no man but may live to see the error of his own present Judgment, which if it err for want of diligence and care, or receiving information, may that way prove a wound in the end too. However let us all be assured, pretence of Conscience will never want its darts in the latter end.</p>
                  <p>There is no man knows his own heart, <hi>'tis deceitful above all things,</hi> much less can any of us look so far into other mens Souls, as to see whether the light within them (a thing much talked of now-a-days) be the light of their Reason, or the flashing of their Affections; and therefore we ought to be as tender in censuring any man, as he would be to be censured. I beseech God to enlighten me in all my ways from the first, <hi>Reason;</hi> and beg of others not to be too tender in trying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: search narrowly whence that light they have proceeds,

                  <p>HAving slightly run over the several apparent, and most discernible faculties of the Soul, distinct and apart; I will endeavour to behold them working together, fighting and combating, raising or inflaming, helping or assisting, drawing or inticing, quelling or allaying, ruling or govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another, in some plain and familiar instance, which may be this.</p>
                  <p>A man who has lived, until his Reason has been able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him he lives, and shew him some ground how, and whence he lives, for that it is not from himself that he lives: A man, I say, endowed once with this faculty visible, (which never much appears till some perfect stature of Body) and having all other faculties of his Soul quick and ready to work, but by reason of the Souls conjunction with a Body, necessitated and constrained to work by and through the Organs of that Body; through them, I say, by one means or other, the Soul lets it self out into the World, or lets the World into it. Now espying through the Eye (and perhaps a hear-say would work the like effect) a covering of the same mould over another, but withall attended with Riches, Honours, Dignities, Power, Place, Authority, or any outward worldly pomp or vanity whatsoever; from this sight it may be (with some little pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent concurrence of the imagination) is the concupiscible part of the Soul irritated and stimulated, and somewhat bent and inclined. The imagination from them again (which perhaps otherwise would be quickly at work in <hi>Eutopia,</hi> and do little good or harm there) is stayed from its present pursuit, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them; and being over-apt to gratifie the affections to the full, presents them again with a false beautiful glass, and, it may be, some such like inscriptions as these, <hi>Haec omnia vobis dabo,</hi> or, <hi>bonum est esse sic,</hi> (in the room of <hi>hic</hi>:) From hence again the concupiscible part of the Soul becomes so inflamed, that it awakes and rouzes all the other affections ready for its
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:50605:56"/>
attendance, though often from its very Brethren it meets with obstructions: For if this spectacle be introduced to some Soul, though the desire therein may be as great, and as large and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensive as in another; yet fear and care of the Body, and a number of anxious thoughts and doubts, frame a <note n="a" place="margin">Prov. 22.13.</note>

                     <hi>desire,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> says, <hi>slayeth him</hi>: His desire is for the glory of his Body; and the rest of its fellow-faculties being for the Body too, they fight for the ease of it. But if a vigorous active Spirit, become once infected with an itch from this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, (admitting the itch not natural) then besides the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ready at all turns to project, design, and contrive all the ways and means imaginable, as we say, all the other passions run full cry after this desire; now Hope and Assurance, now Fear and Distrust, now Heaviness and Displeasure, (<hi>Ahab</hi>'s case when he coveted <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vineyard) now Anger threatens and strikes, now Dissimulation courts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and together with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out notice of Friend or Foe, they endeavour and agree to run down every obstacle in the way; and the Will is carried along with them as a Captive or Slave, which indeed is the proper subject of right Reason. And in this career I cannot but say Reason bears a part, and is one in the company, but yet blinded and as it were a Captive, under dominion for the present. It moves indeed as Reason, weighs every circumstance, conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience and inconvenience; but yet is for the Affections interest, and at their beck, and becomes like the General of an Army in a great Mutiny, ready to gratifie them in whatever they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Yet withall, 'tis never such an absolute Slave in man, though it goes along with the Affections, and serves them some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, (for as I have already said, and it must be ever obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that in every action properly Humane, although there be a kind of dissention too, yet there is some kind of concurrence of all the faculties of the Soul, and no one faculty is wholly and fully excluded) as not to have a Negative voice, and some power left to use its exhortations at peculiar times. 'Twill be now and then trying to reclaim the disorders in the Soul, and shew it self fitter for Conduct, than Vassallage; point out, and lay forth the falsity and circumvention of the Imagination in the first rise or beginning; the false bent and foolish inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Affections; the captivity and slavishness of the Will; I and it self too, for the time passed: hold forth to it self, and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:50605:56"/>
the whole Soul, prospects at some further distance: make us see the uncertainty, instability, mutability, and vanity of all Earthly enjoyments; the certainty of death, and withall that as with the enjoyer there will be no remembrance or thoughts of them in the Grave; so neither will there be any remembrance of them, who now enjoy them, by those who come after: That above the present necessary support of the Body, there is no need or use of any worldly things; that they add nothing of real worth to any man; that there are always necessary trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and vexations attendants on them; that in a mean and private path, we are least subject to affronts and justling; that the Creator of the Universe, cannot but be just, and a wise dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penser of all things, and that we shall never want things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for our journey; that there is a possibility of the Souls existence after separation from the Body, and then by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, there is as much necessity for the imploying its faculties in the well-governing it self, and laying up some treasure or provision for it self, which can neither be of things here, nor properly laid up here. And besides this, it will sometimes forthwith get the assistance of the Memory to its aid, to shew us instances and examples of other men: some failing in their attempts when they were got to the uppermost round of their aspiring Ladder; others crushed down and ground to pieces with the weight they drew upon themselves: and on the other side, others weary of their very acquisitions, and casting them behind them; others joyful, happy and quiet, in a very mean and low estate and condition.</p>
                  <p>And happy were it for us, if Reason could in any time, or for any space, win the Imagination to take part with it too, and so leave the common Rout without any Officer to side with them; in which desertion, their heat is soon allayed and cooled: For this cogitative or conceptive quality, is of ability in some sort, to work even upon Reason's account alone, and can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine there may be a happiness beyond all bodily sense, and then forthwith all its former glasses, become but painted Paradises, and formal nothings. I say, though Reason sometimes runs, and works from the Eyes of sense, it has Eyes of its own, and sees far beyond the capacity of the Bodies Eyes, and what can never be introduced through them only; and so St. <hi>Paul</hi> not improperly mentions to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> 
                     <note n="d" place="margin">Ephes. 1.18.</note> 
                     <hi>the Eyes of their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</hi> Nay such is the strange and admirable frame of man's Soul, that as the understanding has Eyes to see, and power to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:50605:57"/>
direct in some measure; so have those inferiour faculties, the Affections, Ears to hear, and hearken to its direction and call: what is the meaning else of those words, <note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 11.15.</note> 
                     <hi>He that hath ears to hear let him hear,</hi> if the Affections moved not sometimes upon some inward stroke or noise? No man ever made doubt, but all those to whom our Saviour then spake, had bodily Ears, and yet he concludes his Parable with that saying, being about to move the Affections, and keep the heart from being rocky, stony or thorny, and make it good ground; telling us in the explanation, that the good ground are they, <hi>which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it,</hi> &amp;c. Even Reason in man is the Word of God, and if our affections would but hearken to its dictates, our Soul would neither be in so much danger to go out of the way, nor have such mutinies in her way, as she too often finds.</p>
                  <p>Well, I am not about to rob Grace of its effects, or to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute these sights or noise, or hearkning, chiefly and principally to ought else than Grace, and the free subsequent gift of God; we shall find occasion enough, I doubt, to acknowledge where we ought chiefly to pay our tribute, and I shall take occasion to speak more of it hereafter. But this I dare somewhat boldly say at present, (to leave us inexcusable) that there is not one man of common reason, or common sense, in our ordinary phrase, but take him a little out of the noise of the World, and his affections a little cooled, and he will acknowledge some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of truth in this; at least he will not be able to deny it in his heart, but there confess to himself, that he has heard and does often hear his own natural monitor, Reason, though he never did, or were of ability to obey him long. For besides God's gracious goodness in pointing us out a way by his writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word, and his special Grace, leading and assisting us; he has set a native rider, <hi>Reason,</hi> upon us, to direct us, and in that especially differenced us from the Beasts, that must necessarily perish. They have somewhat of Reason, (some men will scarce deny it them) but then 'tis such a <hi>Reason,</hi> as is always subservient to the affections, goes along with the affections, sees with the affections, and from the eyes of the Body only: Not a Reason that is able to see of it self at a distance; nor a Reason of any power or ability to put a stop, check or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul to the affections, or resist-or stay them, but help and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them: Nor have they affections that can hearken, or be moved, otherwise than from sense. But such have we, and

whenever we cast off this Rider, we may remain somewhat the more sagacious Creature, but in no sort the wiser Animal; and yet if we do cast him off for a time, we cannot be quite rid of him; he will up again if it be but to spur and gall us, and wound our affections, that though they go on still, yet some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what halting and lame. And this is the thing which I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, and certainly may most properly be called <hi>Conscience.</hi> But beside this, such is often the goodness of a gracious God, who created and endowed us with such a Reason, as a separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and distinguishing gift from all other creatures, and no ways the ordinary work, or production, from him, called Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; That besides it, I say, he often throws in some let, or stop, in the way of this race of our affections; and disposes things in his providence towards the assistance, and strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our Reason. If Reason see not as it might, or we hearken not to it as we should and ought, he sends some unexpected accident, pain, or sickness, or the like; whence we become sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Soul and Body, of the approaching certain destruction of this our Tabernacle; and happy are we, if we are converted and live; nay happy are we if we become truly penitent for our former blindness, deafness and errors, and die. Then we always see, to be sure, with some Eye of Reason, and whatever other pleasing prospects any man may have, whatever <hi>deceptio visus</hi> there may be in health, I never heard of any sober man yet, who run this race or course, but whatever he saw before, when he came to the Goal, Death, he saw the vanity of this, though he believed not the glory or pain of another life; and was apt to make some such short reflexion upon it, as <hi>Solomon</hi> had done before to his hands, <hi>Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.</hi> Let a man dream here never so sound and quiet, he then usually finds, 'tis but <hi>as a dream, when one awaketh.</hi> How much better then and safer might it be, to hearken to such a voice in health, <note n="f" place="margin">Ephes. 5.14.</note>

                  <head>SECT. I. Concerning the primary faculty of the Soul, and wherein the primacy may seem to be.</head>
                  <p>OUr Souls do work, and after the manner aforesaid do they sometimes work; but it will be a very difficult matter for the Soul, so to trace back or unravel it self in its manner of operation, as to discern the origine, or first rise of every work. What is the first moving point, and rudiment of animation, we shall never know; for though we partition out the Soul into divers faculties, and allow those faculties several peculiar rooms in the Body; yet as that structure and habitation for it, the Body, is so intirely framed and built, as no one room can be said to be before the other, though those rooms are extended and enlarged to their full proportion by degrees: so the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant and mover of it, is one; and none of its faculties in time before other, however some apparency <hi>in actu,</hi> may deceive us. I now think, but why I think, I cannot tell, whether because I have first a desire to think, or a will to think; whether I have a will to desire, or a desire to will; whether I have reason to imagine or think, or thoughts to reason and weigh things. I have all, and my Soul is all, and the gift of one unfathomable Essence, <hi>whose ways are past finding out,</hi> and this one of his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful works or ways.</p>
                  <p>My Reason may weary my Imagination in the quest and pursuit of this knowledge; my Imagination may bring in enough to puzzle my Reason in defining and judging; my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscible faculty may either egg them on, or intice them; my Memory may be assistant to lay up safe what my Invention has found out, or Reason judged, or the Affections have desired; and the Will may be ready and attendant; and all work toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and aid and assist each other in the search, and yet never find out or define the first <hi>motus</hi> amongst them. All that I am able to say in my own Judgment, is, that <note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 139.14.</note> 
                     <hi>fearfully and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully am I made, and that my Soul knoweth right well</hi>; but in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to any certain definitive knowledge thereof, especially how my Soul worketh principally and primarily in my Body, I am inforced to cry out, <note n="b" place="margin">Vers. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Such knowledge is too wonderful for me, I cannot attain unto it.</hi> And I think I may truly say, without alledging it as an <hi>Asylum</hi> for ignorance, or a <hi>Remora</hi> against
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50605:58"/>
search and tryal, it is a knowledge which man is no ways ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, and such an occult secret, that the desire of it may endanger us. What God has hidden or locked up, let no man think to find or open. Surely every rational man will soon find the way of the Soul to be as difficult and wonderful, as any of the four things mentioned by <note n="c" place="margin">Prov. 30.19.</note> 
                     <hi>Agur</hi>; and I may confidently speak in the words of <hi>Solomon</hi> to any such diver, <note n="d" place="margin">Eccles. 11.5.</note> 
                     <hi>As thou knowest not, what is the way of the Spirit, nor how the bones do grow in the womb, so thou knowest not the work of God, who maketh all.</hi> 'Tis not a thing I dare undertake to discover, nor a thing I have ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely desired to know: But only to quiet and satisfie my self, I have endeavoured to make some little search or enquiry, which of the faculties of the Soul may seem (a <hi>visum est</hi> only) primary or most potent in operation, not which in truth are; for that shall never man certainly define. And therefore let no man, till he be able to find out himself, the circulation of the Soul, and the origine of that circulation, and be assured to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince others in reason of that his <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, blame me of sloth or ignorance, but allow me something of intellect, if it be but in finding out my own defect therein. And yet because I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in some degree to satisfie my self, and others too, but not wade herein further than some light from Scripture (which I believe to be the true proper <hi>light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world</hi>) may seem to direct and mark out, I shall set down somewhat of my thoughts, concerning the priority, precedency or prevalency in the faculties of the Soul, one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or above another. Whereabout though I may seem to dissent from the received opinion and learning of the World, and therein be exploded by some; yet I trust and hope, I shall in no wise wrench or screw that Sacred Word for my purpose, nor much swerve from the true and genuine meaning of that, which I alledge to be the principal, if not the only, ground of my opinion.</p>
                  <p>I am not able to find out any great ground of contest to arise between any faculties of the Soul for priority or precedency, (that is, any dispute or question thereabout) unless between the Imagination and the Affections barely: Now that which we call the Imagination, or cogitation in the Soul of man, we find to be an unconstant fluttering, as well as a restless faculty; which at no time can be found settled, or made to fix long, nay much or often, upon any one single object, unless some affection do first seem to draw it, and set it on work, and in a
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:50605:59"/>
manner fasten it as its attendant for a time, though then also it have some momentary flyings out, and extravagancies. And though it be a thing undeniable, that the imagination may often move or rouze some affection which was quiet before; yet it is a thing as undeniable, that the imagination or cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion never created or made any affection, more than any affection ever created that; for we must agree they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary in the Soul, and so neither hath the precedency. But yet where one seems to work more often, in obedience, and to some ends and designs, or safe lodging or pleasing of another, we may allow that other some kind of excellency, and so priority. And this I am ready to afford to some affection, lodged in the center of the Body, or innermost place of recess for the Soul, there secretly fixed by its Creator, with some rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to direct and guide, as well as imagination to whet it. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the imagination and the affections, when they are orderly or regularly working, (if not at all times and seasons) do whet and as it were give edge to each other; but surely as the Love of God, far exceeds the thoughts of him, so the Soul being an emanation at first from that Spirit of Love, Love of him may be said to be a cause of thoughts of him, and that if the Soul were not naturally capable to love, and tend some whither, we could not so much as think. Sense must be agreed, while we live in the Body, to be the chief (though not the only) inlet or Port to the Soul, and that every object, by and through sense, has some touch in its entrance upon the imagination; or else we shall make a strange <hi>Chimaera</hi> of the Soul: But not barely resting upon sense, we may allow some <hi>prior</hi> inherent quality, upon which, by sense, the imagination may seem attendant, and in subjection to. And though at some times the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion do appear as the usher of the affections; yet the least affection once kindled, (and something there must be allowed to be kindled, whether of it self bursting out into flame, or however inflamed or kindled) will often hale the thoughts to the object, without any farther help of sense. But many things are presented to the imagination by sense, upon which no affection seems to stir or move that we are able to discern; and thereupon we may allow the imagination's work or motion, to be chiefly from something occult, (whatever use it sometimes makes of sense) to which it is, or may be in subjection, and not <hi>prior,</hi> but rather <hi>posterior.</hi>

                  <head>SECT. II. That it seems to be in the Affections rather then any other, from Scripture.</head>
                  <p>THere is a common saying, how true I know not, that life is first and last in that part of man's Body, which we call the Heart; and it is generally agreed and believed, and I find no reason to dissent much from that opinion, that there is the principal seat of the affections, and that That is the Cell, wherein they chiefly move and work. Now nothing is so much called upon in Scripture, as the Affections, nor any part of man's Body so often named, as the Heart, the chief and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal seat thereof; as if that part were taken for the whole, and the content for the contained, and whole man, Soul and Body, were included in that one word <hi>Heart</hi>; and no act or thought of man were significant without affection, or did arise or work but from an affection.</p>
                  <p>I shall not in this place (going about to shew some peculiar prerogative the affections seem to have over the other faculties of the Soul) scrape up together and cite the multitude of Texts, wherein God by his Prophets and Apostles seems to strike only at the root of the affections, <hi>the Heart,</hi> and call upon that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to be given him, or inclined or bent towards him; they are obvious enough, and I believe a thousand such are readily to be found. But I shall only mention some peculiar places, occurring at present to my thoughts, which seem to allow, not only a native, or dative power in the affections over the whole intellective faculty, whether Imagination, Memory, or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; but also some primary influence which they have upon them all, or as if the other faculties had their rise or spring from them. Thus generally whensoever the intellect is mentioned in Scripture, it is coupled with the seat of the affections, and taken for them; as if from thence it rose, and had its influence: For if the very imagination had any motion of it self, or by sense barely, without the agitation or help of an affection, and so were the first inlet of things to the affections, by and of it self; its own peculiar seat were then the proper attribute and adjunct for it, and it would or might be said, the imagination of the Brain, instead of the imagination of the Heart; for there doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we imagine in dreams, and when the affections are most
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:50605:60"/>
quiet, and may seem only to move (if they do then move) from the imagination. But on the contrary we read in Scripture, of the <note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 140.2. Luk. 1.51.</note>

                     <hi>errors</hi> of the heart. After this manner speaks St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that when in a whole days discourse from morning to evening, he found he could not move the affections of some of his Countrymen, cites them these words of <hi>Esaias</hi> the Prophet, <note n="m" place="margin">Acts 28.27.</note> 
                     <hi>The heart of this people is waxed gross, &amp;c.</hi> lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, <hi>and understand with their hearts,</hi> and should be converted: As if the heart must be opened, and the affections first move, to let in understanding.

                  </p>
                  <p>In these places, with many more like, the Holy Spirit of God pitching upon the affections, or the chief seat of the affections, for the whole Soul; it seems to me to point out some potent, if not some leading quality in them. And therefore do I think we have not translated that Mandate of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Colossians</hi> amiss, by these words, <note n="n" place="margin">Colos. 3.2.</note>

And as the Scripture speaks after this manner of the Imagination, so it doth also of the Memory, which though I have in some sort before defined to be the Treasury or Storehouse of the Soul, seated in the Brain; yet the affections do seem to ingross that title too, and that there is not only a savour or sense, but a laying up, and keeping in the heart, as well as Brain: So it's expressed of the <note n="q" place="margin">Luk. 2.51.</note>

                  <head>SECT. III. That it may seem to be in some affection from Humane conjecture and allowance.</head>
                  <p>HUmane thoughts and cogitations seem unto me like Clouds in the Air; some vain and empty, and like unto Smoak; some full and weighty; some bright and pleasant; some black and dismal; succeeding each other in time and place; always in motion, and sometimes quick and violently agitated, upon divers occasions, from divers quarters; which, though they may be said sometimes to refresh the Earth, and make her good and fruitful, and that without the fall of them upon her, she were an insignificant, dry, heavy lump, without activity or cause of vegetation; yet certainly those Clouds were first insensibly created, raised and sent up, from <hi>her,</hi> whom they again sometimes refresh, and sometimes drown. Indeed to me the affections do no otherwise appear than that Earthy part of the Soul, (and so we sometimes term it, and that not improperly, while 'tis imployed on Earthly things) which though it have not that splendor, nor is beheld in any wise so admirable, or excellent, as those glorious Lights above, from which it receives influence; yet does rather seem to precede them in time: And it may be no false assertion to say of them, as the Scripture does of the other, they were ordained <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 1.15.</note> 
                     <hi>to give light upon the Earth,</hi> which was before them. The intellect must be owned by all, as the affections light, and Reason as our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Sun, able in some measure to correct their barren, churlish nature and quality, and now and then dispell those unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som and unpleasant mists and fogs, springing, or arising from them. But yet this Earth of ours (as all things) was created good, and in no wise to be wholly rejected, contemned or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised; and for ought I am able to perceive, might be the chief cause why the others were at all.</p>
                  <p>Whoever shall tell me, 'tis some more noble faculty in my Soul than an affection, that gives being to this very enquiry, I must acknowledge somewhat of truth in the allegation, and probably my suggestant may do no less in first acknowledging some kind of appetite, or desire in my Soul to enquire and search. <note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 3.6.</note> 
                     <hi>Desire</hi> as it preceded our first unlucky knowledge, so it continues surely a fermentation in all our learning; at least
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:50605:61"/>
some affection does, and works that, which our natural light would not attain to, of it self. We have a saying, <hi>Si natura negat, facit indignatio versum,</hi> Indignation is an affection in the Soul, and often, at least, helps, aids, and assists the more noble faculties to work, and so do other affections too, as well as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation. The great pretended Rationalist of the World (the Atheist) has ready at hand another such like verse, and if we talk of God, will forthwith bring it out, and tell us, <hi>Primus in orbe Deos fecit timor,</hi> — That it was not our Reason was able to find them, or our Imagination to conceive them, of it self. It may be true in some sort; and it might be happy for these Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionalists too, if fear could set their intellectuals on work as well as ours, since love does not, or will not. However, from them, who deny the Author or Inspirer of the Soul, 'tis agreed, that the passions if any part of the Soul must first find him; and surely I might no less properly before have resembled Affection to a Whetstone, than I did Reason to a Touchstone: For though it be Reason which tries, whether they be pure or impure, false or currant, yet 'tis an Affection that always give an edge, and vigour, even to Reason, as many of our quickest Wits have owned; and that without the rubbing or motion of some Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, there would be little of sharpness, or so much as bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, in any other faculty of the Soul.</p>

                  <head>SECT. IV Of the potency of the Affections.</head>
                  <p>THough we should not, or do not allow the affections precedency by way of operation, or any primacy or su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendency in them, over the other faculties of the Soul, but admit it to be in some other more noble faculty, as the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; yet something of force, power and strength, must be granted and allowed to these common Souldiers of the Soul. It is a wise and prudent conduct that keeps them at any time from mutiny, and disorder; but if it once happen they do mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny, 'tis not any General we have, or carry about us, that can reclaim them, or rule and master them; much less at any time disband or cashier any one of them. I know a man may talk Philosophically, and when his imagination is high-flown, and his Brains a little busie in asserting their Prerogative above the Affections, he may think of mastering, subduing and eradica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:50605:61"/>
or at least of wholly mortifying them; when all the while, 'tis a vainglorious affection to be esteemed wise, and master of ones passions, that sets the Brain on work and raises such a mist therein, that the Brain for the present cannot espy it, but thinks it works for, and of it self. Let no man think I speak this, as if experience were my only Tutor, (though with us all it often appears a baffler of Reason) or because I have too much been, or continue a slave to my affections; until he can plainly shew me he has mastered his own. I do own their potency, and am in quest of another power. In the mean time, while I behold the Soul as it is, as I find no ground for contest or dispute about precedency, between any faculties of the Soul, unless between the Affections and the Imagination; so is there none, as I conceive, for predominancy, power and strength, or mastery one above another, unless between the Affections and Reason. The Imagination though a faculty head-strong (as we say) enough, at particular seasons, is various and muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and never holds out long, or keeps its station against oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents; but is apt to yield and comply with every sense upon all occasions. The Will, as I have said, is the certain assenting subject of the present ruling faculty: For if I am sad, and would be otherwise, 'tis the Wills obedience to a present desire; which desire, it may be, springs from some sensible uneasiness of my present condition, or some special dictate, or demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Reason.</p>
                  <p>Reason, that excellent special Divine gift, is never much vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, till man be of some age or maturity; and till then, how apparently do the affections reign! and sometimes one of them over the other, and the imagination is ever their assistant, till Reason become of ability to reclaim it, and win it by fits, or turns, unto it self. And during this infancy of the Soul in the Body, there is certainly some special preventing ruling Grace, I know not what else to call it, that keeps us from running into all manner of extravagancies, as well as there is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that keeps the World from resolving again into its first Chaos.</p>
                  <p>Now that which forces me to impute such potency to the affections, above all other faculties of the Soul, is this; that the greatest and strongest combates in the Soul of man, are still after God has actually given us some Reason, as his Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, to govern us, and seems as it were to leave us to our selves; at least if he did leave us to our selves, we might justly
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:50605:62"/>
condemn our selves, for our disobedience to that only guide of the Soul under him. Which guide, (<hi>Reason</hi>) though appointed in some sort to be the Soul's governour too, never yet fully and wholly subdued (let men talk what they please) any mans evil and erring affections. Yet on the other side, unruly and violent affections, have many times totally and absolutely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished and destroyed <hi>Reason,</hi> as strong and clear, as man has ordinarily been endowed withall; and this I take to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrable in every distracted person, or <hi>mad</hi> man: For the word <hi>amens,</hi> or <hi>demens,</hi> in Latine, that is, without mind, or without Soul, I think them improper words in the case, for that there is nothing wanting in mad men, but Reason; and the more proper word for that distemper, or loss in the Soul, might be that by which we distinguish a Beast from a man, that is, <hi>irrationalis.</hi> And this is to be noted or observed, that it is nothing else at any time, but some violent, impetuous, and unlimited passion, that is the cause of this distemper; and at such time always, as man is of maturity, and Reason of some ability to govern the other faculties of the Soul, and to put some check to the career of the affections, if it were but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted or suffered. We have Infants idiots, (as we call them) but never have Infants mad, or distracted: He who always wanted Reason to govern himself, can never be said to have lost it, or quite discarded it; as is the case of mad men, who have all other their faculties quick and working, but become totally deprived of their once Moderator and Governour, and doubtless can have no check of Conscience, imagining all they do is right, and thereupon the Law exempts them from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. I have not been much conversant in the Hospital of <hi>Bethlem,</hi> but if it were narrowly enquired, I believe it scarce has a constant residentiary in it, but some violent native passion first gave him his <hi>mittimus</hi> thither. I am ready to acknowledge that every passion in excess, is a short madness; Reason is clouded, shut up, or hid for a time, but not quite extinct, cut off, or shut out of doors: But when that once comes to pass, through the violence of any unruly masterful passion, and from vehement becomes habitual, I doubt it wholly and irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly lost, and question much whether Physicians do not vainly pretend to a perfect and absolute cure. But herein I distinguish between passions, how violent soever, raised from some fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation in the Bloud, (though they seem habitual) as may be from Wine, and several corporal diseases; and such, where
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:50605:62"/>
there being no distemper of the Body, Reason is once disban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or cast off, by the violent career only of some native pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, assisted with the spur of the imagination. For the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of it self, is not of force and ability to destroy Reason; it may be more vain and idle, more extravagant, and less sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to be governed by Reason, than the affections, but if it had any such power of it self to destroy Reason, then might a man lose his Reason from a dream; for then does the imagination work most strongly, and without opposition, and often carries with it terrible presentments to the other faculties of the Soul: But from thence we never find men distracted, or beside them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; it must be some violent waking affection, that does it, when Reason is at hand to oppose, (which is not in a dream) and sets the imagination, like a rouling Engine, on such a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer, as to leave Reason quite behind, and destroyed, and it self never reclaimable from a vain wandring course. They are these passions which metamorphose a man into a furious Beast: 'Tis they which are able to destroy that best faculty, or light of the Soul, Reason; and therefore <hi>Solomon</hi>'s maxim is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served above any, <hi>Custodi cor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But Reason was never yet found of ability, to destroy or wholly mortifie any one passion. It may somewhat from Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine assistance, regulate or calm, lead or direct, but if it should wholly destroy the affections, as some have pretended to do by it, it would prove in the condition of a Prince without Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that is, indeed, no Prince or Governour at all; but we find the Subjects able sometimes, for want of his vigilancy, to destroy their Sovereign, and set up a strange confused Anarchy amongst themselves.</p>
                  <p>Whatever faculty of the Soul we may give precedency to, we sometimes too sensibly find the strength and power of our passions: For besides that they are able to destroy one another, and that love or hatred can drive away fear, and fear is able sometimes to suppress love or hatred; so as it seems more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to determine which of the passions are strongest, then it would be of those things <hi>Darius</hi> his Guard <note n="a" place="margin">1 Esdras 3.</note> 
                     <hi>disputed</hi> about, while he was asleep. They are all strong, and either of them is of power enough oft-times, to make us destroy our selves; or at least neglect our selves, and work more hurt to our Bodies, than any other faculties of the Soul whatsoever.</p>
                  <p>Reason never destroyed any man, the imagination might help to do it, but never did it of it self; but <note n="b" place="margin">Ecclus 7.23.</note> 
                     <hi>sorrow</hi> has done
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:50605:63"/>
it, if we believe the wise Son of <hi>Syrach.</hi> And this common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience will tell every man, who lives, and is not yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, that the slightest of the passions, is able to keep us wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by its proper strength, when the imagination, were it not for some affection, would let us sleep. By the strength of that only (I mean the imagination) we seldom so much as awake from our sleep, unless by some terrible presentment it do irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the affections, and then they are the cause, and not the imagination; and if we do awake thereupon, Reason forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with shews us the folly of our imagination, and our affections become quiet. But when they have their rise from sense, more peculiarly than from the imagination, then is the combate du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious; they then go on in their rebellion, and there is no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery to be obtained over them by power, but by fraud as it were: The Will they outlaw, which was ordained the subject of Reason, and that necessarily carries with it the Organs of the Body as its ministers. The aim of the Will may be good in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, but that is not of power to distinguish between reality and apparency of good; neither good the end, nor virtues the way to that end, have any corporal shape, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be shewed, as so, to the senses, whereby the affections might be reclaimed, and made to fix upon any real good. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides Sense is only judge of present things; Reason of future, as well as present; the imagination is somewhat capable of both: And therefore if ever the affections become fixed on a real good, 'tis not that they are mastered, but that (next and immediately under God's special Grace often leading and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting them) they are deceived into good, hoodwink'd a little from sense, and caught as it were by a wile, or stratagem: The imagination is slily drawn away from taking part with them, and somewhat of real good is first from Reason, as it were, darted into the imagination, and by the imagination con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed unto them.</p>
                  <p>Affections being native, visibly working in us, as soon as we are born, without controul for a long while, (unless <hi>ab extra,</hi> as we say) and no Reason to govern, till they have encamped and fortified themselves; the wise man might well say, <note n="c" place="margin">Prov. 16.32.</note> 
                     <hi>He that ruleth them, is better than he that ruleth a City.</hi> The City where they inhabit, is a deceitful place, many Caves and Vaults in it, for them to lurk in; we find it but too true, when we enter into it, and search it, and think we have wholly won it.

                  <p>I Have thought, and do think, and believe (which is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more then a thought, it is a thought with the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, approbation and allowance of ones Reason) that the Soul of man is immortal; and that the very Essence or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial part of an Humane Soul, disrobed of a Body, or subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it self, is some restless working (however at some times invisible) affection; and that if those more noble faculties of our Soul (next and immediately under that bright heavenly Star) are the Pilots to conduct us unto rest, some affection (as it seems to me) is the chief Passenger in this frail and weak Vessel of the flesh. St. <hi>Paul</hi> in that admirable Encomium of his, of Charity, tells us, that <hi>it abides,</hi> when many other gifts fail. And if <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 13.12.</note> 
                     <hi>we shall know, as we are known,</hi> as he tells us in another place, there will be then little use of the Invention, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, Reason, or the like, which are but the Handmaids to knowledge. Neither can I rationally imagine, after return of the Soul to its place of rest, or for default thereof in its banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to everlasting wandring, any use of other faculties than the affections, unless towards the exalting or heightning them in their several degrees, whether love and joy on the one side, or sorrow, fear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> on the other.</p>
                  <p>The Soul of man being an emanation from that Divine love, must necessarily partake of it, love; and not able at present by any natural light it has, to reach unto it self its proper object, lays hold on any thing, rather than seem to vanish or be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct; and withall that it happens to have such several inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in man, while it is here, is surely by reason of some false imaginary light, or the want of a true one, and that we want both power and skill, in the setting or tuning some strings of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:50605:64"/>
the affections, as I may call them. And 'tis want of a clear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect into our nature and frame, that we become, as <hi>David</hi> speaks, <note n="b" place="margin">Psal. 78.8.</note> 
                     <hi>a stubborn generation, a generation that set not their hearts aright, and whose Spirit cleaveth not stedfastly to God.</hi> And I do fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believe, that all the faculties, strength and power of the Soul, which we have, are given us towards the performance of that <hi>first</hi> and great <hi>Commandment,</hi>

                     <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy mind</hi>: The whole Soul beside, seems naturally subservient, if not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent to the affections motion, and the motion of the Soul would be strange without them, and not imaginable; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as necessary as they are useful. And therefore I think we may as well cease to be, by our own power, as cease to affect; and they who have gone furthest or most covertly herein, have in going about to hide some particular affections, shewed others more visibly; and for the covering of their joy or sorrow, fear or anger, or the like, have set up for predominant in their Soul, a seeming contempt of all things; which is an affection it self, and for ought I know, as subject to be faulty as any. For surely the Soul may seem no less glorious in its march, with all its parts and retinue, than some of them; provided it marches the right way, and each faculty help and assist, and not go about to destroy each other.</p>

                  <head>SECT. VI. How the Affections move from the Imagination, or otherwise.</head>
                  <p>IT does seem to me, as I have said, that the affections, or some or one of them, we properly so call, are, or is the chief inhabitant in this our Body; from which, or from whence, there is, or proceeds motion and operation voluntary. Now if the Imagination be granted to be that glass in the Soul, from whose reflexion they only move, which for the present let us grant; then do I conceive, that glass may receive its light which it casts on them, three manner of ways: 1. By Sense, 2. By Reason, 3. By Divine Revelation, immediately by God, or mediately by his Word.</p>
                  <p>From the two first, the imagination shews unto the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, this present visible World only, but yet after divers man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. From the third it shews them another World; which sight from this last, as it is more glorious, so it is here more
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:50605:64"/>
rare, and men that once obtain it, have their affections so fixed by it, that they seldom quite turn away, or utterly lose it. 'Tis that which I humbly conceive the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> speaks of, with a kind of impossibility of retrieving or renewing it, if once men wilfully turn away from it. <note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 6.4, 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Being</hi> (says he) <hi>once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, and having tasted of the heavenly gift, and made partakers of the Holy Ghost, and have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the World to come; if these fall away,</hi> &amp;c. Then immediately after he uses this expression, <note n="b" place="margin">Vers. 9, 10.</note> 
                     <hi>But beloved, we are perswaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak, for God is not unrighteous, to forget your work and labour of love, which you have shewed towards his name, in that you have mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred to the Saints, and do minister.</hi> As if whatsoever light we had, or whencesoever it came, Love were the worker and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer in our Harvest: but of this I intended not to speak, 'tis a subject very unfit for me to handle; God is gracious and merciful, and as I am not able to depaint that light, so it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves me not to limit his power, no not in my thoughts. But how our affections move from that first or second light, is my intended enquiry at present.</p>
                  <p>From this second kind of light, <hi>viz.</hi> that of Reason, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flex from the imagination, the present World is shewed to the affections, with all its vanities whatsoever; the certain period of man, and all things else in it; the falsity and mutability of it; the futility of the love of it, or care for it. And from the reflex of this light, though the affections are sometimes cooled towards the World, and bent and inclined somewhat towards some greater and more perfect good; yet finding it not, they often suddenly fall away again, and know not where to fix.</p>
                  <p>By reflex from the first light, that of sense only, the World is seen, as Beasts see it, for fleshly delights, and for support and maintenance of the Body, but with this difference between us and them; that their Souls being of a bodily extract, and terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial, their affections move no further than in reference to some present utility of the things of the World for the Body: Ours are coelestial, and of continuance for ever, yet necessitated in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the Body, and for its sustentation, to make use of this light from sense. The concupiscible part of the Soul, being first (and most often) moved from this light, before Reason ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears and shews her self; aud yet never fully satisfied with any present thing it enjoys, (although it often receives its checks
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:50605:65"/>
from reflex of that second light) if it be not graciously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained by the third, and led to take some hold on that good, wherewith it may be somewhat satiate in hope; it grasps at innumerable things, neither useful to Soul or Body; shews only. it is not terrestrial, and yet withall that it is capable to lose in future, its title and signature of coelestial.</p>

                  <head>SECT. VII. What light the Imagination receives from Reason, and the weakness of Reason.</head>
                  <p>THe second way by which light is communicated to the Imagination, and from thence reflected on the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is (as I have said) Reason, which is the proper light and guide of an Humane Soul, and by which it doth discover the vanity of this World. But it is not the least wonder in Nature, that after this light begins with any brightness to shine forth in Man, never so little withdrawn from the noise and business of the World, and, in conjunction with sense for its assistance, doth give him such a clear prospect of its vanity, that a contempt of all its superfluous unnecessaries is raised in the heart, and his affections are so far diverted for the present from it, that a full and somewhat settled resolution is begot there, not to let them possess that place any more: That that man, shall yet forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with from a little pageantry here, presented by the Eye or Ear, have his imagination wheel about again, and by consequence his affections as fast rivetted to the World as ever. Surely there needs must be some Spirit or powerful Prince of the Air, that does bewitch every rational man; how else were it possible almost that such an one discerning his folly and madness, by a far clearer and more excellent light, than that which caused them, shall again often return in despite of it, to act over his folly and madness, which he himself had condemned, and his affections rejected? If there were not, the very light of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son would prove sufficient, so far to extinguish and dazle any weaker light, that the affections might be held, and kept within some ordinary bounds and limits. But then withall, we have ground to believe, and as sure it is, that when we find our sight from Reason thus strangely baffled, and made as it were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to a weaker light; there yet remains and must be, some greater infinite power, above that Prince of the Air, who gave
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:50605:65"/>
us our light of Reason, and from whom we may expect sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; one, who is able to strengthen his first heavenly gift, by a second, and if Reason it self be not Armour sufficient proof against the World, or the Prince of this World, where we now live, there is somewhat to be asked and given, that may be so; which I shall speak of hereafter in due place.</p>
                  <p>I am at present in quest of Reason only, that inherent Eye, or light of the Soul, of what use that may be towards our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness or bliss. Why truly unless it smooth out some way for the current of our affections, and a little turn the stream of them; it may prove in the latter end to have the quality <hi>Solomon</hi> attributes to knowledge, <hi>increase our sorrow.</hi> Be it never so great, or shine never so bright, Satan will allow it us, and matters not though it be always imployed on Heaven, so our affections be imployed on the World, or at best, only kept in, that they move or search no whither beside it. He knows well, that for men to chain up, or to condemn them to imprisonment within the Body, is impossible. When once from the light of Reason, and its influence on mans Soul, the affections shall become like a Water at full Tide, seeming to move neither way; if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn not to the Ocean, they will be sure from so many Springs feeding them from Land, to break in again upon that. If Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son be but able so much as to give some stroke to the affections, (as I have touched in the definition of Conscience) and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less every man has in some measure felt it, then certainly 'tis an earnest of some greater light, which that Prince of the Air endeavours by all means to have hid from us. And that the one may never lead us or direct us to the other, (whereby our affections might work another way, and he be deceived of his hold) he is willing we should believe, that this our best na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive light <hi>Reason,</hi> is but a pure emanation from the Body, which if so, how can we ever expect any other. And 'tis no slight artifice of his, that he has brought us now-a-days to impute every sober serious thought, arising in the Soul, every check upon the affections, every <note n="a" place="margin">Jer. 8.6.</note> 
                     <hi>quid feci?</hi> (as <hi>Ieremy</hi> expresses it) towards a return, to some temperature of the Body, and call it Melancholy; and herein he has got the assistance of some of our bodily Physicians, to attribute a little too much to that Mine, wherein they dig their Oar. I would fain know, what affinity there is between the thoughts of Judgment, Justice, Mercy, or another World; and the Body? If I could find it, I should then think the wiser sorts of Animals had such thoughts,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:50605:66"/>
and could be melancholick too. How the Body first espied any such thing with its Eyes, is strange to me. It is not the Body, but Reason the off-spring from above, and usher of some greater light, that is of ability to behold some things future; and when from the light of Reason, the Soul shall stand for a while at amaze, to behold what a thorny labyrinth she is got into, (whatever Flowers may grow in it) knows not, for the present, which way best to move, but desires direction from above in all her motions; to attribute this to the Bodies tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature, what ground have we? Never let us seek for the Hellebore now in fashion for a cure. If Reason be the Beam, that which men call Melancholy, will prove as steady a Hand to weigh things present and future in the Scales, as any Airy temper in the Soul, they call Sanguine. And while Reason is in the Enquest, it will neither hurt the Soul or Body; but in some measure take an equal care of the one, and of the other.</p>
                  <p>We might as well, and upon as firm grounds, impute every disease in the Body whatsoever, to some impression of the Soul upon it, as every motion or mutation of the Soul, to some tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature or change in the Body. There is, no doubt, some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal operation between them; and as they confess some diseases to have their origine from some passion in the Soul, and yet not all, or most diseases; so shall I readily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that the Soul works many times diversly, and in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent form and manner in the Body, according to divers lets and rubs it meets with there; is brighter, or dimmer, according to the subject matter it works in; and this without derogation from its Sovereignty or Immortality, more then we do detract from the nature or quality of Fire, when we say it gives a clearer light from Pitch than Brimstone. I shall agree, it is now and then dull, and as it were lumpish and heavy from obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and whenever 'tis stopped in its passage, and its operation, in its more noble and chief rooms, and receptacles of the Body, it makes its <hi>Exit.</hi> I shall agree likewise, that 'tis tied by the Law of Nature, to take thoughts and care (not immoderate) as well of the Body, as it self; and has Reasons allowance and accordance for it. I am not endeavouring to bereave any man of his senses, or hinder the Soul to look abroad that way, or to make man expect to be fed, and cloathed, or healed of diseases, from Heaven barely; yet withall, I think every defect or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance of the Soul, every flight or turn of it, is not rightly
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50605:66"/>
imputed to the Bodies temperature; since we are able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern its strange mutations and changes on the sudden, even in a moment, without any alteration of the Body, or any seeming help of Sense; and if it were possible to keep the Body always in one state, condition and frame, and deprive the Soul from all intromission of sense for a time, Reason might consider its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and future being. Yet 'tis very requisite the Soul should move here as well by Sense, as by Reason, or any other light. He who thinks he has it ravish'd from the Body here, has it converted from a Pilgrim and Traveller, to a Vagrant and a Wanderer: And such there are too many, who by the help of Satan, would imagine themselves out of the Body, while they are in it; Extinguish their light of Reason, and Sense too toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, sometimes, by a new Light the World shall never be able to define, nor say whence it arises, unless from that Lake of Fire, which has the title too of <hi>utter darkness.</hi> 'Tis not a little withdrawing of the Soul, or consideration how it should or ought to act in the Body, with the Body; but this strange ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary roving flight of it, is that which may properly assume the attribute or title of Melancholly. This is it, surely, in a lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral derivation, that is, the suggestion or inspiration of some <hi>Black Fury.</hi>

                  <p>I have only this reserve left, in reference to this desirable good, and excellent gift, That an inherent <hi>Prudence</hi> in man (the Flower of Reason, and in some degree the Dowry of every rational Soul) may with some secret Divine assistance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce much to the present ease and rest, and also future happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Soul: For that <hi>Prudence,</hi> or Humane wisdom, as we may call it, putting no false gloss upon things, nor therein so deceiving the affections in their enjoyment, but shewing all things to them as vanity, and withall, that from Reason she is not able to shew them any thing beyond that inscription; she does as it were prepare the affections, to stand quiet, ready, and attendant for some other thing to be presented to them, and to catch hold thereon upon any occasion or offer; without any great turbulency, or admitting fear or distrust to accompany them over-much, in reference to the enjoyment or loss of any of those things, which Reason has, as it were, once convinced them to be vain, or forced them at some time to reject as such.</p>
                  <p>The affections will move of themselves in despite of us; 'tis a good guide they want, to find out good, which is always their aim. Reason is a good guide, but we often want a better; <note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 4.6.</note> 
                     <hi>There be many that say,</hi> (says the Psalmist) <hi>who will shew us any good?</hi> but not expecting with patience, the <hi>light</hi> in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verse, which only puts true <hi>gladness into the heart,</hi> think they can find it of themselves, and though all pretend to that good, run as various courses as imaginable. For not looking fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right upon the Goal, nor considering whatever thing unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary we reach at, and take up here in the way, becomes a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:50605:67"/>
to us, and how at that Goal of death we must part with all; the affections stoop in the course, and catch at the Golden Apple in the way, and sometimes a more trivial thing, a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a puff, every man at somewhat, though never so mean and sordid.</p>
                  <p>I do yet think the Soul of man, however it moves, or from what power soever it moves, to be in its proper genuine equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page of march here; when Reason shines in her most bright, and so, as the affections principally and chiefly move according to her light, when every faculty is as it were up and ready for motion, each one attends the other, and yet moves not far, or any great distance, but expects her directions. When at any time the Soul looks through the windows of the Body, Sense, she makes use of that light, no farther than for the present sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of that building, and <note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 7.31.</note> 
                     <hi>uses the world</hi> (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> expresses it) <hi>as not using it.</hi> But when we once become so unhappy, as that one kind of affection takes up his quarters or repose here, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there, and quarrel about their Lodging, and mutiny about their Guides too; when they sometimes quite desert, and reject the one, to follow the other; when, though Reason will admit Sense in her company, yet the Affections once up in Arms for Sense, will not admit Reason; then from each faculty of the Soul, thus out of order, and not performing its Office aright, it happens that no one of them moves with ease or quiet; neither shall we find any rest, until we find some more than ordinary way or means of pacifying, and right marshalling this disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly multitude of unruly appetites and affections.</p>
                  <p>I am very much assured, there never was sober rational man, but at some time or other has had in his Soul, some combate between his Affections and his Reason; and withall, has found his Reason baffled by them. And therefore methinks that very Reason that cannot rule in the case, and finds it so, might how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever admonish and point to the Affections, and set us on work, if it be but to will or desire earnestly to find out some remedy, or have it shewn us; which Reason it self cannot extract from all the imagination is able to bring in, nor is in the strength and power of the Soul. Which brings me to my last part of enquiry, what may be the best way and method, to reclaim the disorders of the Soul, and reduce it to some quiet estate, and composure for the present.</p>

                  <head>SECT. I. Means to reclaim the Soul.</head>
                  <p>ABsolute power and ability in man, from the greatest strength of Reason, there is none; and I dare say, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever takes it for granted in the premisses of his tryal, will deny it in the conclusion. What? can that wholly allay the tumours in the Soul, which is in some manner the very cause or occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of those tumours? It is the very appearance of Reason, as I have said, and shewing her self in the Soul, that often begets these Agonies in it. The passions are like some rude and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Rout, that the more endeavour is used to reclaim them, the more violent and outragious they become, and the more fierce and heady in their excursions; when it may be let alone, and not opposed, they would forthwith cool, and vanish of themselves. When we were Children, and had none, or very little Reason to govern our affections, perhaps there might be some scuffle amongst our passions, but nothing from thence that ever caused a wounded Spirit; only some little scars, or scratches, which a short space of time without Medicine would heal. Knowledge such as we have, (which some would to be the off-spring of Reason, though I think it has no such issue, of which I mean to say somewhat elsewhere) may sometimes perhaps work contrary effects, and decrease sorrow, as well as (the wise man says) <hi>increase it</hi>; but it will do neither of both, from any absolute inherent quality in it. We often experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally find, knowledge and a troublesom weary life, as well as sometimes a sinful, are not things incompatible, but may subsist together. Reason, the Mother of most, if not all, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Humane gifts, (as Prudence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) is of some ability to judge of her own weak product, that it cannot suppress what is bred of other faculties of the Soul: When she has weighed all that the Imagination is capable to introduce, though she apply, yet she can judge and determine it not to be of full solid weight or efficacy to master that, which for ought she can find or judge, has the instigation and aid of a Foreign and stronger Prince; she finds she has no absolute power at any time over the Imagination, and if the Imagination forsake her but a moment, and side with any other party, she is at a loss. What then? must we cast away our Reason, to be at peace
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:50605:68"/>
and quiet, and have her let go the Reins she is used to hold over the affections, though she cannot stay them or rule them? No! she teaches us of course and consequence, from her dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability found out and acknowledged, to pray in aid of some stronger power, and finding she has no power, she may incline the subject by her motions, and facilitate it for the admission of some new gift, of greater strength and force. She may, and does sometimes, draw in Moral Virtues, for the superstructure of Spiritual Graces. Nay if that cannot be said to be her work properly, <hi>quatenus</hi> she is native in us, but that they require the title of God's preventing restraining Grace in us; they are then good symptoms, that God will perfect and crown that work he has begun in us. It is enough, I say, for Reason to shew us our errors, (if that ability may be allowed her) though she cannot reclaim us; to judge we are restless, and uneasie, though she cannot ease us. There is no man that has her, but at some time or other, from her, has taken up the Prophets wish and exclamation, <note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 55.6.</note> 
                     <hi>O that I had wings like a Dove, for then would I fly away, and be at rest</hi>: But then 'tis silently owned and agreed, there is something else, if it were to be found, that must give us ease, and give us patience, to wait the leisure till that thred of life be cut, which pinions our Souls to our Bodies, so as at present they cannot fly away to any certain continuing rest; and there is somewhat else, beside Reason, that must imp the feathers of our passions too, that we flutter not too much here. There is a rest in Hope, which not Reason but Faith doth give us the prospect of; and by the firm belief of which, and in our Saviour who came to <hi>bring that life to light,</hi> and hath gone before to prepare it for us, we can only hope to bring our passions, those restless inmates of our Souls, into any order. This our Saviour gives as the ground of assured com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, <note n="b" place="margin">John 16.33.</note> 
                     <hi>be of good chear, I have overcome the World</hi>; and the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> spends a <note n="c" place="margin">Chap. 11.</note> whole Chapter on the several won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Faith hath wrought, in the direction, supportation, and quieting of Souls in this Earthly Pilgrimage, as a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for us against future troubles, and as an argument for our agreeable behaviour under them: Faith being the ground or <hi>substance of things hoped for,</hi> and without which Hope had no sure Basis of Foundation. Those excellent incomparable Heathens, who saw so far, and went so far, by the light of their Reason, as we say, (if that may be termed theirs) what do we know but that they might have in company with it, some glimmering
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:50605:69"/>
light of some Saviour of the World, as well as they had of a God, and a World to come? And though they are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in Sacred History, amongst the Acts of that peculiar people the <hi>Iews</hi>; there might be other Heathen men as well as <hi>Iob,</hi> that wished <note n="d" place="margin">Job 19.23, 24, 25.</note> 
                     <hi>their words</hi> (or thoughts) <hi>were written</hi> (or printed) <hi>in a Book,</hi> and were assured that <hi>their Redeemer lived,</hi> and that they should see him with their Eyes. It must be some such Antidote as this, of Faith, that of it self has power at all times to quiet the Soul, and allay its surges; and this may very naturally (if I may be allowed so to speak) accompany or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Reason, provided Reason can see her own inability, not trust to her self; and after she finds or doubts, takes not upon her to be the sole Empress, Ruler, or Guide in the Soul. We have the word of the chiefest of the Apostles, what be found and perceived at last, in the case of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> 
                     <note n="e" place="margin">Acts 10.35.</note> 
                     <hi>That in every Nation, he that feareth God, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him</hi>; and yet, <note n="f" place="margin">Hebr. 11.6,</note> 
                     <hi>without Faith,</hi> 'tis said, <hi>'tis impossible to please God:</hi> And therefore Faith must be <hi>the Anchor of the Soul,</hi> to keep it steady, and from being tossed about, and ready to perish from the waves raised by it self.</p>
                  <p>My Soul has somewhat wandred now indeed from its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended purpose, my thoughts at first being only to depaint, or set forth a Soul, as well as I could, in its ordinary Ethnick ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel; and to consider what ways and means there are, which we might possibly in Humane reason or probability find out, for the quieting, well-ordering and governing of our Souls, and to that I shall return.</p>
                  <p>If we find, or think our selves got into a streight or error, Reason would that we make a stay, and consider, call a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of our faculties, and have them all attendant. Now first, if our Soul be capable to err, necessarily its error must be defined; which is a wandring, or going from its Creator, that first gave it Being, and from his appointed ways and methods; and therefore of consequence, the foundation of a more pleasant structure, must be thus laid. We must with all the inherent faculties of our Soul, acknowledge the errors of all those facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and therefore according to my shallow reason, our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy is well begun, and I cannot see in reason what cavil can be made to that part, unless we are thought by some, to do ill in resembling our selves to those more innocent creatures, Sheep; and might have more truly said, as the World now goes, We have erred and strayed from thy ways like Swine or
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:50605:69"/>
Goats: This is the natural probable way for remission and restitution. We have something like a Deity in our selves, and whenever we receive an acknowledgment from any person, who has dependance on us, of his neglect of us, and perceive any thing of trouble or sorrow in the party, we forthwith par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and receive again into favour. And 'tis our only rational way in the like case, to acknowledge our errors, and get our affections somewhat hot, and then melting in us, that any dross contracted in our Souls, any cankering rust cleaving to them, may drop off, that they may be somewhat bright, and shine again. The Heathens, who had no other light but this to lead them, had their purgations, (of which <hi>Socrates,</hi> I think, was the beginner) which, though after a vain manner, may seem no ways to hurt them: And certainly this manner of purgation, that is, melting into sorrow, may do us good, and prevent many sharp pains the Soul might otherwise feel, even here in the Body. I am not about to enquire and determine, whether after thus doing, we shall be at rest here, or how far, more or less, from hence, the Soul may become obnoxious to afflictions, or crosses; but certainly in all reason, she will bear them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter when she has done all she can towards a return, and can find in her self no ground to think, but that her boils proceed rather from some outward, than any inward cause, and that her disease is rather Epidemical, than singular.</p>
                  <p>Having our Souls somewhat restored and cleansed, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what at ease and calm; we may, I trust, without offence, and without rejection of more Sovereign Antidotes, make use of our Reason, towards the preventing of a Tempest in her for the future, by finding out and judging, if we can, first, the most probable and chief cause of her billows, and why she is often thus tossed, and almost shipwrack'd in the World; and next, espy out some ways or means, for the future prevention of these storms.</p>
                  <p>But first by the way, let us acknowledge, that Reason in man, such as it is, and whereby we exceed all other visible creatures, as it is the special gift of God, and the thing we have least cause to term our own, or too much think of the native<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or inherency of it in us; so it wants a more than ordinary daily support and supply, (for 'tis that faculty or ability in the Soul, which, I have said, man is most subject wholly to lose, and be deprived and bereft of) and without beholding through it,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cum ratione insanire.</hi>
                     </note> that light which gave it being, we may, as I may say, run <hi>mad</hi>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:50605:70"/>
with our Reason. And such Rationalists there are in the World; for why some men, who have had a greater outward visibility and appearance of Reason than others, have yet acted in the conclusion, as if they had less; if this presumption in them be not the cause, or that they looked on their strength of Reason too much as an Habit, and too little as a Grace, I can find none.</p>
                  <p>If the Donor of the Talent be but owned, it may surely as well be Traded with, as laid up in a Napkin; and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, even from it may be found out too some other inherent gift in the Soul, which if rightly disposed and ordered, (I will not say disposed or ordered by Reason) may somewhat abate all excrescencies in the Soul, and become the chief and only Foundation-stone, for any Spiritual building spoken of before, even that Tower of defence, Faith. Reason, I say, may point at, or find out, the proper corner-stone for building, though she cannot move it of her self, or erect any thing on it.</p>

                  <head>SECT. II. Of Love.</head>
                  <p>SUrely he who created us, neither gave us Invention to find out, nor Reason to judge in vain. I must acknowledge, I am not able so much as to think a good thought, nor well able to judge when my thoughts are as they should, or might or ought to be; yet that roving faculty of mine (call it men what they best like) labouring to introduce into my Soul di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and sundry causes of the disquietness, tumults and disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders happening in her, as well as others; my weak Reason (after rejection of some) has seemed to rest satisfied, and pitch'd upon this, as the chief, if not the only proper cause thereof: That that essential part of the Soul, Love, from whence at some times we feel greatest delight, suffers often too narrow an inclosure, is pent up, and imprisoned by some means or other, and has neither that free scope and range, or full and clear prospect abroad into the World, which Reason is able to allow it and afford it, whereby it loses that common acceptable title of Charity; in a word, Love is not rational, but sensual.</p>
                  <p>Love may seem, with the allowance of our Reason, I think, to be placed in every of our Souls, like the Sun in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:50605:70"/>
which though it may have peculiar Flowers, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more than its ordinary influence, at least its visible rays, (and we are allowed some such things as we may more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly call here, Flowers of our Sun) yet its circuit should be to the ends of the Earth, and <note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 19.6.</note> 
                     <hi>nothing hid from the heat thereof</hi>: And then whatever becomes of those Flowers, though they are cropt, dead, or withered, it finds innumerable objects to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise its rays upon, and still shines bright and pleasant: but if it become once eclipsed by the interposition of any peculiar ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, there happens such an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> darkness in the Soul, as most properly may be said to be felt.</p>
                  <p>Whenever we look into the Soul, and find such a thing as Love there; Reason, though it be not able to quicken, nor blow it up to any bright extensive flame, (for that is ever from Divine influence) yet can demonstrate to us, to what end and purpose that spark of Love is inherent in us; that is, to love the Author of our Being. Now as we cannot see God, but by his works, so neither can we be properly said to love him, but through his works: Amongst which, as there is nothing more deserves our love, than such as bear his Image in common with our selves; so there is no more certain way to judge of the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of our love to him, than by our love to them. Thus the Apostle, <note n="b" place="margin">1 John 4.12.</note> 
                     <hi>If we love one another, God dwelleth in us</hi>; and again, <note n="c" place="margin">Vers. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>He that loveth not his Brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?</hi> This is so much the dictate of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that I should have thus thought upon consideration, had I never seen Scripture; and it is to a certain Law antecedent to all that is written, that the Scripture it self doth refer it: Thus the Apostle speaks, <note n="d" place="margin">1 John 2.7.</note> 
                     <hi>I write no new Commandment unto you, but an old Commandment which ye had from the beginning</hi>; and calls it, <note n="e" place="margin">Chap. 3.11, 12.</note> 
                     <hi>the message from the beginning</hi>; of the breach of which he gives an instance in <hi>Cain</hi>'s unnatural murder of his Brother, before there was any written Law; so that the Apostle might in this sense say, <note n="f" place="margin">1 Thes. 4.9</note> 
                     <hi>As touching brotherly love, ye need not that I write unto you; for ye your selves are taught of God,</hi> by the light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the Law written in the heart, <hi>to love one another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if the obligation to this Charity ariseth from a general Reason, as we are born alike, are of the same mould, have our Being from, and equally bear the Image of the same Father, should not our Love be universal? And may we stile our selves of <hi>Paul,</hi> or of <hi>Apollos,</hi> and then in assuming the Title, cast away our Charity and our Reason too? Must we in bandying for
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:50605:71"/>
our Teraphim so far arm our passions, and blind our Charity, as to reject and contemn others persons for the sake of their Opinions, which they differ from us in? Whatsoever our Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions are, Truth is God's peculiar; we may seek for it, and pray for it, but I question much whether we ought to run over, and trample down one another, in the finding of it. We are all very apt to err in the pursuit, and as I have once said, our Liturgy is well begun, in the acknowledgment of our errors; so I now think it ends as well, in our request, That it would please God <hi>to grant us in this World some knowledge of his Truth, and in the World to come life everlasting</hi>: His it is, and so locked up, that I doubt no man yet ever had the certain infallible Keys, to open it to others. Though <hi>Pilate</hi> believed not our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to be God, yet if he had not known, that he was taken and believed on for such, I do not think he would ever have put that ironical question to him, <hi>What is Truth?</hi> He well knew, man was not able to define it, nor attain to any certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, much less appropriate it to himself. St. <hi>Paul</hi> never told us, he himself was the <hi>Light,</hi> or the <hi>Truth</hi>; he rather assures us otherwise, and that he <hi>was not crucified us</hi>; and we are not very apt to believe St. <hi>Peter</hi> was. But a sober Heathen, that should see our heats, would be prone to judge, we almost thought some other men were, (who they are, I will not go about to determine) and that though Truth may be the colour, and pretended, yet 'tis Mammon or Dominion are the Gods they fight for; when for the sake of Truth, they lose all Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and in contending for, and exalting of Faith, the solid fruits of both, Good Works, are despised.</p>
                  <p>I would not be thought in the least to undervalue or reject that gift, or tenure in Frankalmoign, or Free-Alms, (a Lawyers term not improper for this place) <hi>Faith</hi>; since without it, from all the labour and search I am able to make, I cannot find suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in man, to attain to any possession of a present, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of a future happiness. I do own it to be the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent gift which comes down from Heaven, but I fear we are subject sometimes to relie too much on it, or (if it be not improper so to say) put too much confidence in it, place it always uppermost in the Soul; to the starving of that otherwise vigorous and active quality of the Soul, Charity.</p>
                  <p>I stand convinced, that if the most righteous man on Earth, did take a full and intire view of all his best actions, (whether proceeding from himself, or of Grace, such as we call <hi>gratis data,</hi>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:50605:71"/>
we will not here dispute) together with his wilful errors and deformities, and make his Reason judge of the weight and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of each, he would distrust and deny himself, and all he were able to do, and expect his Justification (if he expected any) of God's mere favour and grace; and therefore I am content it should stand for a received truth, that the best works of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel, are not only unacceptable with God, but sinful. Yet as I believe the Scriptures, excluding many men from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, or future happiness, under the divers titles of sinners, and all under the notion of Infidels; so, since there is a <hi>salvo</hi> for penitents, I know not who those sinners are, much less do I know the faithful, from any outward badge or cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance they wear, and therefore am unfit to judge any but my self. For I could never yet, nor shall I believe, unless I become able first to reject and abandon that Reason I have, or that Reason leaves and forsakes me, find just cause to condemn in my thoughts, any one Nation or People, any one Sect or Party, or any one single person in the World besides, for the bare want of a publick profession, (I exclude here wilful denial) or owning of Faith, just according to that model, as any one Nation, or Council, or selected number of men have framed it, so long as I behold in him, or them, those works which are the usual concomitants and attendants, of what I think, and is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally held to be, the true Faith.</p>
                  <p>I do not think it safe to wish my Soul with the Philosophers, but had all my actions, after some knowledge of good and evil, been always conformable and agreeable to their Writings, and such as the actions of some of them seem to have been, I think I should never despair of future happiness, or rest, were my Faith weaker than some men perhaps will imagine it, from my thus writing. What was the cause of their good works? was it Faith? If it were not, I am sure it was the Grace of God, and to them who owned it so, or the work of a Divine power, that Grace was not likely to be in vain.

                  <p>We read of a good and charitable man, a Gentile, who so loved the Nation of the <hi>Iews,</hi> that he built them a Synagogue; concerning whose Faith at that time, there is nothing more to be collected from the story of him, than that having heard of the fame of <hi>Iesus,</hi> he did believe he was able to heal his Servant; and yet the Author and finisher of our Faith gives this testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of him, <note n="i" place="margin">Luk. 7.9.</note>

Truly a Centurion's Faith may best become us, an humble, not an arrogant Faith, and it may in some sort be safest for us to think, that if he vouchsafe to come under our roof, we are unworthy he should, and unfit any manner of ways to entertain him.</p>
                  <p>We are apt not only to extol our Faith, but to impose and force it upon others, and condemn all men who receive it not as 'twere from us, and from our hands. Indeed he who feels any blessed effect of his own Faith, will not only wish all men believed as he did, but endeavour, without breach or rent of Charity, they should: But surely methinks he should not with ease, or without feeling some smart, undergo a rupture in his own Charity, for the transplanting the same Faith into others, since he will certainly find, neither himself, nor any man bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was the planter of it in himself; nor think there should be any diminution of the one, for the propagating (as we call it) of the other, in other men. Without some rent of this thing called Charity, I doubt whether there can be an approbation of, or assent to <hi>Cleonard</hi>'s proposition to the Princes of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; that is, (without other just cause) an endeavour to shew the <hi>Turk</hi> our Faith, with Temporal Armour over it, if we were able so to do; and put part of his Nation to the Sword, to draw or hale the remnant of them to the Faith, and to heal some Souls through the wounds of others Bodies. They are men as well as we, of the same mould, and their Souls of the same extraction, and we might consider first, how we could approve of the like conviction amongst our selves. The Sword doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less has often made a way for Faith, and I believe it to be, or happens sometimes, through God's Eternal wise decree; but I do much question the truth of those mens Faith, who are
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:50605:72"/>
upon such a reason at any time the immediate visible instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this preparative. When a man shall once own the New Testament, as the Word of Truth, and stand convinced, that all the Precepts laid down therein are righteous, and grounded on Moral equity; if he make his recourse to the New for his belief only, and to the Old only for some of his actions, I would ask a Stranger in that case, whether he thinks that man's Reason, or his Affections, bear the greatest sway, or be most predominant in his Soul.</p>
                  <p>It may seem strange, how some men can step from Mount <hi>Gerizim,</hi> to Mount <hi>Ebal,</hi> as it were at will and pleasure; settle a Tower of peace, or defence for themselves on the one, and raise a Tower of offence against others on the other; let the one be the seat for their Reason, and the other for their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and place Faith (as they call it) the attendant on both, and that Reason all this while should not espy that the Affections lead it thither. There is one, esteemed a great planter, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former of our Faith in these parts, who to maintain the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Malediction in some case, (I am sure against <note n="m" place="margin">Mat. 5.44. Rom. 12.14.</note> 
                     <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>precept,</hi> and his example, who <note n="n" place="margin">Luk. 23.34.</note> 
                     <hi>prayed for his persecutors,</hi> and against <note n="o" place="margin">Acts 7.60.</note> St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s too, who did the like) would make a distinction between a persecution of man, (though for the Gospel) and a persecution of the Gospel. If it be against the persecutors of the Gospel, (according to his definition) he then calls it Faiths malediction, or cursing; which, says he, rather than God's Word should be suppressed, or Heresie maintained, wisheth that all creatures went to rack. If this be the work or effect of some mens Faith, I hope I may say without offence, I pray God deliver me from such a Faith. Surely it may be questioned, how, and in what manner the Gospel of it self may suffer persecution; and no less whether the believers therein, would suffer so much from their common Enemies, or one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, were it not for their too positive condemnation sometimes of all, who do not believe just as they do, or profess themselves to do. <hi>Theano</hi> a Heathen Nun, had, in my opinion, more Divine thoughts in her, than some of our late Reformers; and 'twas a better and far more charitable saying of hers, when by publick Decree she was commanded, amongst others, to ban and curse <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> for prophaning their reputed Holy mysteries, <hi>That her profession was to pray, and to bless, not to curse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am so far from adhering to any party, more than other, and so far prone to blame all parties in this case, that I am not

like to receive the favour, or good opinion of any: But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever I receive from man, I trust and believe I shall never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur God's displeasure, for declaring my sence of things only, according to the best light of Reason he has endowed me with. Some such thing I do believe there is on Earth, as St. <hi>Augustine</hi> has intitled his Book, <hi>A City of God,</hi> that is, a peculiar select number of people, who so pass their lives here, as that they shall be Eternally happy hereafter. But for several men, to frame and imagine such a peculiar City in any Nation, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the World, different in some fashion, form, or mode, from all others, and then think that to be the Model, or Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form upon which future happiness must necessarily be built, or depend, seems very strange to me, and may do so perhaps to some others. I cannot think those Citizens, whoever they are, require such a different habit, or dress from all others; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, all of them generally use one special attire, or ornament for the Soul, whereof somewhat is to be found in all Nations and places, and which men free of that City, may be best known and distinguished by: And that is, that becoming or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament St. <hi>Paul</hi> seems to mention upon another account, <note n="p" place="margin">1 Tim. 2.10.</note> 
                     <hi>Good works</hi>; that <hi>ornament</hi> which naturally arises from a <hi>meek and quiet Spirit,</hi> which St. <hi>Peter</hi> seems to intimate, <note n="q" place="margin">1 Pet. 3.4.</note> 
                     <hi>the hidden man of the heart</hi>; not outwardly worn in pomp, but that, whosoever pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately wears, or carries about him, will not too narrowly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sect, rend and tear, much less suddenly condemn the Spirit of another man. True Charity, saith the Apostle, <note n="r" place="margin">1 Cor. 13.7.</note> 
                     <hi>beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things</hi>; and if we put on that which is <note n="s" place="margin">Col. 3.13.</note> 
                     <hi>the bond of perfectness,</hi> it will reconcile us to all mankind, and be as useful to others, as it is ornamental to us. It will be like the Dove in the Ark, as swift of wing, and as fit to be sent abroad upon any employment, as the Raven or Vulture; and with that will bring a branch of Olive, solid contentment and satisfaction to our selves: we shall then have all <note n="t" place="margin">1 Cor. 5.7.</note>

                  <head>SECT. III. How Love may be regent?</head>
                  <p>I May seem before to have undertaken a rational discourse of the Soul, and to shew by what steps and degrees even that way, it may be fitted to resist assaults from without; and therefore in reason it may be expected, that I should set down some rule, some probable demonstrable way or means, how this thing I call Charity, which is ever the main principle of Action, may be set up regent in the Soul; which I have said, and do think there is some stamp of in Nature, no less than there is of Justice, which all or most men agree to, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> each of them is become much obliterate. But now since Charity is so much the chief spring and principle of Action, it's fit it should be so directed and assisted, that it may either be preferr'd to its Regency where it is any ways obstructed, or be preserved in it. And the means hereunto will be the better dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, if it be considered, that there is a certain connexion betwixt the Graces and Virtues of the Soul, and a mutual light and assistance which they lend one to the other in their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore though Love doth appear to be the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, yet it is not alone, in its motion, but what doth depend upon, and owe much of its vigour to the concurrence of the rest. As for instance, Humility doth not a little administer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, as it ariseth from a prospect into our own weakness and insufficiency; and as there is somewhat greater and more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect than our selves in the World, so that shews our Love should be accordingly directed; and that God, who is the Author of our Being and preservation, and is infinitely perfect in himself, should therefore be loved by us with all the heart, and all the Soul. But because man may be lowly and humble, and think meanly of himself, and yet not presently find a ready rule, for drawing his Lines to the circumference; let us see if we can extract Love, by the rule of Justice. This is most certain, that we would be loved of all that know us; we would be aided and assisted in all our dangers and troubles; we would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved and comforted in all our wants and needs; why then, let this be the rule, <hi>To do so to all persons, as we would in right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son they should do to us,</hi> if their state and condition were ours, and ours theirs. This is a common rule, but such as certainly
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50605:74"/>
deserves precedency of all the sage maxims the World has at any time afforded, and might well without hurt to us, like <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Rod, devour all those of the best Magicians and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanters, that we might only make use of that upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. He who has it once well engraven in the Tables of his heart, will need little other precept or rule to walk by. It is a rule, that with variation of a word or two, is applicable to the direction and government of our actions and passions too, not only in relation to our fellow-members, but in reference to all irrational creatures under us; and, I hope without offence I may say, in reference to our actions towards our Creator. For certainly had we power to create of nothing, we should expect of our creatures love and reverence, duty and obedience; and therefore we ought by all ways we are able, to pay them to our Creator. What occurrence is there in man's life, that this rule may not be laid to? A man would think at first view and conjecture, it were as far from being applicable to, or having any thing in it Sovereign for my distemper of Sorrow, as might be. <hi>Facias quod fieri vis, &amp;c.</hi> seems at first sight to have little probability of any sanative ingredient for that passion; yet, narrowly searched into, it has. If I interrogate my self, whether having near Relation, Friend, or child, whom I dearly loved, I would they should for loss of me, drown themselves in a floud of tears and sorrow? I can readily make answer in the negative, I would not. I might be willing and content, that in all their thoughts and words of me, they carried some civil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and esteem for me, but proceeded no further. And why then should I exceed that measure, which I would have only meted out for my self? All excess and excrescence springs from self-love, Charity has none; and this rule may as well help to frame it, as any I can imagine.</p>
                  <p>When I have been alone, and my thoughts have been at any time in travail to bring forth and frame, or to find out already framed some short general rule, by which the Soul might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways move with least grief and offence, and with greatest ease and pleasure, I have ever pitched upon this, <hi>quod tibi fieri non vis, &amp;c.</hi> as the most exact and universally comprehensive, and far beyond <hi>Epictetus</hi> his <hi>sustine, &amp; abstine,</hi> or any other; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the most effectual relief against all incursion and invasion from without, and a firm Basis for Charity to be founded upon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it is indeed for the introduction of universal love and charity into our hearts, that our Saviour lays down this
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:50605:74"/>
rule, <note n="a" place="margin">Luk. 6.31, 32.</note> 
                     <hi>As ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise: For</hi> (the following words) <hi>if ye love them which love you, what thanks have ye? for sinners also do even the same.</hi> And St. <hi>Matthew</hi> setting down that precept in these words, <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 7.12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them,</hi> adds by way of argument, <hi>For this is the Law and the Prophets.</hi> What the Law and the Prophets are, and what they <hi>hang upon,</hi> or mean, our <note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 22.35<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</note> Saviour tells a Lawyer elsewhere, that is, <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbour as thy self.</hi> He who came not to destroy, but to fulfil the Law, puts us in mind of that first and great Commandment, that Law of Nature, I may say, which till we fulfil in some measure, our question will be vain, as his was there, who asked, <note n="d" place="margin">Luk. 10.25, 26.</note> 
                     <hi>What shall I do to inherit eternal life?</hi> and we can have no fitter reply that <hi>How readest thou?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But though in this progress of Love towards its perfection and Regency, Humility and Justice (which bear upon them the stamp of Nature) do greatly contribute; yet there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more necessary to purifie and refine it, and to make it more powerful, effectual, and durable, and that is Faith. Faith, I say, that Divine Grace, which doth present such objects to us, as Reason either could not at all, or but imperfectly discover; but yet when discovered and approved by our Reason, are of that nature and consequence, that they forthwith excite, attract, and engage our Love, and make it to be predominant. And therefore it's necessary to consult Revelation, by which alone these objects are thus made known, and to strengthen our Faith in it; that so our love of them for their excellency, and our hope of enjoying them, with respect to our happiness, may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an effectual means of life and action, and give new strength to all the powers of our Soul in the prosecution of them. Then will our Love grow great indeed, and that which is here thus Regent in us, will hereafter be Triumphant; for <hi>Charity never faileth.</hi> Charity then is the end of the rest, and to which they do tend as Lines to their Center; and as they do lend help unto that, so that again doth give perfection to them, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which they are, in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s phrase, but <hi>as sounding Brass, or a tinckling Cymbal,</hi> that whatever noise they may make, are of no benefit to us. Thus the Apostle speaking of the abiding here of Faith, Hope, and Charity, tells us, <note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor. 13.13.</note> 
                     <hi>the greatest of these is Charity;</hi> of which (reversing his method and order in placing of them) I shall say thus much in short; 'tis Charity must guide
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:50605:75"/>
and direct us, 'tis Hope must relieve and support us, and 'tis Faith by which we must enter into rest; that must be the Key that must open to us, and let us in, after all our travails; and if Faith do ever become a Crown, and Hope an Helmet, we must have before Charity for our Breast-plate, badge or cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance; which we must always wear, and never put off, lest we be left open to divers and various assaults here; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing any Armour we think we have got on, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any allegation of <hi>prophecying in Christ's name, or casting out Devils, or doing other wonderful works,</hi> if we be found to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this Livery, we shall be disowned, and receive that sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, <note n="f" place="margin">Mat. 7.23.</note>

                  <head>The Conclusion.</head>
                  <p>IN my entrance upon this subject, I said, how I had a desire to take some view of my Soul, and see its operations; and now, this here is become its weak product, perhaps more unfit for the World, than that of my Body; yet this I can say, 'tis not spurious, and if my Brain has been the Father of it, and gave it Being, my Heart has been the Mother, and lodged it, and brought it forth; without any other aim or design, desire or affection whatsoever, than the easing, quieting, or calming of her self, unless that she desires or hopes, it may through God's Grace have some mollifying, or sanative quality towards some others.</p>
                  <p>I have not upon my own view of it, so far transgressed, as to fall in love with it; I am conscious of its mis-shapes and deformities, and doubtful, nay very fearful, of its defects and errors in many particulars; and so have little reason to desire, it should live long to my shame and disgrace. But if man will not wink at those errors, nor pass them over with charity, I trust and hope that he who made me subject to errors, and knows them best, and their causes, will pardon them; which hope is to any man a sufficient Cordial against the fear or trouble of others censure.</p>
                  <p>I pretend to no supernatural Revelation in any of my thoughts, and he who is free from error in them, must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily have somewhat more than a pretence to it. Let the World judge of me what they please; I have been before-hand with
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:50605:75"/>
them, and I am sure no man can have meaner, or more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible thoughts of me, than I have sometimes had of my self; and if there be any thing of true and unfeigned humility in man, he can be as well content others should think meanly of him, as he of himself; but they are not always so proper Judges, and I think that question, <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 2.11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

I must confess and acknowledge I do believe, it may and does often cause strange inflamations in many Souls, and renders them not only painful and dangerous, but malignant and infectious, for want of a good digestion; and all that I am able to advise any one further, in the reading thereof, is, that he first observe the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of that man according to God's own heart in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, (who found that very <note n="d" place="margin">Ps. 119.105.</note>

but obtain that, (which certainly a man might do, from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion of the very light of Reason in beholding his own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness) I presume to say after he has read and seriously considered our Saviour's Precepts in the New Testament, he will be at peace, and in charity with all men, and so by consequence within himself. More I cannot say, but that I beseech Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, the Lord and giver of Life, in whom we live, and move, and have our Being, the provident Ruler and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of all things, one Eternal infinite wise power, that <hi>Ens</hi> or Essence of it self, that first cause, that which we are in no wise able to comprehend, that he would enlighten and purifie our understandings; direct all our thoughts; regulate the vain wandrings of our imaginations; strengthen our memories, so far, as they may be retentive of all good; make our Wills obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient and tractable; allure and draw away all our affections, from the vanities and false appearances of the World; actuate and enliven them towards the pursuit of all good, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation of all evil; that we may possess our Souls in patience, and with one mind and one Soul glorifie God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ; and out of the abundance of his mercy, forgive us all the errors of our ways; that he would not be extreme to mark what we have done amiss; that as our sins and follies have abounded, and do abound, his Grace may superabound, more especially to me, the greatest, vilest, mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablest, and most deformed of sinners, and the most defaced Image of his goodness, that he would again restore that Image here in some measure; give me a Fountain of tears to wash away all its blots and wilful sullies; direct me by his Grace here, towards his Glory: increase my weak Faith, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an assurance; convert my fearful hopes into a full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, and certain expectation of that glorious Vision; be with me, comfort me, and strengthen me, at the hour of death: And when this wearied, tossed and turmoil'd Soul, that can find no settled rest here, shall leave its polluted and sinful habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, purified by Repentance and Faith, receive it into Glory. And this for the merits and mediation of his Son <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> our ever blessed Saviour and Redeemer, to whom be glory, and honour, and praise, now and for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <head>The Author's Apology for his Writing. To the Reverend John Tillotson D. D. DEAN of CANTERBURY.</head>
               <head>EPIST. I. Wherein the Author, after some Apology for the not making publick his said Treatises, <hi>De Dolore &amp; De Anima,</hi> makes some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion on Atheism, and blames the unnecessary and extravagant disputes, and writings, against such as seem tainted or infected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with that opinion.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING reduced my (sometimes) sad, solitary, or serious considerations (at all times, and upon all occasions, very inept, weak and imperfect ones, God knows) into some kind of Method; and made them legible in paper, I took upon me the boldness (altogether unknown to you, and without so much as discovering my name) to approach you before all others, and begg the favour of your perusal. And this I did not only from a hearsay of your clear judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and courteous disposition to all men, as well strangers, as familiars; but from a singular opinion I had of you my self; That you were a person of a frank and open discourse, and one who would plainly, and roundly tell me of my faults and my follies, discover your real opinion of what lay before you, and not permit and suffer me (a meer stranger) for want of admonition, to cherish an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or deformed Embryo, and such, as might casually here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be born into the world to my disgrace; but rather while I lived, and had the power over it to smother and consume it in the flames.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:50605:78"/>The most favourable censure I expected from you, was a reprieve of it for some season, not a present enfranchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it (or making it free of the world in my life time) and by consequence a kind of confinement of my future thoughts, if they should vary from, or disagree with these. And yet the latter I met withall from you, and find that you are pleased to move me, not only to allow it present life, and future birth, but to afford it instant liberty and freedom to walk abroad.</p>
               <p>I might seem ill natur'd not presently to grant his request, who so readily condescended unto mine, had I no just cause to alledge, for a demurr at least, if not for a denial, and such as may work upon you to desist from any such motion, as much as on me for a denial: For I must tell you, If I hereafter suffer therein, I shall readily transfer the blame on you; and some perhaps will give you the precedency therein, when they come to know the person who perused these papers, and blame your oversight beyond my weak and feeble inspect.</p>
               <p>Your universal Charity may so far abound, as to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look many deformities, if not errors, occasioned perhaps from my immoderate affection; Which kind of Charity, is a thing not to be expected from other men, at least from all. Indeed if any man receive good from these Papers, he will find greater cause to thank you (next under God) than me; who never at first intended them as a Legacy to the world; nor durst, nor dare yet own them under any name. I trust they would hurt or prejudice no man (if publick) further than the spending of his time in vain, in reading them; and surely that's a sufficient damage, or loss to any ingenuous spirit. There is enough good seed already sown, more than any man can reap in his life time; 'twere well if the tares of this nature, were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together in bundles to be burnt, from which fate I I know not how to exempt mine. I have given you my opinion already in discourse, from which I know not well how to recede; That if some Judicious person were of power to do it, and should banish out of the world, and cause to be buried in utter oblivion many thousand vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes now extant; he would merit more of the world, and perform a far more acceptable service to the wise and learned thereof, than he who added one though of never so great use, or excellency.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:50605:78"/>There is enough said about the soul of man already, more perhaps than is, or ever will be understood, and too much I fear of a higher-subject. Every age in each single Nation has afforded, or rather introduced some subject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or other, whereabout the Souls of men have more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly busied themselves by way of disputation, and made the canvasing of particular opinions, a thing in mode and fashion for a certain time and season: That which at this instant seems to imploy, and busy the tongue, the pen or the Press (except seditious Pamphlets and the like from the spirit of contradiction, or an overweening conceit of ones self never out of fashion) most or above all other, is the different opinion of men about the original of all things, under the notion, names, or titles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Theism and Atheism; wherefore we had some little discourse together, occasioned by some short passages of mine, in my aforesaid Treatise. And for as much as all those Atheistical Tenets, now more than ordinarily vented, do seem to strike at the very root of religious worship, and are wholly derogatory of the glorious Attributes of that God, we serve and adore, I perceive you are not only (to your praise) a strong oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner thereof your self, but take pleasure in them also who do the same.</p>
               <p>Now truly I must here tell you, That which has fell from me in relation to that subject, was rather accidental, upon my weak search into the nature, operation and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Soul, than of any designed purpose to convince any man of the falshood of those Atheistical opinions: Because I am not yet fully convinced in my thoughts of the necessity of any such endeavour; but do rather believe, all those men we term or hold for professed Atheists, would yet gladly receive and imbrace a full perswasion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction from others, of what they themselves maintain in words; and not seldom (some of them at least) question a Deity and divine retribution, from the like passion, they say, others believe one, <hi>viz.</hi> Fear: And if they are sensible of something invisible to be feared, under some notion of justice; and like <note n="(a)" place="margin">Of whom he say<hi>'s Nec quenquam vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di, qui magis ea timeret, quae timenda esse negaret.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Metrodorus</hi> (I think the name is) in <hi>Cicero,</hi> fear what they deny, there needs no conviction of opinion, but rather extortion of confession, which is the peculiar work of a Deity, by distress, affliction, or the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:50605:79"/>If I could once prevail with any man, to ransack as I may say, his own Soul; seriously to consider, and observe the strange motions, tendencies, operations, and sudden alterations therein, I should have greater hopes of some clear manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that man, of an eternal wise working spirit in and through the same, than from any outward prospect, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding its work (under what notion soever Atoms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) in and through the whole Universe beside. Certainly God would shew himself to any one, who did but seriously and humbly behold, view, and consider himself, which we can never shew a man by any outward demonstration; That sight, must arise from within. How some endowed with so great perfection of Intellect, beyond the ordinary sort of men, and able to discern a vast disproportion, or difference of spirit, and yet none of body, between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and others, should not fall into some admiration, at some time or other, with a kind of thankfulness to somewhat or other; is to be wondered at. Every mans Soul is not only an image of God, but looked into of its self, is the clearest glass to represent the most perfect sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow that can be of that Original. There is some spark of fire in man, beyond the reach or finger of chance, which if he might be prevailed with to uncover, and view him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, would afford some light which all the raking, or blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from another, cannot do; God himself can and will shew himself, so far as he sees good, and none else can shew him to that person, who will not vouchsafe humbly to look into himself.</p>
               <p>If there be any such thing, as a beast in the likeness of a man, and one should fight with it, I may ask St. <hi>Pauls</hi> question, <hi>What advantageth it</hi>? I begg your pardon and others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for such an expression besides the meaning of the Text, I am not prone to impose such a title or attribute upon the meanest human creature; but surely, if we once come to that pass, as to reject an infinite wise, just, eternal Being; a Reward and punishment hereafter, and disclaim our own immortality; our prerogative above beasts is very small; and I am sure we may not improperly take up the subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent words <note n="(a)" place="margin">1 Cor. 15.32.</note> 
                  <hi>Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we dye,</hi> for which ends and purposes, tis to be feared, some men have owned (though they have not been fully convinced of) that opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:50605:79"/>The world did, and do's, and will abound with Atheists, that is, persons living as without a God in the world, or duly weighing divine retribution: But whether those on whom we most commonly fix, and impose that title, best merit the same, is some question. There is no great distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to be made between men denying God in constant daily works, yet owning him in words; and denying him in words, yet owning him in some measure by works: unless we should term the first sort real Atheists, and the other professed ones only, and conclude the latter are of more evil consequence; because the first sort or kind require the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect to discern or espy them, and the latter only sense; forasmuch as the tongue, which is such an unruly member, infects even through sense; but actions do it not so readily, but require the intellect to judge and discern, whether the party be an Atheist or no. Had I not in beholding the Soul in an human body happened to consider that admirable power it has to frame an articulate noise, given chiefly to magnify its Maker, and withal how it is otherwise imployed, I had not first so much as mentioned such a thing, or called one, Atheist: and <hi>Davids dixit insipiens in corde,</hi> I cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend much further. For however it be spoken from the heart, that is voluntarily and with some kind of affection going along with it; yet I do verily think there never was man so confident, or that ever so assuredly believed there was no God, as I and thousands others do that there is one; and that seeming negative opinion were at an end, if every man would permit his tongue to declare his belief, or at least his doubt, and not use it to obey some appetite of being singular, and thwart the general received opinion of the world, from some desire to be esteemed wise or learned. Methinks this question were enough to convince any man, that he is not an Atheist in belief. Why is he, or how comes he to be at any time just, and faithful? Why a lover of truth? Why do's he regard his promise, and sometimes perform it to his disadvantage? If he will not own this belief of a God by word, others may espy it in him, for I dare say never any man was yet able, so to obliterate the image of God in himself, but some mark, or impress thereof, might at some time be observed by another; and therefore let us condemn nothing in man, but that <hi>unruly member, set on fire of Hell;</hi> over which too there is now and then a kind of fatal necessity
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50605:80"/>
of contradicting it self in these reputed Atheists; none sooner or more readily unworthily invocating that name they deny, than they. I have yet that good opinion of many professing, or rather saying there is no God, That they are actually in some measure just, merciful, liberal and charitable, which is some owning him in their work, however it happens they deny him with their lips, and they must necessarily secretly own and confess the belief of a Deity from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and some of their own actions, unless they are able to demonstrate to me or others, how these excellent extracor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal qualities, as I may term them, as justice mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or a goodness of mind, universally inclined or inclinable to all, beyond and quite out of its individual self, or progeny; can possibly arise from a bare concretion of Atoms.</p>
               <p>We have lived in (I hope passed) an age, when gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the tongues of men owned a God publickly enough, and might seem to have been a little too familiar with him, given him high and excellent Attributes enough, called on his divine providence, and summoned it down for the justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of every wicked action: When Reason, God's vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent in the Soul, seemed quite abandoned, and Conscience was defined a new light from above, to gratify the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of some, and the fancies of others. And tis no great wonder, if upon a sudden change and alteration, some men run into the contrary extream: That when reason be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to take place again, there start up a philosophical gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of men upon the stage (some say the world is at this time much inclined to it) as bold in words, as the other were in deeds, and feeding too greedily on causes, for want of a good digestion, resolve into Atoms. But tis to be hoped, there is less danger of Satan, when he appears in his own colours, than when in the form of an Angel of light, and that he will not continue in that shape, for any long time or season.</p>
               <p>Now we have greater cause to judge or censure the greatest number of men thus liberal of their tongues, and challenging them for their <hi>own,</hi> or <hi>who is Lord over them,</hi> as men full of new wine, than those Mockers in the <hi>Acts,</hi> did the inspired <hi>Galileans,</hi> men of a quite contrary temper, discourse, or opinion. The spirits of these kind of men in our daies, are quick, and aiery from their accustomed li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, and thereby forgetting all cares and sorrow, they
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50605:80"/>
make a shift to forget their Maker too; or at least remember him and his word, no further, than as they serve for subjects of their wit. If <hi>Bacchus</hi> were banished the nation (as he is at this day in <hi>Turky</hi>) and drollery out of countenance and fashion; these mens Oracles would soon be silent, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any endeavour of a conviction of their falshood: Which till one, or both happen, is not to be expected; and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not not think there is any such absolute great necessity of studying, and maintaining arguments against th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se men, as there is of taking up <hi>Davids</hi> form of prayer for them, <note n="(a)" place="margin">Psal. 9.19, 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Up Lord, let not man have the upper hand; Put them in fear (O Lord) that they may know themselves to be but men,</hi> ignorant weak silly worms, as well as we, who can not own the least knowledge of him, or any thing else but from him. This thing, <hi>fear</hi> has sometimes wrought a conviction, when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else could seem to effect it. That incomprehensible nothing (as they call it) which they say Fear has made our God, is of that power and goodness, now and then by this kind of means to be found of them who seek him not, but even contemn him, and dare him with their tongues.</p>
               <p>Besides these men, who do not always think as they speak nor speak as they sometimes think; and some others no ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest nor eager Disputants in the case, little exceeding beasts in knowledge, yet much in making provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof, who would be content to dye the death of beasts, and may seem therefore a little to favour that opinion; Besides these there are a sort of engineers against God, who out of the rusty artillery of some old Philosophers, by a little new scowring, filing, or the like, do frame and fit up weapons at all points, and expose them to publick view and sale; and stir up active spirits wanting other imployment, to take them up and challenge all Combatants. But whether self interest, or self conceit, has caused more men to take upon them this kind of trade, art, or mystery; or which has bred up most pupils, or best proficients; is a point very disputable, and controvertible. However, be it the one, or the other, or one rather than another at any time; I am somewhat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, there would not be so great vent of this kind of stuff, nor so many Chapmen for it, if some men, who cannot well indure the sight of this commodity, did not take upon them, and use so great labour and pains, to cry it down, but would rather in some manner, slight and contemn it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:50605:81"/>What ever singular opinion any man may raise within himself, about the system of the Universe, or Original frame of the now visible World different from the general received opinion of mankind; I cannot think, he do's at any time vent it, and that varnish'd with the best colour'd reason, or flourish'd Rhetorick he can procure, out of any good will he bears to mankind in general, to disburthen them of causeless and needless fears; or that he thinks it will prove any advantage to the world, to have a mind, all-knowing, just, merciful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cashier'd out of mens thoughts, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed for a fortuitous operation of Atoms. There is no man in his right wits, would desire a cure of the fear of these attributes, mixed or united in one eternal mind, nor need they who talk against it, fear it, if they would return and humbly seek to approach it.</p>
               <p>Now if any men make all this ado (as we say) and stir, to have their quick or deep inspect into nature, their strength of judgment, or profoundness of learning had in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; as it may be reasonably collected some do: Those men are then usually as well pleased to find Antagonists, as pupils, and converts, and think they have not shewed their parts, and endowments, sufficiently and thoroughly enough to the world, unless they have some ground to demonstrate them a litle further by a reply. And therefore all occasions of offering the gauntlet to these men, would be carefully avoided.</p>
               <p>If any man suspecting he has heretofore served God for naught, has set on broach new opinions, or old ones new trimm'd up, dressed, and varnish'd, framed and modelled too, for the allowance or approbation, or rather justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the doings of some great ones in power (whose constant actions all along, have seemed to defy a righteous and just God, though perhaps the parties sometimes feared one) judging it a ready way to advance his own fortune, by telling men in authority, they are masters of their own, and that right of dominion is nothing but what men give, or take for their present security; after this manner striving to demonstrate there is no God, to those who would be well content and pleased there were none; If there be any such I say, and doubtless some such one or other there may have been, a thing best known to a mans own conscience, even such a man would sooner relent, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50605:81"/>
acknowledge his errors, if men would seem silently to pity him only, and not send him bravado's and challenges to defend them. We do not know after what strange man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner indigence or want may (upon Gods a little forsaking for a time) set the soul on work: How from thence all manner of affections do rise up in arms together, as it were at one time, and so beget such disquietness, or disease in the soul, that reason shall swallow down any thing which the imagination shall bring in, for wholesom food, without strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling against it; which the whole soul would willingly reject, and cast up after as nauseous, if it could do it privately: But it is seldom seen, that this ever happens, if the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions become outwardly irritated or provoked, to defend that, of which they might seem to be the original cause.</p>
               <p>I thank God I never actually knew, what strange kind of <hi>Diana</hi>'s that master of arts, the belly; or that grand weapon, necessity were able to forge in my brains; but I do think or rather fear, that if I had once framed some strange monster there, and brought it forth to light, seeing I could not disown it; If men struck at it, and accused or challenged me for the monstrosity or ugliness thereof, I should have indeavoured to defend it, and maintained it to be somewhat perfect in its lineaments and features; when otherwise, I might in some short space, have been as desirous to have it smothered, as any man, and would have been content to be the Executioner of it my self, if people would forbear to look too much on me.</p>
               <p>Perhaps we think we are bound in duty to vindicate Gods honour; 'Tis true we are: But our true and proper vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of God consists rather of a few good works, than a multitude of words. And tis to be feared that for want of the manifestation of the first, <hi>Our father which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> is so little and seldom <hi>glorified,</hi> and so much and so often vilified, as he is: Certainly this were the ready way to convince others of a God, to shew we heartily believe there is one our selves, which is not demonstrable any way so well as by good works: And if the number of those, who alledge there is none, do daily increase, it may be assigned for none of the meanest, least, or slightest causes; that our works do not so clearly manifest to the world, that we veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and assuredly believe there is a God, as some of theirs do, that they believe, as well as say, there is none.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:50605:82"/>There is no man who believes there is a God, but believes withal, God is able, and will in due time vindicate his own honour, and let the world know there is an Almighty one in <hi>Israel.</hi> And I for my part could never yet find or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that mens minds became changed in their course, for having their opinions severely oppugned, or canvased in writing, but that usually they become more stiff, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory, in their course thereby; and that such an out-cry and clamour is the readier way to whet the spleen, and with it, the fancy; than mollify the heart, and with it clarify the reason.</p>
               <p>If any commission be granted us, or allowed us to fight for God, after this manner, it had need be executed with abundance of caution, and in most perfect charity, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring there is no one we term Atheist, but is the very image of God, as well as any other. And 'twill be difficult for us who believe that, to think any of his image wholly devoid of all manner of sense of him, whatever he say. As to the generality of men talking after this manner (not of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign) they usually seem quick, and discerning enough, and are doubtless men of brave spirits; Men, which bear a kind of indignation in their breasts, against being gull'd, or sliely drawn into an opinion by any seducing false spirit. And 'tis some wonder they do not espy (which I pray God one day they may) that those things I mentioned before, self-interest, and self-conceit are no less busy inmates, in unmaking God; than, as they themselves sometimes talk, they are in making one, and that he who starts up with old arguments new vamp'd, in these our days, after the dispute seemed for many ages to be laid asleep, is shrewdly to be suspected, that he labours of the one, or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>The moderate inquiry into the original of all things, might not ill become the first ages of the world, and I cannot much blame men in former days for this kind of search. But when God has once delivered himself (so far as man is able to comprehend him) graciously or miraculously to a nation, or people, and seemed to be engrafted into the thoughts of all mankind; I think some peculiar men may be as much to blame, in thinking to maintain and defend his existence, by the proper strength and force of their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as some others have been to question it of late. If
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50605:82"/>
men once allow themselves the liberty (or think it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them) to let the fancy have its full scope and range in any matter, without correction; they may easily shake the strongest foundation that hath been laid in the world by unanswerable <hi>Nicodemus</hi>'s questions: And therefore surely a <hi>Nicodemus</hi> his reply, may at sometimes be as proper for them, as a grave or sage one; such an one, as to him, who inquiring if God were eternal, or from eternity, and the whole visible universe created out of nothing, at a certain space of time, or that time had its being or beginning from thence; What God did, or how he was imployed before the creation? received this answer; that God was preparing hell or a place of torment for all such futile idle inquisitors as himself. I do think I were able my self, by objections, questions, and cavils, to nonplus or puzzle the wisest and learnedst of the world; and seem to render them incapable to satisfy other mens minds demonstratively, and plainly, of the truth of those things, whereof my own mind rested moderately and sufficiently already satisfied; but if I committed such a folly, and any man went about to answer me, I should not esteem him wise (how learned soever he might be) but think according to our Proverb he might shake hands with me.</p>
               <p>I wish, men who go about to defend a God by their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, be not guilty sometime of the same fault with those who deny one, and do it as much, or more, to be esteemed deep-sighted and wise, and to shew their learning or reading, as for the pure love of God or the truth. It is a subject (if I may be allowed so to call it) which would make a good man, nay a sober wise man, even tremble while he goes about to handle, or think seriously on; And he who is truly wise will not adventure, or think he is able to know or define his Maker, before he know himself; which never man yet did, from all the reason he was indowed withal. I know it were no difficult matter for a man of an ordinary capacity, once master of the languages, to muster up, and run over the opinions of almost all the ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Philosophers, about this point of Theism; finely to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal them, set them in opposition one against the other, and at length with some little new invention of his own, appoint or determine which should overcome in the case. But perhaps at this day he might be generally thought, in such
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50605:83"/>
case as this, the wiser of the three Grecian Sages, that knew when and how far to hold his peace. A man may be mistaken in his aims (whether it be of leading and condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting others into the paths of wisdom and truth, or being reputed wise himself) by saying too much, as well as too little; and I pray God none of us become so far deceived, as to lay the way more open for profaneness, and daring of the Almighty, while we go about (as we say or pretend) to close and hedge it up. I am much afraid our abilities will never extend to salve the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> we so much talk of, or make any thing apparent in Heaven, if I understand the word, nor that reason can demonstrate what God is, though it may tell us what God is not; And therefore I think reason may be as well too blame, for marching too far, or soaring too high, for its learning, or knowledg, as sitting quite still, or groveling on the earth, and permitting the imagination to introduce what forms of a Deity, will, or best may, gratify any the most predominant present affection, an habit which has been too much in fashion of late; and now a little with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing, makes way for the other excess.</p>
               <p>I may have said too much my self in this little, it has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded my original intent and purpose, yet this further I must say, and begg your pardon, and others who shall chance to see it, if I say amiss, that my wishes are, we may all in this great concern carefully avoid extreams: and that as we do not set up such a God by faith, as reason is able daily to confront; so, we set not up such a God by reason, as there needs no faith to lay hold on. For my weak opinion is, nay my present resolution is; As never wholly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert my reason for the adoration of any God: So never to adore any thing for God, my reason is able fully to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend.</p>

               <p>BEcause Soul or Spirit hath been heretofore, at special sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, the subject of my thoughts; and because there are many amongst us, who would seem to have great knowledge of a Deity, and may be thought too familiar with God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a colour or pretence of being daily enlightened with his Holy Spirit, affirming its constant working in them; And others quite Aliens and strangers to God, not barely by their life and conversation, but by their outward profession too, and who deny in words, as much or more than in the deeds, that there is any such thing as a Spirit (which <note n="(a)" place="margin">Joh. 4.24.</note> in St. <hi>Iohn</hi> our Saviour tells us, God is) and that what we term Spirit, is a mere Chimaera fansied in our brains. Both which kind of persons, being equally to modest Society and civil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, and I may say, enemies to true Religion; I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured with all submission to your more weighty thoughts and solid judgement, to present you with my sometimes opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in reference to what we most properly and peculiarly term Spirit; and wherein I say ought, in relation to that Spirit of truth, I humbly implore its aid, that nothing escape my Pen, which may in any wise (if seen) lead others into error, or in the least diminish the goodness, power, glory, might, Majesty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> dominion of the Almighty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> I have thought and do think, That we can not rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally attribute or impute the cause of any action or motion whatsoever to ought else, than somewhat which we, (in no wise able to comprehend by our sense) term or call a Spirit; and that without some such thing, the world were an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>significant Lump; That from such thing, all things live, and move, and have their being, is not to be doubted, whether we call it Nature, or ought else. This Spirit gone forth or sent into the visible world, which now has visible effects;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50605:84"/>
as I take it to be some emission of that Eternal spirit at the Creation from the <hi>Word,</hi> so I think it generally worketh (unknown to its self) the will of that Eternal Spirit, neither can it cease of it self to work, but if re-assumed or <note n="(b)" place="margin">Job 34.14.</note> 
                  <hi>gathered again,</hi> as is expressed in <hi>Iob,</hi> all flesh would perish together, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that all flesh, and all other things, Sun, Moon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do not perish, is the work of Gods ordinary (I trust I may so call it) Providence, the confirmation, Seal of his Creation.</p>
               <p>Such vivifying Spirit as this (which men may call na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture if they please) is gone out into the world, and shall continue working every where (no doubt) until the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed end of the world: yet not apprehensive of its being, nor capable of understanding in the least to what end it works, may probably cease to work, after the manner it now worketh. And this kind of Spirit receives no new influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, nor seems capable of any new influence from above, yet is ordered by what we call Providence.</p>
               <p>But where there is any Spirit conscious of its own work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in some measure capable to conceive from whence it is; or at least desirous to enquire after, or know the original of its being; that Spirit seems to me to be some special emission more than ordinary, at the beginning, or Creation of the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble world; to be of duration, and continuance; A thing now as it were subsisting of it self, and which vanishes not, nor can vanish, or will be re-assumed again: But being, as I may say, the very Spirit or breath of the Almighty, and able to look back towards its original and fountain, is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of some new influence, and as I may say, regeneration; and such is the Spirit of man. And therefore we in no wise deny, but that the Spirit of man, may receive some new light for its motion, otherwise than barely and simply by sense, the Organ of the body: And that no other, though intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual, Spirit, inferiour thereto, can so do, or is capable so to do.</p>
               <p>Now of created Spirits superiour to our selves, or of greater capacity in point of intellect than our selves; as I read or hear of none save Angels, created all good as well as we: so I cannot conceive, that any created or circumscribed Spirit, from any power of it self, to intermix it self with our Spirit, or so move in us, as that it may be properly said, we are possessed with any other Spirit than our own; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis most properly said, <note n="(c)" place="margin">Jam. 1.14.</note> 
                  <hi>When we are tempted, we are
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50605:84"/>
drawn away of our own lusts.</hi> Though I confess I think, objects may be brought by the assistance of some such spirit, and laid down before our senses, or presented to our fancy, whereby our lust may seem to begin to move, though indeed our lusts be the original of our error.</p>
               <p>But forasmuch as our own spirit is some image of, and has its being from the Almighty; that is one eternal all power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful spirit, it being capable by its reason (for no otherwise 'tis so) to distinguish between good and evil in some measure, and to know the will of that almighty One; It doubtless may be, and is capable also, not only to have its reason en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned from thence, but to receive some such new accession of light, as that it may not only have a clearer sight of that bountiful Creator, than reason is able to afford it; but be led into the paths of truth and righteousness and become acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his will: And this we look upon, as effected, by his <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> through his <hi>Word,</hi> one God blessed for ever.</p>
               <p>Such new accession of light, and such a blessed gift as this, were the Writers of Holy Scripture (no doubt) endowed withal, whose words and actions were in demonstration of the spirit, and with power, the effects whereof, we have heard, and beheld, and felt in a great part of this visible world.</p>
               <p>Now for that we have a promise, this admirable strange effect in man, shall not wholly cease, but that God will be with us to the end of the world; and we talk much now a days of the light of the Holy Spirit; It may not be amiss, since we have a <hi>caveat,</hi>

                  <hi>Not to believe every spirit,</hi> and withall authority given us to <hi>try the spirits whether they are of God,</hi> for every man to try his own spirit at least, and see whether that of it self, already sent, be not the spirit only, which he often mistakes, and vouches for the immediate dictates of the Almighty, and calls it a new light, the spirit of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, and so becomes a little too bold with the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.</p>
               <p>I am afraid it has in some men; and that many a man has so little understood himself, and less his Maker, that he has mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken the suddain and strange flashes of some kind of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from his own inherent affections for another spirit; which feeding with conceit he has brought to such a flame in himself, that at last his reason has given place, and approved
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50605:85"/>
it to be something more, than what is under its regiment or correction; even the light of that spirit of truth, whereas did a man by his reason keep a narrow watch over his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, it might observe every the most ordinary affection able to raise its peculiar spirit; that is, such a flame in the soul, as with the assistance of the imagination shall hurry it with the body in obedience to it, and force reason into a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief for the present, that its motion is from the light of truth; of which in time it may stand convinced to have been mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead and misguided. We do not improperly call the product of that predominant affection in man, Pride, the spirit of pride, and the consequent thereof the spirit of contradiction, and these may be the spirits which for the present enthral our reason, and make us believe better of our selves, than others do of us, and think God worketh in us immediately, and of his gracious dispensation, that which is effected by our own spirit, through his most just and wise provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>

Notwithstanding which, and a saving faith at the last, we may not for the present safely challenge that good spirit of God, to be the sole or chief guide of all our thoughts and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; for if it were so, then were it impossible for us to err (as I conceive) which daily we do, and <note n="(b)" place="margin">Eph. 4.30.</note>

for I never saw or searched Writers on such subject either towards the enlightning or confirming me therein) four more especial ways, by which God worketh over us, and in us. 1. By his common and ordinary Providence. 2. By his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Providence. 3. By his liberal and bountiful Providence. 4. By his Spirit.</p>
               <p>His ordinary providence, I call that, which extends over <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> all the works of his creation, as well irrational as rational; which though irrational bodies are no ways sensible of, or its working; yet has he therein an eye over them in their bodily preservation, <note n="(c)" place="margin">Psal. 147.9.</note> and <hi>feedeth the young ravens that call upon him</hi>: And within this care or eye of his, are we comprized too, and no way excluded.</p>
               <p>By his merciful providence, I mean his withholding us <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> from committing those enormous crimes, to which we are prone by nature through the lusts of the flesh, even against the very light of reason, which thing perhaps you will term his common restraining grace; and this he extends to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens as well as others, as may be observed in the story of <note n="(d)" place="margin">Gen. 20.6.</note> 
                  <hi>Abimelech,</hi> and his withholding him from touching of <hi>Sarah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By his liberal and bountiful providence I mean this; That <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> God having endowed our souls with that more than ordinary gift of reason, by which we seem originally capable in some degree or measure to discern good from evil; He more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially overlooks that gift of his, and more especially worketh therein, towards the enlightning thereof: So that of his bounty and goodness alone it is, that our humane reason is at any time brought to a clearer sight than ordinary of justice, mercy, temperance, patience, or the like, and beholds the beauty thereof, above their contraries, whereby we imbrace them with our affections; and this I hope I may without offence, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the name of his <hi>Common renewing grace to.</hi> In which sence or notion, if any shall alledge his capacity of coming to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the present work of the spirit of God in him, I mean not to contradict him; because I behold every mans reason, his rational soul to be in some sence the spirit of God, which being enlightned from him a-new, for the inclining the affections to imbrace that which is morally good, we may more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say then; 'Tis the spirit of God that worketh in us. But many Heathens as well as Christians, have doubtless in great measure participated of this <hi>grace</hi> (for so I call it
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50605:86"/>
now, it being from the mere good will and pleasure of God without any motive or inducement from man) and owned the same to be his good work in them, and yet never other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise enlightned, missed of the <hi>truth,</hi> and could not be said to have any light from his Holy spirit, but to err even to perdition, notwithstanding the aforementioned grace, I, and justly to perish too. For such is the wise just disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our minds, and consequently our actions, by that Eternal Majesty (from whose spirit <note n="(b)" place="margin">Psal. 139.7.</note> 
                  <hi>David</hi> seems to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer we cannot well go) that every man, if there were not some default or neglect in him, might receive the Seal of that other Spirit, the Holy Ghost, as we call it, one God blessed for ever. However in the end, we shall all set forth his glory, and if we miss of Eternal happiness, we shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it so much our own fault, as that we shall take upon our selves shame and confusion of face.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> By Spirit (which is the thing I conceive other men mean, when they talk of their enlightning) I mean, something more than God's barely enlightning our reason, or barely working through that, His very light of truth, above the reach of our reason, <hi>viz.</hi> That Spirit which he has promised by his word, to such as lay hold on that word by Faith, and yet without which, we cannot truly believe; That Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter co-equal and co-eternal with himself, and with the <hi>word</hi> one God blessed for ever. Which work in man by and from that good Spirit, you ordinarily call, as I suppose, God's special renewing grace, or his grace of Sanctification. And truly, if even words could be so laid open and plain to our capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by you, as that we might rightly distinguish things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, 'twere well and happy for us: For certainly those three words, <hi>Spirit, Grace</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> for want of distinguishing the true signification of each in the several places where they are found, have caused many errors, and begat no little disputes amongst us.</p>
               <p>Now according to these several workings beforementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, do I think, we may safely invocate the Divine Majesty: For instance, were I about to take a journy through some desart place, frequented with Savage beasts, or infested with Robbers, or to pass some dangerous current; I do believe I should invocate God in his Almighty power, and providence over all his works, to preserve me from bodily danger.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:50605:86"/>Were I about to resort to some place or company, in which I suspected any allurement or enticement towards the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of those facts, I found my self most inclinable to by nature, and which my reason had already judged of to be crimes, or sins; I do think I should beg of him, in and through his goodness and mercy, to lay some reine upon and over my Passion, and withhold me from running into those snares, to which I found my self most prone, and more especially to keep me from presumptuous sins, lest they should get the dominion over me.</p>
               <p>Were I about to enter upon, and execute some office or place, wherein the good of others as well as my self, might depend, and which necessarily required a more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry circumspection, wisdom, and prudence, or foresight in the management; Or were I about to deal with men in any action, that might in my present opinion require the like: I do then think I should implore him in and through his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wisdom to enlighten my understanding and reason, that it might be profitable to others, and that it become not clouded through any desire of gain, or other passion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I should be hurried away to commit any unjust or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemly action, but that I might approve my self in the sight of all men, discreet and righteous.</p>
               <p>Were I about any present act, whereupon I conceived my Eternal estate and well-being necessarily and consequently depended; as whether I should go to Mass or suffer impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment, and my reason had weighed both, and could not well or readily determine: I should earnestly beseech him, through his infinite goodness and mercy to all mankind that believe in him, to send the light of his Holy Spirit into my heart to direct and guide me therein.</p>
               <p>Now in the first case, were I preserved from imminent and apparent bodily danger, I should readily without hesitation as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe it to his mighty power, who stilleth the rageing of the Sea, and setteth bounds to the same, saying hitherto shall thou pass and no further. In the second case, should I, upon some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration after, find my self to have been as it were mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled, or the course of my passion diverted by some unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected accident, so as I did not at that time perhaps what I would; I should impute it to restrictive mercy, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready to withhold men from sinning against him. In the third case, should I, not only receive applause from men,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50605:87"/>
but from some present comfort in my own heart, be satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of my prudent and just managery of my affair, I should rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily impute it to his wisdom, that giveth light and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing to the simple. But in the fourth and last case, what ever Election I made, although I owned my Election to be guided by God's good providence, I durst not presume to say; it was from his Holy Spirit (though that might be) for that it was, or ought to be my reason, which determined my Election, in all appearance, to my self.</p>
               <p>It seems to me a matter of dangerous consequence to play with that fire, and call for it down from Heaven upon any ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary occasion, or yet for a man to avouch its moving in himself, almost upon any occasion. But we have those of late days, who in the decision of meaner points than those of Virginity and Marriage, seem to exceed St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and not only <note n="(a)" place="margin">1 Cor. <hi>s.</hi> 40.</note> 
                  <hi>think,</hi> but would seem to know in their determination thereof, <hi>They have the Spirit of God.</hi> These men I would undeceive if I were able, or indeed any one whom I conceive to be in an error. But first by the way, give me leave to tell you, without the least personal reflection on your self) whom I never observed to go about to amuse men with strange notions, but to inform their intellect in the plainest rational way you could for the introduction of truth) This bold assertion of an habitual converse with God by his Holy Spirit, has received, I think, if not its first rise and conception, yet its strength and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, from our Pulpits or little Pamphlets (such I may call some) of Godliness: Where some men for want of force of argument, and dint of reason to convince their Auditors or Readers of the falsity of the opinions of that Church, they would they should desert and forsake; have first endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through strange mazes to elect and saint them in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to quiet their reason often put them in mind of the promise of that Spirit to all Gods Elect, and its light to lead them in the truth; and by this means (<hi>viz.</hi>) other mens (in esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation) blowing strange notions into their heads, has opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in some men usurped the Chair of reason. For I do not think, that plain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> simple meaning men could ever of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or from barely reading of the Scriptures, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns pride and every high thought, have raised so good an opinon of themselves, as to think they were led, almost in all things, by the very Spirit of God: if they had not seen their teachers (who we are ready to agree, receive their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50605:87"/>
from thence) too familiar with it. Now whether this too often talking of the Spirit in Pulpits, has been a feeding with milk, or the same be not a thing of difficult digestion, and may be of evil consequence if not well digested; and whether they had not done much better, only to have smoothed the way for the coming of that Spirit, by instilling into men the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of obedience, justice and honesty, and integrity of life and conversation, than talk of its being and effects (which are only known to God himself) I leave to their Conscience (that is their reason) who have preached, and do usually preach of it.</p>
               <p>Such a salve there is, as that of the Spirit to comfort us, but if it be too often and ill applied, it may cause a Lethargy in the soul, rather than ought else. And such a Sword there is as that of the Spirit to beat down our adversaries withall, and indeed it may be said of it, as that of <hi>Goliah</hi> 
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">1 Sam. 21.9.</note> 
                  <hi>There is none like it.</hi> But if men be told of the force of that spiritual Sword, and have not judgement to discern it, They will be prone to catch up an imaginary one, such a strange Weapon, as they will be able to puzzle, if not foile their very Masters with. So, as if God in his infinite and wonderful mercy prevent it not, instead of a spiritual one, every mans temporal Sword will be drawn against his brother at the last.</p>
               <p>We have justly deserted, without doubt that infallible Church, with the head thereof, for its strange arrogance of ingrossing the Holy Spirit, and presumption that it cannot err: But me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks it might be no imprudent caution, or wariness in each of us particularly, that we carry not about us every man a <hi>Pope,</hi> as is said, in our belly, which will in time after some matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, if we take not good heed, break forth, and usurp the Chair, with as great confidence as that, whom at present we condemn and reject; and at last for want of strength to defend it self, yield the prerogative to, and set up the old one again in his full power and strength.</p>
               <p>Certainly did we believe some men enlightned, or possessed after the manner they talk of, averring as much a real presence of the Deity in themselves as the Papists do in the Sacrament, we should adore them rather than the Host (the adoration whereof we equally condemn) and think <hi>gods were come down to us in the likeness of men.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 14.14.</note> And therein per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps these kind of men would not blame us, nor seem so an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry

as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> with the men of <hi>Lycaonia.</hi> Yet surely all men are men, and of like passion with us; And truly 'twere to be wished, 'twere not the spirit of pride rather than ought else, which makes some of us seem to our selves, <note n="(b)" place="margin">Luk. 18.11.</note>

                  <hi>dwell</hi> in some men.

               <p>It is a dangerous thing we are told to sin against it, and from that sin, whatsoever it be, good Lord preserve us! Now this light of the Holy spirit, and its special work in man, further than that true faith with its necessary concomitants is certainly effected thereby; No man in my opinion, can have such an assurance of at this day, as that he can safely and without danger avouch it, in any particular cases of action or opinion, to be his immediate present guide, much less with ostentation challenge it for his peculiar, and reject and condemn others as void of that true light. For as without it, I do believe, there can be no true faith; so too great a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in any man, of its present infallible operation in him, as to other matters which necessarily depend not thereon, in some sign, in my opinion, that his faith is not true, and such as it should be. For surely he whose faith is such, will daily and hourly pray for that enlightning grace, and fear he has it not, which he who seems assured of it, neglects by consequence to do.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> concerning spiritual gifts, willing not to have us altogether ignorant, and about to shew us, that there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities of operations, but it is the same God, which worketh all in all, Giveth us to understand, that <note n="(d)" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.3.</note> 
                  <hi>No man can say Iesus is the Lord; but by the Holy Ghost</hi>: which thing I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, but yet I take his meaning there, to be, not a bare out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50605:88"/>
profession and confession by the tongue; for surely there are many, who have professed so much, and uttered as much with a clear audible voice, at that very instant they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to deceive, and with a very intent to deceive; which could never be the work of that good spirit of truth in them: And therefore we cannot take his meaning there to be, other than an <hi>intus dicens</hi>; A cordial, and total (from the whole soul) embracing, and laying hold on that <hi>word</hi> by faith, as the alone Saviour, and so Lord of the whole world; And this thing, we cannot, as of it self, behold in any man.</p>
               <p>He has given us to understand likewise in another place, that there are <note n="(b)" place="margin">Gal. 5.22, 23.</note> 
                  <hi>fruits</hi> proceeding from the work of that spirit, and enumerated some of them; yet since no man now a days can, or will, I think, pretend to any inmediate gift, of <note n="(c)" place="margin">1 Cor. 12.10.</note> 
                  <hi>discerning the spirits</hi> (more than he can or will pretend to <hi>working of miracles, prophecy, divers kind of tongues</hi> (without study and labour) or the <hi>interpretation of tongues,</hi> which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> has linked together in one verse, and placed that gift of discerning the spirit in the very midst.) How shall we judge of the reality of those fruits, otherwise than by our reason? And therefore why do men talk to us so much of that blessed spirit, and seem to take it unkindly we do not believe their works proceed from thence, if at any time our reason, as sometimes it do's, inform and satisfy us, they may be, and often are without it. Some of those fruits there mentioned by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> as <hi>temperance, patience, goodness, &amp;c.</hi> have appeared much more real in many Heathen than some of us, and yet our reason is not convinced, that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from any thing more, than that bountiful goodness of God in his providence over them; nor until we have that special gift of <hi>discerning the spirits,</hi> can we acknowledge a belief of a better fountain (if so good) in some of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent spiritualists, without a breach upon our reason, whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever our charity may incline us to.</p>
               <p>I am so far from denying the often immediate blessed effects of that spirit of truth in the soul of a true believer; that I would not be thought to make use of my reason in the least, so as to interpose it as a cloud or mist between that and any mans Soul to obscure it, if I could, from the light thereof. I would sooner wish, or be content, not barely to lose my reason, but he changed into a brute as to visible shape, than do it; Yet since I challenge and own my very
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50605:89"/>
reason, from one and the same Godhead however mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously and diversly working as several persons; I hope I may even from that, without offence or grieving that Holy Spirit, tell men they may possibly err in the opinion of its effects, and through some inherent lurking pride, have their conceit raised to that height as to believe (and therefore would have us believe) they bare the fruit of that spirit, when <note n="(a)" place="margin">Gal. 5.20.</note> 
                  <hi>Sedition a work of the flesh</hi> is more <hi>manifest</hi> to our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Indeed Saint <hi>Paul</hi> has told us the works of the one are manifest, but not the fruit of the other, though it has its fruits; and therefore why men should cry up their fruit, to be the undoubted product of that ever blessed spirit, until they can manifest the same so to be, and be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince our reason by some infallible demonstration, that it could not proceed from ought else, I find no just or sufficient ground.</p>
               <p>That true faith (an invisible thing and best seen by works, though by any outward work it cannot infallibly be known) is the very effect of that blessed spirit, we may safely affirm; but further than so, I cannot see how we can without danger affirm its immediate operation in us; or retain a positive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that any particular effect wrought by us, or in us, did proceed merely from the motion of that blessed spirit dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in us. If any; it may to my weak judgement, be in some such particular case as this: when the soul sometimes on the suddain beholds as it were at one intuition, all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things as vanity, and rejects them with a kind of longing desire, to behold somewhat that is not such, and to have some present fruition thereof. And this, at such time as the soul may seem at ease and quiet; and is surrounded, and as it were courted, with all wordly affluence and prosperity, and seems to have wordly honours laid down before it, in its path; not when it rejects, and seems to contemn those things out of a sullen temper, because it either cannot attain them, or is crossed in the fruition of them. When this happens, I cannot think it to be the mere work of the Soul it self, nor of the deity either in any ordinary providence and care over it; but some special grace moving it, and darted as it were into it, from that blessed spirit towards beholding an everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing true joy by faith.</p>
               <p>Besides this, there may be other cases happen, which may induce us to think, that there is something more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50605:89"/>
moves in us from above; as this, When a man shall by his reason (with the invocation perhaps of divine as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance) have weighed the good and evil of some particular action, and all circumstances in relation thereto as near as he can, and concluding of the lawfulness thereof, perhaps through the fallacy of some covert and latent affection in him, shall pursue the same; If afterwards he chance to be stopped in his full cariere (not by any audible voice or visible light, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi>; that is not to be expected now a days, and whenever 'tis averred, I will determine it the effect of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, or which is worse, averred upon contrivance with an intent to deceive, but) by some secret whisper as it were, or suddain conviction of his error, and the light of the truth breaking out as at once upon his soul on the suddain, which doubtless has happened to some men; I should be ready to acknowledge it, as the work of some extraordinary spirit from without, and not his own. For this cannot be said to be the effect or stroke of his own conscience, that is, the dictates of his reason contrary to what he acted before: For in this case he no ways erred against that, but, as we put the case, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted it, made the best use of it he could, with an invocation of the divine power to enlighten the same. Yet in neither of these cases, do I think it safe or convenient, the party in whom such effect is wrought, should presently determine it in his own thoughts, to be the undoubted immediate work of that good spirit within him, lest if he should err, those thoughts embolden him to continue therein against the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est demonstration of truth in future, much less to discourse and proclaim it to be the very light of that spirit of truth in him, lest he induce others to be led away by every fantastick light their brain is able to forge within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>They on whom God himself <note n="(a)" place="margin">John 20.22.</note> 
                  <hi>breathed,</hi> they on whom <note n="(b)" place="margin">Acts 2.3.</note> 
                  <hi>tongues as of fire</hi> visibly sate, they who <note n="(c)" place="margin">1 Corinth. 15, 56.</note> 
                  <hi>saw Christ</hi> after his resurrection and had power to <note n="(d)" place="margin">Acts 3.16.</note> 
                  <hi>work wonders</hi> in his name, might safely make use of their own tongues, to declare their immediate knowledge of the will of that Almighty spirit, and not be thought too familiar with the Deity, in decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring its manner of working. But for us to take the same liberty, and casting aside all thoughts of moral goodness, fall to talking and describing of that strange admirable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect (that being born again of the spirit) sometimes wrought
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50605:90"/>
in the soul of man, which we cannot possibly comprehend how, or when, or where it is wrought, may be of dangerous consequence I think; and further to glory, as if we were the only men in these latter days on whom this spirit is poured, is such an arrogance in my apprehension, that a sober Heathen might well think us distracted. If we would needs glory, let us make use of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> own subject ready at hand, <hi>our infirmities</hi>; We shall find little else if we examine our selves, that we have any tenure of, or may call our own, or that we can have such knowledge of.</p>
               <p>True faith, as I said, which I take to be the peculiar work of that spirit in man, is a trembling, though a fast hold on the Deity, and proclaims not the body to be the temple of the Holy Ghost, otherwise than by the good works done therein; the beholding of which (and we can behold them as good, though we cannot be infallibly assured they always proceed from that spirit) is the readiest way to draw others to glorify that God whom we adore; not to dissect it, as I may say, in ordinary discourse, no not in the Pulpit, and tell men exactly after what manner the spirit of God worketh, or should work in us; As if we were as familiarly acquainted with that spirit, as our own (which few of us little regard, much less understand) that eternal, that omnipotent, that incomprehensible, that dreadful spirit, I may say, (for certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no man can seriously exercise his thoughts thereabout with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear and trembling) by whose breath we are as easily consumed as made, therefore let us fear to be too bold with it.</p>
               <p>Well! can it be any offence against that good spirit, for a man to behold his own unworthiness? to doubt or fear its absence? or to question whether we mistake not some pleasing motion of our own spirit, for it? 'Tis not the present com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort we receive from our cogitations, nor yet our actions, that is any infallible sign that we have thought or acted from that good spirit merely; 'Tis an infallible sign rather, that we have not wilfully acted against the present superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of our own spirit, our reason, and that is the utmost we can be assured from thence.</p>
               <p>I may mean well, and please my self with the sincerity of my present cogitations in relation to this very subject of the spirit; think I have spoken the words of truth and soberness; yet it would be a strange presumption in me (though I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50605:90"/>
the favourable assistance of a divine power in every good thought) to affirm that good spirit more especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly working in me, unless I could be able to convince the world, and rest assured too my self, of the indubitable truth of that which I have said: But that I do not, I rather fear I have in many particulars thought amiss; and surely he who has not that fear always moving in him, is very arrogant, and who has it, must necessarily discard such high thoughts in himself, at least he must keep them from reigning in him.</p>
               <p>Have not many men thought, they have done God good service in some action, and yet repented them of the action? Have not every of us now and then pleased our selves with beholding as we thought the light of some divine truth, which upon second cogitations, and second weighing, we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected as our own false conceipt: and seemed to be angry and vexed with our selves (which is the chief ingredient of repentance) for receiving or allowing such an opinion? Now as it is impossible to err from the immediate light of that good spirit, so I am confident God was never so unkind to any, as to suffer any inward vexation of mind, in relation to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing of that he immediately inclined the mind to, by his Holy spirit. And therefore let not some honest well-meaning men (as doubtless there are many) from the present com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort they receive of the integrity or innocency of their own heart, be induced (through that song of <hi>requiem,</hi> as I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, chanted to them from others) to think that all that which they for the present verily believe, is the demonstration of that spirit of truth, dwelling in them. There is a vast and wide difference, between God's working in and through our spirit by his providence, as I have mentioned, and by his Holy spirit; We may err by the first (and those errors foreseen by him are ordered to his glory) but never by the second; nay, give me leave to say as well as think, we may wilfully sin by God's providence; Not that he is the author of sin, but by leaving us sometimes unto our selves, he so, after a manner as it were <hi>leads us into temptation,</hi> which we are taught to pray against by one that well knew our infirmities in the flesh, though he sinned not. And therefore 'twere well we mistake not the one for the other.</p>
               <p>There is no man that I know, so uncharitable to think any good meaning Christian man wholly devoid of that good spirit; But wishes that from thence, he may in due time, have
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50605:91"/>
a clear sight of the <hi>truth.</hi> A thing at present very remote from the prospect of the best, or wisest of us: Let him be but so charitable to himself, as to wish the same; We have our desire; He lays aside his present confidence and boasting.</p>
               <p>There are many well-meaning men, and of a seeming humble spirit to themselves, who are ready perhaps, therefore, to impute all their good thoughts to the work of that good spirit in them, but I wish their own spirit deceive them not; For I take this delusion to arise, not always, or so common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from humility, and the love of truth, as it does from secret pride, and the love of liberty. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> has told us, <note n="(a)" place="margin">2 Corinth. 3.17.</note> 
                  <hi>Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty,</hi> and if we are <note n="(b)" place="margin">Galat. 5.18.</note> 
                  <hi>led thereby</hi> we are <hi>not under the law.</hi> This pleases us so in a literal sense, that we are ready to let go our reason, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve we have the spirit to guide us in all things. But we might rationally suspect, that those who harp to us so much upon that string, would rather enslave us to themselves. As for liberty, we have enough already in any sence, and 'tis well if we use it not, either <note n="(c)" place="margin">Galat. 5.13.</note> 
                  <hi>for an occasion to the flesh</hi> or <note n="(d)" place="margin">1 Peter 2.16.</note> 
                  <hi>for a cloke of maliciousness.</hi> And for the Law, we need not fear, or desire to be exempt from it, 'tis fulfilled in <hi>one word</hi> the same Apostle tells us, <note n="(e)" place="margin">Galat. 5.14.</note> and that one word, is <hi>Charity;</hi> a thing chiefly to be recommended to all, which I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted upon elsewhere, and which I pray God send us through that spirit: and then we shall not <hi>bite</hi> and <hi>devour</hi> one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther under colour of I know not what spirit; perhaps through the very spirit of delusion.</p>
               <p>In all sins or offences, we say the understanding, the will, and the affections, are all, more or less faulty; but where the will is most too blame, there is the offence ever the greater. Now if it be an offence to vouch the Holy spirit upon every small occasion, and to play with it, as we may say, in too familiar a discourse of it; Men had need take great care and heed, that their will be not most to blame in that case. I think you will not, and I dare not, go about to define, what that sin is, which totally excludes us from mercy; But if any man upon examination of that deceitful thing, <hi>his heart,</hi> shall chance to find, he has at any time, upon any wordly design whatsoever, pretended some light from that Holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; Or so much as indeavoured to obscure the light of reason in others (which is able to shew unto subjects their duty of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50605:91"/>
obedience, that <note n="(f)" place="margin">Rom. 13.1.</note> 
                  <hi>there is no power but of God,</hi> and <hi>the powers that be, are ordained of God</hi>) by amuzing them therewith, and this for the advancement of himself, in place, power, or dignity, whether that we call temporal, or that we call spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual; I will be bold to tell him, he has been very presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and has committed a great offence.</p>
               <p>Well these two sorts of persons I first mentioned, the mere Spiritualist, and the mere Naturalist, are those, whom we shall scarce meet with in company, but we shall receive a challenge from; As to the first I have said somewhat, but properly to hold a dispute against him we cannot; either we must deny his premisses, which we are unwilling wholly to do, or else we must necessarily grant him his conclusion. For the other, so much a <hi>Sadducee,</hi> as not to believe Angel or Spirit, other than his own, if that; and resolving to believe nothing without a plain demonstration; We must) not provoking that spirit of his, of which he thinks himself the only master, and we think he is therein deceived) answer him at his own weapon, reason, (and indeed we have none other as of our selves) and argue with him in calm manner, if at all; not philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, not Aristotelically, but as rationally, and as plainly, and as perswasively, as we can, or are able, leaving the success to the guidance of that good spirit, in which we our selves already believe.</p>
               <p>'Tis a strange thing, a man should admit of any ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary inference, or any indifferent argument <hi>à probabili,</hi> as we say, to satisfy his reason, and raise a belief in any case, but that which is of greatest concern to him, the belief whereof would only do him good, and which could not, if upon a false ground, possibly prejudice him, or do him hurt. If I should begin to talk of the nature of the elements, how each several one, as we divide them, hath in it some latent quality, or virtue, of the other; And that some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular species of one, participates so much with, or is of such cognation, as we may say, with the other, that from some little reflexion or light from that other, it shall in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner change its quality, and seem to be quite another thing than what it was: And then tell one of these kind of men some such strange story of <hi>Naptha</hi> as <hi>Plutarch</hi> do's, A kind of a sulphureous fattish soil to be found, which taken out of the body of the earth, and brought to light, shall forthwith at a great distance from any fire, take flame from thence, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50605:92"/>
become of the nature of fire it self, consuming every thing about it; there is little doubt, but I might, without demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration to sense, obtain credit therein. Now since we cannot make out, that our soul (conscious of its being, and capable to enquire after the nature or original of its own and other beings) is the bare product of flesh and blood; or that it can be actuated from thence, towards these kind of enquiries; Why should not these men as readily believe that there is some spirit or intellectual mind, far above our own, from whence our own receives some influence, or agitation, and by which, it is disposed, ordered or governed?</p>
               <p>I dare appeal to the secrets of any one of these mens hearts, their conscience, if they please to allow of that term; Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no, if I should have done him some great or grievous injury, such as, after all ineffectual indeavour of revenge, should lye heavy upon his spirit, or leave a sting there, he should not by a kind of secret wish, seem to invocate (for we will not imagine he has so much of the Christian Tenet in him yet, as wholly to forgive all offences, and return good for evil) some <hi>Nemesis,</hi> or resort to some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret revenger of evil, to punish my injustice towards him? On the other side, should I bestow so many gifts, heap so much kindness, and do so many good turns to that man, as after all indeavours of requital in point of gratitude, he should find he were in no wise able to make me suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient recompence or amends, he should not by a like secret wish invocate some good power above his own, for a reward upon me? If in either of these cases, he thinks he should so do, or upon examination of himself, finds he has at any time so done, in like cases; then surely he naturally, as I may say, believes that, which in word he denies, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is some spirit above our own; for if he verily believed from his heart, there were no such thing, as some all-knowing, all-powerful, and all-sufficient spirit, a just rewarder of good and evil, superintendent over us; it were the most ridiculous thing imaginable for him barely to wish (nay he could not wish) me good or evil. But if he has unawares by his own spirit recourse to some invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible power, why should he not confess (which he often swears by unawares too) that there is a God?</p>
               <p>Now though it may seem here from the present purpose, give me leave to say in this place, that it is some confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50605:92"/>
of my opinion in relation to the soul of brutes proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing barely from their blood, and vanishing therewith (which thing I mean to insist upon more at large in some other dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course) that it makes no foreign appeal in any case, nor uses any weapon but bodily. I do here think, that God may punish us for the abuse of brute creatures, and that their blood may seem to cry for vengeance; but it cries only silently, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionally from them: For although we do really perceive, a kind of gratitude as well as revenge, in many creatures besides man; yet we cannot observe, no, nor suspect upon just ground, any recourse they have in prosecution of their love or anger to any superior power above themselves, I do not think my Spaniel ever wished me good or evil; if I could conjecture there were imprecatory thoughts in any creature save man (and the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of men has them) I should forthwith renounce and recant my present opinion of the annihilation of their spirit after death. For if that spirit of theirs, can wander out of the body, any other ways than directly by sense; it certainly neither vanishes with the body, nor can be said to be mortal.</p>
               <p>There are many such like cases as aforementioned of some strange foreign work in the soul of man, which have occurred to my mind, sufficient as I thought to convince any Atheist of the falsity of his assertions in point of the original of all things, and the government or guidance of all visible creatures, more especially our selves; But lest I seem guilty of what I condemned in my former Epistle, I shall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to insist thereupon, and leave all to that attribute, that su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabundant stream flowing from the Deity, and which is over all its works, its mercy and loving kindness towards man. And however any of us think or believe, either of our selves, or ought else in relation to our selves for the present; it can be no uncharitable wish or desire, no nor foolish one I hope; that before we cease to be as we are, that is, have finished the race of all flesh, we may so think and act, as that at the end of that race, we miss not of eternal rest, body and spirit.</p>
               <p>But if these two kinds of men amongst us, I have often thought, could be brought to some moderation (shall I say to a reconcilation, for they are opposites) it might prove an happy thing for this Island. And truly I cannot imagine a readier way to reconcile them than to perswade every of the Leaders in each opinion, if we could prevail therein, now and then to withdraw himself from all company, and seriously
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50605:93"/>
consider himself, (our spiritualists with the invocation of divine assistance, though the other not) have some rational discourse, or intercourse with himself alone in relation to his past actions or opinions, after what strange manner his soul has worked? Not only why his will and affections have pursued and imbraced that, which his intellect has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; but why his intellect without apparent cause from without, should sometimes reject that, which at other times it receives, and receive that which at other times it rejects? Whether that be not guided by affection sometimes, as well as affection by that? Or whether they with the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have not wrought together of themselves, for want of a better guide, rather than of any spirit from above? And what is that we seem to drive at all our lives and why? With many such like enquiries. This I call a busy solitude, and recommend it (if that may move ought) as the readiest way for some little light of truth which we pretend to, but too much, to break in upon the soul.</p>
               <p>And O that some men would with their reason, and the spirit in conjunction together, if that might be, throughly and impartially view and consider their imperfections; the daily errors and lapses of their own soul, whether through the precipitance of passion, or otherwise howsoever. Then sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, notwithstanding they might trust to the merits of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour through that blessed Spirit; I dare say they would not boast of its daily effects in themselves, nor go about to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade others of its daily motion in them, clean contrary to reason, and so much difference and distinguish themselves from all others by the spirit only.</p>
               <p>I know no hurt this rational solitude could do our Anti-Atheists, and such as almost deify themselves. I do not observe those great spiritualists much given to melancholy (a thing which sets the imagination on work without any reason at all, and from which I confess there may be much danger in solitude) they are generally busy and medling enough, and over and above their inspiration, assume and challenge to themselves a great deal of rationality beyond other men. They have their reason ready at hand, and sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we must needs allow them strength of reason, if the greatest policy or subtilty be always the product of the strongest reason (which I cannot think but the looking beyond and beholding all policy as vain, to be it) and then that reason of theirs, if they
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50605:93"/>
would first lay aside all prejudice and passion, might in an humble solitude work that effect, which in the end might bring them truer comfort, than what they at present feel, or pretend to, from the spirit.</p>
               <p>But they are not the men, to whom I would chiefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend solitude, lest from thence they feed their passions through their reason, rather than subdue them thereby, as it often happens: It is the plain downright Atheist, resolved in company to believe nothing without a plain demonstration, and who perhaps alone with himself, might from himself re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a kind of demonstration.</p>
               <p>Men may pronounce a <hi>vae soli</hi> but so long as a mans rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is able upon occasion, to put a stop to the career of his imagination and not only suffer it to ramble beyond sense, but even contrary to sense (in which case only it is we are subject to destroy our own bodies) We do think not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding God's wise and provident care of a companion for man in the creation, and the advantage and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort we receive from company above all other creatures, It may <hi>be good for man to be,</hi> sometimes <hi>alone.</hi>

               <p>It matters not much, who was the first Author of that saying, <hi>Nunquam minus solus, quam cum solus,</hi> whether <hi>Scipio</hi> the <hi>African,</hi> or any other, if so be upon consideration it be found to have no less of weight in it, than any of those of the Sages. Surely we must needs think upon weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it proceeded from a more than ordinary divine soul, and one who from solitude found somewhat of enjoyment more than ordinary. <hi>Scipio,</hi> if we believe history, received as great and publick applause, from publick action, as any man whatsoever, and might have pleased and enjoyed himself (we may well think) in company as much as any man; And therefore if it were he, we might the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther give credit to the saying, and hope to find that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and complacency in solitude, we never yet found. This let me tell any man, that he who considers his past actions by himself; searches rationally into himself, if he once come to behold his own imperfections (and that sight he will not miss of, if his intellect be not strangly bewitched by his affections) he will from thence fly in desire, to find out and behold some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that is perfect, which if he should not at present do (as I am almost assured he will do in fine) that little acquaintance he gets with himself, will otherwise find him imployment suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50605:94"/>
to verify that saying of <hi>Scipio;</hi> And this is the thing I would always have specially recommended to an Atheist.</p>

                  </gap>, or <hi>insanis Paul</hi>) and truly he who travels all the world over in quest of an original cause of all things, and looks not into himself, is, in my opinion, as well really and truly, as literally so: 'Tis a strange thing one would think, men in their search after God should go furthest from him; run to the least, and I think, most inconsiderable particle of his creation, and fansie atoms to be the cause of mind, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a mind. No, it must be a greater mind, that is the cause of a lesser mind, and a perfect mind of an imperfect mind: we our selves seem nearest to a Deity, and what should we go further to search for it? A man's own soul is, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that glass, which narrowly looked into, shews not only it self unto its self, but something beyond it and above it. Did ever any man observe the motion of his soul, and not at that time see his ignorance, and impute folly to some of his actions? And can he behold ignorance and folly, and not believe there is some such thing as knowledge, or perfect wisdom? Can he observe his own weakness, without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging some absolute power? Can he find such a thing as falshood in himself, and not believe there is truth? Can he observe himself sometimes harsh and cruel, and not acknowledge that there is such a thing as mercy? Did he never injure man? and if that escape not his sight, how will he be able to deny, but that there is such a thing as justice? and so for the like. Why, give me leave to tell him, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Wisdom, Power, Truth, Mercy, Justice, Love, Goodness, and the like (for I hope we may safely affirm, as well as some Philosophers, that there is morality in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, and that his happiness consists as well in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as in power and knowledge) united in one eternal mind, is that God, which we adore; not through amazement, and out of a confounded astonishment, bestowing these attributes on him, but rationally believing, they are essentially com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and perfect in such mind, of which ours is some image or shadow, but now dark and imperfect.</p>

earth,</hi> and this happy solitude, God and a mans self, seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be rejected for visible company: The citing any books of <hi>Moses</hi> to an Atheist, will 'tis likely, prove to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle purpose, perhaps he may say <hi>Moses</hi> was an Impostor, if not worse; and to talk of God's spirit under any notion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grace of illumination, or sanctification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will be to as little purpose, until a man has some knowledge of his own spirit. I will only say this more; That if any man please to follow my advice and withdraw himself a little from the world, and all company in an humble manner in relation to enquiry on that subject Himself; How himself so intellectual? from whence and whom himself? or the like, he may perchance find a <hi>striving</hi> or strugling within himself, in relation to that other subject matter, God: Whether it be his own spirit, or somewhat else that so <hi>strives</hi> or struggles in him, I will leave to his own determination. This I am sure of, that upon such withdrawing and search, he will be afraid there is some such thing as a God, and I believe for that present instant would venture a considerable summ, for the return of an infallible assurance, there were no such thing (and he is <hi>a most insensible man that would venture a farthing to be secured from that which his reason plainly tells him is impossible,</hi> says that most excellent <note n="(b)" place="margin">The go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the tongue. <hi>pag.</hi> 18.</note> Author, whom I had rather cite than seem to rob, though such notion came into my head as of it self before reading him) and why then should he not confess his fears and jealousies? Those fears and jealousies are an heavy nauseous burthen to the soul, retained and kept in; but cast up, and discharged in that manner, will cause very much present ease, and may fit and prepare the soul, to let into it a more pleasing and cordial belief in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a Deity, than such an one as that of <hi>Felix</hi> which only makes it tremble.</p>
               <p>I doubt not but you have sometimes, as well as I, thought on the madness of the people, and more especially, these two seeming kind of opposite mad-men I have mentioned, both equally bold with God, the one avouching him, as the sole and immediate spring of all his good (and such he is ready to term any or most of his own, whatever they seem to others) thoughts, and motions, and that in an high and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable sense and notion, not in his providence but by his very spirit. The other denying that he is at all, or that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50605:95"/>
there is any such thing as either. What either of these believe I know not, or whether any of them really and cordially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves what he says, I know not. But whatsoever either of them believes, 'twere to be wished, for peace sake amongst us, they sometimes would be more sparing of their speech, especially the latter; And I think he might in prudence soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est be silent, because I cannot judge of any great design he should have to gain proselytes, whatever the other may. But the best way to quiet them both, is, I have thought and do think, not to provoke them over much, but leave them a little to themselves, that so by degrees, they may through Gods providence over us, seem to be at quiet of themselves. And I beseech almighty God that none of us, ever provoke other in the way of dispute, out of some secret lurking passion, the love of somewhat else, rather than the love of truth, the sight whereof if we are once so happy as to behold, and can but retain any glimmering light thereof, the same will reduce us to unity of mind, and not set us at discord and variance.</p>
               <p>Shall I in the conclusion of this Epistle, plainly tell you the result of some of my solitary thoughts in relation to the flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering motion of our spirit here?</p>
               <p>That though it be governed, and enlightned in some case, by that good spirit of God, the very eternal spirit of truth, yet it is unsafe and dangerous for us to conclude when and how far we are thereby actuated, further than the bare embracing that eternal <hi>word</hi> by faith, as the alone Saviour of the world.</p>
               <p>That the providence of God may be safely averred and affirmed in all things, and that it is, or may be visible to all men, and he who beholds it not in some degree, is not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional.</p>
               <p>That were there not some foreign, or, operative power rule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, and over our spirit, besides what is natural, or what we call nature, (that is any absolute power it has of it self) it could not, notwithstanding any present lust of the flesh or eyes, be drawn any wise to promote any act, the inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble consequents whereof (<hi>viz</hi> the disquiet of it self, and disease of the body) it naturally loaths and abhors upon consideration. And that consequent certainly every soul more or less foresees in all intestine division and civil War.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:50605:95"/>That he, who considers our late past troubles, and the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the people then, may safely conclude, our punishment therein, was from God's just vengeance for our sins, in his providence; And that if he thinks there was any thing of his spirit therein, as was then much pretended, or contributing or assisting thereto, he is besides himself.</p>
               <p>That if the like madness now beginning to possess us again, perhaps through the general neglect of our ordinary duty to God, or the like, break not out into open rage and hostility, I will without hesitation affirm 'tis the merciful providence of God alone, and what we can scarce rationally expect, beholding our selves to sin so much against the light of reason. And thus much may any man see.</p>
               <p>That the soul of the wisest man, at best receives but a dim and short sight of the truth of things and causes; that if such sight at any time happen through the goodness and bounty of the Deity, it is apt to vanish again on the suddain, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the interposition of some clouds arrising from the flesh; so as the soul cannot long behold it, nor know where to fix, but in faith of some future clearer vision.</p>
               <p>That <note n="(a)" place="margin">Eccles. 8.17.</note> 
                  <hi>Man cannot find out the work that is done under the Sun: because though a man labour to seek it out; yea further, though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.</hi> But to believe there is wisdom, and truth, and justice, and mercy, in some one eternal mind, and that the judge of all the earth must needs do right, is almost a necessary consequence raised in the soul of man, upon any humble search into himself, and that <note n="(b)" place="margin">Eccles. 12.13.</note> 
                  <hi>the whole duty of man</hi> is no difficult thing to know.</p>
               <p>That even <hi>Solomon</hi> whom we agree to be endowed with the spirit of truth as well as naturally wise, appears to me in that excellent book intituled the <hi>Preacher,</hi> to have had his soul at a stand, and in a maze, not knowing where to fix in the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of any certain wordly course that ours might follow; But that he seems to allow its guidance by the providence of God, rather than his spirit: For if it were guided by the latter, it could not so often err, neither then would he call all its works vanity.</p>
               <p>That the spirits of men are then most keen, and most sharp set towards the world, and most likely to resemble the hawk, or the birds of prey, when there is most talk of the dove; and that we are willing to hide our selves under that shadow, though we have little of the light, of truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:50605:96"/>That some mens outward profaneness and publick contempt of God, seems ground sufficient in justice for our punishment by the hands of those, who, driving at wordly designs, only pretend to honour him. And that if those in authority took vigilant care, to see the very form of godliness better observed; those pretenders to it, in humane probability could not have obtained those advantages of alluring and drawing the vulgar to their side, as now they have.</p>
               <p>That in the misery of civil dissension, we shall be all more or less involved; the Atheist, the spiritualist, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and every of us, more or less shall feel the smart of it in the end, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any of us aim at present; that though there seem a necessity of offences, yet there is a consequent woe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly attending every offender; and therefore we should all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to be void of offences towards God and towards man; and prevent, if we can, that storm which seems to hang over us. But if it be otherwise decreed; then we who seem spectators only (but spectators only, we are not, since we are sinners) and neither deny God in word to provoke him to shew himself in our punishment, nor boldly vouch him in his spirit to cover the lust of our flesh; have this ready and open passage to fly unto God, until our calamities are over-past, His just, and wise, and merciful providence.

               <head>EPIST. III. Wherein the Author sets down some further grounds and reasons of his opinion of the mortality, or utter annihilation of the Souls of brutes upon their death: And therein indeavours to clear himself of all seeds and principles of Atheism, wherewith that opinion seems taxed, in a certain Book presented him by the said Dean.</head>
               <p>THat Soul which pries into things even below, and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to its self, do they seem at first never so ordinary, mean, and obvious, and be it clear-sighted as may be, (and perhaps from the clearest sight the soonest) will at length, if it dwell long on any subject, begin to stagger, and suspect it self of dimness and weakness, and that there is something more in every Creature, than it is able to discern or compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend: and if it resolve not into a blind kind of chance, or fall asleep in occult qualities, it will own one Almighty wise, and only all-knowing Being, or existence; and therein resting it self, will dare to assume no knowledge but conjectural, and seeming probable; that is no more than belief. This is my present thought, and confession. But because in my Treatise <hi>De Anima,</hi> I might seem to you a little too positively to assert the soul of Beast to be no other than part of a body, rarified to a proportion, and with the body perishing, and upon the dissolution thereof becoming annihilate, and totally extinct. I am now desirous to declare unto you a little more fully the grounds of my opinion thereabout; And the rather, because in that little discourse we had together, I received this only Querie from you; How an intellectual spirit, could naturally arise out of a material or bodily substance? And if the same were an infused spirit, and not part of the body, how the same with the body should cease to be or move? A Querie perhaps only made, to hear what answer a plain rational man without learning would make to it; and though a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious one, and such, as I acknowledg my self altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to resolve, or so much as to handle, yet I have made this further adventure in reference thereto.</p>
               <p>Truly Sir, I am not, or ever was, so positive in any asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my own, or so enamour'd therewith, as not to suspect my self of fallibility, and whenever I consider the soul of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50605:97"/>
beast, with those excellent faculties it is endowed, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but wonder at, and admire, and extol the God of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who was pleased to ordain, That from such individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al corporate substances, there should spring so much of intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, especially to be seen in many of them, as might seem to be, rather a special gift, and emanation from that Spirit (alwayes and every where moving, and which was once said more locally <hi>to move upon the face of the waters</hi>) than any pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar essence of so rare framed bodies. But yet I am not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, nor methinks could easily be convinced in reason, That therefore there is any duration of such Spirit, after the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is again converted to earth.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Spiritus Mundi,</hi> (if I may so term our God and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor blessed for ever) is every where, and moves every where, by his Original <hi>fiat:</hi> 
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Psal. 104.24.</note> 
                  <hi>His works are manifold, in wisdom hath he made them all</hi>; But yet without offence I hope, or any breach in that reason he hath given us above other creatures, we may conjecture, his emanations are not all alike. If in relation to brutes (for of such <hi>David</hi> there speaks) <note n="(b)" place="margin">ver. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>When he letteth his breath go forth, they are created, and so the face of the earth is renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>; Yet there may be a reassumption, and <note n="(c)" place="margin">ver. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>taking away</hi> again of that breath; and then things <hi>die, and are turned again to their dust,</hi> and no local continuance of that breath remaining, so as to be a spirit circumscribed. There is no <hi>manifestation</hi> as I may term it, of any durable Spirit in any visible creature, but us, his Image; because although those other Spirits are of him, and from him, yet they are not capable to conceive, they are of him and from him; nay from any thing else: and though some of them seem to work with intellect and will; yet they really work to his glory, as meer machines or engines, without any design and desire to fulfil, or will to transgress his eternal purpose, that we can discern.</p>
               <p>Now let us a little behold God in his Creation; That is, in his several visible creatures, which is indeed the proper mirrour for our reason to look into (for that cannot ascend higher of it self) and we may presently behold somewhat more than is obvious to common ordinary sense, and see his spirit working every where (though not alike) in wisdom. I know we distinguish between animate and inanimate bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, vegetation and sense, and the like; yet in all bodies, there are Spirits insensibly included in the tangible parts, as in an integumen; which are never (almost) at rest, but
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50605:97"/>
from them and their motion proceed Concoction, Maturation, Putrefaction and the like; and even in those inanimate bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies (to which we allow not vegetation or sense) there is a perception far more subtile than sense; That is, a kind of election to imbrace what is agreeable, and to exclude or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel what is ingrate, or nauseous, as we find between bodies electrick and some other bodies; And especially between Magnetick bodies and others, as the Loadstone and Iron; in which, or between which, there is a very disposition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming unto contiguity, or coition, or union with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For we cannot impute any coition of these two bodies to a bare attractive quality in the Loadstone; since those who have made their several Experiments thereof do deliver unto us, that if a piece of Iron be fastned in a bowl of Water, and a small Loadstone inclosed in a kind of Boat of Cork, be put into the Water, it will presently move and make way to the Iron. Nay a Needle touched will move towards a great body of Steel untouched; And the atoms or dust of a Loadstone fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly filed, will adhere unto Iron that was never touched. And as there is a kind of desire of union in some bodies, so there is an antipathy in or between others; as may be observed by Iron put into <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> upon which there will forthwith be an ebulition, with noise and emication; such an antipathy is there, and such a combat and contest between Sulphur and Iron when they meet.</p>
               <p>As for Plants, and all Vegetables (not to speak any thing of the sensible Plant, or the reason of its contraction upon touching) though we allow them not sense or passion; We cannot deny somewhat of appetite and aversion to be inherent in them (which in all creatures of motion is the product and mother of all passions) they do surely attract what is proper for their nourishment, and reject or secern what is improper and nauseous. There are multitudes of Plants, which of themselves, as weak and feeble, shall seem to tend directly to some other next adjacent bodies, which may support them; and even as it were espy and feel them out, as hath been observed of the Vine, the Ivy, the Hop, our ordinary Gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or Kidney Beans in Gardens, and many more. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that observation of perception in Plants may sometimes be taken upon false grounds, and that it is often in reality ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther some attraction by the warm Sun-beams of the body supported to the body supporting, than any perception in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50605:98"/>
the body supported: I my self have seen that Herb or Weed we commonly call Cliver, rooted some little distance on each side of an Hedge, from each side North and South, bent and inclined to the same Hedge, as to its prop and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>
               <p>What there is of affection in Plants is not altogether a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less inquiry; We commonly say, and it may be not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly; That Laurel loveth the shade, or delighteth in the shade; And other Plants love and affect such and such a kind of soil. Now to say nothing of the Palm-tree, strangers to our Climate, of which it is reported, That if two of them of some difference in kind, (for there is some distinction made between them of Male and Female, as we do of some other Plants) grow near together, they will most apparently incline to each other, with the imbraces as it were of Lovers: There is most certainly a kind of agreement, and disagreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween divers and sundry particular Plants; So as some of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral kinds shall thrive separate, and asunder upon a like soil; and yet not contiguous and together: And on the other side, there are divers peculiar Plants, which will not thrive, or be at all, unless adjacent, contiguous, or intermixt with some other of another kind; As from peculiar Weeds, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amongst Corn only, we observe. Some of which kinds of Weeds are never or rarely to be found elsewhere than amongst Corn: Nor will the soil ready manured for Corn (if the same be neglected to be sown with Corn from ill husbandry or otherwise) ever produce them.</p>
               <p>There is a kind of Envy and Emulation between Plants, and as it were a striving for the mastery, as is observable in Trees contiguous and adjacent, which ever mount higher than when they are apart, and distant some space one from each other; and although some other reason may be given for their mounting in height in case of proximity, <hi>(viz.)</hi> a more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous inclination and erection, ascendently towards the Sun, whose beams are laterally obstructed by the neighbouring Trees: Yet that reason holds not in smaller bodies as Grass and Corn; where thickness, or near adjacency rather dwarfs than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise. And yet between Corn and Weeds there is observable a kind of strugling for the mastery, in the beginning of Summer; and sometimes the one, and sometimes the other robbing its rival of nourishment, do's very much enfeeble it, and cause it to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50605:98"/>
lose its strength, verdure, and freshness, if not totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy it; which the Poet methinks prettily expresses in these (if I forget not) words <hi>Et steriles dominantur avenae,</hi> as if after a superiority, they lorded it, as we say, over one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Now as we observe God has, by the universal frame of Nature, implanted some kind of spirit in every of his Works, and some kind of abhorrence of a dissolution; together with a secret endeavour, in every particular of his Works, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not only towards the preservation of its peculiar being barely, but its exaltation, and well-being too, as far as may be: So it is no ways dissonant to our reason, to conjecture, or imagine, that that wise Creator of all things should from those bodies which he was pleased to have separate from the earth, and to have local motion, Ordain a Spirit to arise, rarified in them to some greater proportion than the other; which should be, not only pervious as in Plants, but have some peculiar seats and cells, fit for its proper work and operation, towards the conservation of that body, whereof it is a more refined part, as necessary and requisite thereto; and without which, we cannot so much as imagine it were capable to have duration and continuance in that form it is; But yet withal, no ways comprehending or desiring any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or thing, further than in relation to the sustentation, or preservation of the same body. And therefore for such a Soul or Spirit, to perish with the body, and to resolve again into its first elements, is not altogether incongruous to our reason.</p>
               <p>And we may I think further conjecture in reason, that, though <note n="(a)" place="margin">Rev. 4.11.</note> 
                  <hi>for his pleasure all things are, and were created;</hi> Yet he being <hi>worthy to receive glory and honour</hi> (voluntary) from some terrestrial creature, (For whose <note n="(b)" place="margin">2 Esdras 6.55.</note> 
                  <hi>sake</hi> next and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after his own Glory and Honour, it may seem to us, <hi>all</hi> others were <hi>made</hi>) He might endow the most excellent of his terrestrial creatures, us, men, with such a spirit, as might not only have some glimmering light of him here, but might have continuance, to magnify him for ever, when the Earth and Heavens should be no more. Yet herein again I must acknowledge, that the thoughts of the immortality of our soul are more apt and ready to encounter and stagger our reason, than the mortality, or vanishing of that of Brutes. Since we are not able with reason to imagine, but that (as I
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50605:99"/>
have already said in my Treatise <hi>de Anima</hi>) whatsoever thing had a beginning, may or will have an end; and that there is nothing Eternal, but God alone, the Maker and Creator of all things out of nothing. And therefore there is no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Medicine to cure those reeling cogitations of ours, about our immortality, but Gods promise in his Holy Word, with his special grace to believe it to be his Word; Nor any thing else to strengthen us therein, more than some specifick, and not barely gradual difference to be found out and espied between our Spirit and that of Beasts; That is, some acts or thoughts of man, even <hi>extra-corporeal,</hi> or peculiar to a soul, or Spirit, wholly separate and disjoined from a body, and which indeed are no ways discernable in the wisest Animal; whereof I have made some mention, in my Treatise <hi>de Anima,</hi> and which seriously and duely weighed and considered, I leave to the World to judge of, and shall repeat nothing of it here, in relation to our present subject, only or chiefly now inquiring about their Mortality or Immortality, without questioning our own.</p>
               <p>There are indeed many, and various different kinds of operation, between the soul of Beast, and that of us, in many things; as not only sufficiently distinguish us, without appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priating to our selves and wholly ingrossing the word ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, but seem plainly to demonstrate, their Soul rather essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial with the Body, and a peculiar substance of the body, than ours; and therefore more probably terminating in and with the body; some whereof, having now and then oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to my thoughts, and drawn my reason to accept and allow thereof, I here present you; and submit the weight and consequent thereof to your more serious, or solid judgement; though they have already somewhat prevailed over mine, to conclude the Spirit of Beast (though an admirable work in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) to be a thing only temporary, and fading or mortal.</p>
               <p>There is in all living Creatures whatever, not humane, either immediately upon their first being, and motion, or so soon as there is any vigorous bodily strength for motion, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect clear and evident apparency of that intellect, they at any time have or enjoy, as a special present attendant of their being, and subsistence. And whatever Adages we have of a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning old Fox, or proverbial interdiction of catching old Birds with chaff, I could never yet discern, but that the young Fox, or the young Hawk, had the same compleat stratagems to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50605:99"/>
preserve themselves as the old, and that if they sooner fall as a prey to the Dog, 'tis want of strength, rather then sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty.</p>
               <p>The Kitling sure needs no instruction to catch a Mouse, with a kind of cunning watchfulness, as soon as it hath strength, and the young Bird makes her nest with as much curious art, as the old one. And, what is somewhat wonderful, most creatures at their first production into the world are able to distinguish sounds, and capable to understand the very language of their kind. I have observed a very young Lamb to distinguish the bleating of its Dam, from twenty other doing the like almost at the same instant; and to move at her bleat only, and not otherwise. 'Tis observable in Fowls, and I have taken more special notice of it in the Turky; that whereas they use three or four several notes, or tones, to their young ones; one of allurement for food; another of attraction for covering with their wings; a third for progression, or motion along with them when they move; a fourth of admiration and wonder, or warning to preserve themselves upon apprehension of danger, and approach of Birds of prey; they have within an hour or two after they have been brought forth apprehended the differences of these several tones, and readily observed the old one's dictates; Especially it would almost amaze one to behold these little things of an hour or two old, upon that alarm of danger, how instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they will couch down, and approach the next covert to hide themselves. Nay many of these Creatures need little of document from their Parents, or Dams, or yet (our Mistress) experience, there being in them a Native intellectual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception (as I may say) of every special, and more peculiar destructive nature, or quality, towards them; in as much as we may observe Birds taken out of the Nest never so young, and bred up in a Cage, shall upon the first sight of an Hawk, or other Bird of Prey, brought into the room, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently by their fluttering and otherwise discover a kind of knowledge of some approaching danger, or adstant peril, which upon the sight of any other Fowl, or Beast they will not. Whereas most probably, or undoubtedly rather, to a man brought up in a Have, or otherwise never behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before any creature, save humane, A Lyon and a Calf would prove equally terrible, upon their first approach. And whereas there are many Herbs, Plants, and Insects too, of a
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50605:100"/>
poysonous nature, and of an absolute destructive quality to Man and Beast, if received into the body for food, What creature is there to be found young or old, except man, not able by sense or otherwise, to distinguish between what is agreeable, and what destructive to his nature, and will at all times most certainly avoid and reject the latter, unless by man inserted, or intermixt with some food agreeable to its nature?</p>
               <p>We see many of these brute creatures even Physicians to themselves, and all of them naturally avoiding such of the Elements as are destructive to them. Let a Duck hatch Chickens (trial whereof has been made) and no allurement or invitation she can make shall draw them into the water: An Element equally destructive to our nature, and yet from which we are often inforced to use some care and industry to preserve our own young ones.</p>
               <p>I speak all this to shew, and to make it somewhat appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and plain, that that kind of Intellect which is in Animals, how great soever it may seem to be, is nothing else, but a more curious kind of perception, with sense and motion, than that of Vegetables, or inanimate bodies, and arising in the blood (or other such like thin fluid substance in Insects) because, as soon soever as it has its full current and motion, the intellect of those creatures is at the highest, unless some actions of theirs from our documents seem to make an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of it; which in reality is no addition of intellect, but the exercising a prior inherent Intellect some other way, towards their acquiring food or the like. But the Soul of man though chiefly seated in the blood (and upon a total effusion or shedding thereof necessarily leaving the body) do's not in the most florid and vigorous condition thereof, and in youth so much shew it self, nor is so quick in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning things obnoxious to the body, as theirs; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may seem rather, some wonderful way inspired, than to be connative, and of the substance of the body; for certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a separate created Spirit, though of a wonderful knowledg and apprehension, as subsisting of it self, yet sent into the gloomy dark vault, or tabernacle of a body, wants not only the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of species by sense, as some inlet to work upon, but also some considerable space of time to shew its intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual power, and vigour, rather than a spirit raised in a body, for the substance and government only of the same body;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50605:100"/>
without which speedy work in Nature, to some perfection, the body would not long submit in that state. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the case of a first created, and after infused spirit only, it sometimes happens, from the darkness or closeness of its mansion, it has little other visible operation, than the very carrying its Tabernacle about with it (as I instanced in the case of an Ideot in my Treatise <hi>de Anima</hi>) and yet as to its excellence and sublimity, in point of its original be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and intellective power, were it freed and discharged of those obstructions ithas, far exceeds that of the wisest Animal. So as immaterial and (from thence probably) immortal spirits, want but room to display themselves; or having room, want some space of time to recover and expel some mists of their present obstruction, and then by gifts only, break out in any lustre.</p>
               <p>To will a Spirit, endowed with some kind of preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive intellect to arise from a body, is equally the wonderful work of an Omnipotent Power, with the creation of a body, and endowing the same with a spirit <hi>ab extra,</hi> as I may say: and no less than either, to endow an inanimate body with peculiar operative Qualities or Vertues. But if it be once ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and granted, that in Animals the blood is the life, or that the spirit is essential with the body; whereof there is some sufficient ground from the course of Nature to believe (its motion and tendence regarding nothing else) It will necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily and consequently follow, That the whole, spirit and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, how ever we divide it by particular names, is subject to one and the same Fate, Destiny or Period.</p>
               <p>As to these spirits of ours; If they were a part of, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>essential with our bodies; I cannot see how it were either na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, or possible, that there could at any time arise in the soul, a desire of disunion, or dissolution from that body, of which it self was a part; Which desire in certain humane spirits has most certainly at sometimes appeared, nay often worked its desired effect: Nor is it reasonable to conjecture, that any thing can possibly will or endeavour its own destruction or annihilation; and therefore if our Souls were of the very essence of our Bodies, we must grant, A man could never vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily or intentionally make away himself, the contrary whereof is manifest.</p>
               <p>As to those spirits of theirs, if they were distinct or any way separable from the body, and no part thereof (since
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50605:101"/>
they labour and groan under the Creation as much, or more than we, and are no less subject to passions of fear, and the like) then at sometime or other, upon some displeasure or other, there would be espied a voluntary indeavour of its se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, by its own act, to ease it self of those flames it felt for the present: But this could never be observed in any of them, by any of us; but alwayes such a voluntary resistance of Separation, as there is usually in us, unless at such times as this separable Soul of ours is ravished with Hopes and Joyes, or tortured with Despairs and Fears. At least if the Soul of beast were a distinct thing from the body, and separable therefrom, it might now and then as well as ours, be observed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally to act after such a manner, as in no wise, barely and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply tended towards the preservation of the same body; but seeming to neglect the body, were somewhat fixed for a while upon a subject matter, altogether unnecessary to the bodies ease, quiet, or well being. Now if any man could be able to satisfy me of so much as a voluntary abstinence in any creature save Man, at any time, from any thing, which might seem to afford delectation or nourishment to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or satiate or please the same, at such instant, as there was a present appetite, or desire, and when there was no impendent fear, or other passion to obstruct, so as, the body might seem to be, at the same instant, voluntarily neglected, for the pleasing or satisfaction of the mind: Much more if I were able to discern any kind of motion of the spirit of beast (the most subtle or wise) tending, out of its proper element, the Flesh, and the preservation thereof; and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising its passions, about qualities or accidents; as to love Justice or Mercy; to fear ignominy, or contempt; to desire to know, or the like; whereby it might seem to be capable of, or merit a future reward or punishment, and be a just subject thereof (for nothing uncapable to act voluntarily beyond the preservation of it self can so be) I should then be inclinable to think, that there is rather a continuation, and some transmigration of that Soul, than any evaporation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and vanishing into the soft air, or a reduction thereof into Earth with the body.</p>
               <p>But besides what has been alledged, and some places of holy Scripture which might be alledged, seeming to give a period to the soul or spirit of beast, together with the body. It will be difficult for our imagination (so long as we have
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50605:101"/>
any reason left to go along with it, aid or assist it, or else but correct it) to assign a place for the residence, or future habitation of these Souls, when the body leaves them, or they leave the body. We shall scarce allow them any heavenly vision; and though they are the work of God's hand, as well as we, and work to his glory, and set forth his glory here on Earth, we shall hardly admit them to do it local<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Heaven.</p>
               <p>To what place shall we convey them? or for what work or use shall we assign them in our thoughts? If we leave them as thin aiery bodies, wandring up and down in the Air, or, we know not where, or whither; neither animating or moving other bodies, nor doing good or harm to man, or ought else, I think we derogate from the wisdom of that first cause, wich can no more be thought to continue a thing altogether useless, and unnecessary, than to create a thing use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less from the beginning; which reason will not allow us to think. If upon the separation of these Souls from the body, we can imagine, they forthwith enter into animate, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side in other bodies; we must forthwith make enquiry, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such bodies only, as are of the same Nature, Quality and Species, with those they inhabited before, or else pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuously of any kind, or degree whatever: Either of which will prove absurd to imagine with reason. But before we come to view that absurdity in its particulars; All li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and moving Creatures would be a little considered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in their several Faculties or Intellects; from which notion, <hi>Intellect,</hi> we raise our doubts of their Mortality or perishing.</p>
               <p>Though the wisdom of the Almighty be apparent, and imbraced by the reason he has given us, in his willing the production of a more fine and subtle spirit for moving bodies, than those fixed to the Earth (touched before) we cannot rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably conjecture any vast disproportion of Intellect (though some we find) between living, moving Creatures themselves, whose voluntary operation seems to be, and tend only to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards acquiring Food and Sustenance, to each particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual, and perpetuating it self by generation. For our more immediate acquaintance, or conversation with some of them, more proper and fit for our use, make the difference in their Intellect seem greater to us than in reality it is. And we are apt to place the excellency generally in those creatures,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50605:102"/>
which necessarily depending on us (next under God the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server and Feeder of all) for preservation and sustenance; do by that their dependance, and familiarity with us, shew their Intellect more apparently to us, than other Brute Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. But why we should hereupon imagine, that there is not as much of Intellect in some Fishes of the Sea, as either in Fowls of the Air, or four-footed Beasts which we better know, I find no reason; since by their Intellect, they both acquire their food, and preserve themselves from danger, equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the others; Nay I see no ground to deprive Insects from as large a share of Intellect, in some cases as either. By Insects I mean not only those <hi>reptilia,</hi> and <hi>volatilia,</hi> without parts and blood, to us discernible; but all creaturs what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, bred of heat and putrefaction, as it may be, Mice, some kinds of Serpents, Frogs and the like, whereof some years seem to produce more, and far greater numbers than can be thought to proceed from generation, though I believe most Creatures bred of putrefaction at first, do after gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>
               <p>These together, do undoubtedly far exceed in number all quadrupedes and flying Fowls upon the face of the Earth; Now some of these have already obtained from us the repute of very wise and provident Animals, and we are apt to extol their Intellect sometimes, beyond that of other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of far greater bulk and dimension. Truly it may be adequate in many cases; Intellect we know no more how absolutely to deny them, than other Creatures. Certainly we cannot deny any sense to most of them, for instance the Bee, undoubtedly they see and hear too, as may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served and collected from their being stayed or allured with whistling, or the ringing of a Bason. And since we observe, how they will find and know their way to a Field of Thyme, or the like, some Miles distant from their Hives, and return directly to them again, we cannot deny them voluntary motion, and by consequence Imagination: and further I am somewhat assured, upon Experiment, they will in few days cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know, and distinguish a person conversant about them, and not at any time molesting him, (though he somewhat molest and disturb them) and forthwith strike at any Stranger, upon his or her approach. And truly were Wasps and Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets equally beneficial to man with them, I doubt not, but some, who have wrote the Common-wealth of the one, would
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50605:102"/>
soon have espied a Kingdom in the other (more than <note n="(a)" place="margin">Prov. 30.27.</note> 
                  <hi>Agur</hi> could discern in the Locusts) and found as much of sense and Intellect in the one, as in the other. Since they are no less political creatures, and work in select numbers, and with no less order, and it may be government, than the other; the like may be said of many other kinds of Insects.</p>
               <p>The numerous excess of Insects, beyond that of other creatures granted; and likewise that there is in many of them (which I know not well how it can be denyed) as great a measure of knowledge, as in some other creatures (which thing Knowledg or Intellect in any or all, is our ground to think, why such their Spirit resolves not into Earth or Air, but rather continues in some airy thin body, or transmigrates into some other body, for the animation thereof) It will follow, that the spirits of these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sects cannot transmigrate into specifick quadrupede bodies, or Fowls; because it may be made (almost) apparent, that there often are in one, or two days space more of them in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber destroyed and mortified, than there are, probably, four-footed Beasts, and Fowls upon the face of the whole earth: But we must of necessity find out in our imagination, some place for the spirits of these insects to rest in, for a time; or where they work, or wander up and down for a certain space; Or else conclude, they do forthwith animate (or trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migrate into) bodies of the same, or the like species with themselves, to wit insects only. Which to hold and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, would be equally absurd to our reason; unless we can rest convinced withall, of some World in the Moon, or at least a most accurate Antipodes to our selves, and a Continent of land so placed, where the Sun shall have a most lively vivifying influence too, at that very time or instant we shall first feel our sharp Autumm frosts. For besides the innumerable millions of divers kinds of our ordinary Flies, whose spirits from thence cease to work any more in the same bodies (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween which and those Insects we attribute so much of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to, it would be difficult to define any certain bounds, in point of prudence or Intellect.) How many thousand millions of that sage provident creature, the Ant, do's one winter destroy? Since we often afford an helping hand to their destruction, by laying their heaps and banks open to the power of Northern blasts and cold, as being (how ere so wise for themselves) noxious to our grounds and fruit. How many Spirits or Souls of that other wise creature the Bee, do good
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50605:103"/>
Housewifes at a peculiar time toward the approach of the fall send together in transmigration by Brimstome to some other place? Truly the Ant in great numbers, may be thought, as well to make a voluntary transmigration, as that there is any transmutation of species in them (as some hold) since this is most certain; that every kind of them, at such an age, or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of time, become winged, and leaving their heaps or banks to the younger Brood or Frye, flee away, and are seen no more: But that they convert to a life of another species, I believe no more, than that there is a conversion of species, of those little black Clobheads which we call Tadpoles, bred in Ponds of the spawn of Frogs, by the accession of legs, and quite different features, from what they had before. As to that other <hi>most subtle</hi> and <hi>wise</hi> creature, so termed in Scripture, the Serpents (if our Adders and Snakes may come under that notion) How many of them do some Winters cast into a profound, and lasting sleep? as may be observed from the paucity of them, seen, in a Summer suceeding a sharp and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Winter: So as those which have but shallow caverns, or holes to sleep in, are scarce thought ever to awake again. These are but a species or two of many thousands for ought I could ever perceive, as wise in their kind as they, whose bodies Winter leaves altogether inanimate. We make our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of a plentiful Summer from the sharpness of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter preceding, and we give our reasons sometimes, from some native or inherent warmth in Snow, the contraction of the pores, and keeping in the spirits in the earth, by cold; the retardation of all plants, attraction of their sap and moisture too soon thereby, and then their more vigorous operation, and exhaleing of the same upon the more near approach of the Sun beams, with the like; which though they may be good reasons of our plenty too; Yet I am apt to think, the exanimation of innumerable Insects, hurtful to plants and fruits, from the sharpness of the winter, or it's imbecilitating their Eggs, or Seed, for production; is a reason of more weight, than all others usually given. For he who will at the Spring time but walk into his Gardens or Fields, with a light, in the night season, may espy a various multitude of little creatures, who (as the Psalmist expresses it) <hi>all wait on God for their meat in due season;</hi> Which as ordinary Earthworms (and of them there are divers kinds too) are not to be seen in the day time, nay some of them so small, and of colour earthy, as they
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50605:103"/>
are not easily discernible, but upon a green plant. This every provident Gardiner is sensible of, and does not impute the nipping off (or little holes in) his tender Plants, like common Country people, to Easterly Winds, which may indeed wither, or discolour, but neither bite nor perforate. To find out or imagine bodies ready prepared for all these spirits, at an instant frosty time, would puzzle the best Intellect, or strongest ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</p>
               <p>Should we pass by these spirits, inherent in all these little creatures, as insignificant; and because we are not able with our eyes to see, behold, or distinguish any parts, or blood in them; laugh at those trite sayings, <hi>Formicae sua bilis inest; Habet &amp; musca splenem,</hi> and find out some pretty distinction between their Spirits, and the Spirits of Beasts, of visible parts, and greater bulk. Certainly, since their Shambles are fuller of their bodies in Winter, than in Summer, and most of them (especially wild creatures) bring forth young only, in some peculiar Summer months; We shall need the like help, as in our case of Insects, to salve the errors of a transmigrating imagination.</p>
               <p>In case of oviparous creatures, as all Fowl, I would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know, Whether after the Egg conceived, and formed, from treading or copulation, there be not a spirit therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and included; And yet they who can imagine an immortal spirit in the Chicken, will hardly allow it, I believe in the Egg, or that upon corruption of the Egg, or conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of it to draught, there is any transmigration, and yet no doubt the spirit in the egg, and the spirit in the chicken, are one and the same, only in the one case, by gentle and proper heat continued for some space, rarified to a greater degree, and proportion, than in the other; and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is subject to receive its termination and period with the body of one as well as of the other. If we think the life and motion in the Chicken, be a new peculiar spirit intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by heat, then do we allow our selves a power, not only of sending spirits in transmigration to other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, by our destruction and devouring of the present, but (creating I will not say) alluring, and drawing spirits, from one body to another, at our will and pleasure; and so kill bodies at a distance; which thing, would have made a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy I knew, who hatched a Hawk in her bosome, a little more proud of the act, than she was; and thought herself
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50605:104"/>
equal, if not superior to <hi>Livia,</hi> of whom <hi>Pliny</hi> relates a like sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and I think it was but of a Chicken.</p>
               <p>I am unwilling to move out of my own element, and to indeavour any discovery, about the spirit, or souls of Fishes, what becomes of them. Those aquarious Spirits in our standing Lakes, and Pools, do usually in a very hard win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter undergo the same fate of many Insects, and want at that time a numerous company of bodies, ready prepared, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, and no less at other times (that is in peculiar Summer months) when they lay their spawn do they want in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable spirits, to animate the same, more than that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant season can well afford, either from the destruction of insects, or any kind of moving body. But I think we need not trace after these Spirits, by Sea or Land, or trouble our heads with any narrow search upon such a subject; since whatever becomes of the souls of other living creatures, is rather a curious and unnecessary enquiry, than in any wise ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to our own, any ways useful or profitable to our subsistence, or any ways tending towards the well ordering, or governing our Passions, or Affections; unless, it may be, in this only, that from the assurance of the duration of the soul of Beasts, as something more excellent than bare Earth, or other Element, we become more careful how we abuse or unnecessarily vex them: Which (without knowledge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) we have sufficient ground to forbear, and since beholding our selves, and them together, undoubtedly the workmanship of one and the same God of Nature, we cannot but be (if we be barely righteous) merciful to our Beasts. Thus much more, I have adventured to speak in reference to the Soul of Beasts, that curious and admirable effect of Nature, that Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistry in nature, by which we conceive there is extracted a kind of Intellect, out of matter; yet such, as necessarily ceases to be, or work, out of its house of clay, but falls and perishes with it, as we conjecture, and is not so immediately from the breath, or spirit of the Almighty as our own; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we cannot observe in or from its motion, or opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, any thing which might seem to tend, or reach after eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or perpetuity; or any imployment of any thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that more remote author of its being, the first original in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>depent cause of all, <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In my search into my self, or in my Treatise <hi>de Anima,</hi> and comparing the soul of man and beast together, I did endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50605:104"/>
to find out the native Strength and Power, and set down the just Extent, Limits, and Bounds of each, without dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing ought from the one, or adding to the other; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I might behold their several original extract. This I did by the best and clearest light my Reason was able to afford, and from thence I could never espy any just ground to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude any future duration of the Spirit of Beast (as that of ours) but rather the contrary.</p>
               <p>Now the chief ground, as I conceive, which has begot an opinion in some men, of their Duration and Immortality, is some false opinion or admiration of an Intellect in them, beyond its compass and ability; or what they are naturally endowed withal. Men have been very apt and prone some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, in their search into the works of Nature, to bestow their own reason on other Creatures; and amplified theirs, to have their own magnified; and would be esteemed quick-sighted in curiously finding out what they never had or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed. We have often attributed to Brutes greater gifts, than God, through Nature, ever bestowed on them. Their Intellect has been strangely gilt by some of us, and made to pass for currant amongst others, when in reality it is but ordinary Earth, and from thence extracted: and if we can but once find and espy, as we think, some remote prospect of theirs; it is no marvel if we ascribe duration and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity to them, as well as to our selves. An instance whereof I will first here lay down before you, and then fully convince you (as I think) or any other of the falsity of that common Tenet.</p>
               <p>Amongst others, the wisdom of the Ant is much extolled and magnified, and it is a received opinion from some learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and eminent Men;<note place="margin">

Now to shew the apparent falsity hereof, and that there is no such provident wisdom in this Creature, nor any such foresight of it, into the Works of Nature; We must first find out, if we can, what kind of Ant it is (for there are divers kinds) to which this provident wisdom is attributed.</p>
               <p>Of Ants so called, there are many of various kinds, and different colours; some greater, and some smaller, some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant only in Pasture grounds, or Orchards, raising multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes

of little Hillocks out of the Earth, and scarce discernible to move much further than those Banks, most of a red colour. Others, of a black colour, and usually about some hollow Tree. Others more conversant about houses, and very troublesome to the Owners. Others more conversant about woody places, and raising a great heap of Sticks, Straws, and other light adjacent matter; and this is the great brown Ant, the <note n="a" place="margin">

                  </note> Poet so fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and elegantly describes, which I conceive to be the provident wise Ant, intended; For of other kind, I could never discern that carried any thing to their Heap, Food or otherwise.</p>
               <p>Now I must first take leave to deny from sight, this constant seeming wise course of theirs. For I have seen Corn spring, and shoot from their Heaps; and opening their Heap, have taken it into my hands, and viewed its Sprouts into Blade and Root. Not that I think it usual or common with them, to bring any Corn at all thither; unless the same casually scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, next their Heap and Path, was, with other things as a light portable matter for them, brought to their Heap. For I could never yet discern them to feed on any Corn, but only on tender Buds of Fruit-Trees, and other Trees, Grass, Flowers, and sometimes Fruit; neither indeed shall a man find their Path, by which they go and return, tend towards any Corn-Field at any time; but to some particular Trees, where one shall see their quick and numerous passage up and down. Now, besides that there are innumerable kinds of Seeds, which may come under the notion of Grain or Corn, so round, as that no end is discernible; I would the Discerner and finder out, or at least the Assertor of this Wisdom in the Ant, would shew me the two ends of a piece, which if he should, I can shew him if he please to stay the Experiment, both Blade and Root proceed from one end, in some particular Grain, and Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, and that if it be cut into parts, and one end cast away, the other will notwithstanding sprout, grow up, thrive and flourish.</p>
               <p>But to confute this Error, as I said, He who has ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served their Heaps, and moved them after a great rain, shall find such a pretty contexture, or way of laying those little sticks and straws, that the place where they lay their Eggs (unless sometimes they bring them up nearer to the Sun) and whither they chiefly resort, shall be very dry after the greatest Showers. Now if they have such a way of Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture, that they can lay up their Corn dry, and that it will
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50605:105"/>
so continue; then there is no need of biting off the ends, for without moisture it will never sprout, though the ends con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue on; but if that be denied, and that they lay up their Corn so, as it it may be moistened from Rain, then though it be bit, and uncapable of sprouting; that moisture in the Heap, will soon convert it to Putrefaction and Earth, and take from it all nutritive quality before the approach of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the time they may seem to need it. But besides this, whosoever observes all kinds of Insects which move upon the face of the Earth, shall find none of them, unless such as are kept vigorous, from the heat of other greater living Bodies (<hi>viz.</hi> Worms, Lice, or the like) to want nourishment, the greater and sharper part of Winter; but lye as it were dead, and stupified, till again revived and re-inspirited, by the more near approach and warmth of the Sun-Beams: And except it be for such time, they have always Herb, their common food, so as we do vainly impute to them, a false Wisdom of our own imagination. Yet there is a pretty and not improper simile made between us and that poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by one who compares us together, and sayes we may be looked upon to be very like them, if one shall behold us, as well as them, and see and observe one passing hastily one way, another another way, one going, another turning, one op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing and justling another, one carrying this, and another that, and all to add somewhat to an heap of Earth. Indeed it is a very busy Creature in Summer, and a fit and proper Tutor and Monitor, for <hi>Solomon</hi> to send his Sluggard unto <note n="(a)" place="margin">Prov. 6.6.</note>; but if there be any of the kind, that <hi>gathereth up her Food in the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest,</hi> as he there saith; and that against Winter, as some other Naturalists affirm, 'tis some particular species of them, which they had seen, and I have not.</p>
               <p>We may not unfitly resemble our selves, in many things, to several brute Creatures, and I have often my self done it in my thoughts, but could never find any for a comparison more proper than the Bee. A Creature whereof it may be said only with man, (that is from any bare voluntary act or operation) <hi>Sic ves non vobis,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I could never yet discern any other Creature, unless Man, to lay, and store up together far more than were sufficient to maintain it self, or were necessary for its well-being; and certainly that's the cause, that of all Creatures, they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly destroy such a number of one another of the same species,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50605:106"/>
with that fury and madness. It may be truly observed of them, and us alike, how we live in select Parties, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments; how industrious some of us are to build and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther together, and others are lazy idle Drones; How we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour justly, while we are equally poor, and find enough in the World, by our industry, to make us all rich, and in some measure happy. But no sooner are some full, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, than we fall at variance, and often destroy one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when each one in an industrious way might find sufficient to supply his present need, without the robbing of his Neighbours Hive. We are pettish and angry at we know not what, or at utmost because our Neighbour is richer than our self. But yet surely there remains this difference between us; That we are able to espy the Madness and Folly of such actions, having the Principles of Justice, and Equity engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in us. Indeed we are in many things comparable to the Beasts that perish, but the Beasts that perish are in no wise comparable unto us; until that light of Reason we have, for want of use thereof or looking further than Sense, becomes as it were extinct: which they utterly wanting, in a strict No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; there is no ground for us to think their Souls should continue to work longer than the Ports of Sense are open, but that, they closed, we affirm, the Soul is extinct.</p>
               <p>It may not be improper for me in this place (though I never found inclination in my self to incredulity of a Deity) to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and clear, at least to excuse this my Opinion, of the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality or annihilation of the Soul of Beast, from all Seeds and Principles of Atheism, wherewith it may seem to be charged, and taxed in a certain Book presented me by your self, as an excellent piece on this Subject; after I had set down these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thoughts as they are. In which Book I find these words; <hi>And however some that are no Atheists, be over prone to conceive Life, Sense, Cogitation, and consciousness in Brutes, to be generated out of dead, senseless, and unthinking matter (they being disposed thereunto by certain mistaken principles, and ill methods of Philosophy) nevertheless, is this unquestionably in it self, a seed of Atheism; because if any Life, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation, and Consciousness, may be produced out of dead and senseless mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then can no Philosophy hinder, but all might have been so.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now though I grant the assertion to be true, That no Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy can hinder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet I hope you and others, question the unquestionables, that such an opinion is the seed of Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism. For I think it will be difficult in reason to set down any
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50605:106"/>
Bounds and Limits to an All-Creating, or producing power (which seems rather some seed of Atheism): and while we do not, and hold, we ought not; Let Philosophy tell us simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, or that all might be so, nay must be so; We may safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not unwisely reject her, as vain contending with, and appearing in opposition to Omnipotence. I confess the Author to be endowed with a capacity far exceeding mine, and able to make a more narrow scrutiny into the Soul, than my self; but I had rather be esteemed by you and all men a sober rational man, and withal an humble Christian, than either Learned, or able to contend with him in Philosophy. And therefore having said before on this Subject what I thought convenient, I shall trouble you no further therewith, but bid you, Farewel.</p>

               <p>IF my thoughts of the Soul of Man or Beast, have any ways erred from God's truth, in the manner of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or extraction of them (for in the exercise of that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed gift of charity I think in no wise they have): It will not seem very strange to any sober rational man of another or contrary opinion; if together with human frailty, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the intricate and amusing course of Nature, in the meanest, and seeming plainest work, of the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>From my weak search now and then therein, I stand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, and rest satisfied, there is something more in every the least individual created substance, than ever man was, is, or will be able, or capable wholly to find out. Otherwise I should rather believe them all the Work of chance indeed, than any incomprehensible wise Power: and my weak (and simple it may be) opinion is; that he who traces Nature in her windings and turnings, and do's at any time think he has surely found her, and took her Captive, as it were, do's set up fancy, rather than reason, for Guide and Judge both.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solomon</hi> himself seems to acknowledge, an incapacity of mans nature, to comprehend, or define the Soul of Beast, as well as his own; or to say properly, what it is; but leaves, us a <note n="(a)" place="margin">Eccles. 3.21.</note>

                  <hi>He spake of Trees, from the Cedar that is in Lebanon, even to the Hyssop that springeth out of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50605:107"/>
the wall: and of Beasts</hi>: And we may grant him to be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Philosopher, and best Naturalist, the World ever yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded, and yet think, there were many things in Nature beyond or out of his sight. Some men indeed have fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied to themselves that he had a kind of Universal Knowledg, and was thoroughly acquainted with the nature of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Plants, annd of their own too; and seem much to lament the loss of his Writings and observation in that kind by the reason of the Universality, as well as excellency of the subject: yet I hope I may without offence think, that there are infinite kind of Trees, which <hi>Solomon</hi> never saw, read, or heard of; when besides the many other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys far remote from his; the West-Indies, which have many Plants not found elsewhere, were not known (as we may fairly suppose, notwithstanding what some conjecture about the situation of <hi>Ophir</hi> that way) to that Eastern part of the World in his time. And when any one Nation, nay one single Acre of ground in it may find a man work all his days, we may conceive even those things which <hi>Solomon</hi> saw, read, or spake of, had so much of Mystery, beyond any mans comprehension, lock'd up in their Nature, that there was more in them that he did not know than that he did. And herein I had rather confine <hi>Solomon's</hi> knowledge, and so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand his <hi>speaking of Trees from the Cedar to the hyssop,</hi> with its due limitation (as it ought to be) so as not to comprize all mediums and particulars whatsoever, than bring any particular part of Gods Creation within the bounds and compass of his or any mans understanding. But besides, had it been, as some imagine, that he had thus spoke of all these and their several Natures by a wonderful kind of sagacity, if not Divine Inspiration, yet that discourse of his upon those arguments was never reduced to writing. For if he had wrote of all <hi>Trees, Herbs, Beasts, Fowl, Fishes and Creeping things,</hi> (as the Text reckons them up) we may conclude without any Hyperbole that no subject matter of Paper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would be able to contain all that should be written. Since the number of the last of these, and the least considered, is unaccountable; every body (I will not except Snow or Salt) producing at some time its peculiar Insect, and some bodies several.</p>
               <p>The search into Nature has afforded many pretty inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, various and wonderful helps to man, in this Pilgrimage, physically, and otherwise (thanks be to the God of Nature)
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50605:108"/>
and may do more; yet seldom, or never, by any nice abstract Philosophical inquiry; but rather casually, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly, upon some first humble discreet universal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the things of the World, and then of some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars: And the event and success hereabout, has usually moralized the Fable of <hi>Pan,</hi> who though a rural God, sooner found <hi>Ceres</hi> lost, by accident, than all the more select Gods, by their curious speculation and search. This I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve not to dehort any man from it, but advise it rather, so it be performed with due moderation, and circumspection. That great Book of Nature, which is before us all, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what laid open for us to read, is daily mistaken, and we are apt to forget the first and last letter of it, the Alpha, and the Omega: and adventure upon causes, not only lamely (for that we do at best) but blindly too; and then, 'tis no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, if at last we find we imbrace a Cloud, in the room of a Goddess.</p>
               <p>I am not about here to set down any Catalogue of the Errors, or misconceited sights some men have made into the works of Nature (though it might prove no unprofitable work to have them marked out) but only declare to you my opinion, of the fallibility of this kind of search: And that unless we therefrom by the goodness of a gratious, as well as incomprehensible wise God, see our own ignorance, and thereby somewhat of him, our search is usually vain; and that he who terminates there only, hits the proper mark set before him, whatever he seem to aim or design at, or light on profitably besides.</p>
               <p>'Tis true in the search of Nature, we often for the present light on causes, agreeable and acceptable to our Reason; and tis the peculiar property of human Reason only, to search and find out causes (the words are often confounded, and shewing a Reason, put for shewing a Cause) but no man yet was ever able to extract by his invention, with the present al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of his Reason, such a certain cause of any Work in Nature, as to be imbraced by himself, or others, as altogether indubitable. Fancy indeed, having oft-times somewhat of similitude and likeness with Reason, though not of cogna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with her, is so much quicker sighted, though not clearer sighted, than reason her self; that if it keep the Watch-Tower in the Soul, there shall not be such a thing, as an occult quality in nature; nor any thing so hid, as it cannot easily
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50605:108"/>
discern. No man who has it regent in his Soul, will ever dye the death of <hi>Aristotle</hi>; although a death most likely of fancies first framing, or inventing. It is able to espy not only a Transexion, or Transmutation of Sex, but a Transmutation, or Transition of one reputed species into another, a Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, Metamorphosis, or what it pleases; and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to stand still, as a Spectator in Natures conception, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, will do the office of a Midwife, and frame an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryo to its own model; nay raise more monstrosities, than ever Nature produced from confusion of Principles. But I think reason will as soon espy the defects, and imperfections of that Soul it inhabits; as any other mans, and find that even nature is above its absolute reach.</p>
               <p>After due trial and search into the works of Nature, and perhaps invention or experiment of some setled or constant effect therein, not to rest assured therewith, may be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and perhaps is, the usual disease of an inconstant, wave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, fickle, if not very weak judgment; yet such is the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of secret occult Qualities, and some secret property (words quite cashiered by our hot-spur searchers, as the <hi>Asylum</hi> of Fools or Sluggards) wrapped up in every individual; as is sufficient to beget a Scepticism in any modest sober Soul. I am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed to acknowledge my weakness, and dim-sightedness into the meanest and smallest Plant, or Insect; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that after diligent search into some, and when I thought I had espied the very utmost extent of their Nature, and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; I found my self deceived, even by something casual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or accidentally appearing from them, not ordinary in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the same visible species, so far as I was able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish; from whence I could afford you perhaps some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible stories.</p>
               <p>It may seem a bold adventure of so weak a soul as mine, yet I dare challenge the quickest, clearest, and Learnedst Intellect in the Universal World, to shew me how Nature in her Work, often changes (even as to visible mutation of colours) and to set down any (rationally) undeniable, or incontroula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cause (for instance) of black, or blackness; nay such as I am not able in Reason, to convince him of the uncertainty, and dubiousness thereof.</p>
               <p>That she follows any certain especial course therein, no man will maintain in things of the same species. That not only in Sheep (a thing most common) white of both
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50605:109"/>
Sexes for many descents, produce black, we find; but even Crows, and Daws sometimes do the like, or contrary, and produce white, as I have sometimes seen, and I suppose at this day may be seen at Saint <hi>Iames</hi>'s: And though it might be <hi>rare,</hi> it would not appear a miracle to me, but the Work of Nature, to behold a black Swan. The like I could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate in Fruit both Plums and Cherries, from Stones of another colour'd Fruit set together, in the same bed of Earth, black from white, or red, and white from black. Men may talk of some portion of <hi>Mercury,</hi> Salt, or Sulphur in every Body, adust, torrified, sindged, or the like: but how this adustion works sometime in peculiar forms, and figures, only; let any man tell me. That alteration of colour is at any time an effect of the Imagination, is a thing utterly exploded, and never was other, than the whimsy of some mens imagination, or fancy: surely never any man ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained fair or black Children from the greatest strength of his Imagination. If it were able to work such an Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, we should be all very fair from hope, or black from fear; since Passions very much strengthen, if not create or ingender an Imagination. However, if any such thing were thus wrought in living Creatures, it cannot hold in Plants, which have no Imagination. I know men from their imagination have adventured to set down Causes of Colours, and thought verily they hit on the right; and yet have been corrected by another mans imagination, rather than any solid Reason. <hi>Aristotle</hi> tells us, the cause why there are to be found more delicate and lively colours in the Feathers of Birds, than in Hairs of Beasts, is this: For <hi>that Birds are more within the Raies or Beams of the Sun, that Beasts are.</hi> Another comes and corrects him, and say's he gives a vain and frivolous Cause for it: and tells us, the true and real Cause of it is; <hi>for that the excrementitious moisture of living Creatures, which makes as well the Feathers in Birds as Hair in Beasts, passeth in Birds, through a finer and more delicate streiner, for Feathers pass through Quills, and Hair through Skin.</hi> And surely his true and real Cause, is as little exempt of vanity, unless he had been pleased, or could have shewed us a Cause too, why there should be, so adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, such variety of delicate Colours, about the neck of a Cock-Pheasant, produced from such neighbourly, and similar Streiners; nay three of four delicate Colours, in one
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50605:109"/>
and the same Feather, through one and the same streiner: Or why in a Peacocks train, at such an exact and equal distance from the Body, Nature should produce that cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and delectable Colour, in a peculiar form and shape; and the excrementitious moisture in its streining should fail of its Beauty, not only in its first, and next, but in its furthest, and most remote motion, and produce but a dull Colour, at either end of the Quill. Of the two opinions, or causes, I will give that of <hi>Aristotle</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency; because I find not only in Feathers, but all Flowers, that I have seen and observed; that side of the Feather, Leaf, or Flower, which is most directly within the Suns raies, to be ever most beautiful; and that Eye of <hi>Argus</hi> in the Peacocks train to have but a shadow of its Beauty, or form, on the lower reversed side; And yet doubtless there are most curious Colours to be found, in the very bowels of the Earth; And I for my own part, am neither able to give, nor do I expect further or other substantial cause to be given, of the beauty and splendor in any part of a Creature, than the will of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in his Creation, either for our pleasure in beholding, or admiration (to draw us towards him) in considering the variety, ornament, and excellency of his Works. Neither do I think there is any undeniable cause to be rendred, why Stones (ground to powder) should not nourish as well as bread, if God's <hi>fiat</hi> had been upon them, as Satan seemed to tempt him.</p>
               <p>I do not from hence, go about to perswade you, or any man, to transplant and remove back again, all final causes, particular effects, and fix them only and barely, upon the first original cause of all things. I know there are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior Causes to be given, for the blackness of this very Ink, I write with, and such, as may not only satisfy an ordinary Reason to accept thereof as indubitable; but such, as may frame an ingenious Spirit towards the finding out, some like useful invention. But this I say, there is such an intricacy in the veriest ordinary Works of Nature, to him who looks any thing deeply, and not superficially therein; as is sufficient to shew us, both our own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and folly, and a transcendent Wisdom far above our reach. Upon which, there should be always one Eye fixed, and ready upon all occasions to recall the other, and also all our other senses and faculties, permitted some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50605:110"/>
lawfully to ramble after second Causes. And surely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we set up fancy (as I have said) rather than Reason, for Umpire, it would so be; and we should be forced at last (as to the main) to terminate in some hidden Cause. A Cause in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed not altogether hid from us, but set aside as unregarded; that is, there necessarily is, One only Eternal, immutable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Essence; abundant in Power and Wisdom, through its abundance, shewing it self in variety, in the least of whose Works (being infinite) there is more than humanity can comprehend; which by a Law of Nature, binding all things but it self, continually worketh all in all.</p>
               <p>What defence or Apology shall I then make, first, for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting my thoughts to ramble in quest of the Nature or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of the Soul of Beasts, as well as my own; and next for setting down my opinion thereof, and exposing the same to publick view; thereby seeming to endeavour to impose the same belief on others, which I hold and maintain my self. Why truly, for the first, it might be occasioned, or at least augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from a late private rural life, and a conversation, as I may say, with Beasts as well as men. I cannot say with the Preacher <note n="(a)" place="margin">Eccles. 1.13.</note> 
                  <hi>I gave my heart to seek, and search out by Wisdom, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning all things that are done under Heaven, but</hi> the later part of the verse may not unfitly be applied to me, or others, <hi>This sore travel, hath God given to the Sons of Man, to be exercised therewith,</hi> or <hi>to aflict them,</hi> or, as some Translations, <hi>to humble them thereby:</hi> and that is a good effect, if it happen, of such a search, as well as a ground for search. I neither foresaw, or conjectured any advantage likely to happen, or any ease or quiet to be framed and raised, in my own, or any other Soul from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry or search into that of Beast, unless to keep us from mounting too high with our rationality. We find little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference upon the first view, between our selves and them, in our frame, unless that our Building is weaker than theirs, and from a number of Causes, more subject to corruption than theirs; and our very Intellect as to the upholding or preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Building, exceeds not the Intellect of many Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, nay comes far short of that of some: And as to the Ports and entrances to it (sense) they generally far exceed us. But after we have made some search, perhaps we shall wonder at both, and yet cannot but think and conclude, our own to be of a more noble, and celestial extract, and therefore permanent, and that in this thing only; That we find it capable to search
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50605:110"/>
into the Nature and Original of others, which certainly no other Creature, ever did, or can do into ours.</p>
               <p>Out of meer curious speculation, or to be accounted Wise, or Learned, I can safely (or with a good Conscience) declare unto you, I never searched into, or about the Soul of Beast; but have ever held the opinion of the wise Son of Syrack (without wholly borrowing it from him) good counsel; and here set it down to you in his own words, because I cannot deliver it so well in any of my own, <note n="(b)" place="margin">Ecclus. 3.23, 24.25.</note> 
                  <hi>What God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thee, think upon with reverence, and be not curious in any of his Works, for it is not needful for thee to see with thine eyes the things that are secret. Be not curious in superfluous things, for many things are shewed unto thee, above the capacity of men, the medling with such, hath beguiled many, and an evil opinion hath deceived their judgement.</hi> Which I wish all men did esteem, as good and sound Counsel, as I do my self.</p>
               <p>As to any indeavour to impose my belief on others, in so dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a matter, it do's not appear, by what I have set down, that I have so done; I was not over earnest or eager in it, I delivered no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before as altogether indubitable, neither do I now, further than it receives the confirmation of God's word, by me truly cited: Nay I cannot rationally expect many Converts, because to have such an effect wrought from human writing, there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite an infallible demonstration, such as may work upon mens Senses and Reason together at the same time, which would prove a difficult matter, in a discourse of a Soul's Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, whether of praeexistent matter or not. I think we do well in such discourses as these or of this Nature, if we deliver our selves, or thoughts, in such probable arguments; as that when others first behold them by their proper Intellect, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear so much of seeming bulk, at least in them, that it causes those others to vouchsafe to weigh them by their own Reason, and what I take to be our care and duty further is, that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire the God of truth, so far as there is truth in them, it may appear and be accepted of others, and so received into their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, which Rule, I hope, I have not transgressed.</p>

               <head>EPIST. V. Wherein he further illustrates the inherent or native Power, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominancy of the affections, above other faculties of the Soul; but more particularly treats of the Imagination, its deception, its sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the place of Reason in us, our miseries thereby, and the remedies against its Delusion.</head>
               <p>THE Imagination or invention is reckoned by some as part of the Intellect, and so a more noble faculty of the Soul: And being placed in so high an Orb, it is then apt to contemn the affections, ranking them with those of Brutes, because perhaps it hath rendred them a like disposed and inclined as they. Wherein it may be resembled to some Steward, that having helped to debauch his Lord and Master, presently thinks the whole power as well as superintendency to rest solely in himself. But how high soever the Imagination may mount in conceit, yet Reason doth often correct it, and discovers that some Affection (how covertly, latently, or disguisedly soever) doth set it on work, and when it is roving and soaring throws out some lure that draws it down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
               <p>Man indeed is not generally prone and ready to espy the predominancy of his own Affections above his Intellect, but it is evident in the observation we make upon others; In dealing with whom, the first and chief enquiry is usually, not what he is capable to apprehend or judge of the case, but how he is or probably may stand affected; whence it comes to pass that it is almost the constant evil fate of Princes and great men to have so much of food or Physick administred to that part of the Soul beyond any other, as if it were granted on all hands, that the Affections were the powerful part of the Soul, and the Intellect but an <hi>ignis fatuus</hi> drove along before them, a weak light at best, and such as might be easily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scured. So true is it that how noble faculties soever Reason and Invention, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are, and how truly soever they move and point, yet they are mostly set on work and as it were direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their course by things of an inferiour Nature; being herein like a curious Clock, whose motion is carried on by the force of Leaden weights: And it is to be feared, that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50605:111"/>
without some such kind of metal, first drawing the lines of our affections, there would remain a very faint kind of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the intellectual faculties, and we should have amongst us very few Famous Divines, Physicians, or Lawyers, but had need be all, naturally pious, heathful, and peaceable. I would fain have any one shew me, how he so much as happens (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less through some special Motion from above) to think on good or discern, or judge of it, without some kind of affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion as it were moving or strugling within; or what his other faculties would work for, if his Affections were laid aside or discarded? what would they gratify and please, since them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves they cannot unless in conjunction with other? for they are in the Soul, like the nobler parts in the Body, void of sense, yet feeding the craving appetite of more sensible parts, by which we apparently move.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plato,</hi> I think not improperly, calls desire or concupiscence in us, <hi>The Horse of the mind</hi>; Whatsoever Rider may be set upon it, or whatsoever reins are laid over it, or whatsoever power there is, that holds those reins, and sometimes restrains, or guides, and directs that Beasts (which term we sometimes put upon the Affections) we may not improperly say; The original of such joint, or complicated Motion, is from that Horse.</p>
               <p>I have read of some, who having had their Children taken from them, very young, upon their approach to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence many years after unknown, have had a secret joy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themselves, without the least seeming precedent imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their being such; I cannot say, how much of truth there may be in the affirmation, but if there be, then that blind faculty of the Soul (as we sometimes term Affection) may move without the precedent assistance of its fellow faculties; And, it would seem no wonder to me, if, the imagination set on work thereupon, after some search, should at length pitch upon some such cause, but certainly the imagination more or less, must necessarily be set on work therein.</p>
               <p>The two who journied to <hi>Emaus,</hi> mention the burning of their hearts within them, upon our Saviours talking to them, without the least precedent imagination, that I can collect, that it was he who talked with them; Nay the Text says their eyes were holden (and sense is the ordinary inlet upon which the Imagination presents to the Affections) That they should not know him; And he calls them Fools, and <note n="(a)" place="margin">Luke 24.25.</note> 
                  <hi>slow
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50605:112"/>
of heart to believe,</hi> thereupon; As if belief might arise from the motion of the heart, without the precedent work of the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from sense. And truly Sir, since I am verily (I hope) perswaded; That every faculty in mans Soul, is Divine, and different from that of Beast, which work only from sense; I do not, or can rationally think that the Affections motion depends solely upon the Imagination's presentation, but that the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination is often irritated upon the Affections first Motion or strugling; or otherwise, through the good will and pleasure of some insensible power, immediately working in us, the one, or the other is strangely set on work.</p>
               <p>I must confess of Beasts, I do think, that Sense being the only port, and inlet of the Soul, and a thing through which every object makes its stroke, the first Spiritual Motion is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily upon the Imagination; Nay, that Imagination is no other in them, than some more refined curious part, or quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tessence of the Blood, lodged immediately over those doors and cells of the Body, which raises and creates some such kind of thing, as will, and affections in them, rather than inclines any will or affection in them before created, or inspired; Because we never find such kind of Motion in them, as either to affect, or will, above the reach of sense, or contrary to sense; But that through sense only from the Imagination, there is raised in them an appetite to or aversion from such and such object; And thereupon it is, that they are neither misled, or misguided by their Imagination, neither is there any great or lasting Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease of the mind, but what raised through sense only may be soon allayed, and quieted therefrom.</p>
               <p>First their Imagination misleads or misguides them not, for having its dependance only thereon, and working thereafter, and not capable to work upon the impulse of any thing, but what, as of it self, penetrates through Sense; It receives every object in its more proper exact Nature, Figure and Form, than ours; And it being most certain, that their sense is generally more open and clear to receive, than ours; they mistake not, or misapprehend not, as we do. Hence it is, that they are seldom mistaken in the face of the Heavens, in which we are so often of our selves deceived; and that our Prognostick from their sense, and their motion, and contrivance thereupon, is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally truer, than what we can make from our own. The hastning home of that little Creature, the Bee, by multitudes into their Hives, is a more infallible sign of an ensuing storm,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50605:112"/>
than we are able to espy by the best help of our intellectual faculties (sometimes otherwise imployed than from sense) through a weak and disturbed sense, and which the strange work thereof does not seldom disturb.</p>
               <p>Indeed hence it is, that a Beast (if not stopped by force, or by some more pleasing Imagination raised from present sense) is able of it self, which man cannot do, to return to its anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent place of abode at a great distance, how strangely soever, or through what mazes soever, conveyed from thence. And we may observe in its ordinary motion, it will return more directly, I may say more knowingly, by the paths it went and came, than the wisest of men; nay, a Fool will do this, much better than a Wise man, because, though his Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be subject to be recalled from attendance on Objects offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves through present sense, and imployed on others by some sordid affection, yet it is generally obedient to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent sense, and is not so much in subjection to reason, as to assist that faculty, or taken up by that, in help of revolving, or weighing of things past or future, and the causes thereof.</p>
               <p>I could never yet collect from the narrowest observation I could make, any power or ability in Beast to revolve a thing in the mind, without the help or introduction of present sense; no nor any affection raised in them to work, or recall the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination from its present work, without its help. I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, lust, or itching of the flesh, or rather appetite, a thing below an affection, and inherent in Plants, may, and does seem to recall their Imagination in them sometimes; and with a neglect of present sense, set it on work, so as to contrive for their prey or food, or the like: But for any Affection, of it self an affection, to do it, I cannot observe. Sense shews the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male only, the product of her body, and thereupon the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination is stirred to raise and create a kind of affection to it, which we call love; so as in defence thereof, anger may be kindled, and in deprivation thereof, sorrow may arise; but the Imagination works for neither of these of themselves, nor do they continue to be, as I conceive, longer than some Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject makes the impulse through sense: And therefore we shall observe, there is no bleating or lowing, but from bleating and lowing, or the approach and beholding again the place where they usually fed or nourished their young, or the like; stop or divert that, and their love, or sorrow, is at an end. <hi>Darius</hi> his Horse, as I have mentioned, could neigh when he
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50605:113"/>
beheld the place where his lust was first raised; but I question much, when the impress the Imagination has made in such Creature, is once wiped away for the present, through some new introduction of sense; whether it can be raised again, without the fresh stroke of some Object relating thereto, through sense; Or, whether the Horse were capable to revolve that act in his mind at any time, without such means to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce or raise a thought.</p>
               <p>Now if the Imagination in Beast, work only immediately upon Senses introduction, (as we have reason to conceive it does) and that thereupon their affections are raised only; their Affection necessarily attending their Imagination, changes according to the change of Objects through Sense. For what is created or raised, by and through that merely, may be fully satisfied through that only; neither can there be ease or disease, pleasure or displeasure in the Soul, longer than Sense affords being to such Affection; and this I think to be the case of Beasts, because we never see them disquieted long, or above measure, nor refusing any grateful Object, if some disease of the body resist it not, we observe not their Imagination heightened by their lust, nor their lust inflamed or raised from their Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but at such time only as Objects offer themselves through Sense; and the one abstracted, the other seem to vanish. And surely were our degenerate lust and affections of the same ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, it were impossible for us to be hurried away to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of any vile or base passion, as to imploy our thoughts nights and days about a meaner, or more sordid Object, than Sense it self usually affords every moment.</p>
               <p>But Affection in us is of another extract, able to desire and imbrace what Sense cannot afford; our Imagination of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther capacity and reach, penetrable, and malleable, as I may say, otherwise than by sensible Objects; Our Will, and all other our animal Faculties, subject to supernatural influences; and that is the reason there is such daily combat between them, and sometimes such lasting agony. For the Imagination rowsed and called upon, as it were, from divers and sundry quarters, and not able through Sense, to work so as to satisfie one single affection; It sometimes opposes Sense, and raises a thousand <hi>Chimaera's,</hi> to the astonishment and amazement of it self, to the conclusion and distraction of the Affections, and to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet of the whole Soul; so as, whatsoever original cause we impute elsewhere, the present apparent cause of our disease,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50605:113"/>
we may rightly impute to the Imagination; and the rectifying thereof must needs be the readiest way towards a cure, which I shall endeavour to speak of in the end of my following Discourse.</p>
               <p>Do we not find our Imagination allured or inticed to work from the restless strugling of some affection? Do we not again find it recalled by Reason, arrested by our Will, wrested at length by some foreign power from subjection to either; and forced to work, as we observe by consequence, in obedience to some eternal decree, leading all the others as captives? And all this while Sense (one and the same in all men) might seem to offer it other subject matter for its present work. Do we not, or may we not observe in our selves, at special seasons, some mounting in desire to imbrace, or lay hold on somewhat above the reach of Sense? And would we not our Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could invent, or find out some such thing? Is it not thereupon set on work? And, though it cannot fully compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend mere insensible things by any investigation, yet is able to imagin or conceive, there is something more glorious, more pure, more perfect, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that it can conceive, whereby the Affections are a little quieted for the present, and rest in a kind of hope; and to this, Reason freely consenting, there is begat a kind of faith.</p>
               <p>I would fain know, how it were possible our own thoughts should be set on work, in relation to what others thought of us, or in what state we were in the eye of any righteous all-knowing Judg, or argue and weigh, or will in relation thereto, or be concerned or troubled thereabout, with fear, or dread, or ioy; if sense were the only inlet to the Soul? I am sure it cannot hurt us at present, but from our desire to know, and our imagination's presentation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon; so as, what our Imagination frames, must be chiefly the cause of our disquiet, or disease of mind, if any happen. Indeed, as it is sometimes the window by which Heavenly light is admitted, so it often proves the Postern-door, by which some evil spirit sliely enters, and the Key thereof is certainly some corrupt affection. It is most subject to be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about by every wind from within, and from without, most subject to be deluded, and delude; and since our Happiness here seems to depend very much upon its work, we will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to treat of it here, a little more particularly than we
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:50605:114"/>
have done, either of it self, or in conjunction with some other faculty of the Soul.</p>
               <p>Indeed the several faculties of the Soul seem not many in number, yet the Soul like some instrument of very few strings, is capable to render such innumerable various sounds, as are able to confound us in going about to distinguish them. This we own upon trial, to be the admirable work of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident Creator and Governour, and judg it impossible to set any certain rules or bounds in its manner of work, or so much as to fathom or know our own. Yet this I think, the sweet harmony, or jarring discordance in this wonderful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, in relation to our selves, and whether it renders a sound sweet and pleasant, or harsh and grating, consists very much, as I conceive, from the high, or low, or even straining that one string thereof in it, the Imagination.</p>
               <p>The Imagination is a most strange faculty, and able to confound us, and put us to a stand, or a maze, while we reflect on it. 'Tis that various, and sometimes false light, which puts the colours of good upon evil, and evil upon good: 'Tis that strange resounding echo to the affections, that renders their cry double and louder. 'Tis that, which called upon by one affection to its help and assistance, often raises, and leads with it a thousand furies to disquiet us. And if we may affirm, as I think we truly may, that the heat of the affections sometimes causes its work so also; It is that bellows which increases their natural heat double and treble, and (driving them from their proper Object) inflames them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all degree and measure, to their utter destruction, and confusion in the end.</p>
               <p>I deny not, but that Imagination in man continually and necessarily working, is capable to work from divers causes; it is diverted, or called upon, and imployed by various Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects minutely through Sense, as we observe; How else could we remember (which is but an impress left in the Imagination) for any time, what we daily hear and see? And when those windows of the Body seem shut up, 'tis often imployed upon such Objects as it formerly received thereby. But I cannot but think, that its work generally tends to the satisfying or feeding some affection, not affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of its own creating from Sense, as in Beast, but some affection of equal extraction with it self; originally pure and undefiled, but now corrupt and depraved by its work
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:50605:114"/>
through the slie insinuation or delusion of some evil Spirit; and that from Sense alone, the one nor the other, nor both together, could create in our soul those diseases we find, and I may say, often see and feel above the Beasts which perish.</p>
               <p>This affection in us, how pure soever, or howsoever debauched, is the thing ever chiefly aimed at in all addresses to the Soul, as I have touched already, and therefore is Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory defined to be nothing else, but a <hi>dextrous application, to the affections and passions of men;</hi> which received Tenet, is sufficient to demonstrate, what faculty we generally give the preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to, and esteem for most powerful in the Soul; I am not about to correct the definition, though methinks, since there are faculties in the Soul, capable of instruction (which the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections properly are not) as well as agitation, or rowsing up, every application should principally tend, and aim thither, and he be esteemed the best <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Optimus est enim Orator, qui dicendo, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosaudientium, &amp; docet, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectat, &amp; permo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet, docere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitum est, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lèctare honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium, permove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re necessarium.</hi>
                  </note> Orator, who rather indeavours to inform truly, than delight and please; yet since most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is and indubitable, that there is no approach or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of one human Soul or Spirit unto another, but through the Organs of sense, by the Imagination into the Affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions (So as to hit, and wound or heal them, men necessarily glance upon the Imagination by the way, and tis that which certainly gives them an edge or dulls them) Men should be careful, that faculty be not first deluded to the deception of the other, nor that we suffer men to delude our affections through our Imagination barely, Reason not at all, or not well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted.</p>
               <p>That the Imagination is a deceitful faculty, we need not Scripture to declare to us, as it does of the heart; daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience sufficiently informs us as much. But above all, its leiger demain in supplying the place of Reason to the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, is the greatest and most considerable fallacy thereof, and most carefully to be avoided. We commonly affirm, it supplies the place of reason in Beasts; but if we look narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into our selves and them, As we find them void of Reason, and incapable to argue within themselves; so we should find that faculty in them, most exactly and curiously, exquisitely, and admirably framing and contriving in obedience to the strokes it receives through sense, and in us only to supply the place of Reason.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:50605:115"/>And how happens it or comes it to pass, that it supplies the place of Reason, that more than ordinary divine gift in us? Why thus; Reason, which is the ground Work of Faith, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it accept of things invisible as true to create a belief (and indeed a belief properly is not without it) yet never directly opposes sense, whereby there is a more apparent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction in the Soul, for then it were not Reason (a thing of it self not deceivable) nor the Spiritual gift of that God, who gives us leave to make use of our Senses thereby: the Devil, or man, cannot hurt us through that faculty alone, or chiefly. But the Imagination in man, though of divine extraction, and given as subservient to Reason, is capable of a kind of exaltation, in direct opposition to sense, and that, through the inflammation of human affection, equally divine, and not satisfiable through sense. So as, if once the Affections become grievously wounded through sense, or otherwise, they do as it were enforce the Imagination to satisfy them for the present with a bare imaginary belief, and therefore are the affections always chiefly aimed at, and this is that which the World applauds as a dextrous application; when they are thus hit, to the exaltation of the Imagination, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression or clouding of Reason; or if you please in short, when an imaginary or fictitious belief is created in the Soul.</p>
               <p>This has been found out, as the surest, and most ready way by all pretenders to Religion, in all ages, to set up fancy for predominant, by blowing through it upon some affection, which of it self is apt to recoil and inflame the Imagination, to the dazling of Reason in conjunction with it. Passions of all kinds shall be assaulted, Pride, and vain-glory, as well as love; and if a belief can be effected no otherwise, fear must be raised, and that that fear may stand its ground, and inflame the Imagination to some height, God, whom we ought to serve in fear, must be brought in as a party, either constantly ruling in his (so called) infallible Church; or else new inspiring some amongst us by his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Spirit, which we ought to hearken to, and obey. The fallibility of either which position, or assertion, is plain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and common Reason would soon espy the delusion, if she were free and at liberty, not confounded through fear of, I know not what, that 'tis absolutely necessary for men to believe as the Church do's, or as new gifted or inspired
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50605:115"/>
men shall teach them, and thereby the Imagination is hurried to supply the place thereof.</p>
               <p>I dare appeal to the soberest, and greatest rational Doctors of the Romish Church (Passion already raised against us somewhat cooled, the Imagination a little quieted, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son a little free) whether, the general, universal belief (yet I do not think they all believe what they affirm, maintain or Preach) of their Transubstantiation, Miracles, Fables, and Legends, were not first raised, and be not yet supported by the strength of Imagination only, or chiefly; And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they do not think, their Religion, or rather their Romish Church would soon fall to the ground, if mens Affections were left quiet to themselves, that working faculty, the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, a little rectified, and freedom allowed men to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise their Reason without imaginary danger.</p>
               <p>I would neither offend God, or them, or any one else, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and advisedly by questions and doubts; But in that grand point of Transubstantiation, or the real Presence, wherein, or whereabout we so much differ; I beseech them to declare, not only how it comes to pass, but how any real belief thereof can at any time be effected in the Soul; since Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son it self, more prone to accept and allow of things as they are represented through our own sense that otherwise, at first rejects it, and cannot be easily convinced of the contrary, till it be convinced of the very fallacy of that glass of sense in us.</p>
               <p>As to the thing it self, I know they will readily alledge, that there is a miraculous, and wonderful suddain change, through Gods omnipotent power, of the Bread into Flesh, upon the words of the Priest; And this I readily grant, if there be any such change at all, and so far I agree with in belief: But, belief it self, or to believe it so, or so done, seems to me to be an human act, a voluntary consent of the mind: And surely they will never affirm, their own belief thereof miraculously effected, nor that ours must so be, by the free grace, or necessary impulse of the same eternal Power; If they do, I will answer them, it is then vain and idle for them, once to think to convince any man of the truth and reality thereof, by human argument, and that it is cruelty, as well as folly to indeavour or imagin to do it by fire and Fagot; their Prayers then to that Power, were the better, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and safer way.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:50605:116"/>If they say, it may be effected, through the assent of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, ever submitting, and bound to submit to Gods express word, whatever sense introduce in the Soul to the contrary: Then let them shew that express word of conversion of the Bread into Flesh; But if they would perswade our Reason, in opposition to sense, to accept it as true, and real; Let us see how they can make out this fallacy of sense, without setting up our Imagination, as regent in the Soul, to the suppression of Reason.</p>
               <p>I confess a mans Reason may naturally submit, to accept of those truths sense cannot penetrate, or it self comprehend, but it can never submit from any human impulse to accept or allow of any thing, clear contrary to the demonstration of sense, and what from thence might be comprehended of the Soul, without a great depravation of the Imagination to blind it, and lead it captive. And therefore while we retain our Reason, free and at liberty, we may wonder, with a kind of laughter, why these men should indeavour to prove to us a real Presence, by clean contrary ways to our Saviour himself: And bid us distrust our sense, and elevate our Imagination, and believe contrary to that inlet, by which, He, who best knew the safest way, would, that belief should be raised or let in to the Soul, and was the greatest confirmation of the absent Apostles Faith.</p>
               <p>Every outward apparition to the Soul, if there be no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, or defect in the Organ by which it is let in (though it pleases or displeases not alike by Reason of our lapse and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections disorder) is ever one and the same to all men, or else we must accuse our great God and Creator of fallacy, which God forbid! And thereupon I think it impossible in Nature, for Reason, which is his immediate gift, and his Vicegerent in our Soul, and able to judge a defect or no defect in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, to move of it self in a direct opposition to that apparency. But that it must be some other faculty in our new diseased and distempered Soul from our first lapse, that, as it were, forces its consent; Or rather falsly represents through some distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance and inflamation of affection, and so raising and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it self an Idea, which is not, so that we might well discard the opinion of <hi>deceptio visus</hi> in most cases, and impute our fallacy to our own opinions, that is our imagination.</p>
               <p>Now how comes this faculty, which is imployed and works for the enlightning of the whole Soul, to delude and deceive
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50605:116"/>
us so often? Why truly, not of it self barely and simply, as I said (it is if well imployed even about sensible things, an admirable and wonderful searcher and Diver after truth, from the very work whereof, how weakly soever we are able to judge of it, we are apt to become proud as well as self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited) but from the restless importunity and craving of the Affections, and the fumes proceeding from thence, towards the present allaying whereof, it is now and then as it were almost forced on the suddain to supply the place of Reason (since the Affections have no immediate recourse to Reason) and sense too, and palliate Reason to contradict present sense, and raise a seeming sense of what is not, to delude Reason, become Judge as well as Juror, pass final sentence, as well as indict, which is indeed the sole office of a more noble, though a more quiet, that we say not a more lazy, faculty in us.</p>
               <p>I am somewhat assured, the most Ingenious of that party, will not be able to deny, but that strength of Imagination (ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than strength of Reason) inflated through passion, has brought them in many, if not the greatest number of prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes in that belief. Perhaps they will say, Credulity, that is a belief without due examination, is an Epidemical disease in every Soul, and that the strength of Imagination backed with passion, has in some of us, created a belief of things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together as (rationally) incredible. I must confess I think it has, and, owning as much, wish we were all so far undeceived, and those mists ingendred between our Affections and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, so far dispelled, as that we might in these our days, behold the things which belong to our present, as well as fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture peace; and that we might so far behold each other in charity, as not so fight and quarrel about our different beliefs, and colourably set up Reason in the case, when in truth they are Affections, one or two, and perhaps none of the best, Pride and Covetousness in us, which with the assistance of the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination contend on each side, which of us shall reign or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineer over the other.</p>
               <p>I intended not when I first reflected on the Imagination, and the delusion thereof from corrupted passion, to bring in Religion as the subject matter or Theme, I meant only to speak of it, in reference to moral delusion, apparent enough in most cases of our life and action, and how far reason in us, if well exercised, might prevent it, and to that I return. Truly, this restless busy and prouling faculty in us, the Imagination,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50605:117"/>
which flees from us like our shadow, while we pursue it, and to espy its frauds, endeavour to arrest and lay hold on it; was certainly given us for good, and not only in observance of Sense, but in obedience and subjection to Reason; and it seems to continue so in most of us, until we begin seriously to make use of our Reason, to weigh and consider some of the Imagination's past devices, and then we observe its fallacy: That it is often like to some kind of Subjects, which outwardly pretend the advancement of their Sovereign's power, and will not seem directly to resist his commands, as some of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects (that is the Affections) do; yet complying with those Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects under hand, and enticing them to Rebellion, makes use of him as a glorious Cypher, that under colour of him they may more easily move, and more safely and quietly do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineer.</p>
               <p>This is the way of the Imagination, and when it has thus done, that is, that it hath colourably set up Reason, and as it were deceived the affections, baffled them, and seemingly master'd them, and brought them to its beck, as it thinks; that it hath taken freedom from the Will, and subdued all in thought; It becomes at variance with it self, in distrust of it self, and so brought to amazement and confusion, is at length made a captive and slave to the meanest, basest and most sordid rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious affection, perhaps envy, or hatred, perhaps brutish lust, perhaps despair, and this to the overthrow and utter destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of reason in the end. And if this be the usual result of its treachery and fraud; and it may be prevented, why should it not be prevented? We have reason in us to do it you'l say; I say so too, but how it will be thereby effected is questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable.</p>
               <p>Truly Reason in the beginning, and when she first comes to maturity, if she means to reign well and safely, must make use of <hi>Machiavel</hi>'s Maxim of division amongst her Subjects, especially the Imagination, and some particular affections, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted perhaps before she had any strength: For if they once agree, as it were to trust each other, they will soon undermine her power, or at least render it useless: And therefore Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son should, as it were, sow jealousie between them, satisfie the Imagination, that some corrupt affection set it idlely on work, and shew the Affections, that the Imagination labours for them in vain; it should represent to each what drudges they often make of each other, to their several disease and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet:
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50605:117"/>
Thus it should raise a kind of suspition of each other, and satisfie the whole Soul as it were in conference sometime; that neither of them is to be trusted, or relyed upon without her authority, and mature and deliberate allowance; that they are both deceitful and treacherous, and strive as it were to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude and supplant each other by false presents, or false imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And surely, whoever has his reason any whit clear, free, and at liberty, will quickly see the dangerous consequence of the reliance of these faculties on each other. For if ever their familiar intercourse, and running long together without stop or stay, as I may say, and due examination of the subject-matter, do bring peace to the whole Soul in the end; I never yet had any reason in me, or understood their motion.</p>
               <p>But before I go about to talk of the Imagination and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in conjunction together, and a remedy to prevent their united operation to our disquiet, and perhaps final destruction: I shall endeavour to lay open and plain, an error or two, as I conceive, we constantly retain in point of opinion.</p>
               <p>First, That though our Imagination work and contrive me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodically, and orderly, with a kind of connexion and cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of things, as if it had the present assistance of Reason, as we conceive, yet in many such cases it has not, but such its work, (notwithstanding the method aforesaid) connexion, or coherence, is without the allowance or approbation of Reason, nay in direct opposition sometimes to true and perfect Reason, and is by the impulse of some kind of affection with the assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance perhaps of an evil spirit.</p>
               <p>Next, That though it sometimes so work, without the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse of any evil affection, or the suggestion of Satan; yet it is ever accompanied and attended, and stirred and moved with some kind of affection, how inconsiderable or slight so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; and if it do not directly aim at the advancement of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, Truth, Justice, or the like; it has not the concurrence or approbation of Reason, whatsoever it may seem to have.</p>
               <p>'Tis a strange thing, methinks, that men should falsly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign that Divine and Heavenly gift in us, and impute our greatest faults to it, make that which was given us to direct us in sobriety, righteousness and godliness, to be the cause of our exceeding Beasts in all voluptuousness, debauchery, wrong, deceit, falshood, and profaneness; that men should accuse that of actual guilt, of which it is not guilty, or capable to be guilty;
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:50605:118"/>
nor is blamable or culpable in any case, but of sloth, negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence or inadvertency. That we could neither lye, nor dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, nor cheat handsomely and cleverly, without being ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; nay, men of strong reason; when 'tis the very office of Reason to render all falshood, fraud and deceit, how cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly soever hatched in the Imagination by the brooding of some affection, detestable and abominable to the whole Soul. Nay, that some men should tell us, that to every Politick contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance in us, Reason is so aiding and assisting, that without it, and depth of judgment, we could not contrive a false story (perhaps affirm a false story of anothers contrivance) with any coherence or connexion; and therefore if we can observe in a man any thing of collateral folly, simplicity or weakness, we must believe his allegation as grounded upon truth. Surely such assertion with what flourish soever of words, was not from the suggestion, or allowance of Reason, but the bare fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Imagination towards the gratifying some ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious if not covetous desire; and their own reason may one day tell them so.</p>
               <p>Indeed I have heard of a late good Penitent (who therein could have no design) that he should on his death-bed accuse and condemn himself with this kind of Exclamation: <hi>O that his reason which God had given him in some degree and measure above others, should be exercised and imployed in deriding and vilifying the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of his Being, and him who gave it!</hi> I must take leave to say, it was his invention only (a thing wherein few men seemed to exceed or excell him) with the impulse of some sprightly pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion that did it, not his Reason; but that the checks he confesses sometimes to have felt against that course, was (through Gods grace) his Reason only.</p>
               <p>That roving, quick, and lively fancy of his, had it been obedient to Reason, that is, that had there been made some search and enquiry into that kind of involuntary check, that kind of confusion in it self on the sudden, notwithstanding the outward applause it received through Sense, might have wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about as we say, seen the sordid ugly visage of lust, and the consequent of its rage, beheld the luster and admirable beauty of a chaste and virtuous life, the benefit and advantage from thence, as well here, as hereafter, raised zeal, and pure love again in the Soul, and became the garnisher thereof, with rare and all manner of delightful invention: But running its own course, as we say, it approves its past motion, supplies the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50605:118"/>
place of reason, and continuing that intimacy and familiarity it had got with corrupt affection, was made at length the very Slave and drudg of lust.</p>
               <p>'Tis our misery by a fatal kind of consequence, that that faculty in us is so capable to supply the place of reason; for that it is (though given subservient to reason, and is of equal Divine extraction with it) and is (as our affections) able to work against, nay contrary to Sense, and capable of influence from above, and subject to the delusion of infernal power: but of that more in the end.</p>
               <p>'Tis Passion and Imagination in conjunction together, by which we err, and commit the most foul and enormous crimes, how cunning or advisedly soever we commit them; and not Reason and Imagination in conjunction. Or rather, it is from Imagination attended with some kind of passion in rebellion to Reason. I do not observe our Law (grounded upon Reason as we say) to accuse Reason in any case, or to make any aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of rationality in us, at the time of the fact (although it excuses a man if he be wholly and totally deprived of Reason) we have <hi>instigatione diabolicâ seductus</hi>; we have <hi>imaginatus est,</hi> thereupon we lay the fact in some cases to be done <hi>ex malitia praecogitata,</hi> malice forethought (and which I think is ill transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>malice prepenced,</hi> for there is no due weighing of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) as if malice that sometimes subtle thing, were hatched in and brought forth by the Imagination.</p>
               <p>Now for this thing <hi>Malice, improbitas,</hi> or <hi>vitiositas,</hi> an evil habit of mind, for so I take the meaning of it to be, a thing no ways natural in man, we bring it not into the World with us, and therefore it is perhaps that St. <hi>Paul</hi> bids us <note n="(a)" place="margin">1 Cor. 14.20.</note>, <hi>Be chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in malice.</hi> We can discover or discern no such thing in Beasts; there is in them anger, and a kind of revenge too, raised by the Imagination from sensible danger, loss, hurt, or the like, but nothing continuing in them like a passion from concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved damage or prejudice only, without the assistance of present Sense, nor when Sense seems to afford grounds for the product of love or kindness (things of contrary quality) as it happens sometimes in man: Now in man it arising through a kind of mature deliberation, and not being on the sudden, or of short continuance, like other Passions; (although St. <note n="(b)" place="margin">Ephes. 4.31. Col. 3.8.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul,</hi> and St. <note n="(c)" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> both do link it with passion) I will not so call it, and the rather because a Learned Orator has affirmed, That passionate men are not malicious: But I will impute it to be
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50605:119"/>
a strange effect of humane Imagination only, or chiefly, and begat thereby, as it is restless and active, and <note n="(d)" place="margin">What will not Malice invent?</note> Proverbially inventive. And withal, I will readily grant, that he in whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it is, or harbours, is a man of weak reason; because he thus permits this Prodigy or Monster in Nature to inhabit his Soul; but yet I continue to think, (being begat by humane Imagination which can supply the place of reason as I have said) it may work with some coherence and connexion, and with the help of Satan and his Emissaries palliate truth.</p>
               <p>This <hi>superfluity of naughtiness,</hi> so termed, I conceive by Saint <note n="(e)" place="margin">Jam. 1.21.</note> 
                  <hi>Iames,</hi> once bred or raised in the soul, will never let the Imagination be idle, or attend on any thing else; and then 'twould be strange if humane Imagination, or invention thus imployed, though in opposition to reason, should not invent formally, and with some coherence. But besides this, there are common evil inherent affections in the nature of man, able to set the Imagination so on work as may deceive us, and make us think 'tis Reason that answers their call at our devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when indeed 'tis no other than a restless, quick, and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly working Imagination rowsed from them. We do esteem him a man of quick and brave parts, who seems to have a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over his Imagination, can at any time recall it to work, as it were at his pleasure; and this we say is strength of Reason: But I do not always look upon a man as the more rational therefore, or that it is his Reason only, or chiefly, by which he seems enabled so to do. <hi>Caesar</hi> we say, was a man of quick Parts; and how was he so? why, his ambition was naturally great; and again greatly inflamed by a clear and roving Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and those two in conjunction together, ready to serve each other upon every turn, might make us admire him. But I cannot well judg his Reason to be greater than others, or actually to work in conjunction with those other faculties, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less in such particular cases in which he duely observed Justice, or out of true compassion shewed and performed Mercy. He could not but be sometimes convinced in reason (for we'll not suppose the Spirit or Grace to work in him) that the Wars he made, the trouble and disturbance he raised in the World were injurious and unrighteous; and therefore his invention in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance thereof wrought in opposition to his Reason. I do not think he was deprived of Reason, or his Reason clouded so far, but that if he could have attained his aims and designs, his ambitious ends and purposes without injury or wrong to any,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50605:119"/>
he would rather have done it that way; but contriving to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy his ambition, <hi>per fas &amp; nefas,</hi> as we say, I say his Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, inflamed and hurried by his ambition, only supplied the place of Reason in all its contrivances.</p>
               <p>I my self have sometimes designed, and contrived (as many others have done) by all lawful ways and means, the advancement of my estate, and the settlement thereof in my name and family; I have invented, and found out perhaps, as probable a worldly method for the doing thereof, as another: My Imagination has brought and laid down before me, all the letts and impediments that might seem to hinder and obstruct; It has invented means to avoid them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet since my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son has at particular times informed me of the vanity thereof, the certainty of Death, the mutability of all human things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I will not impute my contrivance to Reason, and lay the fault on that, which disallowed the work: but to Imagination rather from some restless affection, which it indeavoured to gratify, so far as 'twas able, and only supplied the place of Reason, to make me strongly think, rather than firmly believe, the matter feazible by man alone.</p>
               <p>Surely, there is something more, in Reason, or Reason is somewhat more, than we are yet generally aware of. 'Tis, as I have touched, the thing, by which we are in some measure enabled, to weigh and distinguish good from evil, and evil from good, right from wrong, and truth from falshood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The chief and principal ingredient of that thing we call Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, (however frequently those who most pretend Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, make least use of it, and least exercise it) an inherent native light in mans Soul (not excluded from Heathens) and not the Spirit, we Christians so much talk of from Scripture promises. A gift, which whosoever observes, makes use of, and obeys, procures to himself peace, and quiet of mind. For, unless some disturbance in him do arise, as by the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of bodily danger, hurt, or loss, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> through present sense, which is ever of short continuance, and no longer than sense is open to it; Observance thereof, and obedience to it, is ever necessarily, and consequently attended with joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
               <p>'Tis not, as I conceive, the man of quick, nimble, exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site or excellent parts (as we term him) but the good man we so call, who, we may most properly say, is the great ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional man, or the man of Reason; We shall find a sound
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50605:120"/>
Reason and quick invention, sometimes working together in one Soul; But the quick or methodical work of the second, do's not always denote the actual assistance of the first; quick invention, denotes often, sprightly, lively, vigorous, and active passions, and such passion (not forward and testy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours) is usually attended with a quick, and well contriving invention, and they work together upon each others motion, call, or notice, to astonishment or admiration (even to the blinding sometimes of a strong Reason) but not always that which is good; Nay often, especially through that flexible member of ours the Tongue, that which is evil; And, that Trumpet of a rational Soul only, given us to make a true sound, from the invention only, is made to render a false one.</p>
               <p>Reason that Divine gift, properly so called, and yet distinct from the Spirit, never was the occasion of falshood, never wrought injustice and damage to any man; Nor of it self (unless from our neglect of its monitions) became of evil consequence to any. Argument, or <hi>ratiocination</hi> as some men call it, has, but I do not take every seeming manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, every Logical dispute, or Rhetorical flourish to be at any time so much the proper effect of Reason, as of invention, or Imagination. Perhaps that one word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> signifying both Speech, and Reason, has not only made young Sophisters mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake themselves for the rational men, but deceived the World into a plausible opinion of them, and begat a Faith of many things, contrary to Sense, and Experience, the best and trustiest Hand-maids Reason has in the Soul. We have coined a multitude of English words from thence, ending in <hi>logy,</hi> to signify our rationality, as, <hi>Astrology</hi> to be a knowledg of the effect of the Stars, <hi>Theology</hi> a dispute, or dissertation of God, or things Divine, <hi>Analogy</hi> a comparing of things together, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology</hi> rendring of a cause or reason, and the like. When God knows how little of true Reason is made use of in relation thereto, but words only; And they might, for ought I can perceive, owe their derivation thither, or from thence, as well as the word, <hi>Tautology.</hi> And therefore though that Phrase of Speech, be sometimes used in Scripture, and which we tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate <hi>reasoning,</hi> I do not judge it, to be spoken of, or mean, that pure natural human insight, into the reality and truth of things upon consideration, ever void of evil, or just offence; but a disputation private, of words arising or offering themselves

Can you, or I, or any sober unbias<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed rational man, upon due consideration believe, or affirm, (unless where fancy supplies the place of Reason) that any indeavour, with the best, and most polite arguments made thereupon, for the disinherison of a lawful Heir, by any of us who can challenge no right to the present disposition of the Inheritance, proceeds from Reason? Can Reason do, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive any evil, or injustice, that good may come thereon, (perhaps in fancy only) Do's it not teach us rather to suffer patiently, whether by stripes, imprisonment, or death? Do's it at any time teach us or instruct us to do or say, what we would not have done, or said in relation to our selves? and this upon due examination, and weighing in the ballance of Justice, were our case theirs, against whom we do, or of whom we say. He, who has truly, impartially, acted or spoken thus, has followed the dictates of right Reason; not he, who has used elaborate arguments to condemn or disable ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the case he would think it unjust, to be disabled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; be the convenience, or inconvenience, to the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of mankind, never so great or pressing, but has rather followed his own Imagination, and the dictates of his own lust or affection, which indeed is apt to delude and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, not only other mens, but even our own Reason in the end.</p>
               <p>I may pray to confound mens counsel, as <hi>David</hi> in the case of <hi>Achitophel.</hi> I may pray to confound their devices, as well as to abate their Pride, and asswage their Malice, as in our

Liturgy; I may pray to be delivered from absurd or unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable men; But I shall never pray, I think, to confound any mans Reason, that will never hurt me, I am sure, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me. But for want of it, or exercise of it, in my self, I may be deceived. The Poet says, <note n="(a)" place="margin">

                  <hi>Reason neither deceives, nor is deceived at any time</hi>; in the first part of his assertion I fully agree with him. It is that special emanation from Truth, which of it self, or by it self, puts no fallacy on things, nor works any evil, as I said. But unless, by Reason, he means that very light of truth, or truth it self, which is the thing, we admire and adore by the name of God, it is deceivea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Human Reason, how strong soever is deceiveable, and that through its tame compliance only to the work of the Imagination, guided or directed, as we may say, by some base, or corrupt, or otherwise pitiful mean Affection, and supplying its place.</p>
               <p>Nay men do not only falsly impute, all our wicked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances of deep reach, and subtilty framed, unto reason; But even all our futile idle contrivances, well and formally, or curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously done, to Reason too. Every finely framed Romance, every <hi>Eutopia,</hi> or <hi>Atlantis,</hi> every witty Poem (the mere work of the Imagination) we ascribe to that, we are all become so rational; Nay if we see but an exact Picture, or Building, we do as much, when we might better do it in the model of every little Birds Nest. But as Reason, in the former case, disallows every thing that is apparently false, or evil; so in this, it rejects, of it self, every work in the Soul, and every contrivance of the Imagination, not directly tending to the glory of our Maker, the discovery of truth, the reformation of mens manners or the like. And doubtless at the instant work of the Imagination, in relation to these contrivances (though not directly hurtful of themselves) many men have had some secret whisper within them, first of the vanity thereof, then upon a review perhaps have had some kind of Regret, and in the end have censured, and condemned themselves, as guilty of a crime, for such work that their Imagination or invention might have been better imployed, as they say it fared with Sir <hi>Ph. Sidney</hi>; Which could never be, if reason had actually af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded its help towards the contrivance.</p>
               <p>But in these very cases, I think as in the former, there is the immediate help and assistance, of some Affection, and that the Imagination is constantly attended therewith, and elevated
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50605:121"/>
or inflamed thereby, or else it would be otherwise imployed through sense, and these pretty kind of Buildings would fall to the ground, or vanish in oblivion, before they were perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and compleatly finished. And what kind of Affection is this? why, a desire of being admired for our fancy, a light, airy Affection, and spawn of Pride, nourished, and foster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Imagination only, and pleased with its invention; for surely fancy barely (though some fanciful men so talk) cannot be pleased or gratified with it self, nor do those that entertain themselves after this manner at idle hours, do it to please their fancy only, but some impotent weak spawn of Love, bred through Sloth and Idleness, blindly and child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishly craving somewhat. For whensoever Affection in man has any strength or vigour, through sense or otherwise, and craves real food; this Affectation, so I may call it, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than an Affection, soon vanishes. And surely here, of all other cases, fancy supplies the place of Reason.</p>
               <p>This being granted, that in our greatest and deepest Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick contrivances, and in our most curious and exquisite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, the Imagination may and is able to supply the place of Reason; that the Imagination and some Affection in conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction together only, can frame with coherence and connexion, and that in their operation they want reason only to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish of truth or falshood, and the consequent of their work, good or evil; that its checks in relation thereto are but rare, its offers weak, and it is become amongst us almost a Cypher in the Soul: Let us enquire here, if you please, how far it is, or may be in our will and power to cherish it, or strengthen it, or how far we may become enabled from thence, to regulate or reclaim, controll, or recall, change or alter, guide or direct our Imagination and Affections; so as from our obedience thereto we may obtain in the conclusion not only some peace of mind here, but eternal rest hereafter.</p>
               <p>For reason, or ought else inherent in man, absolutely to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the Imagination, and wholly reclaim its wandring, nay to fix it one moment, without some kind of deviation, upon any particular Object, (since so many various Objects offer themselves through Sense, and since without present sense the Imagination is agitated from such opposite and various quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) I hold it altogether improbable, or rather impossible. Some indeed who had read that excellent Tract of the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Tongue,</hi> (a bodily member) did promise to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50605:122"/>
and us, the like, of the Imagination, a spiritual faculty. But 'tis in fancy only that fancy is in our power, or can at any time be made a faithful obedient Subject. We cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it by our Reason, at least we cannot do it at our will and pleasure, and therefore chiefly and principally we must trust the Government with, and expect the guidance and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection thereof from, some Superior power. Yet this I dare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, That as Reason naturally, and as it were involuntary to us, does now and then put a kind of check to the Imagination, and thereby cools the Affections as to worldly Objects; so it may by observation, and some kind of endeavour or exercise so far increase in strength, as to make us will or desire that which is perfectly good, so as our Affection shall as it were distrust our Imagination as unable to shew us that of it self, and not eagerly imbrace that which the Imagination often lays before them. And then (the Affections a little cooled) the Imagination will cease to contrive in that manner it often does, or at least its contrivances will not much prejudice or hurt us.</p>
               <p>I might here a little distinguish between Imagination and Imagination, that is, a sudden, senseless, (as we sometimes call it, and yet perhaps arising by a stroke through sense) vain, insipid cogitation or thought, without the apparent concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of any Affection (a frailty in us not wholly to be preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and for which we are in no wise answerable to Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice as I shall speak hereafter) and a cogitation allowed, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and embraced by some Affection, <hi>An imagination of the heart,</hi> as the Scripture calls it, that is perfectly voluntary as I conceive, these kind of thoughts may be surely in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure prevented, that is, that they be not <hi>evil, and that continually</hi>; for our affection, (though not our Imagination) was certainly ordained subject to our Reason; and our Imagination, at least, by consequence.</p>
               <p>There are some men I find, who are already perswaded, or (if you will allow it) have raised a setled opinion in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; that because it is impossible not to think, it is therefore impossible to prevent a thought; say they, How can we be said to hinder a thing before it be, or that which never would be? And when it is a cogitation, how can it cease to be? And so voluntarily, as it were, yield up the rein, to have their thoughts arise or work by a kind of fatal necessity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:50605:122"/>What I shall futurely think, I must confess I cannot pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly prevent, and yet it may be so in my power by way of precaution, and curbing my Affections with my Reason, as to prevent the rise of an evil thought which otherwise might have been, and further the rise of a good thought, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps otherwise would not have been.</p>
               <p>If beauty, or riches, or honour, or place, shall seem to offer themselves to ten several men in their thoughts at one instant, that is, they all then think there is an opportunity offered of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining or enjoying; doubtless there will follow as many va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thoughts about the manner, as there are men, and neither could prevent at that time such their thoughts. Yet if any one of these men had at any time before curbed his appetite in like cases; that is, made use of Reason so far, as to shew unto his Affections the vanity or inconsistence of these things with true happiness; the vileness of obtaining them by any indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect means, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which we cannot but imagine 'tis in some measure in the power of man to do) do we not think, nay can we not judge, but that such mans subsequent thoughts, would much vary from what otherwise they might have been or tended, and if so, a thought may be changed, altered or prevented.</p>
               <p>If our thoughts were so far out of human power or ability, as that they are neither creatable, mutable, or reclaimable thereby: To what purpose is all this argument about them? We will imagine now; the Inventors, Assertors, or Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this Opinion, are like other men, and we will appeal to them who urge it, whether they would not the good Opinion, and good thoughts of us, and all men, in relation to their sincerity in this averment, that is, that 'tis the plain demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of Reason in them, and no sinister Affectation what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, that induces the maintenance of this Opinion (which perhaps at present, we think it to be) now I am sure they will offer it to our Reason, to make trial thereof.</p>
               <p>Now if I have no power to exercise my Reason, then is that offer to it vain; if I have, and thereby change my Opinion, then is it in my power to change my Opinion, and create those thoughts in me, which otherwise would never have been. Nay this very exercise, that is, the weighing and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining the grounds of the first rise of this Opinion, creates in me thoughts of the Inventor, such as otherwise would not have been; (<hi>viz.</hi>) That he who first started this game for the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:50605:123"/>
Imagination to hunt after, to the confusion of it self, and the clouding of Reason, so far as to betray the Soul to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion of Satan, and averting it from a ready and willing obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to that guide set over it, was no good Christian, nor no good moral man.</p>
               <p>If he were alive, I am pretty confident, he would grant, it were in my power to be idle, that is, permit my thoughts to ramble, in obedience only, to sense present or prior, so as without exercising my Reason (how weak soever) that thought of him, would never have risen within me; but I should have believed, or granted, All he had said, to be true, and then had I prevented such (as I suppose he would call it) evil thought of him.</p>
               <p>Reason though it be the least Earthly, or the least of cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation with the Body, of any faculty in the Soul, yet is most like it in this; that it acquires strength and vigour by use and exercise. If it but once reclaim the Imagination; If but once thereby we master an unruly Affection for a time; If from it, we once behold our past folly and madness, and have some glimmering light of truth (besides the present comfort there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in) how ready is it upon every turn, to afford us its help and assistance? It seems indeed at first an irksom thing to the Imagination, perpetually working as of it self, <hi>ad arbitrium,</hi> and naturally working to feed and please the passions, to have Reason called in, for its regulation or direction, in all, or any of its motion. It begets in us that disease, (we fansie so at least) the Apostle calls a <hi>weariness of the mind</hi>; Let the Affections, and Imagination, work and run together without control, men seldom complain of a weariness of the Soul, however it may fare with their Body, in pursuance: but if Reason be obeyed in its checks, and called in to weigh all circumstances, future danger, as well as present enjoyment, and to distinguish real good and happiness, from colourable delights; We presently faint and give over, leaving our Imagination and Affections to themselves again: And so instead of a weariness of the mind for the present, subject it to Agues and Feavers, doubts and distrusts, anxiety and perturbation in the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, such as are far more unpleasant, irksom, and intolerable, than the pains we indeavour to avoid.</p>
               <p>If any man, who has felt it, shall make a diligent search into the cause of any his involuntary disquiet of mind, he will find (setting aside some particular cases not to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented)
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:50605:123"/>
it has been from the too great trust, the faculties of his Soul have had of each other, and the too familiar com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with each other, that, which way soever the one has first moved, the other has followed, or at least not resisted as it should or might; that in their course together, which soever has been originally most to blame, the Imagination has been the Ring-leader or File-leader; that if they had been now and then at a little distrust, and now and then had had a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test for precedency, and superiority, it might have prevented that mutiny and disorder in the Soul, which is not seldom oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned by Reason's stepping in and exercising its power, and shewing us our Errors, when it seems too late.</p>
               <p>I must confess every dispute, or contest amongst the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Soul, is for the present troublesome, but who would not, if he could, indure a small trouble to avoid a greater? A voluntary dispute or contest between our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and Imagination, is never very dreadful, or deadly, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can I foresee any dangerous consequent thereof. The danger is only, when it is involuntary; when Reason is rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and awakened by some unexpected accident, sickness, crosses, or the like, when it starts up, as it were on the suddain, and as Gods Vicegerent (of which we were not sensible be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) seems loudly to cry out, and condemn us, for not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that use of it we might, or not obeying its private moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions before, and this to the suddain amazement and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of all the other faculties in the Soul; then does the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion sometimes, according to its wonted falshood, so far comply with it too, as to present us a prospect of a just and revengeful God, and (forgetting mercy) his utter desertion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of us; which likely ends in despair: but if it be volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and so the Imagination and Affections be as it were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the encounter; let no man ever fear the evil suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess thereof: Reason, Gods Vicegerent, will never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us utterly, at such time as it works of it self, and as it were of its free motion, to reform us.</p>
               <p>This contest in the Soul I recommend, and this mutiny, if it might be, for the present, I look upon as the readiest way and means, towards a setled and lasting peace and quiet for the future. We are prone and ready enough to distrust each other, and to fall to foreign or outward dispute and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, and to go together by the ears for God's sake, as we say: But truly, if there be in Nature any struggling or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:50605:124"/>
any difference or division, any fighting or combating, acceptable to the God of Nature, and the God of Unity, Peace and Concord; it is between the several faculties of a Soul a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves, when Reason shall as it were voluntarily exercise them, and call them to an account; when Affections good and bad, shall as it were fight together; when Pride and Vain-glory shall be undermined, and fall to the ground, through a sense of our own unworthiness; when modesty and shame shall quench the flames of inordinate, and more than bestial love; when perfect love shall drive away fear, and the like. And this through Reason's shewing us the delusion of the Imagination before; all the wound we receive thereby, is, that our Affections seem a little disgusted for their too great compliance with the Imagination, and disobedience to some former checks of Reason, which will be perfectly healed by their present compliance, and the Imagination hereby will be somewhat reclaimed from presenting to them a pretence to any absolute authority for the future.</p>
               <p>Surely this most excellent Divine gift, <hi>Reason,</hi> was not given us barely to condemn our selves for our neglect of the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Grace in us; but that there is a kind of will and power in us attendant upon that admirable gift to act. I own there is Grace co-operating with it, or working in it, by which it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten moves and guides us, but yet I judg it may move from some strength of our own, or as of it self. It stands by often as it were idle and unconcerned, in relation to our thoughts and actions; but we often find it is not dead in us, and then sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we our selves may give it strength by exercise, or add strength to it, and exercise it, we our selves may; and that it will sooner and better work in us from thence, than from the inforced motion of any outward humane application. We may desire and request men to exercise their Reason; we may lay down before them the benefit and advantage they may reap thereby, but we cannot properly be said to perswade them to it. For 'tis not a belief upon a bare consideration, that what we at present say to them is true, that is an exercise of Reason, (though belief in a strict sence be the work of Reason) but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on consideration, whether what we alledg may not be false. A narrow scrutiny and voluntary search after truth, is an exercise of Reason. And this is the work in the Soul, as it were of it self, rather than from our perswasion, (or indeed the work of Grace) which I commend.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:50605:124"/>We have in one place a kind of assertion of this power and ability in man (to me seeming) from one, who elswhere ascribes all his good thoughts and actions, as much, and as oft, to the effect of Gods Grace in him, as any man whatsoever; and that is, St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the defence of himself before <hi>Foelix,</hi> when <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullus</hi> had accused him as a Pestilent fellow, a mover of sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a ring-leader of a Sect; <hi>That he had</hi>

                  <hi>exercised himself to have always a conscience void of offence, towards God, and towards men.</hi> What can his meaning be herein by the words <hi>himself,</hi> and <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise?</hi> but by the one his Reason, by the other a will and power annexed to that Reason, given as a rein over the other faculties of the Soul, that is (for so I take his meaning to be) that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his opinion, notwithstanding his Affections ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering, cleaving to, or going along with such opinion, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding a subsequent will or desire, that the World should imbrace that opinion or belief (<hi>viz.</hi> of a Resurrection) which he himself had entertained with the allowance and consent of Reason; He endeavoured all along by his Reason so to keep those other faculties under subjection, as that they became not offensive to God or man: and from thence, as I infer, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely avers, That in entertainment of that opinion, he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imagined evil, desired evil, willed evil, or prayed for evil to any man for dissenting from him in opinion; that his Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination was not hurried herein to gratifie any evil, ambitious, or vain affection, that he neither meant or intended, or could foresee the disturbance of the present Peace or Government of that Nation, in the allowance or declaration of his belief; that he neither desired, or aimed at riches, places, preferment, or popular applause, or admiration thereby. So as when he came to review and re-examine his past thoughts and actions in the judicatory of his Reason, he doubted not but he should find quietness of mind, and no disturbance amongst the faculties of his Soul; nor God, nor man (justly) offended thereby. I wish we all in matter of belief endeavoured as much, that is, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised our Reason therein. I affirm we may and can; and that is the readier way by this work from within to obtain and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure (his words are there, <hi>ad habendam</hi>) a <hi>Conscience void of offence,</hi> than by the Imagination, raise a <hi>Chimaera</hi> in the Soul, a <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> vulnerable, in complaint, from without; a thing only of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended when the Imagination and Affections are crossed in their course together, and not else.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:50605:125"/>I do not presume here, to propose, or offer this exercise of Reason, which I affirm to be in the power of most of us to do, as any absolute way or means, by which our Imagination and Affections may be reduced to work, and lay hold on that which is good only (that I refer to the only fountain of all intellectual as well as other beings, through our humble Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress and application thereto, in Prayer from some sense of our own weakness, and reserve it for a Conclusion) but as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative thereto; Neither has my Imagination hitherto, so far out run my Reason, or so supplied the place thereof, as to make me believe St. <hi>Paul,</hi> or any other, was ever wholly void of offence, or trouble of mind thereby. But my Reason (I trust to say so) informs me, that did we make that use of it, we could, or should, we might espy the fallacy of our Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination in many particular, if not most, cases of our life; And to endeavour to awake it, in our selves, or others (if these Papers happen to be seen) is my chief aim, and I hope and trust, it will prove no cause of offence.</p>
               <p>Experience (something more than memory, for 'tis a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment passed upon memory) methinks might help us a little; 'Tis to Reason, as memory to the Imagination; A Fort, to resort to sometimes, from which it makes its sally, or <hi>exit,</hi> usually with some greater strength and vigour than before. And methinks, if Reason were not Master in us before, this thing Experience, which is certainly Mistress in most of us, might help to make it so; To see we have been deceived by our Imagination, and that from thence, a kind of false or feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed belief has been raised in us, is sure, the readiest way to prevent deceit for the future, and raise in us a more true, and substantial belief from Reason.</p>
               <p>How oft have we observed our Affection, nay our whole Soul, disturbed and disquieted, through the delusion of this one faculty in us, the Imagination? Has not that often put divers and various colours upon Objects, as it were through Sense, at several times, and upon several occasions? while Sense continues one and the same, to day, and to Morrow. Have we not, as it were Yesterday, beheld things as Delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, Beautiful and Pleasant, through that false glass only, which to day we do not? Has not that alone, and not Sense, raised the Proverb of the Crow? He who has at several times received favours and disgraces from Court; He, who has at several times received admission, and denial to Church
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:50605:125"/>
preferment (with either of which I was never acquainted or concerned) is better able to set forth to the life his various prospects through this glass, than I; and better describe, how ugly, or beautiful the feet of those men, from whom he has received both denial and admittance, obstruction and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance, have seemed at several times; and I wish some men would consider it.</p>
               <p>Is it not the strength of this one faculty alone so predominant often in us, that introduces various forms of one and the same thing? Beasts do love, and fear, as well as we, from sense of a particular Object; but I can scarce conjecture, the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination in them can so far alter the form of the Object, as to make it seem various to several Beasts of the same species, at one and the same time. This we find, and may observe it does, in us Men; a Bush, at a distance, will seem to one his appointed Friend, to another his Lover, to a Third a wild Beast, to a Fourth a Thief, to a Fifth an evil Spirit, and to a Sixth a good Angel, according as a present fancy shall render, with the assistance of some formerly debauched or deceived Affection.</p>
               <p>Now, howsoever I adjudge, affirm, or maintain, Affection to be the original cause of motion, or work in the Soul, I do not adjudge it originally to blame, or to be the chief and principal cause of every uneasy, or evil motion in the Soul; but that the Imagination is first and chiefly to be blamed; and that Affection would never imbrace any thing as good, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject any thing as evil, which are not so in their Nature, if the Imagination did not first present them as such. Human Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, originally good, naturally tends in desire to that which is good; But because the Imagination, the perspective by which it looks abroad, is not able of its own strength, to afford it a full and true prospect of any such thing; it many times presents unto it in haste, things, as good, and beautiful, which, in truth, are not; which once accepted by the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections as good from that false glass, they adhere thereto, and are not easily removed, but disturb us, whensoever we are informed the contrary by others, beating upon our Reason through sense, or, indeed, that our Reason of it self shall too late inform us otherwise. 'Tis from the checks of Reason, at peculiar seasons, that that saying of <hi>video meliora, &amp;c.</hi> has arose, not from the Imagination, which is most apt to delude us; that, we follow, and are most prone to follow, and, if we
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:50605:126"/>
are once given up, shall surely follow, as Scripture it self seems to intimate, placing the foolishness of our hearts, <note n="(a)" place="margin">Rom. 1.21.</note> subsequent, and attending on the vanity of our Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And therefore we should strive, as far as we are able, to rectify that one faculty, in the beginning.</p>
               <p>Does not experience daily shew us, this one faculty in the Soul, has deluded every thing that may be called an Affection in us, by representing things on the right hand, in a far more pleasant, and delightful, and on the left, in a far more horrid and uncouth dress, than in truth they are, or prove to be, when we become really acquainted with them, and by our Affections seem to taste them? Every man who has promised himself Place or Power, (with the delight thereof) to gratify Ambition or Revenge, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to gratify Pride, Riches to gratify a Covetous desire, Fleshly pleasure to satisfy a more than Beastly lust, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed either, I am sure will own it to himself; and that a Mahometan Paradise best agrees with fancy alone, and by it self, as it were; for whatsoever may be called an Affection, no sooner tasts it, but it loaths it, and wants the Imagination to put fresh colours on it again, to raise a fresh, or, as it were, a new desire.</p>
               <p>The things, which the Imagination at first presents as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to the Affections, we are rarely so long, and so well acquainted with (because we shun them, and turn from them in thoughts, as often as we can) as with the help of experience, to make a true judgment of our Imaginations false gloss thereon, and we are never willing to stand out the trial. This I am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily perswaded, that, that most dreadful Gulph of Death, is chiefly so framed from the Imagination, and is not such, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its deception: And that those, who have shot it, if they could return to us again, and declare what might be most for our ease and quiet, in relation thereto, would bid us, not to read the Treatises thereof, which some have made, and framed by their Imagination, but advise us to exercise our thoughts, towards the performance of moral duties, rather than busy them about that which serves but to aggravate and enhaunce terror. And I do further believe (how e're we accuse our Affections therefore) that it never was suddain joy, or suddain fear or grief (as is storied) that has killed men: those Passions are not so much to be blamed (how suddainly soever they are awaked) they only imbrace or avoid, as they seem directed;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50605:126"/>
but, that it is a strange suddain exaltation of the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a thing seated in the brain, which from its violent heat and motion there, is able to dissolve, and dissipate, our vital Spirits, and stop this breath of life in our mortal Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
               <p>I do not impute our common distractions, and disturbance of mind, (grounded, as may seem to most, in fears and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies) so much to the fault of mens Affections, as their Imaginations (though Affection be to blame too) Affection in man is generally good, and inclinable to peace and quiet; and if it work the contrary, 'tis from some false light of things, darted from the Imagination, however raised or kindled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. There are many thousands, no doubt, who from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of their hearts, wish and desire the quiet and peace of their Country and Nation, and yet at this instant very much help to foment its differences, and are ready to bring upon it the contraries thereof, Trouble and War: and this from a false and vain Imagination only, or chiefly, that we might be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier than we are, because we seem not at present so happy as we would be. Which deceit of the Imagination, men usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly observe when 'tis too late, and wish themselves again but as happy as they have been. But it is a strange thing, that they who have once observed it, and found themselves deceived there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, should a second time suffer their Affections to labour under the same fallacy, and not observe from Reason, back'd as it were from Experience, that we may be deceived thereby, and therefore carry such a suspicion of the Imagination in our Soul, as not to let our Affections, too deeply ingage with theirs, who may possibly indeavour their own advancement, rather than our reformation, and amendment, and aim at the delusion of our Imagination, by <hi>mormo</hi>'s and <hi>spectrum</hi>'s rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and shot into it, through sense, absurdly enough, rather than the enlightning our Reason, by offering us any thing of weight or truth.</p>
               <p>Nay, when the Imagination without the least ground, or concurrence of Reason, has once framed a belief in some men, and thereby captivated their Affections, how ready are these faculties together, to spread the infection through Sense, in others, by the most ridiculous ways and means that may be? Every Apparition, every Blazing-Star, must portend, if not infallibly denote to others, as well as themselves, Sedition, Troubles, Wars, Subversion of Monarchy, or what else men
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:50605:127"/>
readily would: And truly so every such thing does, if we exercise not our Reason, and it happens once to become a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral belief amongst us, from the fallacy of our Imagination, by the Devils Emissaries, that there is such a portent; but if men would be prevailed with to make use of their Reason, I affirm, (and they would see) these Apparitions portend no such thing; But that it is in our power at all times, to change the seeming evil consequent of these Signs, or Face of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens; and I will plainly tell you how. Let every one of us indeavour to amend one, (our Prognosticators especially) him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self rather than another; Let each single person begin to lead a righteous, sober, quiet, humble life, let him submit himself to all Power, Laws, and Ordinances already establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for God's sake. These I am sure are the dictates of right Reason, and these are things as much in every mans power, as any thing imaginable. Be but this (and Reasons dictates, when it dictates, are the same in all men, though that be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times weaker, sometimes stronger, and sometimes blind in man) once observed, we become again, as it were of one mind, and if we become of one mind, Sedition is necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wanting, and if Sedition be wanting, I am sure 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, Troubles, or War, should happen amongst us. So as, 'tis we alone, are able to make a Star portend good or evil, which of it self signifies nothing of concern to us.</p>
               <p>When plain down right Reason is neglected, the subtle Imagination inflamed, and our Affections once wedded as we say to Opinion, what monstrous consequent beliefs are begot in the Soul? Is it possible, think you, from Reason, to have a belief raised in any mans Soul, of his own merit or worth in relation to any future state? Is not every man conscious thereby, of his own defects and unworthiness here, of his treachery and falshood, of his Irreligion and Profaneness, of his want of Charity to his fellow Creatures, and want of due ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to his Creator? Can any man behold himself (and in some degree and measure know himself, which is a thing utterly impossible of another) and not condemn himself by his own Reason, if he have any, as acting some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times against the plain light of that? and look upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as St. <hi>Paul, the greatest of sinners,</hi> because 'tis impossible he should behold, and perfectly know, any greater, and throw himself at last at the footstool of some infinite Mercy? I am sure no man can do less, that makes present use of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:50605:127"/>
at other times neglected. Whence is it then, that some men elect, and Saint themselves, without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent respect to such infinite Mercy, and behold others as Reprobates and Castaways, discarding all Mercy out of themselves? Is it not from opinion only, and the bare work of the Imagination in them? And is it not wrought and effected principally, from others disagreement with them in point of Opinion, relating to the ways, and means, and methods of obtaining future Bliss and Happiness? Affection sure is not herein originally to blame, neither can any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar affection (unless Pride, the spawn of the Devil) be found, that should inflame or exalt the Imagination above Reason in this manner. Before men thus differ in Opinion, they love and affect one another well enough, but after Imagination has raised several beliefs in several men (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps about a trifle, and that which is not worthy to be a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of belief) they generally, mortally hate, and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute each other. Herein, I say, the Imagination is chiefly culpable, and raises such a belief meerly for want of a little exercise of Reason; For, that, duly consulted, I dare say, would raise another manner of belief in us, that is, that without just provocation, and the immediate necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry defence and preservation of our own Bodies, we ought in no case to wound and destroy anothers: And then would this Diabolical imaginary belief vanish, and we should be at Amity again; which, God of his infinite mercy, by the strengthening or enlightening our Reason, or otherwise of his immediate Free Grace (so far as it may agree with his holy purposes towards the setting forth his own Glory in the end) grant unto us all! and that we become not more savage than Beasts, whose Imagination working up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the inlet of Sense barely, frames, and contrives no further than self-preservation, nor is vainly exalted in any of them into a belief of self-worth, or Spiritual Prerogative or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty above their fellow Creatures, so as to destroy one another as a Victim to Pride, but only to present Rage, or Lust, or Appetite.</p>
               <p>I am so far from accusing Passion, as the Original Cause of our Errors, and by consequence, our Trouble and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet (which I rather impute to the bare work of the Imagination, and that chiefly through the delusion of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan) that I do think, there is not a greater, or stronger
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:50605:128"/>
Bulwark against the idle and wicked excursion of the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, whereby our Troubles do arise, nor a more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual means for the opening and strengthening our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, by which they are soonest allayed, than some peculiar Passion, inherent, and raised (I will not say by the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, for the Imagination alone I am sure cannot do it) in the Soul; and that is, <hi>Sorrow,</hi> a thing we are ready and willing to shun, and condemn in our Imagination, before we become well acquainted with it by our Reason. Of the usual blessed effects whereof, I mean to say somewhat in this place, in order to a Conclusion.</p>
               <p>By Sorrow, I do not mean every Grief, Anxiety, Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or Perturbation of Mind, but, that <hi>Dolor flebilis</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; a mollifying and melting of the Heart, through some seeming irreparable loss, but so mollified or melted by a stronger power than the Imagination; which thing, though it continue not in its first state or height, but resolves into a kind of joy at the last (and indeed while it is, is no other than a privation of some preceding joy or delight) yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains so much of its first nature and quality, that upon remembrance thereof (and if it were real, it cannot be utterly forgotten) it will remain as a guard to suppress the treacherous attempts of the Imagination (or rather the Devil through the Imagination) and consequently the Insurrection of all base and sordid affection, or, if you please, against the excursion of other Passions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, against the deceit and falshood of the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>The Imagination is usually of a towring quality, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding all worldly goods under it, and, not seldom, is as liberal of its Promises to the Affections, as Satan to our Saviour: And this puts them all in Arms, and whatsoever Mastery, Victory, or Enjoyment is obtained, there will be Mutiny and Trouble, and Disorder, amongst those com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldiers of the Soul; which this one single Passion, raised, is only able of it self to prevent or allay. For it cools the Imagination only, while all others inflame it, and rejects those Companions of Envy, Hatred, Malice, or the like, which other Passions usually call in to their assistance, by the help of the Imagination.</p>
               <p>There is no doubt; neither shall I gain-say, but that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, notwithstanding the present Dominion of Sorrow,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:50605:128"/>
or any other moderate lawful Passion, retains in himself the Seeds or Roots of every irregular unlawful Passion, which may in time spring up, and bear a bitter Fruit to the Soul; yet this Covering, like Snow, which has in it the qualities of Cold and Heat both, will obstruct their spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth for the present, the usual consequent whereof is a good and plentiful Harvest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sorrow</hi> I affirm is a melting of the Heart from above (for 'tis not any apparent cause can do it at all times) and a new moulding all the affections through a rectified Imagination. Now whether it arises at any time, from the weight and sense of a mans Sins, the loss of his Relations, or other cause whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; if it be true and real, without too much mixture of some other Passion, I dare boldly and confidently affirm, it will have this effect upon every man, that he shall not for the present, plot and contrive for the gratification of any evil affection whatsoever; but that, that thing we call Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, shall render all its former Devices, in such case, abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, and loathsome to his Affections.</p>
               <p>Those busie contriving Heads now abroad in the World, who think they have Reason working in conjunction with their Imagination, did they feel, or had they ever felt, this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection or Passion, truly regent in them; were they, or had they been once sorrowful, for permitting their Affections to be wedded to their past Inventions: I am perswaded they would not pursue their present designs, with so much ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerness or greediness of Mind, as perhaps they now do, nor would they pass over so slightly and unregarded, all those Bonds of Amity and Friendship, Truth, Justice, Mercy, Pity and Compassion, and the like, which God has imprinted in their Nature, and given them Reason to enliven the same, and by which plain Light, they would almost necessarily walk, did not the Imagination by Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons clean contrary to Sorrow, dazle their Prospect by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction thereof.</p>
               <p>Does not the Imagination, upon the least reflection of Sorrow, cease its working, to supply or foment all Lusts of the Flesh, and the Eyes, nay, strive as it were to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press them? Is it possible that any Pride of Life, should so far infest the Imagination, as to render it obedient there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, or to comply with it, when Sorrow has possessed the Heart, a thing necessarily attended with Humility; that
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:50605:129"/>
is, a low esteem of ones self? Can any man in Sorrow, do, or say that to his Neighbour which Reason forbids? Let Envy, Hatred, Malice (those pleasant Companions to some) receive entertainment and compliance in the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, at such time, if it be possible: Nay, let a man then, so much as think evil of any man but himself, the space of one moment, I will tell him, he either was not truly sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful, or I understand not yet, what true Sorrow means.</p>
               <p>Whereas, Love (I mean not that which is pure) sends the Imagination on a thousand idle Errands, Fear disturbs it and distracts it, Foolish Joy ravishes and confounds it, and some of them make it raise a thousand Chimaera's; Sorrow alone, shews the folly of the Imaginations attendance on all other Passions, while it holds a Glass to it self; and although it be esteemed an heavy lumpish Passion which no ways quickens the Invention (a faculty in whose work we much glory, though it work our shame and confusion in the end) but rather dulls it: Nay, though it be not of it self, so active and sprightly abroad as some other Passions, yet it is not altogether idle at home, it sweeps the Soul clean of much Rubbish, casts out, and disburthens it, of many foul things, and invites, as it were, Love and Charity, and Good Will, to garnish it and possess it in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</p>
               <p>To rectifie, or cure our Imagination this way, is most certainly out of our power; we cannot melt our selves thus, at our will and pleasure, and therefore it may seem vain to commend it to any man; I only mention it to this end, That they who look upon it as terrible and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, may prevent it before-hand (if so be they can) For he who can or will follow the plain dictates of Right Reason, and not his own Invention, shall never certainly fall into it: But if any man shall have done otherwise; Let him pray for it, let him help to advance it, and entertain it thankfully, if he find it coming upon him (and that is a thing may seem in mans power) and look upon it, as a most blessed Remedy, sent in aid of Reason, towards the cure of an unruly wandring Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and its Attendants, unquiet and disorderly Passions; and without which, we cannot easily be relieved, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of them. A blessed weakness or sickness of the mind, which (if the Imagination, through the delusion of Satan,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:50605:129"/>
make it not to end in Despair) will so help Reason, as to render our Soul in a more perfect state of Health than ever it was before.</p>
               <p>Humane Imagination, is the most strange thing in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nothing so strangely working, nothing so strangely set on work; nothing so deceiving, nothing so deceivable, nothing so suddenly alterable, changable, or mutable, nor by such various and divers ways and means; I have often in my thoughts compared it to many things, but to none so often, as that thing which our Saviour has resembled the Kingdom of Heaven to (<hi>viz.</hi>) a <hi>Drag net,</hi> which by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse of somewhat (it may be sometimes that good Spirit we have mentioned, it may be sometimes an evil one, it may be our affections from the agitation of the one, or the other) gathereth, and bringeth into this Land of ours, things of every kind, good and bad; which if some other faculty of our Soul be not able to distinguish, and sever the one from the other, but that our whole Soul does embrace, and greedily feed on whatsoever is brought in without any difference, she is in a great deal of danger of being infected with many diseases: And so much the rather, as that the imagination being of equal divine extraction with our Reason, and capable to work without regard to present sense, it becomes the door, if not well looked to or guarded, by which Satan sliely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in, to the possession of our Souls with an Imaginary belief, against Reason, and Sense too, and brings us to entertain error for truth, evil for good.</p>
               <p>There are many seeming ways, so far to reclaim the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and so far to stop the common usual course of its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies, as that we become not confounded, nor great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and grievously disturbed in the Soul thereby, that have (through that very faculty it self) occurred to my mind, I had once thoughts to set them down: But when all is said that can be said, or thought that can be thought, and we proceed to make our Judgement thereupon; That one (chiefly Divine) faculty, Reason, which God has placed as his substitute in our Souls, tells us, our thoughts of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are vain, and shews us our insufficiency, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, we are, as of our selves, a thing of naught, and left to our Invention, worse than naught: It bids us cease our vain Imaginations, if so be we can, and humbly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:50605:130"/>
our selves to that very power from which we think; so to think as may be most pleasing thereto, and safest for us.</p>
               <p>We are all, God knows, as to what is good, dull of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, frail of Memory, and weak of Judgment, whatever our Will or Affections are, or seem to be; and the sight of that, might well put a stop to my Writing. But you (and every man who finds and owns himself under that Notion) will I hope pass by, and pardon my infirmities, if there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear any discrepancy, between these and my former thoughts, already set down in relation to this Subject: And the rather because, you well know, all my former Papers were out of my custody, whilst I was imployed and busied in these. I have already exceeded the bounds of an Epistle, and will trouble you no further, save in relation to some former demonstration of my weak judgement relating to this faculty of the Soul, the <hi>Imagination,</hi> under these four several following heads di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct and a part, and those I am bold to set down, as follows.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>I. That the Imagination, of all the faculties of an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Soul, is most subject to infection, change and alteration, from the humours of the Body.</item>
                  <item>II. That the guidance, regulation or Government thereof, is least in our power, of any faculty of the Soul.</item>
                  <item>III. That it being a faculty, the Government whereof is so much out of, or beyond our Power, We are not answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for its Transgression, unless, where some other faculty, more in the power of our will, through the light of Reason, does apparently concur, or comply with it; Or that through the negligence of our Reason, it was the cause of the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations incorrigible rambling errors.</item>
                  <item>IV. That it shews its Divinity and extraction, as well as any other faculty of the Soul in the manner of its Work. That set on work in relation to its own motion, it necessarily terminates (with the allowance of Reason) in the thoughts of, one, Eternal, Wise Being, or Mind, Governour, and disposer of all things. That from such thoughts, we are necessarily stirred and incited, in all the faculties of our Soul, to fly thither for relief, and to receive direction and guidance from thence chiefly. That yet herein, necessary care is to be had and taken, that we retain, and in some measure make use of our Reason, lest we become ensnared through the delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Satan.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:50605:130"/>I. Notwithstanding my Opinion of the Souls extraction, its Divinity, and Immortality; its power here in a Body from Heavenly influence to mount sometimes above sense; its strength to resist all foreign delusion through sense by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; Its capacity to work without a Body, or the help of that more present inlet, bodily sense; Yet it is in my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, while it remains in a Body, so far subject to some Mists and Vapours arising there from, that the Imagination, the Eye of the Soul, is thereby often deceived: And so far deceived thereby, that Reason, though it remain in its native strength, cannot correct its wandring, but is forced to yield its allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and consent, and to be led as it were captive by the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</p>
               <p>This faculty, the Imagination, the Eye of the Soul through sense as well as otherwise, necessarily and perpetually work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and in motion, Upon any distemperature of the Body, whereby sense is in any degree or measure clouded or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed, is apt of it self to frame and raise strange Idea's and make strange representations to the other faculties, to the amazement and confusion of Reason; To the allurement, inticement, or attraction of other faculties from that which before they naturally were bent and inclined to; and thereby at length, to the captivation of Reason it self.</p>
               <p>This happens not from every humour, or in every disease of the Body, but in such disease, and from such humor only, as, by fumes sent into the brain, clouds, or darkens that port, or inlet to the Soul, <hi>Sense</hi>: Or so disturbs or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structs those passages, that they cannot afford that assistance to Reason, as usual, against the deceit of the Imagination. <hi>Sense</hi> I say, a passage, way, or means, by the perfect openness and clearness whereof, Reason oft makes a better, and truer judgment of things, than it can, when those passages are a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle obstructed, and yet to the Imagination, seem open and clear.</p>
               <p>In sleep, when that port, <hi>Sense,</hi> is as it were wholly shut up through fumes, Reason (without blame) leaves the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, as sole Master in the Soul, to frame and introduce Idea's of it self, which in reality, are not; Yet upon the opening of Sense again, they vanish, or are presently rejected, and cast out of the Soul as idle. But when that port of Sense is open, and the Imagination presents to the other faculties of the Soul, as if what it presented, were rightly and truly formed
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:50605:131"/>
through Sense with the allowance of Reason, and thereby a vain belief (a thing somewhat more than a Dream) is raised, perhaps to the terrour and affrightment of the Affections; Reason not able, absolutely to contradict the Imagination, because it seemed to have the concurrence of Sense, is sliely drawn into a kind of consent; and this not seldom occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned through gross humors in the Body. In which case, there is in my opinion a kind of defect, lett, or disease in Sense (though not apparent) as well as fault in the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>The Imagination is capable of distemper, two manner of ways, corporally, or spiritually, as we say. But those two kind of distempers of the Imagination; the one from the Body, to the Imaginations deception of its fellow faculties in the Soul; the other from those fellow faculties (as vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Affections) to the deception, or rather confusion of the Imagination it self, being often confounded together, and the one, not sedom mistaken for the other, and the fault of the Body imputed to the Soul, and the fault of the Soul imputed to the Body; I have thought good to set down here some kind of mark, by which they might be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished (though I offer it not with any great confidence, as the light of an infallible truth appearing to me) and it is this.</p>
               <p>That if at any time we find and observe a Body health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful (as in most Lunaticks) and withal, the Affections very vigorous and active; and every design and bent of them, ready to be put in execution by the will, and the instruments thereof, bodily members; There we may rationally adjudge the distemper of that Soul to be occasioned no otherwise than by its own default or neglect, and the Original cause of the disease to have been the too familiar intercourse and trust, between the Affections and the Imagination, from the neglect of Reason, and a thing, which Reason might have prevented.</p>
               <p>But if we find and observe the Body infirm, heavy and lumpish, and not active, or ready with the Affections, to put in execution those things which are framed in the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, but that there is a kind of Terror or Horror ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable over the Spirits, and a doubting and distrust in the Soul, there we may impute every false gloss, and fictitious formation and contrivance of the Imagination, to have its rise
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:50605:131"/>
or result from some gross humors in the Body, such as we call Melancholy, such, as Reason in its greatest strength, could not rectify or prevent, though it strived to resist; Nor are the Affections to be accused, justly, of any inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or disorder through the delusion of Satan, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; Neither can we justly think, there has been any wilful defect or neglect in the Soul to occasion it.</p>
               <p>Further thus; when Pride, or self-Love, or Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, with their Off-spring and Darlings, Anger, Revenge, Hatred, Envy and the like, distemper the Imagination, and cause it to wander without any order or Government, raising false and fictitious sights in the Soul, the usual resort is abroad, and in relation to others vileness, or baseness, overlooking all that is really, or may be espied in Imagination at home; and in this case, we cannot so well impute the distemper to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors naturally bred in the Body, as to the Devil and a wilful negligence in the Soul. But when men, without any great or visible Errors in the Affections, condemn themselves falsly, when the Imagination works at home, and nothing seems vile or odious to a man, but himself to himself; I judge the fallacy to arise merely from dark and dusky vapours in the Body (nay I cannot see how it should proceed from any unruly or depraved Passion) by which the Soul shut up as it were a Prisoner, from free communication with other Souls, labouring of it self, and in travail to be relieved; for want of help, a consternation is suddainly raised in the Affections, and from them again the Imagination suddainly and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently set on work, Sense before clouded is almost destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it becomes as useless as in a Dream, the Imagination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes without controul from without, and is sole Master and will be sole Master till these vapours are dispelled or allayed which is best done, as I think, by Bodily Physick.</p>
               <p>When I once see men come to Visions and Revelations, and pronounce and proclaim them, as given or sent to direct and instruct others thereby; I shall very much suspect, their Soul more nocent, or more defective than their Body: But if I find nothing but self-censure, and self-condemnation in man (unless in case of a very apparent wicked life before) I have ever been so charitable as to think strange and dreadful seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Apparitions in the Soul, rather to be raised first in the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination through some defect or obstruction in bodily Sense, than that the Imagination through Affection deludes Sense,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:50605:132"/>
and that the Soul of it self is purer than we can well judge of through our Senses barely.</p>
               <p>Most certain it is, and experience tells us how subject this one faculty in us, <hi>Imagination,</hi> is to sudden change and mutation from things meerly Earthly, received into the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; how a little Wine will sometimes clear and elevate it, how the anointing with peculiar Oyls will dull, and infest it, how particular Herbs and Plants will presently distract and confound it. Neither can we, I think, rationally observe the sudden alteration of any one faculty of the Soul from any distemper of the Body barely, but this. I neither cease to love, what I loved, nor hate, what I hated, nor believe what I believed, nor will what I willed, from any sudden fumes of the Body; nor, indeed, until the Imagination by its continued disturbance from thence, shall have raised and put on other colours on the Objects, and through its influence it has over the other faculties, in time subjected them to accept such Colours as true. The Imagination is many times suddenly changed and altered, distracted and confounded from meer Bodily Diseases: and so (it being as I have said the Eye of the Soul) all the other faculties from thence are led into Error, the evil consequents whereof (the Body only or chiefly faulty) certainly God in Mercy will not look upon as punishable, or take vengeance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; to which I shall speak somewhat more at large in the third place, but first declare how far, I think, the work of this faculty is out of, or beyond our power.</p>
               <p n="2">II. It is a common saying with every one of us, when any Foreign Power lays a restraint upon our actions; We can think what we please, or what we list; Which, if it were universally true, might perhaps in some cases render us more miserable, than men of themselves can make us, by disquieting those Affections, which they cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, but through our own thoughts; Which are often strangely diverted, and the Soul at better ease, than if that faculty were in our absolute power. But, blessed be God, since our will is not generally so good as it should be, the Will has no such native power over the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>'Tis not the strongest Reason, the best Will, nor any other inherent gift of a Soul, placed in the most health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, athletick, sound and clear Body; that is able wholly
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:50605:132"/>
to direct this faculty, or guide it in any good or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular course, for any space of time; Whatever men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend. Indeed, I have heard of some men, who have so far gloried in their abilities this way, and with all their devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards God (for he is now and then formally brought in, when we are minded to glory of our selves) as to affirm, They have been able to pray several hours in fervency of Spirit, without the least wandring or extravagant thought. Such, are very divine men, we may well think, and happy were we all, if we could be so, in some less degree. But yet I wish, no man deceive himself herein, and that through his own Imagination (<hi>ex post facto,</hi> as we may say) chiefly, and so have a belief thereof raised from the immediate work of that faculty, rather than grounded on Reason, or (what indeed is the impress of a right Imagination) perfect, and sound <hi>memory.</hi> Surely to raise this belief, of, and in a mans self, a man must be in, what we so, call a Trance; Sense must be closed, and shut up for a time, against all Battery: In which case, we'll grant, the Imagination to be sole, or chief Master in the Soul, and then 'tis no marvel, if it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive men into such a temporary belief. But I dare appeal to any such seeming devout Enthusiast, if he has been at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that holy Mystery (a Spiritual Banquet, whereat men usually are, or should be, as intent, and careful to keep their thoughts from wandring, as in any case) whether, present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after, he were not able to tell me, the colour of the Bread, whether white or brown, the fashion of the Chalice, or the kind of Metal, what Vestment the Priest had on, what looks, or gesture, or action he used in the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, and the like. Now if he will confess the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of any such thing, which I dare say, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not truly deny, I may be bold to tell him, His thoughts somewhat wandred. For Memory being no other than the impress of Imagination, or a cogitation renewed, his cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation did a little ramble, and was, through sense, imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about visible Earthly things. And so long as we retain our Senses (which I pray God we may make use of, with our Reason, for fear of a worse inconvenience) we shall scarce be able to judge otherwise of our weakness, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities herein, but have such a true sight of them, as we ought to have, and make us humble, not proud in Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:50605:133"/>I do confess, we seem to have some little power over our Affections, from the very light or strength of Reason in us. Not to let them move one way or other, in relation to objects introduced in the Soul without some kind of prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent allowance, because before they fix, or indeed fly as it were out of the Body, towards imbracing or rejecting any thing, there is a kind of Consult. But the Imagination in its first motion, admits of no consult, nor is capable of Reason's correction till after it has moved. Nay, 'tis so swift and sudden of motion, as nothing whatsoever, can rightly be compared to it in velocity, and swift rise. 'Tis well, if we can any wise stop it, or change it, or alter its course in the end: And surely whensoever that is done, it is done by, or through the Affections, not Strength of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or power in Will, immediately over it. Affection first a little regulated by the light of Reason, and made, as it were, to expect some directions towards the embracing true Happiness, does much help towards the correcting our Imagination. But in this correction, we shall find, or may observe, the Imaginations, better, and more regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar motion, to be, rather by the allurement of some Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than the impulse of the Will, or immediate strength of Reason. Neither Reason, nor Will, can wholly reclaim it from following, or complying with Sense, nor force it to work clean contrary to a present affection. So as, we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign it up to some Power, or Will, than our own, if we expect it should be guided, by any such thing, as what we call Power or Will.</p>
               <p n="3">III. This being premised, That we have no absolute Power or Dominion over the Imagination, but that, as it necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and perpetually worketh, and we cannot quiet it, so it sometimes worketh against our real Will, and we cannot reclaim it (for who is there, who willingly, as I may say, lets it present death of Relations, Friends, and other losses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times before-hand, and withal in such dreadful colours as it does) and that all the rein that we may be said to have hold on, is only from the power which our Reason hath over our Will, not to let our Affections fasten on, or long embrace what is presented to them by the Imagination, if so be our Reason allow it not: This I say premised; Let us, if you please, here examine, how far we may become liable to Divine Justice, or Humane Justice either, for our Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:50605:133"/>
happening, or like to happen, from the work of the Imagination, as principal. Whereabout, having many times puzled my self, in relation to the manner of the Souls work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you shall here have my judgment, or the allowance of my weak Reason, with submission to a stronger, your own.</p>
               <p>But here again, as all along in treating of the Soul, we must suppose, in the motion of any one faculty, no other Principal faculty is wholly exempt and secluded, but has some kind of (seeming) consequent motion with it; As is observable in our very Dreams, wherein men do not only imagine, but seem at least to affect, seem to argue and weigh, and seem to will; Nay some in pursuance thereof, have bodily motion, they talk, they arise, they walk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For if the Imagination were not attended with those other facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or did, or could at any time work alone, or singly of it self, I should readily acquit it in most, if not all cases, as blameless.</p>
               <p>Now then, thus I think, whatsoever false, or naughty or vitious presentment of the Imagination (that is, a first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment in our thoughts, what seems contrary to Gods revealed will, or that law of his imprinted in our minds, if search and inquiry were made) is gratefully accepted by the Affections (Reason then in its full power and strength) though Reason so far restrain the will, and them too, as that there follows no overt Act thereupon, I think doth make us culpable, that is, we sin. Because, were our Affections such as they should be, or such as we might through our strength of Reason, with the invocation of Divine assistance, have made, or rendred them; they would not gratefully accept any thing that were evil, but have a reluctancy against it, and decline it from some prior instruction, I may say, rather than present correction. But if the Affections, upon the first touch of the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, do loath and abhor that evil the Imagination brings or lays before them; We are in no wise answerable for the irregularity or evil contrivance of our Imagination.</p>
               <p>If Reason be totally disabled to work in us that which is right (the defect we call ideocy or perpetual madness) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any negligence or default in us, we are neither answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able (as I think) for our evil Imaginations, evil Affections, or Intentions, nor consequently our evil Actions thereupon. But if that disability came upon us by our own default or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence;
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:50605:134"/>
I think of it otherwise in relation to God, and punishable by him, howe're it may be dispensed withal here, by man.</p>
               <p>If Reason be disabled naturally and inevitably (though for some time only) through the fumes of the Body, and the very inlet, <hi>Sense,</hi> stopped (as in case of sleep) though the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination invent that which is evil, and some of the Affections imbrace the same, and the Will seems to agree and consent thereto; yet is the Soul blameless before man, I think, and God too: For that, Sense being shut, and the Imagination as well counterfeiting the same, as supplying the place of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, we may without any prior obliquity in our Soul, seem only to have the consent of those other faculties to our Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination; Which other faculties, will utterly abhor, abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and forsake what that contrived, as soon as ever Sense is open again, and that they have the influence of any clearer light to move by. And therefore I cannot judge any man culpable for any Act of the Soul whatsoever in a Dream; Let him seem to plot and contrive first, then, to strike, wound, or kill any man whatsoever, I shall not condemn him. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is not, usually, any natural malignity of Affection, or any evil inclination in mans will that first forces the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination to conceive or entertain Evil against Sense, but ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency a good and lawful Affection which forces the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, for the want of the light of Sense, to raise a fear of deprivation of what we best love; and they together, such fear and fancy, composing a Tragedy (for there is no man but dreams oftner of the death of his Friends than of his Enemies) often make us seem the Actors our selves. I, or any man may dream of the killing of his own most beloved Child without offence; Nay, a man may by way of case put, how doleful such an act would prove to him, imagine and think of it waking, and yet loath and abhor the Act, nay tremble at the very thought of it; And therefore it appears to me, a strange folly as well as cruelty in <hi>Dionysius,</hi> if the story be true, That put one of his best friends to Death, for dreaming he had cut his Throat, and alledged no juster cause than this; that what he thought on in the Day, that he dreamed on in the Night. Had the party that told his dream, withal affirmed that his Affections seemed delighted and pleased with the Act; I should have thought there had been some ground for the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, but without such declaration, no colour of Justice for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:50605:134"/>If we voluntarily drown (as we say) our Reason with Wine, we cannot excuse the irregular motion of the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, nor the assent or compliance of the Affections there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; much less the assent of our will, and the putting our thoughts and designs in execution; Yet I cannot allow, that there is thereby an exaltation of the crime, as some Lawyers would, because there is an exaltation of the Imagination. There are two sins indeed, but the latter is not made greater by the former, but rather the contrary. In no other cases of Reasons disability, whether temporary, or perpetual, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that we call Delirium, Lunacy or Phrenzy, and all that we comprize under the general notion of <hi>non compos mentis,</hi> I do verily think, that if it happened, or came, by the default of our own Soul, we are answerable to Divine Justice, for the deliquity of our very Imagination, and the consequent Acts thereof; nay I cannot see, why we should altogether exempt men from human censure, and corporal punishment, if the evil of their Imagination appear at any time by overt act, provided that punishment extend not to the present separation of the Soul and Body, so as to leave the Soul remediless by Death, which for ought we know might recover its pristine state here, and so, purify it self for another state hereafter.</p>
               <p>Most certain it is, men can in these cases of Lunacy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (happening one way or other) imagine, and design evil, and not seldom accomplish and compass their evil designs. And therefore our great Lawyer in commenting upon the Statute of the 25th <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. of Treason, wherein the very Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination is struck at, shews very little of a Philosopher, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he shews of a Lawyer, in my judgment, by telling us, That a man, <note n="(a)" place="margin">Instir. 3. part fol. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Non compos mentis</hi> (a man who is not Master of his Reason, or Reason is of no power or Authority in him, as I expound it) <hi>is totally deprived of compassing and Imagination.</hi> I think he might more truly affirm, that he who imagines the death of our Sovereign, with any the least appearing assent of his Affections, is, <hi>Non compos mentis,</hi> than that a man <hi>Non compos mentis</hi> cannot imagine, or have his Will and Affections assent to that Imagination (which we find but too often in these kind of men) And truly since all our safety depends much on that of our Soverigns, and that Lunacy may be so acted, as the wisest of men cannot discern the reality thereof, I think that Comment might well have been spared, and the question left undecided, till there had been a necessity for it: which
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:50605:135"/>
God prevent! and so of his goodness direct all our thoughts, as that they do not outrun our Reason too far, and kindle in us such a blind zeal, as requires at length a greater power than Reason, to controul and suppress.</p>
               <p>I must confess I have ever looked upon this one faculty in us, Imagination, sufficient to shew us, that the extract of the Soul is Divine: that as it may be, and often is, rather than any other faculty, immediately influenced from that good Spirit, and by it we are enabled sometimes to think that which is good, without any precedent motion of any other faculty; so it is most subject to delusion from infernal Powers. That duly beheld; it almost necessarily drives us, towards an invocation of one Eternal wise Mind, the Creator, Preserver, Guider and Director of all its works. Which is the chief, and last thing I designed to set down in this Treatise.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. We cannot deny unto Beast these four faculties of a Soul, very fimilar with ours, Imagination, Memory, Affection, and Will; But we may and do rationally suppose (for we cannot observe more in them, or the contrary) that they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine through Sense, they remember again from Sense, they affect by Sense, and Will in pursuance hereof only, and not otherwise, as we have touched already: neither can they, or are they enabled to weigh and consider, so as, to raise within themselves an evidence of things unseen; which is the proper act of Reason, a thing merely incorporeal; and necessarily mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving upon the cooperation, and making a judgment with the assistance, or help, of other faculties, of themselves somewhat more than corporeal likewise. So as, all our faculties are of Divine extraction, and capable to be wrought upon otherwise than through Sense, though indeed they are most commonly rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and set on work through bodily Organs, as those of Beasts.</p>
               <p>Most certain it is, that we do, (as well as in that excellent faculty, Reason, whereby we are enabled to ponder, and weigh, and try, and judge of the reality and truth of things) herein excell them, and go beyond them: That we do now and then wish our selves out of this Body which we could never do from Sense; and desire a clearer evidence, or manifestation and appearance of the truth and reality of our own being, and all beings whatsoever, the original from whence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than Sense is able to assist us in, or indeed can rightly afford us. Then next, are not all our Affections readily imployed upon things meerly incorporeal, and insensible, whenever they offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:50605:135"/>
or are offered thereto? Do we not love and admire Truth, Justice, Mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Do we not hate the contraries thereof, falshood, wrong and cruelty? Every one will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess this. But now, how are things brought in this shape to the Affections? Why, chiefly by an Imagination capable of divine impression; an Imagination that may be wrought upon, otherwise than through Sense, and able to introduce appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the other faculties of the Soul, without the least help or assistance by Sense, so as human Imagination is most certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly divine.</p>
               <p>'Tis no battery upon the Soul through Sense barely, no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcating, or telling us by word or Writing, that Vertue is amiable, which properly make it so to us; But first an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest (our Imagination) that presents, and next a Judge (our Reason) that allows and approves of it within us, as such. Indeed Imagination in Beast, lodged immediately over the doors of Sense, do's from thence work so strangely to our admiration; so circumspectly, as I may say, direct their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and Will, as that it has obtained the allowance of some to supply the place of Reason in them. But there is none I suppose that ever admitted them, so far rational, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed so far imaginative, as to search after the ground of their Imagination, whether Sense barely, or somewhat more; or once to imagine or think after what manner they thought. Now surely these thoughts arise in most of us, as of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and if that proceed from any stroke through Sense barely, I have no Reason: and could I not fancy to my self there were existent that which eye never saw, nor ear ever heard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I wanted human Imagination, and such an Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation barely can never proceed from the Body.</p>
               <p>Well Imagination in us alone, revolved, is a thing that most certainly declares our Divinity and extraction, for it shews it self penetrable, otherwise than by Sense. Nay, it appears, being revolved, to be made to work and lead the Will and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently some Affection in direct opposition to Sense. How were it else possible good men should be willing to die, and leave this World? 'Tis not Reason alone and by it self can model and frame a more pleasant state, 'tis not all the bare telling us, there is such, will do it. How were it possible, as I have touched before, that an evil man should be so weary of his life here, as to let out his Soul with his own hands, or by any voluntary act? which Beast never did; 'Tis not any
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:50605:136"/>
stroke through Sense alone, can render his life more miserable to him than all others; there is nothing but self-preservation, and self-existence offers it self through Sense. The Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alone is the cause, It is wrought upon divers and sundry ways, as Divine, not subject to strokes through fense only, but some way else, and from somewhat else than corporeal. We are assaultable divers ways, and in sundry faculties of our Soul; and I deny not but supernatural power (not tied to order) may work its effect originally in Affection, or the Will; but I do think, this facile, pliable, restless, and ever working faculty, <hi>the Imagination,</hi> is oftnest directly and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly assaulted from insensible powers, and the work of our conversion, as well as destruction, not seldom begun there.</p>
               <p>The Imagination ever meets with somewhat Divine in its own work, admit there were no other faculty apparently in conjunction with it at first. It is commonly said, that that man is of very weak parts, or ordinary capacity, or in an evil condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who cannot entertain himself with his own thoughts. Now if he do but that first (and no man can but do it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times) that is, think of his thoughts, he will have Affection and Reason attendant, and then he must needs see, and be inflamed therewith, that these thoughts of thought arose from somewhat more than Sense, no Sense could lead him back to think of thinking, or be the direct occasion thereof: and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding further to weigh and consider the manner of his thoughts, together with his sometimes strange Affections, he will by a kind of necessary consequence observe, that Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in man is not merely actuated through Sense, and that, by these two consequents.</p>
               <p>First, there will appear to him, there was no certain me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod or order in the motion of the several faculties of his Soul, but that sometimes the Affections seemed to move from the Imagination, sometimes the Imagination from the Affections.</p>
               <p>Next there will appear an independence and direct breach of his thoughts at peculiar Seasons, and that without any new stroak through Sense; for though there be generally, as I have touched, a concatenation of mans thoughts (as certainly there is always in Beast) until that link be broken by a stroke through Sense, yet upon due examination, man will find it otherwise at some time in himself.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:50605:136"/>I. That there is no direct approach from one human Soul unto another but through Sense, I confess and agree, and that he who would inform or rectify our Reason or Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and bend and incline our Affections to, or from, that thing it already stands bent or inclined, must necessarily enter that way, that is by Sense, and thereby consequently first make some slight touch upon the Imagination. So as, the Soul seems generally to work from Sense; first by the Imagination with the assent or allowance of Reason, and next the Will and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and yet even in this manner of its work, there is so suddain a stroke upon all of them as it were together, that no man can directly affirm, priority or posteriority in the work of either of those faculties of the Soul, or that one is in time before or after other. But when we are sometimes alone, and the Soul works as it were of it self (though indeed not of it self) without any apparent stroke through Sense, it may be, nay appears upon a serious retrospect and considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, otherwise.</p>
               <p>Do we not, or may we not observe, there has been some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a burning within us? our Affections on the suddain kindled and inflamed in a kind of expectancy, we well know not how or of what? and so as it were creating thoughts in us, divers from what we ever had, or perhaps otherwise would ever have been. Sometimes we find Reason suddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enlightned, to the disallowance and correction of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent as well as past thoughts, Will, and Affections, whereby there is a strange mutation wrought in the Soul; Sometimes we find such a thing as a Will wrestling and struggling in us, to change and alter our present thoughts and Affections, and they have been changed. But more often may we observe, a suddain irresistible thought arising in us (without any help or assistance of Sense that we can perceive or observe, nay some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in a direct opposition to Sense as it were) we know not, nor can find whence or how; whereby our other facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties subjected as it were thereto, some work is wrought, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the conclusion to the glory of some all-powerful irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistible Will, as we conjecture by the consequence, and shall most certainly find in the end.</p>
               <p>Now if the course and manner of the Souls work be not always the same, but so various and seeming preposterous, so alterable, mutable or changeable in its work, and yet that alteration is not made by any stroke through bodily Organs,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:50605:137"/>
neither is there any apparent cause to be found, why the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections should be inflamed, or Reason enlightned on the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain in opposition to an evil or false Imagination, or an Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination suddainly raised in opposition to delectancy through present Sense; then is the Soul (in every part) a thing most certainly Divine, capable of insensible influence, and not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from the Body. For if it were of the Body, and so necessarily required, for its motion or agitation, a stroke through bodily Organs, the course of its motion would always be regular, and continue after one and the same manner: Man must see and feel, and hear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and perfectly conceive by his Imagination through Sense before he be affected, and then I should be ready to grant, the Imagination to be the Principal faculty in mans Soul, and the other faculties to be raised and created thereby, and to work in obedience thereto, as I hold it does in Beast; But so long as I find I have willed, I have affected, I have imagined, without the help, beyond the reach, and sometimes as it were in a direct opposition to Sense, I shall continue to believe my Soul is somewhat more than an extracted quintessence of the Body, and subject to the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of some incorporeal power.</p>
               <p>Nay were not the Imagination, at least, subject to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and stroke of some supernatural, invisible, insensible power,</p>
               <p n="2">II. There would necessarily be a certain concatenation of my thoughts, and a dependance upon each other, until they were interrupted and broke in sunder by some immediate stroke through Sense, which happens not at all times, as may be observed.</p>
               <p>I do here agree that there is generally, as I have touched, a concatenation of all mens thoughts, even at such time as they seem to ramble upon some prior inlets through Sense, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any introduction or help through present Sense; But yet narrowly inspected we shall find and observe, the Imagination now and then to catch and lay hold on (or rather to be caught with) things, strangely different from, and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of, what it last entertained; and that a thought may succeed a thought, such, as has neither the least dependance with the former, nor yet can be found to proceed from the stroke of any Object through Sense, present, or prior, For instance, After a long sleep, wherein the Imagination has roved some few hours, and in those few hours has touched upon a
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:50605:137"/>
thousand several things, and each several prior thing might be found the cause of introduction of the subsequent (if the impression were so deep, or our memory so good in sleep, as to afford us any ground for asearch and observation and judgment thereon) we no sooner awake (whether through a vain fear or joy attendant upon a vain Imagination, or otherwise from a sufficient temporary refreshment of the Body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) but there is sometimes darted as it were into our Imagination (we may say before our Reason is awake) something as clean dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from, independent of, and contrary to, all our past thoughts, as may be, or is possible; perhaps very divine thoughts, such as were not in us at any time before, possess us for a while, and pass away again without due regard or examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; perhaps good moral thoughts, of Justice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> clean different from what we had at any time before, arise in us; and this in such dark and quiet silence of the night, as no Sense could help it to catch hold on, unless that of feeling; by which these thoughts certainly could never arise.</p>
               <p>Nay we will put this waking case of the Imagination, if I were looking, and lusting, and withal contriving to satisfy my (what some men may admit innocent) Lust, that is, all my faculties were busied and imployed in the fulfilling there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and no battery through Sense is made upon me, nay no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection from any former stroke through Sense occurs to me; If I shall on the suddain (be startled through Imagination, and begin to think that which I never thought before my Will and Affectons still standing bent and inclined as they were before) that the thing I am now about is evil, (be it Reason, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, or Grace, or whatsoever men are pleased to call it, that is the cause of such thought) most certainly my Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is not the Subject of a bare stroke through Sense only, but somewhat more: For to think clean contrary, on the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, to what a man thought, without the help of Sense, nay perhaps against the present delectancy of Sense, shews more of a mere spiritual effect in the Soul, than bare independency of thought can do. And he who finds not, and acknowledges this sometimes strange stroke upon his Spirit, (upon his Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination at least if it go no further) is wholly deprived of the custody of that seal or stamp of the Imagination, which we call <hi>Memory,</hi> or else is very stubborn.</p>
               <p>The Soul is doubtless a good subject to think on. If the very thoughts of it in general, raise not such a sight and such a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:50605:138"/>
in man, as shall make him endeavour to pursue that which is good and right in the sight of all men; It will raise such a doubt, attended with some kind of fear, of its perpetuity, as shall somewhat obstruct his pursuit of that which is evil and naught in the sight of all men. But above all, the very thought of his thoughts in particular, how strangely they arise, how inconsistently they work, how insensibly they are imployed, shall amaze him for the present, and at length drive him to the invocation of some Spiritual Eternal Omnipotent being.</p>
               <p>Lord evermore keep this door of our Soul! this common passage, that nothing enter thereby to the pollution or disfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this most admirable frame in Nature; lodged in human Body for the present, but made to endure after the dissolution thereof, to thy Glory, whether by misery or happiness, and though parted from that Body for a time, never to vanish. Keep it shut, against all deadly and destructive assaults, from Satan and his Emissaries. Never let it be wrought upon to contradict Sense directly, and Reason too, though it sometime surmount both through thy gracious influence.</p>
               <p>When a man begins to think, how far his thoughts are out of his power, how little his own, or of himself (and who is there that now and then thinks not after this manner) and that Sense is not the only inlet to the Soul, but we are often led by the Spirit into temptation, as well as guided to that which is good; It is sufficient to make a man besides himself I confess, and on the one hand, if he pursue that which is palpably evil in the sight of most men, to excuse his sloth with a kind of inability in himself to resist; and on the other hand, if he find out, or light on that which is good, but in his own conceit and Imagination, to mount a little too much above himself, and conclude he is graciously inspired.</p>
               <p>This notion of an insensible Spirit working in man, and this insensible thinking, say some, proceeds from a scurvy black humor in the Blood only, called Melancholy. Well let it be so thought by some for the present (for it cannot be made out) so long as we retain our Reason to correct our thought in some measure, think not too highly, nor too dejectly of our selves, are not dismaid, nor altogether confounded in thought: And then in, that thing called, Reason, Let any man (first wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his objection of Melancholy as much a chimaera of his making in some cases, as any God of mine) shew me and convince me by any satisfactory argument, why my thoughts
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:50605:138"/>
(if but thoughts alone) have been thus intent and busied on this subject (the Soul of man, whence it is, how, and after what manner it works) beyond many thousands of men, endued with more sprightly or lively Affection, of clearer and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Invention, of better and firmer Memory, of stronger and sounder Judgement, of every way greater abilities, attended with fitter opportunities, and greater leisure, less pestered and troubled, or sorrounded with wordly affairs, or indeed the pleasures of the World; And this at such times as I have strived to cast away the thoughts thereof, and could willingly have pleased my self with sensible Objects, even offering themselves as it were to my Affections; and I shall adhere to him and become his Convert.</p>
               <p>In the mean time I cannot believe the more than ordinary imployment of my thoughts on such subject proceeded from any peculiar humor in the Body, nor that any stroke upon the Imagination through Sense at any peculiar instant before caused it; Nor yet do I believe or so much as once think it to have been the immediate gracious influence or inspiration of that Holy Spirit. I have always had so much strength of Reason left me, as to keep me from that inflammation of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and I pray God we may all so have, howsoever he is pleased to work in us: But this I think, and find, and know, that mans thoughts are not always of himself, and therefore I very well agree with the melancholy temper (as it may be thought) of those men, who have prescribed us the following form of invocation of the Almighty Spirit of the World, and that immediately before the hearing his Commands, that it would please him, <hi>Unto whom all hearts be open, all desires known, and from whom no secrets are hid, to cleanse the thoughts of our hearts</hi> (where I yet hold, most of them are hatched or fostered, at least our considerate thoughts) <hi>by the inspiration of his Holy Spirit, &amp;c.</hi> But I do not agree with that man that shall now a days affirm, that his or any mans particular Thoughts are throughly cleansed at any time; we cannot so judge by our Reason, while we consider the vanity and folly of our Thoughts at most seasons, and I am sure we have nothing else, properly, to judge by. Some will tell me, my Reason is carnal, and cannot judge of Spiritual things; I say Reason of it self is not carnal, it is of Divine extraction (I think I have made it so appear) it is an heavenly gift already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on us, and by which chiefly, we must try the Spirits
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:50605:139"/>
wherher they are of God or no; I, and that too, through Sense most commonly, for he who tryes and judges otherwise, does it from Imagination barely. Some will tell us of their faith, their zeal, or love of God; If it be pure, and real, I will readily admit it to proceed from that gracious Spirit: But how can I, or they themselves, well judge it to be, otherwise than by Reason, from sensible and visible effects? That may deceive us indeed, but that is the best and safest Judge we have in us at any time. I know not how to appeal to mens Spirits, in that notion some accept the word, <hi>viz.</hi> an immediate light or voice from Heaven that dictates; but I appeal to the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, safest, and best distinguishing faculty of their Spirit, their Reason; Whether in the case aforesaid, (relating to Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press commands, as well as those private ones written in our hearts) If the thought of our Hearts were cleansed by the immediate inspiration of his Holy Spirit, we should then look upon obedience towards our Superiors and Governours, Chastity and Temperance towards our selves, Truth and Justice, nay Love and Charity towards all men, as abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely necessary and consequent, as Zeal, heat against Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Profaneness, or our observation of days. We cannot rationally think, though that Spirit be not limited or confined, that the good effect it has upon man, will not be as visible, in one equally known duty as another; Or that we can be truly zealous (though Imagination may sometimes render us so to our selves) but we must be truly charitable.</p>
               <p>I cannot yet think we ought to be so born again, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to cast away our Reason, or so much to neglect it as not duly to consult it (a thing through which, chiefly, we are born again if we are born again) but follow our Imagination only. I do not think Reason was a thing given us, directly to resist or oppose, and wholly reject every stroke, that first wounds or possesses the Imagination, or Affections, if it came not directly or apparently through Sense, and presently conclude it the sole Embryo of the Imagination; No, Reason, the best and strongest, does many times give place for a trembling yet fast hold on Mercy from Eternal decrees. But yet I think, that in the most evident cases of an immediate work, of some other Spirit than our own, in and over our own, we may, nay we ought to retain, and make use of our Reason, by consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, weighing and trying all sensible consequents, that may happen, whether good or evil, and curb the Imagination
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:50605:139"/>
and Affections, for entertaining them in other colours, than what upon due advice, that only or chiefly puts upon them.</p>
               <p>The worst enemy of mankind needs no greater advantage over mens Souls, than to have them follow, or be given up to follow their own Inventions, or Imaginations, without any dispute or struggling of present Reason within them, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the deception and fallacy, that may be therein. He shall never want, besides ordinary Sinners, Enthusiasts, Dreamers, Visionists, Prophets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and, with the help of some base Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Statists, and modellers of Governments, enough to set the whole World in a flame and uproar. (And that they do not, as the World now seems to go, is God's wonderful providence over it.) If a man once come to lose the use of that rein, or let it go, or rather cast it away by the strength of some Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection (that is, devise and pursue, that which he would not, others should devise and pursue, were his case theirs and that in justice too) I doubt even his Prayers to God, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the course of his thoughts, or his present thinking only, that that which he thinks is right, will little avail him in the end.</p>
               <p>For such particular persons, as pretend and positively af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, to see visions, and hear voices, and declare them, as sen<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And yet we see such accepted for men in their wits, as we say, and allowed of by some Statists, who would be angry perhaps we should tell them they wanted Reason, although we may truly tell them, without just cause of offence, they do not lay aside all passion to exercise it. If there were two, never so credible witnesses, who should testify upon Oath, a call, or voice of this Nature to a third person, and own as much as is recorded of those who journey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <note n="(a)" place="margin">Acts 9.7.</note> 
                  <hi>St. Paul to Damascus,</hi> I profess I should very hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give credit to any such thing now adays. For being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready sufficiently satisfied and convinced, even in Reason, that the Reason and necessity of supernatural Oracles, Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and Miracles (since <hi>God spake to us by his Son,</hi> in those

last days <note n="(b(" place="margin">Heb. 1.2.</note> and the Christian Religion was fully establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) is at an end and ceased, I shall rather believe there were some imposture in the case, or the Imagination of those two laboured under the same fallacy with the third, by infection from it, and by a kind of Sympathy (to which way of fallacy some of the learned have subjected this faculty of the Soul) and that neither of them, in reality, heard ought.</p>
               <p>'Tis Imagination only or chiefly, which renders men thus bold and familiar with God, which makes them so positive and dictating to man. Reason is not so towring, it is ever attended with humility and fear; It is weak in us, God knows, and it is his Wisdom and Will, it should be so; yet a faith from thence, though weaker and trembling, is usually more lasting, than from that predominant faculty in man, Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. 'Tis Imagination that makes us believe well and highly of our selves, and meanly of those, whom it might seem in Reason, God has placed over us, dictating and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing forms of Government, with a <hi>nolumus hunc,</hi> or <hi>hunc, regnare</hi>: But in this very case, Affection may rather seem to corrupt Imagination, than Imagination to debauch Affection. I did once mean to discourse to you of the general deception of mankind herein, but I know you see and espy it, and God alone is able to prevent it, which I trust he will do in some measure, and therefore lest I seem to some to be of any party, I forbear; and to all such as at present hearken to our argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative (as if they had Reason on their side) Imaginatists, I have only this to say: If they have left them but half an Eye (a Phrase sometimes used for an ordinary Reason) and will but make use of it, if they then do not find out, and espy, some self-Affection aiding and assisting most of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers Imagination in their Plat-forms and Expedients, rather than Reason, Let them then swallow down with them this as a good rational maxime, That evil may be done, that good may come thereon.</p>
               <p>I have ever in my judgment looked on evil Affection, and strong blind Imagination, always so actually in conjunction to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, above other faculties, to our confusion; and so pernicious to our present and future happiness, as nothing more: I know not which to give the precedency to, nor indeed well how to distinguish them in some cases. Pride, in general, the Mother of all evil passion, is defined (and rightly defined) to be, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:50605:140"/>
else but a good opinion, or high conceit of a Man's self; Spiritual Pride is somewhat more, it is a bold presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous arrest of the Deity, making him our Inmate to cover and colour our Pride; and where that once is, and takes pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, 'tis in vain to knock at the door of Reason. If I should admit Reason it self to be wholly out of our power, and that we were specially directed in our very judgment, I can yet say truly with <hi>David</hi>

               <head>EPIST. VI. Wherein the Author treats of the various impress of the Divine Power, upon each particular created substance, more especially upon the Souls of Men: And further shews, how proue we are to mistake about the case and temper of others and our own, and that they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally are not, what they seem: And thence proceeds to discourse of Friendship, and of Love.</head>
               <p>MY good and kind Friend (for so I am bold to salute you in this Epistle, wherein I mean to say somewhat of that human, yet sacred tye, Friendship) Let a man behold any thing he will or can, and search for the original cause of its so being, and 'tis somewhat a wonder to me, he should prove so stupid and senseless, not to behold it; or at least not to afford it some proper attribute, and allow it so much as the title of incomprehensibly Wise, or the like; since that <note n="(a)" place="margin">Ps. 75.1.</note> 
                  <hi>that his name is near, his wondrous works declare.</hi> Some such dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent or distinguishable form there is in every visible Body whatsoever upon the face of the whole earth, narrowly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected or observed as, that (howsoever we generally stile all things the work of Nature) our Intellect, by and through our Sense, is able to espy some Image of an infinite wise Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, ruling in, and through that thing we call Nature; for she of her self as a blind Goddess, like Fortune, could never imprint so various a stamp upon every individual, unless di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by such a first power, as is eternally one and the same, and yet able to give various forms unto every created, or extracted substance; but would produce, though not the same, yet often some indistinguishable, or unperceivable like.</p>
               <p>I do not think it will be denied me by any rational man, that amongst all the faces of men (not the worst <hi>index</hi> of a Soul) which have been or now remain upon the face of the Earth, there never were two Visages (as we say) so like, but that they might be easily known or distinguished from each other, or the one from the other; And if I should of my self further alledge, that there never was one single grain of Corn, nay so much as one single medal, of the same metal with others, and receiving its impress from one and the same stamp or mold,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:50605:141"/>
but there might be found upon the same, by diligent and curious inspection or observation, some different form or mark sufficient to distinguish it from any other, which could be produced of the same kind or species, I should say no more than is true, being confident that no man is able to produce two such Bodies together (of any magnitude) wherein I, or some other, may not be able to shew him an apparent diversity. I would fain know how it otherwise comes to pass, that the Bee knows any one of a separate Hive, or the Ant its own Eggs (though I find not that quick inspect in other Creatures) as may be observed in the stirring of their several heaps; But my meaning here is not to trouble your more serious thoughts about Flies, but to let you know mine, in reference to the Souls of men chiefly, with some grounds and reason thereof.</p>
               <p>They have been these; That amongst all the works of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or more properly the God of Nature, no such great and various dissimilitude is to be found, as in that chief and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal work of his, the Souls of men; whether of themselves, or arising from the subject wherein they work, shall not in this place be my chief enquiry. But since we daily find, and observe, or may so at least, a Soul of a great magnitude inclosed in a narrow Body or Prison; and a very narrow small contracted Soul, in a large one; A vigorous and active Soul, in a weak Body; A feeble, in a strong and well built one; A bright and beautiful, in a cloudy and deformed one; A black and deformed, in a clear and beautiful one; nay any in any; we have no Reason to conjecture that it receives any chief or sole power of its operation from thence, much less its strange vicissitudes and changes; since Seasons may be observed, when though through the Organs of Sense, all the most pleasant worldly objects are let into the Soul, it will be dismal and sad, and sometime notwithstanding all the gastly Spectacles which can be presented to her, she will be pleasant and joyful; and all this as well at such times, as the Body is strong and vigorous, as when it is weak and feeble; as well sickly as healthful, and as well healthful as sickly: And that the Body should cause a visible mutation in the Soul, when there is none discernible in it self, by the very Soul that inhabits it, will hardly obtain a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional assent, but that they are as they are, by original Creation, or some external actuation.</p>
               <p>We vary from one another in relation to our Soul's acting, far beyond what any Creature does from others of the same
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50605:142"/>
                  <hi>species</hi> with it self; Some similitude or likeness of the Souls motion is to be found in them, but none, or very little, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us. And this various and different kind of operation in us, as to Intellect and Affection both, shews an original dissimilitude (for being as much alike one another in Body, as any Creature of one <hi>species,</hi> we should act as much alike if the Soul had its being from the Body) rather than any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental or casual one, happening from some formation of the flesh. Do we not observe all Brute Creatures of one and the same <hi>Species,</hi> though in several Climates, to use the same way of policy in point of their preservation? Do they not build their Nests alike? and do they not express their Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect alike; whether by obedience or disobedience to us, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by their crouching, fawning, or resistance? Are they not alike cunning? But are there two men to be found in the World, think you, who, left to themselves, without instruction, or without a Precedent or Plat-form before them, would do as they do in their kind? Surely besides the various form of each, one would prove a <hi>Lucullus,</hi> and another a <hi>Diogenes</hi>; one would think no dwelling too spatious and beautiful for him, and the other would think a mean and plain one were most useful, and best became him. We differ in the manner of expressing our Intellect legibly, equally as in our Intellect; Could we behold the formation of the Issues of several mens brains, upon any subject matter, we should find one mans begun at the head, anothers at the foot, a third at the middle, and none alike, but every mans variously; One would bring forth his Brat with all its lineaments and features at the first, and yet perhaps a weak one; another his, very deformed (with much labour and pains licked into form, according to that erroneous Tenet of the Bear) and yet perhaps a strong one: And were lick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or rather correction and amendment of the most perfect and exact piece, committed to divers men successively, we should find in some space, it would prove like <hi>Theseus</hi> his Ship, renewed by planks, it might retain the first name, but would not have one jot of the old materials remaining. We scarce comment or expound alike in any degree or measure: that agreement of the Seventy or seventy two Interpreters is related as a wonder, and were I assured of the truth of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, I should so esteem it, nay one of the greatest wonders the World ever afforded in story.</p>

                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:50605:142"/>In this great and chief work of the Creation, the Soul of man (especially wrought and effected for the setting forth the Glory of the Creator) wherein there are diversities of gifts, and diversities of administrations, and diversities of operations, and one God who worketh all in all; It is no wonder, that we are altogether ignorant, either in our selves or others, of the power and manner of its operation; but are inforced to leave that to the Creator, and are only able to behold and see the great variety and strange dissimilitude of human Souls (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond those Spirits of other Creatures) how unlike every one is to another, and sometimes to it self, for want of a gracious influence, and thereby behold that one single and simple es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, darting out its various rayes upon all the World, and our selves chiefly. It is we alone, that may be most like that essence, who are most unlike one another, by his drawing us to himself, and as it were renewing this wonderful Image of his, perhaps variously defaced, but happily mutable. Did ever man yet behold two Souls, naturally, as we say in common acceptation, alike? There is one who venturing upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parisons in the case, amongst others, brings in <hi>Demosthenes</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> together, and tells us in his entrance upon their lives, how fortune might seem to have framed them out of one mold, and Nature fashioned their qualities alike; and yet in the Conclusion, he tells us, that as their Phrase differed, and the one was grave and harsh, the other jesting and pleasant; so one of them was sharp, perverse, froward, and sowre of Nature, the other complaisant; the one modest and bashful, the other full of ostentation, and extremely ambitious of Glory, or vain-glorious; the one excessively Covetous, even to corruption, and the selling of his eloquence; the other not so, but liberal and just. And surely had he been throughly acquainted with their several dispositions, he might have found divers other contrary qualities in them, and perhaps not two alike in any degree, and those mutable too; and their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers so to vary, that he might have seen his pleasant man sometimes froward, and his froward sometimes pleasant, and not been able to give a reason thereof.

               <p>I know a Gentleman, who was wont to say of himself, that he merited not any praise for his being a just and honest man, for that he had a plentiful estate left him, which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed in peace; Had I been poor, says he, I know not what I should have been to become rich; I fear I should have been a knave; which was a true saying in the main, whether the good man feared it or not. The knowledge of a mans self is more heavenly than the command, and if ever man had such a gift as that, I am sure he must receive it from Heaven. There is certainly such a saying came down from Heaven, as, <hi>Ye know not of what Spirit ye are</hi>: are though that speech, as you seem to intimate in one place, may receive some limitation or qualification, and it may be manifest to any man, upon search for the time past, from whence his Soul had its motion, and in what state and condition he at present stands; yet surely no further than the very present; for if any man could fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see his future thoughts, or the motion of his Affections, his consequent intentions and actions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he must necessarily know more than himself, and dive into the secrets of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, after what manner he has preordained all things to work for his Glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:50605:143"/>Every particular Soul is so unlike every other, and (not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to any course of Nature) sometimes so unlike it self, that it is not to be known by any but its Maker; neither is any man able to declare, or rightly conjecture his future manners. And this is from the goodness of God, that we might find just cause to ascribe all goodness (if any such thing be found in us) to him; Rely on him, trust in him solely, and thither fly for relief in all our wants, and for a cure in all our infirmities, and not to ascribe any thing to our selves, or any other Creature.</p>
               <p>There are some perhaps who seem to think the Souls of men more similar in their original Creation, or emanation, than in truth they are; And that of themselves they would be more quiet, and bend or incline more one and the same way (perhaps like those of Beasts) were it not for some several <hi>Genius,</hi> or instructor, that every human Soul had for its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant, whereby it is sometimes directed, bended, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined. Indeed I do think there is such a thing as a <hi>Genius</hi> in every man, that is, some distinct or different character on every Soul, in the manner and way of expressing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering it self out to others, such as thereby a wise man, when he comes to be familiarly acquainted with it, will be able in some measure to distinguish it from any other, as well as the face by any grace or feature, and so a Soul may be outwardly distinguished, though not inwardly known; And the Soul has most properly this attribute bestowed on it, or conjoyned to it, when by some unusual sharp edge or smart stroke, it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with a kind of life into others, nay gives life to Paper it self (as he who had a very quick and piercing <hi>Genius,</hi> seems to <note n="(a)" place="margin">

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50605:144"/>
and from thence men frame and fansie within themselves, some brave discerning Spirit or <hi>Genius</hi> more than in truth they ever were indowed withal: But if every Soul has necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily this kind of Attendant, to advise with, and to inform him, what were best to be undertaken or let alone; whereon to place his Affections in this World, or not to place them, and the like; My <hi>Genius</hi> has proved a very ignorant one, or else deceitful and treacherous to me: for this I can say, whenever I have been confident to obtain, or trusted in my own strength or wisdom, I have ever had the worst success; when I have feared or suspected the worst event, things have succeeded better; When I have placed my Affections too strongly on any thing, it has never prospered so well, as those I less regarded; which is ground sufficient for me to believe, not a <hi>Genius</hi> or familiar Spirit, but, a God on whom I might cast all my care, and who careth for us. And surely the Soul of every other man, notwithstanding any liberty of Will it may now and then seem to it self to have, upon dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent inspection, and view of its own strange, and sometimes weak, and ignorant manner of operation, and yet better than it self, or its <hi>Genius</hi> could contrive, may soonest termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and rest in the opinion of one original Spring of all motion, that, <hi>sum, &amp; non mutor,</hi> without introducing any strange <hi>Spectrum, Genius</hi> or <hi>Familiar</hi>; or yet delivering it self up to the dominion of Necessity or Fortune.</p>
               <p>These strange opinions we have, in relation to our Souls, and the impossibility to discern our selves throughly, much less others, subjects us to false opinions of our selves, and false conjectures, at least, of others. For as to the discerning part of anothers Soul, the Intellect, doubtless we commit sometimes great mistakes. There are, and have been cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly many Souls, who though, for want of some outward ornament, or some casual advancement or improvement (by which we are only capable to apprehend them, or conceive ought in relation to their Intellect) they have not been able to express themselves plainly and evidently to the capacity of others; yet have had a very clear inspect into the truth and reality of things; And we are not rationally to think, because we find them not in story, that therefore there were no wise men before <hi>Apollo,</hi> as well as valiant men before <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> and so are, and will be for the future, unknown and unheard of to us. Nor should we look upon our selves,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:50605:144"/>
who dare to set forth our folly and weakness, rather than ought else, legibly to the World, to be the only men of parts. God knows how far the best and wisest go astray from the truth, and it might be easily evident to humanity, if men would take the pains to weigh things, how much light coyn has passed for currant. Men there are, who have words at will or command, and know how to place them in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent order; but if they were to pass <hi>Solomon</hi>'s test, and should be duly weighed in the ballance, we should find them to be but words, and carry nothing of weight or solid matter in them.</p>
               <p>As to the censure of the affectionary, or imbracing part of mans Soul, doubtless we commit as many, and as great Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and mistakes. That unsearchable thing (as <note n="(a)" place="margin">Prov. 25.3.</note> 
                  <hi>Solomon</hi> terms it in a King, and doubtless is so, in others) the <hi>Heart,</hi> is not certainly known by any outward motion, neither the gesture, nor the lips will at any time fully discover it to a spectator, or auditor; and there is little trust to be given to what a man receives in at second hand; It is so ordinarily mistaken in man, that truly he who would judge aright, had need I think vary from the general censure of the World. If a man be but a little facile, he is presently esteemed for good, and yet perhaps the <hi>Italian</hi> Proverb may be verified of him,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tanto buon, the vale nient.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>That he is so good, as that he is good for nothing.</hi> There is a great mistake of that which we call good Nature; I for my part think, that if a man be so soft and pliable, as to take an equal impression from all men (that is indeed none) he has little of real goodness in him. He who will never be angry, will (in a strict Sense) never be pleased; and he who never thinks evil of any man, will never think well of any man, nor becomes ones special Friend, upon the ground of a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and good life; and though Charity prompt us to think the best of such a man, yet Reason informs us (and without breach of charity we may think) nothing really good, that is insipid; and that if a man have lost his savour, and taste all things alike, there is little of vertue in him, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there may be of goodness. Goodness, if there be any such thing in man, must since our Fall (how ere we were created) be looked on as a Grace, not a natural habit, and he is only good, who intentionally, in respect to God, is so; not he, who is, as it were, so habitually, or casually, and unawares to himself, as we say. I am sure it is no uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:50605:145"/>
part in man, but rather the contrary, to think, that some persons, whom we seem to behold surly, cross and pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish in their words, and actions too sometimes, have good intentions and meaning in the general: And though in propriety of Speech, a man cannot be said to act against his Will, but the Will ever accompanies both words and actions; yet there may be something besides of a latent Will in the Soul, or wish of good to the party injured, even at the very time of the injury.</p>
               <p>Indeed it is said, he who is of a currish churlish Nature, should sacrifice to the Graces; but we might pass him by, and pardon him without Sacrifice, and ascribe that to the Bodies temperature in that particular case, which we are but prone and apt enough to do, in many other cases. There is a kind of condiment, or sharp acrimonious humour in the blood (not that the Soul is made or compounded of any such) which the Spirit meeting with in its operation or motion, raises outwardly a kind of mire or dirt, and yet may be clean it self. I have seldom met with injustice, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression cruelty or rapine in a snarling habit, though I have often seen them all in a fawning one, and that Scripture ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, there are things <hi>smoother than oyl, yet are they drawn Swords.</hi> There are rugged, obscure and dark passages in Palaces, which lead to the fairest rooms; and there are soul Sepulchers, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly painted, and constant bright and pleasant shining Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, set burning before them: And we often therefore judge amiss, when we judge of the mind by such indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>It is a blessed happiness, when a quick working Soul, can at all times flie abroad into the World, and search every thing to the quick, as we say, without offence, and without venom; but it is very rare, that that salt, or gall, which has been allowed ever by the learned to quicken the Invention, should not sometimes exceed due measure, and be mistaken for ill nature in the Affections. Affection, of it self, is not evil by nature, it is blinded since the Fall, and strangely led; and truly whether it be good or evil, upright or crooked in the main intention and consequent, is impossible for us certainly to know.</p>
               <p>It is esteemed now adays, and perhaps ever was, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal part of a Wise man, to become acquainted and versed with the several humours and tempers of several men, and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:50605:145"/>
throughly to study and know a man: But as it is an insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious study, I think, unless in case of your profession only, with a purpose barely to reclaim the Soul, and make it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; So it is a very fallacious one, and in that respect may doubtless be very well linked with that of judicial Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, and many men have but deceived themselves, while they thought to know others. Surely he who practises upon any Individual, beside himself, and pryes narrowly into others, is not like to find any path, that will lead him towards Happiness; This he will be sure to find in every Soul, a self-love, inclosed about with Briars and Thorns, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in no man's power, to eradicate or grub up those Briars and Thorns, growing in every man by Nature, as we say (unless in himself, if so be that) he may chance to be scratch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and torn thereby, while he thinks to bring that love to his own Lure.</p>
               <p>He who is so curious to inquire into mens Natures, and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, and thinks he has found out every root and string of their Affection, and judges good perhaps, to indeavour some mutual and interchangeable transplantation of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection (that thing I mean to speak of <hi>friendship</hi>) for the melioration thereof; had need be very wary and circumspect in his choice, and rely upon a Divine watering, and pruning too, as well as his own planting; or else perhaps, though it grow, and thrive with him, it may bear him little or no good Fruit.</p>
               <p>The variety and diversity of human Souls with their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral seeming inclinations, and suddain alterations; and that innate, unsatiate love in man (receiving its inflammation some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times otherwise than by Sense) from whence, every one la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and travails to secure and advance it self, by some means or other; and especially the difficulty of discerning the motion of the Spirit in a mans self, much more in another, is the cause in my opinion, why there is so little of true, and real Friendship amongst us in the World, and that there have been in all Ages, so small a number of faithful Friends reckoned up, and that our love is changeable, mutable, and unconstant: When as we may daily espy in other Creatures of different <hi>Species,</hi> even a Lyon and a Whelp bred up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, a constant and continued love to each other, during their lives, I may say, without design, or without dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:50605:146"/>Of Friendship I have read, or been taught somewhat, when I was a Boy; which as I long since utterly forgot, so I mean not now to have recourse thither again, or to any other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor that treats thereof; but having already adventured to meddle with the Soul, I am minded to say somewhat of that league or union of Souls, <hi>Friendship,</hi> to you my Friend; and to give you my natural thoughts of it only, according to my plain rustick way, and manner of delivery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Friendship,</hi> I take to be an union, or <hi>knitting</hi> together of two Souls (as is expressed of <hi>Ionathan</hi> and <hi>David</hi>) in amity, so as the one loves the other as it self; Or more particularly, <hi>An human, yet sacred tye, made and contracted between two Souls, in the mutual and reciprocal aspect, of some similitude and likeness in each other; Each shining in some degree, after the similitude and likeness of its Maker.</hi> So that to the contracting thereof, it is necessary the party who loves as a Friend, do behold in the other some Image or shadow at least, and Goodness, Truth, Justice, Mercy, Love (especially) and the like; without this view or supposed view, there can arise no such Love as is called Friendship. Or if you please, we will in short de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine it thus; Whereas Charity is a general love to all men, for God's sake; So, <hi>Friendship, is a love to some particular person, for the persons sake, yet ever having a respect to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Friendship being a kind of alliance of two Souls, resembles somewhat an alliance by blood, or a consanguinity, as we call it; He who would make out that to any man, must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily resort to some one fountain, head, or Ancestour; and from thence trace, and bring down the blood to himself and the other party, without any corruption or attainter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervening. And our Soul being a distinct gift, and a distinct creation or breathing which we receive not from our Parents; it is necessary in Friendship, that as two Souls concenter in belief of one head, and fountain of their being; So there be no visible corruption thereof, but that each participate some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the Image of its Maker, and leave not quite off, to be Loving, Just, Merciful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at least be not stig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized with any Character of Uncharitableness, Injustice, Cruelty, or the like; whereby that Image seems defaced; and therefore no Atheist can be a friend to any man, nor any other man so to him: For if there be such an human Creature in the World, who verily believes there is no God, he must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently believe, there is no such thing, as Justice, or Mercy, or
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:50605:146"/>
no need thereof towards our particular quiet or well-being; and such man's kindness, whatsoever he pretend, is no other than a mere self-love and respecting himself barely, and not Friendship; neither can any one love that man, who rejects or disowns the Wisdom of his Maker, and attributes all to, what we call, Nature, or Chance. Besides this; If there be any men, who own a God, and yet live as <hi>without God in the World,</hi> though they readily perform all offices of kindness faithfully to each other, that I hold not to be Friendship but call it rather a Satanical League, than Friendship, (such as St. <hi>Iames</hi> terms <note n="(a)" place="margin">Jam. 4.4.</note> 
                  <hi>enmity with God</hi>) For a league of Friendship, ever respects God; because, unless in respect to our selves, there can be no other original cause to love one another, but God alone, who indowed us with a love extrinsick, as I may say, and such as is not natural, or arising from the flesh.</p>
               <p>The Soul of man, in the Body, is prone to cleave to Earthly things, and many Leagues it makes, and Alliances it doth contract. Some upon considerations merely acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental and transient, and which fail with those considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; such is that with respects the bounty of another, as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith <note n="(a)" place="margin">Prov. 19.6.</note> 
                  <hi>Every man is a Friend to him that giveth gifts,</hi> or as the wise Son of <hi>Syrach</hi> 
                  <note n="(b)" place="margin">Ecclus. 7.33.</note> 
                  <hi>Liberality pleaseth all men,</hi> and so gains applause, respect, and Friendship (improperly taken:) but the Friendship thereby obtained, proves but like the Winter Brooks that <hi>Iob</hi> speaks of <note n="(c)" place="margin">Job. 6.15.17.</note> that <hi>what time they wax warm they vanish, when it is hot they are consumed out of their place. The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish</hi>: And when we stand in most need of their help, will most surely deny it.</p>
               <p>Sometimes again, love proceeds from external relations, as that which a man bears to his own natural Product, which although it be usually real, and lasting, and is allowable, good, and lawful; yet is not praise-worthy and commendable; the like being to be found in Beasts, and would be as great and lasting in them, had they equall knowledge of their own with us; nor can be called Friendship, since it seldom and of it self begets a Love mutual and reciprocal, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not indeed be termed other than love of our selves.</p>
               <p>That which doth come nearest to it is the love in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, which being mutual and reciprocal when contracted upon fitting terms, the Man and Wife thereby are, as our
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:50605:147"/>
great Lawyer thinks according to Scripture he has rightly defined that mystical knot, Two Souls in one Body: And when it respects Vertue chiefly, they may be said to be one Soul in two Bodies.</p>
               <p>When two Souls can place a repose in each other, without distrust, or diffidence, when they dare trust each other as Gods, though men, that I call Friendship, which can never be without some (imaginary at least) sight of Truth, Justice, Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the one in the other. To such a love I will afford, and affix the Attribute of <hi>good.</hi> And doubtless such a mutual Love affords the greatest pleasure of any thing our Souls are able to frame to themselves here, and cometh nearest in delight to that pure love of God, even for himself, which of his mere love and goodness, now and then, as the earnest of everlasting love and joy, he bestows on us for his Sons sake, and is chiefly effected through faith.</p>
               <p>This being premised; that every love which is praise-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and which is able of it self to create an alternate true Love, necessarily respects a Deity: Let us behold, if you please, how far it ought to respect humanity too, and with whom we may contract a Friendship. By the very profession of Atheism, notwithstanding any seeming kindness, all obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mutual rational amity, is become null and void, for the cause aforesaid. I may have charity for such a man, and relieve him in his want, but charity differs much from friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and is somewhat of an higher Orb; for charity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects God only, or chiefly, though rationally, and we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by pay a duty barely to him, in his Image, which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold with our Reason as his, however, or which way soever defaced. But this other love respecting man, as well as God, and man chiefly, and God secondarily, as I may say, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not arise without some apprehension of human recompence, or expectation of a reciprocal kindness; and that cannot be from an Atheist; for how can I think <hi>that</hi> mans Soul will ever be knit to mine in amity, who denies the very cause of its own existence, and attributes that to chance, which I do to Wisdom and Love. Human love, stirred through opinion, with Reasons allowance, necessarily requires an agreement in opinion about the Author of our being; For where we vary in opinion about the manner of our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Extraction, there is no ground for rational Love as fellow Creatures, or fellow Members. But whether this
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:50605:147"/>
kind of Love, called Friendship, requires any further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in opinion, than that there is one God, eternally wise, Maker and Creator of all things in Heaven and Earth, and a just rewarder of Virtue, and punisher of Vice and the like, let us, if you please, inquire a little further.</p>
               <p>Why truly I can see no just Reason, why we may not contract Friendship with a Turk, (as well as Christian States and Princes make Leagues with them) or having contracted Friendship with a Christian, why I should dissolve that knot of amity, imagine he turn Mahometan; (which I cannot so much as imagine at present, if he ever were a true Christian) provided I behold and continue to behold in such person, according to the best judicature of my Reason, the worship of a God, and an unfeigned indeavour to be led by the clear light of truth, and a continued resolution, not to forsake those known, and approved (by all men) paths, of Justice, Judgment, Mercy and the like, which tend towards her. Friendship being a voluntary union of Affections, between man and man, and so of human product; It is not requisite, it should have the approbation and acceptance of Faith, but it is sufficient, it have the allowance of Reason, which is the proper Judge of all human actions: It is an human League or tye (a duty if you please) of loving one another as men, and that, not as men out of the Body (though it be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of Souls) but in the Body; and therefore if we think and adjudge, the Will and the Affections in man, good in the main, that is, constantly bent and inclined, towards some good, we are not to reject such an one, in point of Friendship, because he believes not just as we do, or because we think he wants those graces (things out of an human rational pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect) which we suppose we have: We should friendly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to inform his Reason, and heartily pray for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enlightning of his Spirit; and so long as we behold faith in his practice, whatever he want in the theory, begin to love him, and continue to love him. If mercy and truth forsake not a man, I know no Reason, why he should not find fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in the <hi>sight of man, as well as God,</hi> according to <note n="(a)" place="margin">Prov. 3.3, 4.</note>

but yet there is a greater, which puts a stop to it, through the whole race of mankind, of what temper soever, or what opinion soever; And that is (besides the strange diversity of human Souls in point of opinion, the difficulty of discerning anothers opinion, and mans mutability too therein) the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of discerning the very right bent, or inclination of a mans Affections, or distinguishing that which is real, from counterfeit ware, by reason of that false vail which every hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Soul (the simplest and weakest) has ready at hand, and is able to put on, and wear, by looks, and gesture, as well as speech, and that is, Hypocrisie, and Dissimulation; which no other Creature but man, how sage soever, did, or could ever yet, put on: Charity sometimes overlooks this natural habit in man, but Friendship, a thing of human product, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting a return, which charity does not, trades abroad very seldom, and sparingly upon this account of counterfeit wares, and men are loth to venture, for fear of false re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns.</p>
               <p>Of Dissimulation I mean to say somewhat in another place, how little it ever advantaged any man; and therefore let it suffice here, only to say of it, that it is the very bane of Friendship; and whensoever 'tis beheld as an habit, in any man, that man must not expect Love and Friendship from another. That <hi>Love is the Loadstone of Love</hi> is a trite, and true saying; and therefore he who would attract it in this case, had need carefully observe the Apostles rule, and, <note n="(b)" place="margin">Rom. 12.9.</note> 
                  <hi>let</hi> his <hi>Love be without dissimulation.</hi> It cannot be with it, I am sure, accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table or pleasant, but nauseous and loathsome; Dissimulation seen in any man, being a thing, that gives an ill aspect, and an ill relish and savour, to that, and other the best indowments in a Soul. It was the variety of human tempers, and the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of knowing them, that I principally respected in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this Epistle; Friendship, and the want thereof, came in accidentally to my thoughts.</p>
               <p>Well, perfect and complete Friendship, between any two, is, as the Heathens feigned their antient God, begotten of time; notwithstanding this, it must have a beginning, and comes to pass many times on the suddain, in an instant, as soon as a man <note n="(b)" place="margin">1 Sam. 1.8.1.</note> 
                  <hi>makes an end of speaking</hi> (as we find that of <hi>Ionathan</hi> to <hi>David</hi>) if we perceive, or at least think there be integrity of heart in the Speech. Yet in this league of Friendship (sometimes too suddainly made and concluded) we ought to
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:50605:148"/>
take some care, that it be such, as may be lasting; and that since, as one says, All old Friends were once new, we make such a choice of a new one, as that he may prove an old one; and this requires circumspection and prudence in the doing.</p>
               <p>The mutual view of Truth in two men, as it is a most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable prospect to each other, and may be termed an happy interview between two Souls; so it is, in my opinion, the most likely thing to engender between them, a real and lasting Friendship. I do not mean here, by the sight of Truth, Truth in the theory; that thing of which we have sometimes a glimmering light only, and no more, and for which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbially reject <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Socrates</hi>'s Friendship, to admit her in our company, and yet know not when we have her; but naked Truth, practick Truth, Fidelity (if you please so to call it) or plain and upright dealing, when a man upon no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion will lie to deceive his Nieghbour, nor be drawn or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed to commit a falshood, for the gain of the whole World; and besides, upon just occasion will open his mind plainly. I know it is not prudent or requisite, we should always speak what we think; but if we do speak, to speak as we think, is ever best, and most acceptable to a good man. I do think that person, whoever he was, who first delivered it to us, and set it down as an observable Maxim, <hi>Obsequium ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos, veritas odium parit,</hi> to have been, not only a Sycophant, but ignorant of the ground of true Friendship; and I would not advise any man to chuse his Friend, from any Obsequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, Fawning, or Flattery. If you can behold Truth naked in any man, and can adjudge him to be of a setled mind and resolution (not <note n="(a)" place="margin">James. 1.8.</note> 
                  <hi>double-minded</hi> and so <hi>unstable in all his ways,</hi> as St. <hi>Iames</hi> describes him) we will render you the man if you please in <hi>Horace</hi> his words, <hi>justum, &amp; tenacem propositi vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> and withall moderately wise; such a man you ought to love, and imbrace, and with such an one, you may safely contract Amity or Friendship; But when you have so done, you must trust in God to continue him such; for I think you'l love him no longer, than he is such, neither do I think it fit, you should; For I do think men are mutable, and I do not look upon any League of Friendship, how fast soever made, like the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> but that the same is alterable, and may be dissolved, and abrogated, without any just blame. For though it be an human tye, in the reciprocal aspect and mutual promise of each other;
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:50605:149"/>
yet having ever a respect to God, as I said; if we shall find our dearest Friend, to sully the brightness of that Image, which first invited us to love him, and notwithstanding our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, to cast off that and to assume and bear about him the image of <hi>Belial,</hi> we may reject him.</p>
               <p>Thus much I remember yet in <hi>Tully</hi> (who would necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily have all Leagues of Friendship inviolable, and perpetual) that he utterly condemns that Saying of <hi>Bias, Ita amare opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere, ut aliquando esset osurus,</hi> and truly as a Christian I cannot commend it, for that I believe we should hate no man, upon any accompt, much less that future hatred should possess our thoughts, at the time we make a League of Friendship, or begin to love in that sence: But this I think may be a good rule herein, and I will adventure to give it you in Latin, <hi>Ita amare oportere, ut cessante (vel deficiente) causâ originali amoris, possis, tuta fide, non amare.</hi> For Friendship should not be entred into by a vow, and in such words, as Marriage, <hi>for better, for worse</hi>; Yet since it is an human and sacred League, we should be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful not to be mutable herein, though we are in other things the most mutable of any Creature; but then only cease to love our Friend, as our own Soul, when 'tis apparent to all the World, as well as our selves, that he bears no Love to his Soul himself, nor will be prevailed with, by any perswasion, to regard it more.</p>

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:50605:149"/>
inition of Friendship, in what we call, or most properly call Friendly Love, and learn to reject no man, who offers us this bond of Amity, for want of that Authentickness we only imagine it requires, <hi>viz.</hi> the Seal of Election and Grace, which no man ever yet saw, or could see I doubt in others (unless in Imagination.)</p>
               <p>I have formerly thought, and set down my thoughts in my Treatise <hi>de Anima,</hi> (which I exposed to your view) Love, to be the substantial part of an human Soul, flowing from that immense Ocean of Love, the great and wise Creator of the Universe; and I do yet think it so, and confined to, or inclosed in an impure Earthly Body for some space of time, where it does for the present necessarily work, burns inward, and sometimes flames outward; and according to its motion or inflammation here, either by Sense, Reason, or Grace, we give it its denomination, and attribute to it several names, and sometimes call it Love, sometimes Lust, sometimes Charity, and sometimes Friendship. The <hi>Latines</hi> have the same names (besides others) <hi>viz. amor, libido, Charitas, amicitia,</hi> though they distinguish them not always according to that notion, or in that sence, I intend or mean to do in this place.</p>
               <p>I say, Love is the principal, or sole, proper active Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent (if I may use that word) of a Soul. For as for Fear, Envy, Anger, Hatred, Malice, or the like; they are but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duments or Apparel, or Armour, which Love puts on, or bears about it, as I said, in its march or travel here. It is that thing in man, which has often possessed and taken up, or imployed my thoughts, how strangely, diversly and variously it works in several men, and no less diversly in one and the same man at several times. And therefore I am willing to behold it again, and say somewhat more of it, according to my capacity, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the afore-mentioned heads of Love, Lust, Charity; and of Friendship, only, orderly, and in course.</p>
               <p>When there is no motion in the Soul, further than for the pleasing it self, or the Body it inhabits, or it has no other chief respect, than to their worldly ease and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure only, and looks no farther therein than the obtaining Riches, Honour, Children or the like, I call it Lust, or self-love.</p>
               <p>When it beholds God alone, as the only perfect good, and the Author and giver of all goodness, and places a trust and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:50605:150"/>
repose in him, without taking any anxious thoughts, or care for worldly things, and delights the Soul in the Contemplation of his absolute and complete goodness; I call it pure Love, or Love in the abstract.</p>
               <p>When from it, or with it, the Soul beholds all men, as Gods special work, and pays a just and due respect to every member as his Image, howsoever deformed, or which way soever defaced, without any great respect to persons; I call it Charity.</p>
               <p>When it primarily respects and imbraces particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, for some visible inherent goodness in them, and God only secondarily, as the Author of all good in man; I call it Friendly Love, or the inition of that mutual aspect or League, we term, or name, Friendship.</p>
               <p>The first of these, is directed and guided by Sense on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or Reason captivated; the second by Grace; the third, and fourth by Reason at liberty, with some assistance or help of Grace.</p>
               <p>The first of these we may not improperly term Natural; the second Supernatural; and the third and fourth may be said to participate of, or proceed from both; <hi>viz.</hi> Nature and Grace.</p>
               <p>The first works or burns inwardly only; the second flames outwardly, and directly ascendant; the third and fourth flame laterally outward, after several ways (for the one is more intense upon particulars than the other) but both point upward.</p>
               <p>Love in man (of it self good) I have called and do call here, when it greedily catches at, or lays hold on any thing before it, Lust or Concupiscence; <hi>Cupiditas effraenata</hi>; that is, Love unbridled; for so I take the meaning of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to be; and withal a greediness in it, (unbridled) to be presently satisfied, as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>aviditas cibi,</hi> signifies. Reason, I have said before, is the proper rein of human Affection (though there be a hand above which sometimes guides or directs it) and when that rein is laid aside (as truly it is when we look no further than our present ease and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure) and Love moves by Sense only, or chiefly; We may well call it, Lust, or an unbridled Desire, and not Love. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is by some often referred to a peculiar flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desire, but I take it more generally, to signify a greedy desire of any Worldly thing whatsoever, and so does Saint
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:50605:150"/>
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> seem to make use of it, according to my apprehension of his meaning, where he opposes the Love of the World, and the Love of God, to each other <note n="(a)" place="margin">1 John 2.15, 16, 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Love not the World, neither the things that are in the World, if any man love the World, the love of the Father is not in him,</hi> says he; and then immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after makes use of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>For all that is in this World, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the World, and the World passeth away, and the lust thereof, but he that doth the will of God abideth for ever.</hi> And St. <hi>Iames</hi> immediately after his speaking of a <note n="(b)" place="margin">Jam. 1.12.</note> 
                  <hi>Crown of Life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him,</hi> useth the word, <hi>Lust,</hi> as a degenerate Love, by which we are drawn aside; Which raised in the Soul, and coupled to the flesh, conceiveth and brings forth sin. Now I have called this Lust natural, because, since our fall, Reason being much clouded by the Flesh, it is for want of Grace, most prone to be led by Sense in every human Soul, as well as bestial; And because it chiefly respects our selves, I have defined it to be an inward burning; And truly human love thus pent in, and a thing very vigorous of it self, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it cannot be satisfied within, shall never want any fuel to feed it, which Sense is able to bring in with the Devil's assistance; But this inward burning generally creates a smoak and a smother in the Soul, sometimes visibly to a spectator, and often feelingly to the owner; and how ere it may sometimes warm, or comfort, for the present, is never delightful or pleasant in the end.</p>
               <p>When this Love in man is pure, or purified, as we cannot describe the manner, so we cannot describe how joyful and delightful a thing it is; Neither is any man able so much as to imagine it, unless he have in some measure felt it, and then perhaps he may cry out with <hi>David, One day in thy courts is better than a thousand,</hi> &amp;c. I know there is no man but would take it in great scorn to be told, he loves not God; every one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to that, however he deal with his Neighbour; but sure this kind of Love (the most excellent) will never be made visible in any, to the wiser sort of the World, but by some outward, clear, and manifest demonstration of the two fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing kinds of Love, to our Neighbour, and to our Friend: And 'twere heartily to be wished above all things, that self-love did not often colourably set it up, and march under its seeming Banner. It may and has done so, certainly; which is
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:50605:151"/>
so base and treacherous a self-love, that the name of Lust or Concupiscence is too good for it; neither can any man invent a name for it, which may properly refer to man; 'Tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human, and worse than sensual, it is Devilish, neither can I call it other than Devilish, when men once indeavour to open a way to their self ends with a <hi>scriptum est.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Towards our present ease, and quiet in the World, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready declared my opinon, that the observance or performance of that second great Commandment, that is, an Universal good aspect, or the bearing about one, a love and kindness for every individual Image of our Creatour, let that Image never so much vary in opinion or fancy from our own (we will again set it down in one word as before) Charity, is that <hi>unum necessarium</hi>: And this is a thing, which in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion every man might (God assisting) blow up and enliven in himself by his Reason, so as his Love might flame out on every side, as I have described. But that is not the thing I am now upon, neither was the consideration of it, or of pure love, or of self-love either, my chief aim or design herein; but Friendship or Friendly Love. A thing which though it seem not so absolutely necessary towards our future, or present well-being, as Charity, yet usually attends and accompanies it, and may seem to be, and proceed from one and the same head, or cause in man; therefore let us, if you please, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle behold it, and inquire into that cause, and find out, if we can, the true original fountain thereof in man; and how love in man, comes to be inflamed after this manner of way, we call Friendship.</p>
               <p>I have already said, that towards contracting Friendship, the raising Friendly Love, or moving Love in man after that manner of way, it is absolutely necessary, we behold in each other, some imperfect shadow at least, of those excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, which are complete and perfect in the Deity; that is of Truth, Justice, Mercy or the like: Now these being things, as I said elsewhere, which have no corporal shape, and such as are no ways obvious to Sense; It must be Reason sole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that is able to behold them, and judge of them; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore friendly Love necessarily arises, and moves from, or with the sight of Reason; and we may strictly, and most properly, call such a Love, rational Love.</p>
               <p>Now for that sensual Love in man, having Reason in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with it, and oft-times assisting it, and contriving for it,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:50605:151"/>
engenders such a mutual Love between men, as very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembles friendly Love; nay, for that sensual Love, and friendly Love, are often complicated, and twisted together in man (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated let us say, if you think good) 'twill be necessary we find out the true original of each, and the real difference between them, that so we may rightly discern, and distinguish bettween them.</p>
               <p>First we say, friendly Love, properly and strictly, is a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Love from the sight or judgement of Reason free and at liberty; Where that, of it self able only to behold, and beholding some image of good in another, is moved to stir towards that particular person, as the cistern or receptory at least of that good; without any expectation of recompence or reward, other than a reciprocal Love, upon a review of the like good in the party himself that loves. Other love than this, that is, a love arising upon the bare view of good, without other expectation than aforesaid; whatever aid or assistance, Reason in a manner captivated may afford to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it in the first motion, or how far soever it may contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute towards the continuance thereof, or the making it last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or invitatory of a reciprocal Love, although self ends occur not for the present to a mans thoughts, but he is, as it were, insensibly drawn thereby; the same is no other, than a sensual, or self-love. And therefore all those seeming en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearments of Liberality, Wit, pleasant demeanour, or the like, are no other; and our ordinary mutual visits and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociations in clubs and companies, whatsoever Reason may seem to contribute towards them, of themselves, raise no other Love than such: We are delighted in the company, we hope to improve our parts thereby, we expect advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or we look to secure our present acquists, or enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the like; And this is no other than a self-love; Which kind of Love, though it seem sometime to burn out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and that with eagerness and violence, yet it sits but on the top of the heart, as we say: 'Tis shallow, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial, and mutable, seldom lasting longer than a man beholds an outward motive with his eyes, or the like; It changes upon every change of Sense, is driven to and fro, and sometimes presently vanishes. For Sense, not able to penetrate into the depth and nature of things, cannot of it self make any deep impression into the affectionary part of an human Soul: But Reason is able of it self to do it; for
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:50605:152"/>
when that shews to the Affection any thing truly lovely in man, it informs man withal, he ought to love, and that with some trust and confidence in the party loved.</p>
               <p>I do not think but that Reason in man, may be so far de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>based, as of it self to behold and judge that thing as good, which in truth is not so, through some mist which self-love, full fed and pampered from Sense before, has raised in the Soul; and in that case, Love, though Reason seem to be the conduct of it, may change, upon every change of Sense; But whenever Reason free and at liberty, and withal clear, does once direct or guide love to such an object, Love in that case will not easily be moved, but must be haled away by the same strength, which directed and guided it thither, neither shall Sense soon loosen it. Fidelity in man, or some ground whereon another may place a trust, must be the foundation, on which the first loving stone (if I may so say) of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is laid; and he who brings the second, must do it on the like ground, and so perhaps the Building will be united, and raised to some height, and 'tis Reason only is able to shew us this ground: Sense of it self is not capable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it; nay let Sense but point out a foundation, with Reason accompanying it, and for a time assisting it, if Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son once draw back a little, and shew to the Affection any ground for distrust; though we cannot say, but a man may continue to love, yet it will be but a weak and feeble Love, and such as Friendship can never be raised thereon. And therefore though a man heap all the kindness he can possibly invent, and rain showers of Gold upon another; If that other having his Reason about him, free and at liberty, do but once espy, that he defrauds a third person by injustice, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the doing it; Let him take my opinion for Oracle, for I will deliver it as such in this case, though he <note n="(a)" place="margin">Prov. 6.35.</note> 
                  <hi>augment the gifts,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> says in another case, That man shall never love him, at the bottom of the heart; and yet there may be, and continue a mutual Love between these two, grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Sense, but no interchangeable view for a trust, which I say is the ground of Friendship. This is the prospect of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son only, and within its Judicatory, and not the view of Sense, no nor of Grace; for that is a special divine gift, not inherent in us, which ever bearing Charity in company with it, through Charity, is apt to pass too favourable a censure, and condemning none, beholds every man through it (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:50605:152"/>
any inequality or the like) a fit subject of Love.</p>
               <p>Now because self-love, or sensual Love, Charity, and friendly Love, in man only, may all subsist together, at one and the same time, and they are so complicated as we said, and folded one in the other, that we do not easily distinguish them, and now and then a pretence only of the love of God, is wrapped in amongst them, I will further indeavour to distinguish them a little by a plain familiar instance or two.</p>
               <p>I behold somewhat of truth and fidelity in a man, by the judicature of my Reason, I relieve him in his Wants, I after confer many gifts on him; You'l say he has reason to love me; I say so too, but it will be but with a sensual Love, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his Reason; for in the first case he may think; and his Reason may well allow of such thoughts; My Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or kindness, was with an eye to some praise, to be seen of men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or at least in expectation of some future reward, and not from beholding any thing of good in him: In the second case he may with the like reason conjecture, my libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality flowed with expectation of a return, and with some reference to my own Worldy advantage, that I intended to make use of him, or the like. But if at any time there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to this man, a sight of truth in me; that upon the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est advantages, or greatest offers and temptations to desert him, I stuck to him, and would not be drawn to do him the least injury, or injustice, for any gain whatsoever, and he behold the principles of Justice and Honesty engraven in me; He will then think it proceeded from my view of his deserts, and some good I saw in him, and seeing the like in me, and placing some trust and confidence in this my Love, he will make me a return, and love me cordially, as we say, with the allowance of his Reason, free and at liberty, and this I call a rational Love, or friendly Love, and the inition of true Friendship.</p>
               <p>We will imagine there are three persons, before whom I have a Cause depending, to corrupt whom I offer to each a Bribe; the one refuses, the other two accept, and thereupon I have a Judgment by the two, according to my sensual appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite or desire, and am very well pleased therewith; the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is, whether of these I should love best from my heart root or soonest enter into a League of Friendship with; Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly

he who refused; and yet I must necessarily love the other two, who gave judgment for me according to my sensual desire, best, with a sensual Love; Now in this case of my sensual Love to the two, Reason was assistant to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the raising of it, or else I could not have thought on a Bribe; On the other side, Reason free and at liberty, must be the thing solely, which causes me to love him who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused my Bribe, and that in beholding his integrity; for it is impossible I should do that by Sense, his action being, or work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing visibly against my interest.</p>
               <p>There are two Litigants before me; the one a Christian by the Seal of Baptism, and outward profession, as I know; the other not, but a Turk, we will suppose; These two I delay in point of judgment, with some shew perhaps of my readiness to take a Bribe from either; the Christian offers me one, the Turk not, but trusting to the merits and justice of his Cause, and hating and detesting corruption in such case (as I observe) utterly refuses; though upon hearing, I were fully satisfied of the justice of the Christians cause, and gave judgment for him; whether of these two, think you, should I have the firmest or deepest Love for, or soonest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a league of Friendship with upon occasion? I will tell you, the Turk. For as concerning the Christian's action, my Reason will inform me, that there is no person that indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to corrupt me by Bribe, but either thinks I am unjust, or at least would have me so. If I once suspect he thinks me unjust, 'twill be in vain to love him after the manner of a Friend, for he can never love me so again, or place any trust or repose in me. If I perceive, he would have me to be unjust, he is most certainly so himself, and then I can place no trust or repose in him. Now if outward profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion were to be the standard of this Love, and my own Religion the guide, I should sooner make choice of the Christian for my Friend; For I behold him through Grace, the better of the two, and believe the Turk a Reprobate, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his hate of corruption, and Love of Justice, and that the Christian may be by repentance in the state of Grace, notwithstanding this injustice in him; yet beholding and condemning falshood in any man by my Reason, I cannot in that man place a trust, or repose, with allowance of my Reason, nor raise a trust in my Soul, so as to confide in him, which must be effected through Reason, as the proper Judge
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:50605:153"/>
of human Safety, or felicity here; for upon that is Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship builded, not on future hopes, or Heavenly prospects; And therefore Grace, which is a kind of prospect, through Faith, of future felicity, can neither create friendly Love, nor judge rightly of a fit subject thereof; but Reason.</p>
               <p>Whoever would be my Friend, I desire he may so be, from the very formation, as well as allowance of his Reason. I know not what any man can behold in me (whatever he see in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self) worthy friendly Love, by any other light than that of Reason; Neither do I know, if his love should move other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, or by a greater gift, how to repay him (a burthen to every man till it be done) but by such a return, a Love from my Reason; since I confess, I have no other light to do it by, nor without it can judge of the reality of his Love, or any good in him. I know there are some men, who would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine their Love to move only by what they call the Spirit; but whether it be not the Spirit of Delusion, rather than Love, will appear by its confinement within such a particular Sphere. That Spirit of Love, surely directs us not to reject any man, in whom we behold just and upright dealing, and other effects of a sincere, and well-disposed mind, by our Reason; what falls not within the compass of that light, <hi>viz.</hi> Reason, may be beheld by him, who infuses it through the merits of his Son, not by us; And whom I think we do ill to vouch in our ordinary familiar intercourses, and to make him so much a party that he must love only as we, whilst we love only as we please, and as our own fancy doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us. To love as Friends needs not the seal of adoption and Grace, the seal of Creation is sufficient. You have seen doubtless, as well as I, contracted mystical subscriptions, in very familiar Epistles, such as, <hi>Yours,</hi> or <hi>thine in the Lord,</hi> only; which though it be good and allowable in some Sense, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be acceptable in the common notion, as we are men, neither can we rationally think, such men will ever love us as sober men, when once they seem to think themselves out of the flesh, while they are in it. But we may allow such as in our days use the salutation, and who make bold thus to write in every Epistle, to cloud their kindness in Divinity; since there never was party (some thereof at least) that bore about them less of humanity. But if such kind of men, who would seem out of the flesh here, and reject all moral Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Goodness, as insignificant, will not be drawn to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:50605:154"/>
or love us, otherwise than aforesaid; nor imbrace us for any Justice, or Mercy shewed them (for as for Spiritual Graces, theirs and ours are equally invisible) we shall do well so to frame our ways, as to please our Maker, that if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our enemies because we do not take the same ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary flight with them, they may, at least, be at peace with us, and that if it be possible, as much as in us lyes, we may have peace with all men. In the Christian World I doubt, nay I believe, there is least visibility of Friendship, and this I take to be the cause; that the very outward noble badge or cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of Christianity (I will not say true Christianity) by the help of Satan, has so much elevated many Souls in opinion and fancy, as to make them think no others, who wear it not outwardly for ostentation and shew (as themselves) worthy their common Friendship.</p>
               <p>It is a seeming unhappiness in our nature, that our Affection cannot be long at rest, and that Love in man only, has such several Pilots or Guides; Sense would have it stay at home chiefly, and please, or work for the Body; that at least it should not move far, nor otherwise than to bring in freight for the ease and pleasure of that. Reason would, it should traffick abroad, and imbrace whatsoever that heholds good and virtuous, laudable, and amiable in another man, and the man withal, therefore. Grace now and then raises it to mount upwards, and beholding that fixed bright Star, by which we all move, attracts it in some measure to bend and incline thitherward, without regard to danger. It moves at all these several Summons or calls, wherein that in Beast never stirs otherwise than from Sense. But yet upon every turn and occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence so weak is our light of Reason, and so uncertain, and often clouded (through our sins) is that other bright and gracious light, that it is apt to be drawn and haled home again by Sense, and then it catches up every weapon, offensive and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive, for the Body; Anger, Fear, and the like. Thus are we tossed to and fro, as it were by contrary Winds, and often shipwracked, before we come to shoot that dreadful gulf of Death, and we may well cry out before the time, <hi>O wretched men that we are, who shall deliver us from this Body of Death</hi>? Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son sooner than Sense, will shew us some ground whereon we may anchor, and fix our Love, as it were, in a good and pleasant harbour for a time, but it self will often loosen it again, by shewing us, it is sandy; that there is no trust in
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:50605:154"/>
man, nor in the children of men; and that whatsoever we see of Justice, or Truth, or any thing of goodness in them, for the present, those are not things of permanency in them. Men are various, fickle, and mutable in their Habits, and in their Affections too; We cannot rationally trust our selves, We have no power over our selves, 'tis most certain; And we have beheld some, seemingly very rational, for want of Grace, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy that Body they best loved, their own, with their own hands; And how then can we place any setled trust in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Faith must throw us out at last, an anchor for the Soul, sure and stedfast, and that must be of Love, not that it directs, or should direct our Love, <hi>quatenus</hi> human; that is, and ought to be guided by Reason; But it may inflame our Love to that height towards our Maker, that we shall not be troubled above measure, though we behold the inconstancy of human Nature, and the falshood and treachery of our dearest Friends, though they deceive us, and all the World forsake us, nay <note n="(a)" place="margin">Psal. 46.2</note> 
                  <hi>Though the Earth be moved, and though the hills be carried into the midst of the Sea.</hi> We may wish perhaps, but as much setledness of Affection, and seeming constancy of Nature amongst our selves, as in those poor Creatures which serve us, and were created (next to God's Glory) for our use; that we might find ground to trust each other here, and lodge our Affection safe, out of our selves, for a time, in any fellow-member, since we can behold no better by our Sense, nor comprehend what is above us, by our Reason; But his Wisdom is infinite and unsearchable, and yet perhaps may appear to us herein, that we should trust (even while here) in none, but him, who is for ever one and the same, and Lord over all; And who, if we love him, will withhold nothing he sees good for us, and become himself our Comforter in all our Afflictions.</p>

               <head>EPIST. VII. Of the different vain pursuits of the Souls of Men, wherein we are ready to accuse each other of Folly, though not our selves, and yet are all Fools in some degree. That no pursuit of the Soul here, is praise-worthy or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, further than it intentionally advances God's Glory, which is the mark set before us, and which if we do not behold, in all our travails, our labour will not profit.</head>
               <p>IN my Treatise of the Soul, I made some glance at the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and different pursuits of it in man, that is the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary or imbracing part of it; but I could not but behold withal the several opinions that men seem to have of the pursuit of each others Affection, how vain every man thinks that to be, which he himself affects not, or desires. But the beholding the variety of opinions and judgments in the case (with the folly and madness of all men) would have conduced little to the present cure of any Soul diseased, and therefore I needed not to insert my thoughts thereabout in such Treatise; but have reserved and now sent them to you for your perusal.</p>
               <p>Truth is, all our courses (as various as they are) in any excess, and not necessarily relating to some other end, than what they seem to an ordinary Spectator to tend after, are equally frivolous and vain; and though we are every one of us very dimm-sighted towards any espial of our own fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and ridiculous eager and longing pursuits, yet are we quick and apt enough to see, and deride the same madness and folly in others; and we never need, with the Psalmist, attribute laughter to him who dwelleth in the Heavens, from his only or alone beholding our futile contrivances; since we our selves are able to afford it one another, from the weak in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection we do, or are able to make into any mans madness or folly, but our own.</p>
               <p>I do think the Creator of all things, who affords himself that blessed center of rest unto our Souls, and to whom our best and chiefest Affections, might from very gratitude ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally tend, has of his abundant wisdom and gracious goodness, permitted and allowed them, not only a divers and innocent vagrancy towards various and several terrestrial objects; but withal, so framed the Intellect and Judgment, as that each
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:50605:155"/>
several person shall in some manner, or measure approve and allow of such honest tendency of his own Affections, beyond those of another mans moving another way; and take such satisfaction and acquiescence therein, and now and then to hugg and please himself in his own choice, as either to pity or deride another whose labour or indeavour is exercised in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent way, though that of either (unless in relation to the advancement or setting forth the glory of that first cause which few behold) is equally vain. Do we not think our State Politicks look on all others, as Fools and Ideots? And on the other side, some whose Affections are not so Worldly mounting (though perhaps they carry about as able a purveyor or contriver for their Affections) laugh at those gins and traps, those men lay, to catch themselves as often as another. Surely if a man could become a discerner of the thoughts, he might espy in a number of Mechanicks, very mean, if not derisory ones, of a man imploying his time, beating his brains as we say, or at study for some rare, new or useful inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; although without some such labour, or study at first, such a kind of <hi>Democritus,</hi> had neither known his craft, or mystery so called, nor had been acquainted with that God he adores, and so much labours for, Mammon. And on the other side, every ordinary Virtuoso is ready to deride, and contemn such a Craftsman, whose ordinary course of life in his Shop, has little more of sagacity to be imputed to it, than that of a Spider in his Web, nimbly running and catching at every one that enters, to suck some profit or advantage therefrom. Neither of these perhaps beholding a wise disposal from above, or so much as once extracting from their Intellect any such Moral, as might be deducible from such like story, or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as is made of a blind and lame man's meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the ones sight was given to direct the others legs, and the others legs, to assist his eyes, or sight. Now though some things have obtained the general assent of the best and clearest Intellects (as we observe by the daily pursuit) to be good and desirable, as Power, Dominion, and Empire, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments rather than goods, and allowed as good, to please the Ringleader of Affections to Perdition, Pride; Yet that judgment is passed over, before the enjoyment, and though Pride will not suffer it publickly to be reversed, I dare boldly say 'tis ever done in private; and were it not for somewhat of Pride, every publick man would become private. Indeed,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:50605:156"/>
the Soul which pursues dominion may at preview expect beautiful Attendants and Concomitants, and to have many, if not most desirable goods in its power, as Riches, Pleasure, Ease, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I, and Wisdom too by imputation: Yet were it possible to resort to the greatest Favourite, the World ever had in that case (and for instance let that Favourite be the first <hi>Caesar</hi>) and obtain his response, as to his own happiness, while here; I do believe and am fully perswaded in my self, it would be to little or no other effect, than what we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at home from one of our own Nation already, <hi>That men in great power and place, must borrow other mens fancies and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions to think themselves happy by, because they are never so in their own.</hi> I would not be thought here to descant upon those, whom this cross is barely laid on (doubtless God makes it more easy to them, that we can reasonably imagine) but I speak of such, as snatch up this cross, to lay it on their own backs, who certainly are Fools therein, and I know not why we may not well account that man, <hi>Caesar,</hi> of the number. There was never any thing attributed to him, or said of him (and much has been said) which, I protest, I ever held upon serious thoughts, worthy emulation, unless his great mercy and clemency; which every private man is capable to appear with, though not in the same luster, and splendor. <hi>Solomon's</hi> truth is able to extort confession from any man in a sedate, and sober temper (with an <hi>only</hi> added to it) that <note n="(a)" place="margin">Prov. 19.22.</note> 
                  <hi>that is to be desired of a man is his goodness;</hi> and it was a magnanimous and noble saying of <hi>Alexander</hi> (whom upon comparison with the other I cannot but ever prefer) to <hi>Taxiles,</hi> a great and wise King by the story, I will fight with thee in honesty, and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie, because thou shalt not exceed me in bounty and liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. A great Commander (though not so great as either of the other) could once say; that were not the mercies of God, great and infinite, men of their profession, and course of life, could have little hopes of any future bliss of happiness. And certainly as little real happiness, or quiet, is to be expected here, even in this World, by one whose course of life is a very bereav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of many innocent Souls of their very outward and present peace, ease and rest: And yet we would most willingly be all <hi>Caesars,</hi> if we could obtain that Title, Power and Dignity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out labour and pains. What's the cause of all this? Why I will say it is Pride, and 'twas that only, that in labour and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel; brought forth those words from <hi>Caesar,</hi> That he had rather
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:50605:156"/>
be the first man in a mean Village, than the second man in <hi>Rome,</hi> which I think neither was a wise, or a manly Saying, (though others will think otherwise) and that it was the thought of future fame, and glory, that framed it. Fame with her pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wings, memorious fame, well, 'tis a great sign of the Souls immortality, that seeing she must not always abide here, would leave a perpetual remembrance of her self behind; And yet as it is vain to think, that the Soul of the right <hi>Caesar,</hi> is at all sensible of its fame, with us; so I offer, whether any of us, may not if we please, be an imaginary <hi>Caesar,</hi> and that's as well, in this case of Fame. For if a man will but take the advice given to the covetous man in the Fable, who had lost his hid treasure, that he should take and hide a stone, and imagine it to be Gold, and it would have the same effect towards his happiness: So let a man but think, that after his death, that Soul which is so much magnified, by the name of <hi>Caesar,</hi> shall be his; It will be then, all one, as if he had been the man, while he lived.</p>
               <p>But who is so mad to part with any one Virtue, for Honour, as necessity often inforces, if a man will needs get it? It was a pretty Saying, and it may be a true one, of the Priest to <hi>Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> about to build a Temple to Honour and Virtue, that those two Gods could not dwell together under one roof; nor I think be brought together to attend on one Soul, unless Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour were Native with it.</p>
               <p>A man of a stirring Spirit, if he be not building Temples here for <hi>Diana,</hi> that is gains (a thing not of so great esteem in the World though as generally affected) he will usually be building of <hi>Babels,</hi> to get himself a name. We shall find in every brave Spirit (so intitled) something of the Roman temper; It would leave some mark of its being here, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver considers of any such saying, as, <note n="(a)" place="margin">Lu. 12.20.</note>

Let no man too confidently think of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talizing his name, either from Writing, or the Press; It was a bold thought, as well as a saying, which proceeded from one, when he had finished his work, that it should live, in despight of <hi>Iupiters</hi>

Though I believe the Creation of the World with others, I find no firm or just ground to believe it is so near an end as some others have accounted it, from Prophecies, which I much doubt, whether any of us ever yet rightly understood. And then we may as well believe in Reason, the future obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion of all present actions, as the present oblivion of most past ones, and that, of Nations, for ought we know, or can reasonably imagine, indowed with as brave Spirits, and as industrious to preserve their memory, and deliver it over to Posterity, as we our selves. A thing, the whole race of human Nature (for want of truly beholding a present Vanity, and another manner of future felicity) has, is, and ever will be, prone unto: And I my self am prone to think, that before any imaginary fifth Monarchy takes place, that is before the World have an end; there may be yet fifteen (or more) suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively take place, and amongst these, 'tis not altogether irrational to conjecture, that God to punish us for our Pride and self-conceit here, or other secret purposes, best known to himself, may raise up one of such power, that he may give Laws unto the World; One, who may make such a destruction, as that in after ages, Learning and Arts, may seem chiefly behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to some of his Successors, for its rise. And yet in this rage and tempest, to shew his own power and might, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his promise, preserve intire his Holy word. Some have imagined, the Turk may do as much, as I have said. Well! we have authority to say, <hi>Of that day and hour knoweth no man.</hi> We reckon and account upon time, while we live; but as time is nothing to God, so time will quickly be no more with us, but we shall be swallowed up in Eternity. Indeed upon a call to repentance, St. <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptist's words are true, and necessary, <hi>the kingdom of Heaven is at hand</hi>: Our passage is quick and speedy; and our Souls, now Earthly Inhabitants, must in short space know their doom: And were it imaginable, that they with our Bodies could sleep and become as 'twere insensible till that last day; though they should sleep together Myriads of ages, yet upon sound of the last Trump, and their then awaking, it could seem no otherwise to them, than as yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.

Here do we often hunt after we know not what, and think to catch hold on something stable and permanent, but when our very Bodies awake again, through their very instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Sense our Souls may behold themselves to have been here, but in a dream.</p>
               <p>This inscription on all things here, Vanity, whereof <hi>Solomon</hi> seems to have had a full and clear view, and was the man who first delivered the same over to us in writing, is a very good, and, I may say too, a gracious sight and prospect, and a very ready one, I think, to point us to inquire after, if not find out, something which is free and clear from such inscription: But it is a further most gracious and glorious donative, if we ever behold it, and we must never expect to behold it, as of our selves, and from our own strength; our Opticks are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly too weak. There have been many, as well Heathens as others, who have obtained a pretty fair view of the vanity of all things here below, from their very light of Reason: what any of them saw farther, I cannot say, nor will go about to determine; but I should have thought that tenth Satyr of <hi>Iuvenal,</hi> to have proceeded from somewhat more than an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary poetical rapture or fancy, had it not been for the conclusion therein, <hi>monstro quod ipse tibi possis dare.</hi> When once we think we behold that sight, as of and from our selves, our eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come weak, and dazled, and from too intent a view of this World, we are disabled to see and contemplate the glory of another; that sight must be reached unto us, upon our humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in beholding the other, and of our selves we cannot reach it: But this is a needless instruction for you, and improper for this place.</p>
               <p>We were minded in our search to inquire and behold, what and how far worldly imployments of the Soul were neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary and commendable; Whereabout I never thought it good, to indeavour to hang clogs and fetters on any mans, but rather add wings to it. Neither is it good to amaze men with speculative Notions, but rather to incourage all men to be up and doing, provided a way be opened first, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold that mark which every Soul should chiefly aim at; and that is, God's Glory. And therefore if a man can behold that, and place it as the prime object, and make it the main end, and chief Scope and design of all his work and motion; Let him go on, though he expect and promise himself there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, Power, Honour, Riches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> besides.

               <p>But besides a good primary intention, in every Souls mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it will be very necessary and requisite, for every Soul to keep a due and constant watch over her self, lest at any time unawares she sacrifice to her own nets. For though her good motions like Springs, may seem to proceed out of the Earth, yet they are in truth from the Sea; and though as the Earth, we receive fruit and increase thereby, we ought at no time to dam them up within our bowels, lest they become putrid and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholesome; but allow them a free passage, and give them a quick return, by way of acknowledgment, to that bountiful Ocean of goodness; as the necessary means of a fresh supply. I know nothing but that <hi>Agrippa</hi> his Oration, might be good, nay so good, as a Stander by, might in a good Sense take it to be rather <hi>the voice of God than man</hi>; but if his Auditors acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in applying it solely to him, were gross flattery, I am sure his reception in that strict and narrow Sense, must needs be a damnable presumption.</p>
               <p>Satan is a subtle Politician, and doubtless many, who in the beginning of their race, have set forth with an eye, only or chiefly, fixed on the Glory of God, and the general good of man, have by baits thrown in, and casually happening in the way, diverted their eyes a little from the course they first steer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and cast them inward on themselves, and at last converted publick aims to private, or at least so intermixed or allayed them, as that they could not be taken for currant. And when once our actions begin to carry upon them, our own image and superscription, it will be no difficult matter for the Devil to perswade us to own the Metal as well as the Coin, and make us think and own our selves, as well Miners as Forgers of our dependants fortunes and our own.</p>

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:50605:158"/>
find just Reason to envy his Worldly Power, Pomp, and Authority, knowing at the best, and honestly obtained, how transitory and fading all Worldly habiliments are; So none of us can justly condemn or accuse such a man of vain glory, but we may allow him some such <hi>Euge</hi> as <hi>David</hi> took up upon another account, <hi>Good luck have he with his honour, let him ride on;</hi> And we who seem to want, what such a man enjoys, may by our contentedness in a mean estate, with chearfulness and ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity, glorify God together with him, since the World is able to afford, Power, Authority, great Place and the like only to a few, and small number of men.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Gloria in excelsis</hi> (by the way) ought to be the <hi>Canticum</hi> of our Souls in all our travail, and to have its rise from our strongest and best Affection. It should be the Motto we carry along with us; but in a white Banner, as the Ensign of peace, and not that of <hi>In nomine domini,</hi> in a bloody and warlike one. It is indeed a most angelical Anthem, yet it must be taken whole, as they sang it, or not at all. I have wondred at the once leaving out <hi>Gloria patri, &amp;c.</hi> appointed to be, as the bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of those Heavenly Songs, or Hymns of <hi>David,</hi> and have sometimes thought, it would never have been ordered to be omitted, unless by those, who desired neither peace on Earth, nor good will towards men. This is a thing, if any, to be preferred above our own salvation; and I must take leave here, to be of opinion, It was this alone which made St. <hi>Paul</hi> wish himself <hi>Anathema;</hi> for in my weak judgment, I cannot take the meaning of those words (usher'd in with such a serious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation as, <hi>I speak the truth in Christ, I lye not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost</hi>) otherwise; I cannot think, his Charity did so abound, or overflow, as that he wished his brethrens salvation before his own, as some: For to wish evil to ones self, is impossible, and to wish anothers good before ones own, is so too, and also irregular; we being at utmost commanded to love our Neighbour, but, as our selves; the whole heart is only due to the Maker, and Framer of all hearts, for whose Glory all things were made. But this I think is his meaning; that were it possible God's Glory could once come in competition with ones own, or other mens salvation, the first were to be preferred by us; And this he brings in as a Preface to his explanation of God's promise made to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed; that all are not children of the promise, which are <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, but some others; and is an answer to an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:50605:159"/>
which might be made by the <hi>Romans,</hi> to whom he preached that promise, as seeming contrary to the letter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>Were God as cruel to some one peculiar part of his image, as kind to others, under the Notion of Predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as some have represented him in their fancies, and so rendred all his Precepts and his Promises of none effect, which God forbid; And were I assured, notwithstanding all my diligence, all my indeavours, and earnest requests, to perform his will, that I might obtain his promise, that I were one of that irrecoverably secluded number; I do yet at this present think, I could notwithstanding any such assurance, make my <hi>exit</hi> in these very words; <hi>Glory be to God on high,</hi> or <hi>sanctisicetur,</hi> or <hi>magnificetur nomen tuum.</hi> And certainly who ever makes a true search into himself, and consults his Reason, whereby he will find God's prerogative far greater over us, than the Potter over his Clay, will find cause to do as much.</p>
               <p>Well! he who keeps within such a path, as points, and tends directly to God's Glory, and the general good of mankind, God's visible Image, without turning quite out of it, into some other By-path or corner, what ever ornaments or covering he gets, which are often scattered in the way, he may lawfully take up and wear, and which we esteem, and account of as good worldly Blessings; But yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding we so do, when we consider how cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som they are, and how troublesome they often prove to the owner and injoyer, (especially all outward ones which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Body barely: and which when superfluous are reserved but for one Sense to feed upon, that is the Eye) we may with Reason reject them; And though some men have made a shift sometimes, to keep on those Plumes and Feathers of Honours, Riches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and wore them perhaps, both safely, and easily, during their lives; Yet since we are able dayly to behold, how certainly they are shed, or moulten by every mans Posterity, if not stripped from them by force and violence, and that usually, in a very short space of time, although they were thought by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestor, very fast pinnion'd to his progeny; We can by no means exempt any of them, from that title <hi>Solomon</hi> has given them. Nay, we have thought and said that even Fame her self, which has the most lasting Feathers,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:50605:159"/>
and strongest Wings, may yet lose them, and perish in oblivion. And therefore there is no Reason for man, to be very eager in the quest of any thing this World is able to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford him; neither can we think but our most fortunate Worldly contrivers, and happy men, as we esteem them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in some degree with this common disease of Folly and Madness in the World, have felt the anguish and trouble thereof.</p>

               <head>EPIST. VIII. That any compleat Happiness here, is a thing meerly in speculation. That natural indowments or excellencies in the Soul, do conduce to the Ease, Peace, or quiet thereof, and so are desirable though we attain not happiness thereby. Learning or Knowledge, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Prudence, and subtilty considered. That even Prudence the most likely conduct to happiness, was never yet the constant concomitant of the clearest or brightest human Soul.</head>
               <p>THE Souls of men while they are here below, do all agree in this one thing, that is, in a wish or desire of being happy; But what Happiness is, wherein it consists, or how in some measure it may be attained, even here, there is not one Soul, but in some kind or other, at least in some degree or measure, differs, and dissents from its fellows. Indeed happiness is a thing so quite out of our reach, and out of our view, since our first wilful turning from it to run after a game of Satans starting, that it is a very blind and cold chase to the best of us. Divers there are who make a cry of it se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways, and we are prone from that general desire, or wish, to hearken and run after them sometimes; and yet when we come to try it, after some stay upon it, we find it to be but a false cry. For as our future final and Eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, is wrapped up from us in such clouds of darkness, that we had need <note n="(a)" place="margin">Corinth. 12.1.</note> 
                  <hi>come to visions and revelations,</hi> and as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth it, be <hi>caught up into the third Heaven</hi> to have a glimpse of it: So even our very present temporal Happiness, and peace of mind, is such a mystery, rather than an art, as no man could ever yet find out the exact materials, from whence it should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily arise, but every one must acknowledge it, in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, to be the gracious voluntary raies of an Eternal essential happy Being, now and then darted on us.</p>
               <p>What do we talk of finding Happiness here? The sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow whereof would sooner cool our appetites, if we groped not after, and catched too greedily and earnestly at the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. A full perswasion that Happiness is altogether out of our reach, nay out of the clearest sight, may as much conduce towards it as any thing I can imagine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:50605:160"/>Happiness is a thing, that perhaps is oftnest found of them that seek it not, and that if we go out of our place, and our desires are bent upon, and our thoughts straggle too much after it, it is not seldom but we may be compared to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean <note n="(a)" place="margin">Mat. 12.43.</note> 
                  <hi>Spirit,</hi> walking through dry places, seeking rest and finding none, and would gladly return to the place whence we came. Happiness is not a thing to be Chymically extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of any Earthly materials whatsoever, and a man will find it no less folly to promise it himself, upon the enjoyment of any thing, than it is to promise himself an assurance of the thing, before he obtain it. But as it never was insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly annexed to any state or condition, nor the certain Spouse of any mortal; so need no man pronounce an absolute divorce of it, from any state or condition whatsoever, but that in some degree and measure, it may be imbraced and laid hold on; But that must be by looking directly up, where she is essential and permanent, and so we may receive some gracious drops of it, to refresh us in our journey. Seem our present way never so dirty or miry, never so ragged or stony, never so sharp and thorny, it is good to plod on (without thoughts of planing or levelling it our selves) without looking behind or before, and on either side, or indeed too curiously and narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on it, or striving to leap out of it without a call; now and then casting our eyes upwards, till we are insensibly drawn out of it, or it be rendred whatsoever it seemed before, a way of pleasantness, and our paths are peace; which are only the ways of right Wisdom, immediately sent from above.</p>
               <p>Were it in the power of the Will (that Sheriff in the Soul) to give the Affections possession of all kind of Worldly goods, ever enjoyed by man, in such order and method, as the most contriving Imagination could invent, and a man could make himself Prince of what <hi>Eutopia</hi> he pleased; I question much, whether he would be long content, if the Heaven were in his Eye, or any thing could present it self to his mind, which were out of his reach. I do agree with him who said, that to be Content is but another phrase to be Happy, but how this thing Content is obtained, will prove the main question. I cannot yet find ground to think or believe, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials whereof Content are framed, are in our own breasts, orat least anyways at our own disposal, or that it was ever yet in the power of any mortal, to build or make ready a Temple for her, as has been fansied of old for other Graces. She is very
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:50605:161"/>
fickle in her habitation, and comes and goes, at the pleasure of some greater Power, than Earth barely contains. St. <hi>Paul</hi> had got her, and learn't her, he tell us; and how he could <note n="(a)" place="margin">Phil. 4.13.</note>

                  <note n="(b)" place="margin">2. Cor. 4.8.</note> 
                  <hi>troubled on every side though not distressed.</hi> And surely, he has a very dull Centinel or Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in his Tower above, who has not often alarms in his inferior faculties below, and those common Souldiers of the Soul, (as I have called them) readily catching up their Arms, or at least sullen and discontent, and not moving as they should; and there is no absolute perfect remedy to allay them, or please them again, but by recourse to, and yielding them up to be governed by the wise disposer of all things; who of his free bounty and grace, if we become once able to see his hand, is pleased now and then to shine upon us, and shew us his face. And if at any time he but <note n="(c)" place="margin">Psal. 30.7, 8.</note> 
                  <hi>turn his face from us,</hi> every man is in <hi>David's</hi> case, <hi>troubled,</hi> and will find no other way for cure, than <hi>crying to the Lord, and getting to his Lord right hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we examine the word Content in a literal sense, it seems to me, to be a fulness, or satisfaction; we talk of <hi>continens</hi> and <hi>contentum,</hi> in such a Notion. Now if the Soul of man be a special Divine Emanation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (and we the rather hold it to be so than that of other Creatures from its common inordinate craving) I cannot see in Reason (which is the surest mark of our existent Divinity) how it can be filled at any time, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than with hope; which, being an aiery thing (and as <hi>Solomon</hi> says <note n="(a)" place="margin">Prov. 13.12.</note> 
                  <hi>deferred maketh the heart sick</hi>) in comparison of fruition, will often admit the entrance, or intrusion of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what else, not to fill it, but to rake and tear it for a time, and therefore it must be some gracious stop of the Souls craving, rather than properly its satisfaction, or content, some blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding, or hooding from the ordinary presentments of the World; Some little diversion, and way of exercise of all, or at least, its best faculties, as it were out of our selves (and that by the gracious warmth of that Sun of Happiness) in duely beholding his Image first, (the earnest of Happiness) since we cannot behold him as he is, which is Happiness it self: And how this may most commonly happen, or readily come to
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:50605:161"/>
pass, I have indeavoured, according to my ability, to declare, under that often happy prospect of <hi>true Charity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now give me leave here to speak a little of some things, wherein we are often deceived. To mention ought of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness like to arise from any bodily pleasures, common to Beasts, as eating, drinking or the like, (wherein Man becomes as certainly deceived as any thing) were below a manly Soul. But I shall speak only of the Souls peculiar seeming satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in hope according to that saying, <hi>Soul take thine ease, thou hast goods laid up.</hi> Surely many men, who have spent their years in turmoil as well as their days in Vanity about it, may be said to have gathered much, and tasted little; some have had so many pleasant seats, as that they could not take their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in any, and perhaps have entred Friendship with so many, that they could never enjoy the Happiness of true Friendship with one. On the other side, any sedentary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative course of life, will as soon deceive a man's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation; that seeming withdrawing a man's self out of the World, while he is in it, and a poetick fancy of some Earthly <hi>Elysium</hi> to be found here, will never create that <hi>satura quies,</hi> so much talked of; it may prove a vale of rest unto the Body, but not unto the Soul, nor a Happiness to either. The Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination cannot be at rest one moment, and whatsoever it brings in, to the Affections, if it appear not useful and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, it will prove but unsavory to them, and be so rendred now and then by it self; and raises them trouble about trivial matters, as quick and soon, as about weighty. The proper, chief, and peculiar pleasure or delight of the Soul, from any cause that ever I could find, or guess; is the reverberation of some good works, or a light or joy arising or springing from thence, which in a retiredness from the World, will miss of many objects to act upon, from which this Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness might redound. I know there was a great Emperor and a wise, who after he had tasted what Fruits busy greatness (but perhaps not good works) could afford, voluntarily sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred up his Scepter; and could not be prevailed with, upon the greatest invitation, and most urgent Reason, to accept it again; but feelingly said, 'tis likely, He took more true delight in the growth of the Lettice in his Gardens, than the increase of his Dominions. And doubtless there are many more would give up their Verdict for that state of life as most of all tending towards Happiness, which God
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:50605:162"/>
appointed <hi>Adam</hi> in the state of his Innocency: But I, who have had some taste of the pleasure of it, and perhaps better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it, than some who admire it will not recommend it, as a station wholly exempt from disquiet. Even since our first Trespass, we are subject to be afraid, if we hear but a voice in the Garden; and the very withering of any gourd we have there, is enough to raise our anger, especially if before, like <hi>Ionah,</hi> we rejoyced, or were <note n="(a)" place="margin">Jonah. 4.6.</note> 
                  <hi>exceeding glad,</hi> at the growing of it, though we <note n="(b)" place="margin">ver. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>made it not to grow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do not think but there are, and have been many, of late days, as well as in <hi>Davids</hi> time, both publick and private men, who <note n="(c)" place="margin">Psal. 49.18.</note> 
                  <hi>while they lived, counted themselves happy men</hi>; nay some who have lived all their days in the Sun-shine of the World, and set at last too, in brightness, and, though <hi>their pomp has not followed them,</hi> yet have escaped that Prophet's prediction, of <hi>never seeing light,</hi> and are now at rest, and happy; but these are but rare Largesses of Gods bounty, and goodness. Such a condition there might be, and they might be contented in it; but yet they could not be so happy as to cross <hi>Solon</hi>'s observation of <hi>Ante obitum nemo, suprema<expan>

And therefore in our search after some proper way and means to reduce the Soul to a quiet state, which effected, is some degree of Happiness, we must reject what are called the goods of the Body and Fortune, and have recourse to what will enlighten or improve that which is eternal in us, and is truly our selves.</p>
               <p>Amongst which what we call Learning may deservedly be ranked. But yet I think the multiplicity even of that, which is rather the treasure than the goods of the mind, doth more distract than instruct us, more burden than ease and satisfy the mind. Of this I take St. <hi>Paul</hi> to speak when he saith, <hi>knowledge</hi>

Surely it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired and adventitious knowledge, not the power to know and discern so far as may concern our future safety, that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lests us, for of that <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <note n="(f)" place="margin">Prov. 2.10.</note>

The bringing in of Foreign Plants, and setting them in a man's own Soil, provided he have a judgment to distinguish good from evil, may be good, and in some measure plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant: but to have his own Soil improved, to such a degree, as to raise, or produce as wholesom, and as savory, and such as may nourish, and heal, as well as delight him, or others (which every man may do in some measure by digging at home) is better, and will prove more cordial to him. He who takes in too much of this Foreign kind of Lading, will find it (though light, yet) cumbersom, and troublesome: and neither please his Pilot, nor his Passengers, his Intellect or his Affections. I cannot but think, that many, originally excellent, brave Souls, like clear Springs, might of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and from themselves, have afforded pure and curious Waters, which, by receiving in so many inlets, and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereby with a rapid stream to carry all before them, have become not only useless, but troubled and muddy, and withal not seldom lost as well their original name, as their Virtue, Repute and Estimation. Truth is a blessed thing, and happy is he (I will affirm) that finds her, but there are few of our high-flown learned men, I fear, whom we need envy that Happiness. Certainly there are many deeply read as we say, and we may give them the appellation of great Scholars too, who have lost her in a crowd; that sought too much abroad, when perhaps with less labour, and God's blessing, they might have found her at home, naked as she is, and so, naked, have better presented her to the ignorant and mean, and such as are not capable to receive her with any large Retinue, or At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants. However I am somewhat confident, she is not to be delivered shackled and in Fetters; nor to be established, or set up by an <hi>Ergo</hi>: and that Logick is so far from being any good Centinel, or Guard for Science, that it is (as some before me have held) fitter to establish an Error, than to discover or open a way to Truth. That I seem to declaim against Learning, as a lett, rather than a furtherance to Happiness, I know I shall obtain your pardon, because I believe you Wise, and Charitable, as well as Learned; and for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who may chance to see this, I may hope the like from him; For if he be so happy by that kind of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge barely, he will pity my Ignorance, and want of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:50605:163"/>I do think, the advancement of Reason, may be without the advancement of Learning, and that if any man could frame together materials for such a Work, it would prove the more Happy, though it were not the more Learned Book. Now if we admit or allow of any thing good here, and withal desirable in any measure, beyond what is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely necessary to support us in our Travail, towards some future, constant, permanent, setled Bliss, and Happiness (for certainly we can never lay hold on, and enjoy such here) it must be some inherent gift, which may adorn and beautify the Soul it self; and such, as well used, may give us not only a little light towards our Journeys end; but afford us some warmth and comfort also by fits. A gift whereby the Soul may solace her self, and though a Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, yet become a Prisoner at large, as we say, and obtain a little fairer prospect, than barely out of the gates of her Prison, the organs of Sense. And that is in some measure, a clear and right understanding of things here, while she is here, or in a word <hi>Wisdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wisdom is a general word, and so we would have it here accepted. For properly and strictly taken I think it to be (however we hold the Book that so defines it for Apocrypha) <note n="(a)" place="margin">Wisd. 7.25, 26.</note> 
                  <hi>The breath of the power of God, and a pure influence, flowing from the Glory of the Almighty, A brightness of the everlasting light, and the unspotted mirrour of the power of God, and the Image of his Goodness.</hi> That more immediate (and no way habitual or inherent) light of the Holy Spirit, which leadeth by the paths of Virtue, unto everlasting Bliss and Happiness, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the fear of the Lord is the beginning, or forerunner; and is in truth no other, than what St. <hi>Iames</hi> calls, <hi>pure religion and undefiled.</hi> Which being a thing, not to be discovered by man in man, but to be judged of, at such time, as <hi>Solon</hi> would have Happiness (and that certainly must be after death) is a fitter subject for Divines, under the title of Grace, in the most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable Sense, than for me.</p>
               <p>This indeed is a thing to be desired, above all things, and without limitation, since <note n="(b)" place="margin">Prov. 3.17.</note> 
                  <hi>her ways</hi> (wherein she leads us) <hi>are ways of pleasure, and all her paths, peace.</hi> But since he who has told us so much, has this saying withal, <note n="(c)" place="margin">Prov. 8.12.</note>

and safe a guide it may be for us, and how far it may receive admittance, to cohabit with that special divine gift, <hi>Wisdom.</hi> And also, to say somewhat, of a different kind of worldly Wisdom, and which seldom cohabits with her, under the name of <hi>Subtilty</hi>: Because it is a word attributed to that old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, upon his first deceit to man; and words, the <hi>index</hi> of things, if not someways regulated, are apt to confound our Intellect.</p>
               <p>The thing I am now about to speak of, is indeed no other than what I have already handled, <hi>Reason</hi>; we may call it here <hi>Reason clarified,</hi> that inherent gift in man, which, when it is somewhat clear, and guides and leads us, without transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of any rule either of Justice, or Charity, but follows Truth, so far as it is able to discern her, and is not dazled by any Mists or Fogs, arising from some erring, and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Affection; I call <hi>Prudence,</hi> or right Reason. But when it beholds things, as quick, and nimbly, and at as great a distance as may be; If it in any wise transgress the rules be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, or become swaied, bended, or inclined, as aforesaid, I can give it no other name, than <hi>Subtilty,</hi> still al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing it the attribute of Reason, though not right Reason; or else we must rank a great part of Mankind, under the meer <hi>classis</hi> of brute Beasts, and take from them the title and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of rational.</p>
               <p>That this desirable good, <hi>Prudence,</hi> or a clear, or right Reason, may be inherent, and injoyed in great measure by man, and yet avail him nothing towards everlasting Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, nor he prove wise unto Salvation, is a thing, I will not, or cannot deny. All that I am about to alledge, is, the one is no lett, or impediment, but rather a furtherance, for the coming of the other.</p>
               <p>The cohabitation of Wisdom with prudence, in the same person, or whenever they are the indowment of one and the same Soul, is a most blessed, and admirable gift; and why there should be sometimes, seemingly maintained, a kind of necessity of their separation; and that the lesser, must wholly give place, and cease to be, for the introduction of the greater (though it is very likely, this thing I call Prudence, has often by a kind of degeneracy into what I call Subtilty, forced Wisdom's absence) I trust, and believe there is no firm ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:50605:164"/>We should not be so out of love with the word <hi>Magus,</hi> as to condemn all, under that notion, and hold all Philosophy to be vain, and so conclude not any wise are called, because St. <hi>Paul</hi> has said <note n="(a)" place="margin">1 Corinth. 1.16.</note> 
                  <hi>Not many &amp;c.</hi> or because <hi>Solomon</hi> has truly told us, <note n="(b)" place="margin">Pro. 21.30.</note> 
                  <hi>there is no Wisdom, neither understanding, nor counsel against the Lord,</hi> to argue there is none for him; is more than I think, we have commission to do. It is an undeniable truth, that <hi>the wisdom of this World, is foolishness with God,</hi> and that Wisdom, in the abstract, is God's peculiar, and to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, with an exclusive particle, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> has done it, <note n="(a)" place="margin">Rom. 16.27.</note> 
                  <hi>To the only wise God,</hi> or <note n="(b)" place="margin">1 Tim. 1.17.</note> 
                  <hi>To God only wise, &amp;c.</hi> And he, who is not at all times ready to deny himself, and wave any self-sufficiency in that point, never merited the title of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Yet without any necessary self-denial, it may not be improper, or imprudent, to allow an inherent kind of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in man, as God's gift, if it be owned with the same qualification, as our Saviour approves or allows in case of Riches, that there be put no trust therein. 'Tis a good cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and commendable, to put men in mind of not trusting to either; but absolutely to condemn the Owners thereof, if any such, is not so. Perhaps it were to be wished, that some men, who, to lay a good foundation for grace in their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory, as they seem to pretend, do utterly decry all other excellent gifts of the Soul, under the name of Worldly Wisdom, and would have it rooted out, as obstructive to Spiritual gifts, as they peculiarly term them, were such indeed themselves, as they desire their Auditors should be; that is plain, simple, well meaning men. But since the number of weak and foolish men, does always far exceed that of the discerning and Prudent; and since weak and ignorant men, are soonest won by a smoothing kind of Flattery, that theirs is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, and to them alone belong the Promises; We have cause, I fear, to suspect that some, who are very solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous, and over-earnest Preachers of this Doctrine to others, are not free from subtilty, or policy therein (though of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they are, and such as I say may cohabit, and well agree with Wisdom in the same Soul) and take up, and make use of those very Sayings, which were chiefly meant and intended by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> against themselves.</p>
               <p>I do not alledge it as an observation, worthy any regard, neither do I know, whether it has been made before; But we find not St. <hi>Paul</hi> any where, so strongly declaiming against
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:50605:164"/>
Worldly Wisdom, twice together citing the Prophet <hi>Esaias, Where is the Wise? where is the Scribe, &amp;c.</hi> as in those two or three first Chapters to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and that immediately after his complaint of their divisions, and telling them, how <hi>some said they were of Paul, some of Apollos, some of Cephas.</hi> As if he should seem to allow a kind of policy or Worldly Wisdom, in those factious sidings and parties, and admit, how advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous it might prove to the leaders thereof; yet God, and Truth, being still the same, There was no need to fight, or contest for it, under the peculiar Colours, or pretended Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, either of himself, or <hi>Apollos</hi> or <hi>Cephas.</hi> But that, such their doings, were Folly and Madness in the sight of God, and not in reality Wisdom, as perhaps they esteemed it. He tells them (immediately before his declaration, of the Wisdom of the World being foolishness with God, using there, the word <note n="(a)" place="margin">1 Cor. 3.19.</note> 
                  <hi>Craftiness</hi>) of their manner of building on his Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; Bidding them take heed, how they built thereon: Indeed he does not absolutely condemn such Builders, neither do I, but this may be said from his words to such men (for I know not how to build upon his words, Castles in the Air, or Purgatories, as some have done) that they had need pass through a Purgatory of Repentance in this life, for building Wood or Hay or Stubble (instead of Gold and Silver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Foundation.</p>
               <p>I have Charity enough to think or hope, at least, that this kind of Subtilty, of fashioning Gods word, so, to a mans own Model, as that he may thereby best raise his own fortune, and advancement thereon (since it never yet obtained a Patron, and is utterly disclaimed and disowned by all men) is very rare. But the one, and the other, of these men, the <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> and the <hi>Subtile,</hi> as I distinguish them, which is but from their Reason looking different ways, have left us some of their several Precepts, and Maxims, to walk by, if we please. I am not much acquainted with such Writings, neither have I read, or studied them; from that Reason I enjoy, I have ever thought, a man may become better inabled, to walk by his own guide, than another mans, and that if any one should collect all the sage Sayings, which ever the World afforded, and had them ready <hi>ad unguem,</hi> as we say; he would never prove the more subtle, or prudent person for them. They might be like Jewels in a Swines snout, perhaps stay him a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle now and then from extravagantly wrooting in the Earth,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:50605:165"/>
but never further him towards the acquiring Food, or what his Affections would prey upon; nor afford him lustre to walk by, with any such decorum or comeliness, as if they were his own proper ornaments, or extracted from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <p>The chief and principal Corner-stone, for the subtle mans Building, is, we know (though we desire not to know all) deep Dissimulation, polished with Lyes; And though he may have other fine wrought Materials, and a pretty kind of var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish't Mortar, to cement his Fabrick; Yet, what great and lasting Building, or at least pleasant Structrure, any man can raise on such Foundation; I leave to any sober person to judge.</p>
               <p>Indeed this very thing, Dissimulation, has ingrossed the name of Wisdom to it self, and no man is allowed the title of the one, till he first obtain a perfect habit in the other. It has been too much esteemed, a Court-like and Princely Virtue, or quality; and some, no mean ones, have professed to desire, their Son and Successor should learn no other Lesson, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to live, and govern prosperously and happily. If such men did but consider that they often find, by Experience the Mistress of Fools, that there is a great number of men, which make as little use of their very outward Sense to find them out, as their Reason, they would never esteem this Art, for any point of Policy in themselves; For (to take up <hi>Solomon's</hi> saying in this case, <hi>Surely</hi> 
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Pro. 1.17.</note> 
                  <hi>in vain the Net is spread in the Eyes of every thing that hath wings</hi>; and it must be a very dull Eye, that at some time, or other, or upon some occasion, or other, is not able to peep through this false net-work vail: which when once men do, such catch little by it, and, if accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a common English Proverb, they gain any thing in the Hundred, they lose more in the Shire. Men do not naturally love masked Faces; and what true Friendship, or perfect Love can any man expect in return from others, who puts off coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Wares to all men? He who can make it his trade, and profession, purposely to disfigure the very Image of Truth (that is himself, the Image of God) must needs be sensible sometimes, that he mocks himself, with his fellow Creatures; and cannot be ignorant, that his Creator cannot be mocked. I dare appeal to any such man, whether he has not some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times deceived himself to scorn, if not to derision; and so over-acted, that he has sensibly found, that his longing Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:50605:165"/>
had been better gratified, if his brains had been more quiet, and at rest, and that he had obtained better tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and quicker returns for them, if he had not hung out so many, and various signs for them.</p>
               <p>There are many men, who never attained what they ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly desired, or earnestly pursued, for this very Reason; that by utterly disowning their main intent, have greatly puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and at length caused their Friends, and followers, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert them, rather than always walk along with them in the dark, or in a mist.</p>
               <p>A man may be allowed sometimes, <note n="(a)" place="margin">Pro. 20.5.</note> 
                  <hi>dark Sayings,</hi> but not false lights; and we may admit, <note n="(b)" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>counsel in the heart of a man to be like deep Waters,</hi> but not muddy, or discoloured Waters; Such, do most commonly deceive the Authors. It is not seldom, that these kind of men meeting together, become like two men in the dark, and stumble together, but neither, as <hi>Solomon</hi> says well <note n="(c)" place="margin">Pro. 4.19.</note> 
                  <hi>knows at what he stumbles.</hi> When a Cretian meets with as perfect a Cretian as himself, he is forthwith then (if not at some other times) in a perfect maze, and must needs confess himself a Fool, because he is justled in his old paths, and knows not readily which way to walk, nor so much as to turn himself.</p>
               <p>We needed not, indeed, have ranked these kind of men, under the notion, or title of Wisdom; unless to distinguish them from those, we term Innocents, from whom they differ in a large degree, wholly deserting the attendant of that attribute, Innocence, if we believe <hi>David,</hi> who says, it <hi>will bring a man peace at the last.</hi> Whatever such man esteem himself, or however he may be esteemed of by some (and it is an evil fate, that sometimes the Fool should be applauded for Wise, and a wise man derided for being circumvented, or overreached, as men term it) there is no Wise man, but will conclude with <hi>Solomon,</hi> that <note n="(d)" place="margin">Pro. 10.18.</note> 
                  <hi>He that hideth hatred with lying lips, and he that uttereth a slander is a fool.</hi> Nay I will be bold to go further, and say, that he who uses to gratify a far more noble Affection, than hatred can be esteemed, with a lye; and with any seeming approbation, or allowance of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, is no better than a Fool; and such is every one, who professes, and allows of dissimulation, as an Art.</p>
               <p>Surely, whenever any man draws a false vail over himself, to hide himself from others, the Devil throws another over him, to hide him from himself; Or else his Reason would
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:50605:166"/>
shew him his folly, together with his falshood. That Reason is very weak in man, which shews not to the whole Soul, at some time or other, falshood to be a crime. If it do not, that man is a very Fool, in the estimation of all men; and I may tell him according to my definition, he has no conscience, that is, no consultations, whispers, or debates, amongst the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of his Soul; which thing, he will take as a greater ignominy, than the other title. If it do, and it is heard (which is the thing I call conscience) and yet a man acts against it, in a constant course of motion, his Reason is weak, and he can never be allowed for wise. For when his Reason becomes subservient to Affections only latent and not up in Arms on the suddain; It is rather deceived into a compliance, than mastered, or overcome by force. I say not, but that the most Prudent, nay the most Wise here on Earth, may act sometimes both foolishly, and falsly too; but then, it must be from an Acute disease, which quickly terminates, not a Chronick and lasting one in the Soul, not such as steals upon a man, and yet he thinks he is in health; not a content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vassalage of Reason, but rather a constrained bondage of her for a time. I have alledged and owned the potency, and predominancy of the Affections in the Soul; But I think in the case of a professed Hypocrite, Reason may as properly be said to misguide the Passions, as the Passions to mislead Reason; and then, that man can never be indowed with Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or right Reason, if at some time or other, it will not take place, and be master.</p>
               <p>We have little Reason to look for Happiness, or expect to find it, in that place, where Wisdom and Prudence are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from the Watch; Or so much as to think, there is any inward order, or regularity in that Soul, where the door or entrance into it (the Tongue) is hung false, of intent and purpose. If any do expect to build a Temple for Peace, with the materials before mentioned, he must inquire out an able Surveyor, and a more exact Contriver, than I am like to prove. I know it will prove a vain thing, to demand of any such kind of person, what quiet, ease, or peace of mind, he usually finds with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himself; since that dissimulation being his chief profession, he will dissemble his injoyments, as well as his aims, and palliate his Wounds and Scars, as well as his Weapons. But if we could appeal to his Conscience (of which there is some question whether he have any) it would tell him, as well as <hi>Isaiah</hi> has
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:50605:166"/>
told us all, there is <hi>no</hi> 
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Is. 48.22.</note> 
                  <hi>peace</hi> obtained upon any indirect course. However every man by appealing to his own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, may receive information, that he who always paints, and colours his own Actions with a false Gloss, or Varnish, must necessarily have some fear, and a jealousy or suspicion within himself; that in all addresses, honest intents, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent well meaning actions from others, there lies secretly hid, some poyson covered over with that <note n="(b)" place="margin">Ps. 141.5.</note> 
                  <hi>precious balm,</hi> he himself makes such daily use of: And what pleasant, quiet, peaceable Inmates, jealousy and suspicion are, I leave to the judgment of all, who have at any time entertained them.</p>
               <p>We will allow a number of men to have a nimble slavish Reason, whom yet we will not allow to be endowed with right Reason, or Prudence. Whenever Reason yields to make a breach upon the rules of Justice, or Charity, she is not right, and streight; but bent and inclined by some evil or ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set Affection. If she do not strike at the Affections for maste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, she is a slave; If she do, there is no peace for the present, nor till their subjection; And hereabout will I conjecture, much of our Peace, and Happiness, and disorder, and unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness in this World, depends.</p>
               <p>I have sometimes thought, that if Reason in man, meriting the title of Prudent, might towards any present safety, and quiet kind of the Souls injoyment of her self, in this life, transgress any rule of Charity, naturally engraven in the Soul, or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to her by Divine Law; It were in this only case of not <hi>believing all things;</hi> for since we hourly behold, the treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and falshood of the World in general, and find withall, how all ages have derided this credulity, and long since given to a good man, in this charitable sense, the name of a <note n="(c)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Semperbonus homo tyro est.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>fresh water</hi> Souldier, or Novice; Since we almost daily see, and read examples of particular men, who by their too great cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity in this kind, have drawn misery and sorrow, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent danger and destruction upon themselves; Why should not Reason, that is right Reason, now and then, nay often, call for, and place, that no beautiful nor pleasant thing, <hi>Suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,</hi> as a Centinel in the Soul?</p>
               <p>I do believe, there is a righteous and good God in Heaven, continually beholding all human actions, and a rewarder and punisher thereof, according to demerit; and since I do believe so much, I may conjecture, that he would not frame human
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:50605:167"/>
Nature, capable of any bodily affliction, or suffering, but what by his gift of patience, and contentedness, might be born with some kind of pleasure or delight. The Mind, or Soul distinct, and of it self, is not vulnerable in any part, but where it yields of it self; and I am sure, pleasure which is the health of the Soul, will sooner arise in being deceived from a good and innocent intent, and meaning, than in deceiving from a bad, and evil one, and therein the deceived has the advantage; and therefore I do not, nor dare not recommend that thought, to any one.</p>
               <p>Wise, or Prudent, we would all be, whether we know when we are so, or not. It is a very pleasant prospect, some have said, sitting on the side of an hill, to behold the Errors in the vale below; but then a man had need be very well seated, and fixed, left that through some mist arising from thence, or some giddiness, or inadvertency in himself; he rowl down into the same, or the like Errors, he beholds. If I could espy out, or find a ground for this kind of sedency; that it ever were or could be possibly obtained, and held, while we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main here on Earth; I would presently grant, that man might be happy here, whatever became of him hereafter; and that a wise man (in no other notion than the Heathen took him) were certainly an happy man.</p>
               <p>In case of Prudence, as I define it, I will agree with him who says, that while she is <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Nullum nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men abest, si sit prudentia</hi> —</note> 
                  <hi>present,</hi> a Deity is seldom <hi>absent,</hi> at least, there is a Deity ready at hand, to assist and help; but I do not agree with him, that she (I mean Prudence) was ever yet within the power of any Mortal, or at his beck or call, or that I am able to <note n="(b)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Monstro, quod ipse tibi possis dare</hi>—</note> 
                  <hi>shew</hi> her to any man, in such manner, as that he may lay hold on her, and detain her. He (with others) who seems to undertake so much, has done no more, than what <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> had done before him, endeavoured to shew us the vanity of all things; which indeed, is a prospect from Prudence, and which, most sober men see by fits; and yet often court those things, they beheld as deceitful, and which usually carry repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and sorrow, as their attendants; So as, to see vanity, do's not amount to a clear sight of all things conducing to Happiness.</p>
               <p>Prudence is a flitting companion of human Nature, if she rise with us, she may hap not to lye down with us; and if she lye down with us, she may hap not to rise with us. If the Spaniard had his wish, and the World should be able to rise wise one morning, it is to be doubted, or feared, above half
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:50605:167"/>
of it would go to bed foolish. So much is a man apt to differ from himself, and that from causes sometimes appearing, and sometimes not. A great and wise Statesman was wont to say (from some experience 'tis like) that that was seldom, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver good, and sound Counsel, which was given soon after dinner; and surely there may be found, many other, and far greater obstructions to Prudence, than fumes arising from a full stomach. The Soul is subject to many imperfections, as long as 'tis subjected to work in a Body, and to become tired, as well as stifled or blinded. If <hi>Alexander</hi> could always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold sleep, as the earnest of death; a man of a meaner capacity, may see it and term it the emblem of folly; and find, that his Intellect, that is the better part of his Intellect (for I do not mean his Imagination but his Reason) is not able sometime to watch for his will, one hour, nay one moment.</p>
               <p>We may sometimes find Reason, or Prudence in the Soul (that is Reason in her best native dress) and behold her as an handmaid to Happiness, and quiet, and she may often prove no less, and so we claim and challenge her to be under our jurisdiction, when ever we find her; but yet still, she is often out of the way when we want her, and would have her, nay, when we have most need of her. We may think to borrow her, or lend her, and indeavour to shew her to another; but if we do, we must lend the party our eyes too, at the same instant and season; for he who is Prudent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, if at any time he will take upon him to make another so, had need be as well able to infuse his own, or some discerning Spirit into him, as afford him his rules and docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to walk by. We are too ignorant, and blind, I fear, in finding out, or discerning the manner of conveyance of very human Prudence, as we call it; whence it is, and by what ways and methods 'tis attained. Prescriptions or dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions for Prudence in the Soul, are good, and yet may be compared to our Physicians <hi>methodus medendi,</hi> towards recovery or health of the Body; the method may be orderly obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and a man never the better, it may be somewhat worse. The best and most prudential saying, is no otherwise to be looked upon, than a Recipe, which works on several Subjects several Effects, and several Effects on the same Subject, at se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Times and Seasons. We may grant <hi>Solomon</hi> to be as great a Doctor as any, in that case: but none of his precepts are so far approved, as to be Universally infallible, and without
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:50605:168"/>
exception. It is generally true indeed, which he says (as for instance in this) <note n="(a)" place="margin">Prov. 15.1.</note> 
                  <hi>A soft answer turneth away wrath</hi>; but we meet sometimes, or at particular seasons, with tempers and constitutions, where a rough, blustring, or bold answer shall soonest work that effect. Though he generally tells us, there is a time for all things, he could never prefix that time, to particular occasions, or particulars to time; that must be left to every mans Prudence, or rather to God. That may be Prudence to day, which will not prove so to morrow. For though we are able sometimes to judge rightly of anothers disease, we are apt to be deceived in the secret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, or suddain alteration of tempers, with which we deal. And therefore he himself is forced to leave us at large, with some such excellent general sayings as these, <note n="(b)" place="margin">Prov. 16.1.</note>

               <p>A quick discerning sight of Reason (often by the level of Justice and Charity though Gods gracious direction) which some men have pretty ready at hand, and in a sort fixed in the Soul; has many and great advantages here, and were to be wished, if but for this one attendant, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> glances at, that a man might <hi>suffer fools gladly;</hi> That is, not fret and vex himself, at the beholding the inherent folly and madness of some men in the World.

               <p>It is sufficient to render human Nature somewhat unhappy, and incapable of any setled tranquillity of mind; that this one seeming inherent gift, or Attendant in the Soul, <hi>Right

Reason,</hi> or Prudence, shewing her self sometimes as our Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, does at other times become so treacherous, as to desert and forsake us, and leave us only light enough to have the want of her espied. It is, and will be owned as some point of knowledge, to observe the cloudiness which sometimes hangs over us: To discern our want of so clear a sight into very human affairs, as others are at the same time indowed withall, or we perhaps at other times; How often weaker eyes, in estimation, outvye us as we say, and that we are forced as it were, to borrow, or take our light, or have our Candle lighted from them, as I may say. Now if we do not at such time withall consider and behold our selves, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a subject of infused light, capable of receiving more or less, according as it may further the good will and pleasure, or secret purpose of some Almighty Power, than an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent light of our selves, or shining at any time by our own proper power, or strength; Every view or espial of such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, which is often incident to the wisest man, must necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly torment, and vex us: And no man, how wise soever, is able to prevent these billows, arising from such his often co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations, nor able to shroud himself from this very kind of storm, or be at rest in his mind, without recourse to some such shelter as this, that there is some Eternal light, <hi>which lighteth every man which cometh into the World,</hi> according to his good will and pleasure, and <hi>from whom every good and perfect gift descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, as from the father of lights.</hi> And therefore I am prone to think, those Heathens so much in esteem with us, either secretly owned all their common abilities in this kind, as divine gifts, without assuming a self-sufficiency; or yet thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves wise by Fate (for so it is likely they call'd Providence) did in a manner render up their Souls to their Donor, or Author (from whom how much further they might be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned in the end, I know not) or else rather palliated a tranquillity of mind, than really felt any. If they had any thing of Wisdom, or foresight, as we say, they must needs espy their own defects and weakness, and that view must necessarily beget some disease in the Soul, unless they were able to behold or believe, a wise disposal of all things, as well as an inevitable one. For as to any thing under no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter notion than Fate, Destiny, or Necessity, as well blind as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable, it would afford a man rather ground for discontent, and sooner prompt him to curse his fate, than acquiesce in it.

But if any man will admit they beheld an irresistible, but yet all-seeing and wise power, under any of those names, I will not quarrel, or dispute with him about words.</p>
               <p>Thus have my thoughts sometime rambled in relation to Happiness here, or a desire of any thing here, to make us so. Never let us envy any man for his outward accessions; They will do us no good if we had them; for his inward indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, we know not what they are, or how easy and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant in his Soul, or how they would fit us if we injoyed them, or the like. Let him who is able only to satiate the Soul, moderate our desires here, and make us wise, onely, unto Salvation; and then are we happy (even here) whether we know it, or no.</p>

               <head>Epist. IX. Wherein the Author maintains Divine Wisdom and Providence, ruling in, and over the Soul of man, more especially, and more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently (if considered) than any work of the Creation: And that the Affections in the heart of man seem that part of the Soul, whereon God more especially exercises his prerogative, moulding and changing them on the suddain, to his secret purposes, beyond, and even contrary to any foresight, conjecture, or Imagination of the very Soul it self.</head>
               <p>THere are already extant, no doubt, the footsteps or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of many more excellent Souls than mine, which have indeavoured by their Writings, unknown to me, to render conspicuous to the World, or to a succession of Souls after them, a constant and continued operation of one only E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal intellectual wise mind, in every the most vulgar and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary motion, of the most common visible work in the Creation. And surely he who has but the ordinary discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit of a man, is either strangely fascinated, or else had need go out of this World, and be transplanted into some other, before he can become capable to deny in his heart the belief of such a thing, it is so obvious to sense in each particular. Nature, as we call it, has no such certain impress upon its habitude or motion, as that we can in any case rely thereon; for when she seems to intend one thing, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence draws forth another, not contrary to Nature. And upon the most diligent search thereinto, we cannot arrive to any sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, or come to an end of our enquiries, but after all we doubt, and wonder and are nonplus'd; Cause direct us to Cause, and all to one that is the first and Supreme; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as every Herb, according to the old saying, is sufficient to demonstrate a God, and give some higher title to the cause of all being and motion, than Nature.</p>
               <p>The Soul of man, and its strange excellent faculties, has not seldom happened to be as you may perceive, the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful subject of my thoughts; and therefore I would not seem here to descend any lower than that, to find out, or maintain a providence; nor indeavour to extract that out of a Flie, which is more visible, and may far sooner be
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:50605:170"/>
perceived in man himself, if he could or would but look into himself.</p>
               <p>That the Soul of man (or Spirit and life in man as some would) is that work, or extract in Nature, in respect to which, all sublunary things seem at first to have been created, and yet continue subservient, will not be denied by any, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. And therefore in all likelyhood, <hi>that,</hi> if any, may be esteemed a free Agent according to Nature, and out of the Dominion, or Government, of any superior distinct power from Nature, and so work as regularly and orderly as any other, according to the common course of Nature. But if any the least inspection be made into it, it will quickly be found, and observed to be more various and strange (I might say exorbitant) in its motion, than any other work in Nature, and more strangely stopped, and turned in its course, so as its mutation cannot be rationally imputed to the dominion of any thing, under the bare names of Nature, Fate, Chance, or the like, nor any other thing than some Eternal Intellectual mind. For if it be prone by Nature to commit all those acts we term or call evil, beyond that of any other Creature, as it too often happens by experience: If it at any time work that which is good, above and beyond that of other Creatures too; which is as visible; then necessarily, there is some power visibly exerted over the Soul of man, beyond that of Nature. Which thing I somewhat wonder, how it escapes the daily obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or notice of the most ordinary Intellectual mind.</p>
               <p>Surely the Soul only passes with it self for a free Agent, while it is busy and intent in looking outwards; and not while it looks inward, by reflex upon its past and present motions. For whatever we think we see, or know at other times, we then suspect at least, whether, clearly and truly we see, or know at all; or how, or to what end and purpose we act, or move; and are inforced secretly to own our selves foolish, and miserable, until some unhappy gale of Pride, fill or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Sails of our Imagination again. For certainly no man ever looked soberly and narrowly into himself, but found himself, that is the best part of himself, not only a prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and underrestraint, but an absolute Subject, and Vassal to some Superior Power; and so under a necessary, and legal constraint.</p>
               <p>If we behold the folly and madness incident to man, and seeming inherent in our Nature, we may well admire, how we happen to live in so much order and peace, as we do. If
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:50605:170"/>
we look upon that Viceroy in us, <hi>Reason,</hi> to be of any absolute restrictive power in us, and our own by Nature, we may well admire, and wonder at our daily mad extravagant follies; And therefore we cannot adjudge <hi>that,</hi> other, than placed as a Guard or Centinel, and now and then as a Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, or Controller in us; but of no power to command, and so must necessarily yield such power to be in some Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, over and above what we are able to find out in Nature, or the like.</p>
               <p>I have thought, as well as others doubtless before me, that the World is ruled by Wisdom, but not ours; that our folly is sufficiently apparent to our selves, and that through our folly, rightly and humbly discerned, an infinite Wisdom shines or glimmers, somewhat to be seen; And farther, that we live in such order as we do, is not from any inherent prudence in our Governours (the contrary every man is too apt to espy) but a Wisdom shewn through their weakness, plainest seen, and best extracted (so it be not done with an evil eye) from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding their weakness. Which Wisdom, did we not some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time behold, as well as their folly, we should never be able so much as to speak rest unto our Soul here, or dethrone, or keep Fear from an absolute dominion in it.</p>
               <p>We can readily grant and allow to a man, such as we term Wise, a kind of ability to carry on his designs, and intended purposes by others, in such a secret, close, and covert way and manner, as that, those his subservient Agents, although they chiefly act as from him, and for him, shall imagine and think the while, they act all along for themselves; and that there were no other secret spring, or engine that moved them, than their own Affections, or that light, by which their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections moved (as some would have it) their own proper Intellect; and to this our Wise man, we can afford the glory of the Action, when we see the End; and pass by, as unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, those Instruments, which seemed to carry the greatest stroak in the affair, while it was in action. And it is strange, we cannot sometime move one step higher, and afford as much to some Divine Essence, to which power is as insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably annexed, as Wisdom; since from our very reason we are able to affirm, it must necessarily be such a kind of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that worketh all in all. Man cannot, as we say, make a Mercury of any logg, but at best and utmost, conjectural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pick out, and make use of such instrument as is fittest for
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:50605:171"/>
his purpose; and he is a wise man, who can do that: but to the first and principal Mover, in such necessary concurrent action, there is absolutely requisite, such a power, as is able to fashion and wholly to mould, and change the Souls of men, to secret intents and purposes, rather than lead and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline them, and that is God; through whose Grace we now and then see and behold, how those wise men of the World, who thought they had wrought others to work pursuant to their own wills, intents, and purposes, have all the while indiscernibly (by themselves) and ignorantly, fulfilled the wise and secret will of the Almighty, (manifest in the sequel) rather than their own.</p>
               <p>Some men may, at some special times, think themselves na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally Wise, and please themselves with an imaginary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of self-ability, and that such and such things, proceed from (or at least succeed according to) their foresight. But this seldom holds or lasts longer, than their blind Affections are gratified by it, or in some measure pleased, with a good success as we call it, or prosperity in the World: For 'tis at such time chiefly, that men take their own brains for able Contrivers, and Surveyors; and think themselves wholly beholding to them. Let but any thing cross, or grievously wound those Affections, and then we find the greatest Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher and Naturalist, at a loss, and his Tongue becomes his own, rather than his Brain (though strictly neither is so) and he will be prone, readily to cry out <hi>Digitus Dei,</hi> and behold that finger in a storm, and through a cloud, which he saw not before, though it were as apparent; he will then see and believe the greatness and glory of the Sun, above other Bodies, by its visible Bow only; which holds no longer than the clouds continue.</p>
               <p>And therefore it is a great mercy to any one, to have this vail opened by crosses or otherwise; that he may look in, and behold the slippery places, men are set in here, and the place of rest which is otherwhere prepared. For if there be any Sanctuary (in the ordinary notion we use the word) for the Soul to flee unto for present ease and rest (over and above that quiet the Soul finds in an Universal Love and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which it hath for all Creatures) it is a firm belief, that there is the hand of a wise God, permissively at least, in the disposition and actions of all men. And truly I could not wish the veriest enemy a greater displeasure, I believe, than to
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:50605:171"/>
think otherwise; or pray against him in worse terms, than <hi>Fabricius</hi> did at supper time, upon hearing the <hi>Grecian</hi> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy, and the opinion of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> that the immortal Gods took their pleasure without regard of human affairs; <hi>God grant that Pyrrhus and the Samnites be of that opinion, while they have War with us</hi>!</p>
               <p>A Wisdom in the Deity, not for it self, but over us, and for us, is that gracious and happy sight, which must keep us from sinking in a storm. A belief effected through our Reason; that <note n="(a)" place="margin">Ps. 93.4.</note>

               <p>It may seem a needless discourse to you (since it is not like to be seen of others) to dispute for God, and talk of Providence, when I in no wise doubt, but that you always move with a fixed eye thither; And to think to prevail over other men,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:50605:172"/>
and settle them in that opinion, may seem almost as vain a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to him, who maintains the Affections in the Soul of man, to be the principal Spring in its motion, and those Affections to be at the sole disposition of an Almighty Power, and out of the reach of human battery, which the Intellect seems not. For every Soul is better able, even of it self, to behold truth, than embrace or affect it, and we find it more easy to awaken mens Reason, and inform their judgment, than either reclaim or guide their Affections. But for that, we only deliver some grounds of our opinion to be considered, if ever they come to be seen of others.</p>
               <p>That in the extraordinary, at least, motion or inclination and turn of the Affections chiefly, there needs the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of a Divine power, and that there is nothing of casual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, fate, or chance in the case; If I should alledge Scripture, it might seem to many, a begging of the question, and I should obtain little credence, to tell them from thence, that God <note n="(a)" place="margin">Ps. 33.15.</note>

But to alledge that strange instance of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> moving first against the light of Reason, and after acting in despight of many signal wonders, for that God had hardened his heart, as 'tis repeated several times in the story, may seem much more so. I would not be suspected of you, or any in the least once to imagine, that any man sins by the direct guidance of Providence (there is another power that has a recourse to the heart, as the chief Shop or Workhouse in the Soul of man, and <note n="(f)" place="margin">Joh. 13.2.</note> St. <hi>Iohn</hi> tells us who it was, that put it into the heart of <hi>Iudas</hi> to betray his Master) but I think the heart is only bent and inclined to evil, when God letteth it alone to it self, or the bare light of weak Reason, and leaves us destitute of his help; And in that very case, God so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:50605:172"/>
the event of sin by his providence, as that it becomes serviceable, to his most Wise, most Just, and most Holy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses; And further that when the heart has once wedded it self to some particular object, through the deceitfulness of sin or the like, there is no divorce to be had or effected but by the special assistance of divine goodness towards the Soul of man. For notwithstanding Reason may be convinced by the arguments of another, and there may be a representation of its conviction to the Affections, yet it holds on; Reason may, and often does beat upon the heart, but it cannot enter, so as to obtain any possession; as if it were to shew there were a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendent power, which shuts, and no man opens, and opens and no man shuts, and that that part of man, were more God's peculiar than any other. Thus we find it in the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said case, where <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were sufficient to convince an obstinate <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in point of Intellect, (as he often acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth it) but God had the sole dominion over the heart, and permits it now and then to be contracted and shut up, against all human light, <note n="(b)" place="margin">Rom. 9.17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>That his power might be shewn, and his name might be declared throughout all the Earth,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> from that place.</p>
               <p>Affection in man (as in my thoughts of the Soul I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready touched) seems often the most disorderly, and irregular thing in the course of Nature: And therefore could I once prevail with any man so far, as seriously to consider the strange motion of it, in himself or others; I do think it might prove the readiest way, to quiet it for a time, and dispel those misty clouds which are raised in the Soul, by the very restless strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling of the Affections; and enlighten it to behold, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant working providence over all its faculties, and especially to win and regain that very part of it (for what is our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing to our Creatour, but to admire him? but our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are given to embrace him) and to have our Affections become inflamed thitherward.</p>
               <p>Sometimes our Intellect cannot but observe how strangely and suddainly the Affections are cooled, moved, or restrained beyond its foresight or prospect. We see, or hear, or read a thing an hundred times, and it may be then think our Intellect clear, and discerning too, and yet not become affected with it; And it may be these our waters, at some other times, are rapidly moved, not from the Imagination, I shall rather chuse to say, from some Angel coming down at certain seasons; that
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:50605:173"/>
Assistant, I mean, or Framer of the Intellect, that <hi>spirat quo vult.</hi> Otherwise the same words could never strike so much deeper into one onely, it may be of a great Auditory; and he none of the quickest apprehension, or naturally or usually most discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit; and that to the subduing of an unruly Affection, equally predominant in many others of the same Auditory.</p>
               <p>I know there is no man, but has loved, and feared, and joyed sometimes, without any apparent or discernible cause, to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self or any other; and if he would or could but observe so much, he might possibly discern somewhat more than chance in the disposition if not Creation of his Soul. Some, and not the meanest Wits have stood at a maze at the Affections motion, especially; And though they looked no higher than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, yet terminated in some occult cause, such as the blindness, and sometimes edge, and sometimes dulness of their Affections. It may perhaps seem to many but a mean distich of the Poet, <hi>Non amo te Sabadi, nec possum dicere quare; Hoc tantum possum dice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, non amote</hi>; but I must crave leave to judge otherwise of it, and that he saw by that, as far as ordinary human Reason is able to shew us; and I take his meaning to be, that such is the condition of man, as that notwithstanding, there be often presented to the Affections, an invitation without exception, and sufficient ground and reason offered to them, to imbrace and accept; yet they are stubborn and decline it, and want something more than natural human light, to bring them to compliance. There are thousands doubtless have received all the endearments imaginable from particular persons, and thought well of them, but never heartily affected them: And on the other side, notwithstanding all the scorn and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, injuries and affronts they could receive from others, have yet heartily and truly loved them; So as 'tis no wonder the Heathen amongst all their Gods, thought only Love blind, and so represented him to us.</p>
               <p>Indeed upon the beholding, and consideration, of any the least Plant or Insect, there is a glance offered, of some power wonderful and to be admired; But that power is chiefly to be seen in ordering, ruling, and determining the Passions and Affections of men, sometimes preventing them from breaking forth in an Insurrection, and then suddenly quenching the fire, that the World be not thereby in a greater flame. This doth the Psalmist ascribe to him, <note n="(a)" place="margin">Psal. 76.10.</note> 
                  <hi>Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee, the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain.</hi>

               <p>That men should adventure their Lives, and Fortunes, yea their Souls too, and hack and hew one anothers Bodies in pieces, to please the appetite of an ambitious and covetous Prince, nay perhaps some less apparent Meteor, some one or two Subjects designing either to build on the ruins of others abroad, or divert mens eyes for a while, from looking into their own corrupt, and base designs and practices at home, or the like. What is it? but some base rubbish of Affection in the generality of mankind; sympathetically (as I may say) kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, by the heat of some ambitious desire in particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, or highly inflamed in them at least, by the Devil or some evil Spirit. I am sure there is nothing of Reason or Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence (nay or Nature) could lead the generality of mankind in companies, into such design; since you may quickly and easily convince almost every particular Person of them, that it is safer and better to be quiet at home.</p>

               <head>EPIST. X. Of Credulity, and Incredulity, the rise of both, and that Credulity of the two, is of more pernitious consequence. And of the Evil of imposing on others, or creating or raising a belief on false or uncertain Principles.</head>
               <p>SInce I have elsewhere as well disowned my abilities, as disclaimed any call or Authority, to treat of that incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable divine gift, <hi>Faith,</hi> in a strict and saving Sense; And withall made some kind of confession of my own: I hope, if in declaring here my opinion of the dangers attending Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity, and evil consequence of imposing on mens belief, I do by way of introduction, and making some inquiry into the ordinary acceptation, as well as proper signification of the word, Faith, a little touch upon it, in that gracious Sense; it may be without scandal and offence.</p>
               <p>The word, Faith, is often taken, for that which should be ever, the ground of it, <hi>Truth</hi>; As when we commonly say, there is no Faith in man, we mean thereby, there is no truth in man, or just ground for a belief; and so that saying, <hi>Nulla fides, pietasve viris, &amp;c.</hi> is to be understood. So the word faithful is often meant or intended for true, as that of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which we render in one place <note n="(a)" place="margin">1 Tim. 1.15.</note> 
                  <hi>This is a faithful saying,</hi> and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place render the same words <note n="(b)" place="margin">ch. 3.1.</note> 
                  <hi>This is a true saying,</hi> and such indeed as may obtain an assent and raise a Faith in us. Thus we also conjoyn the words in the oath of fealty or <hi>de fidelitate,</hi> and render it in the administration to be <hi>true and faithful.</hi> And most certainly, whenever Faith or faithfulness is spoken of God, it must necessarily be intended of his truth; as where 'tis said <note n="(c)" place="margin">Rom. 3.3. &amp; 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Shall their unbelief make the Faith of God without effect? God forbid, yea let God be true</hi> &amp;c. So, <note n="(d)" place="margin">1 Cor. 1.9.</note>

                  <hi>Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.</hi> There are, they say, who have reckoned up above twenty several significations of the word Faith in Scripture, but I'le not meddle therewith, or yet trouble you, if I can avoid it, by confounding it with the bare cogitative faculty, but distinguish the one from the other as near as I can.</p>
               <p>Faith, or Belief, in the strict genuine Sense, and proper meaning thereof, I take to be, a conviction or perswasion of
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:50605:175"/>
the Intellective Faculty, to accept a thing for true which it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not digest into any kind of knowledge, or receive under the colourable notion of knowledge. Or more generally thus: An assent or perswasion of the whole mind; Because the Will, and the Affections, if any powerful effect be wrought upon the Understanding, concur for a time therein. This the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> signifies, which is derived from the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suadeo,</hi> and therefore <note n="(a)" place="margin">Joh. 3.36.</note> the Apostle rehearsing the saying of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptist (as we translate it) <hi>He that believeth on the Son, hath everlasting life, and he that believeth not the Son, shall not see life,</hi> by way of opposition one to another, makes use of the words <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> together; And the like may be found in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places.</p>
               <p>Now as to Faith in the most gracious Sense (as well as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of which I have already treated) I do in all humility think it to have its rise and first work (I will not say from, but) with Reason; Nay I think that both Faith and Conscience are Effects in and through Reason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the one case as Reason is passive, in the other case as it is active. Conscience being a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult from Reason's whispers in an advised active deliberation; and Faith being a result (through God's grace) from Reason's si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in an advised yielding, upon a kind of passive deliberation. For truly as Conscience in my opinion is no other than an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the Soul wrought from the bare (seeming) stroak of Reason, so I do believe that in the birth of Faith, such I mean as we talk of in a justifying notion, there is some stroak upon Reason too; but withal I acknowledge there is somewhat more <hi>viz.</hi> an insensible (though Hearing may be the instrumental means of its coming) stroak from the Divine Power and Goodness; A lightning from above <note n="(b)" place="margin">Acts 15.9.</note> 
                  <hi>purifying the heart,</hi> melting the Affections, and new molding them, <note n="(c)" place="margin">Eph. 1.19.</note> 
                  <hi>according to the working of his mighty power.</hi> And this is that precious Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Balm, by which we lenify and heal those wounds made by the stroak of Reason, in some case of Conscience; and such wounds there will be now and then occasioned by the Will's disobedience to Reason's dictates, and serving the Affections.</p>
               <p>Now of this strange work in the Soul, <hi>Faith,</hi> no man can certainly point to any peculiar instant in which it is wrought (as he may to the stroaks of Reason in point of Conscience) neither can we discern any thing of the reality or truth thereof, further than by a general propension to good and a general aversion from evil: And which we cannot by any other way
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:50605:175"/>
shew to others, if we would shew it, than by our works. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the very same may be said of Conscience; We cannot so much as shew that to others, either whether there be such a thing in us or no, or whether it be good, or whether it be evil (if there be such a thing moving in us) unless by the Affections embracing that which is good and rejecting that which is evil: For from thence it may be collected (other men having the like Reason with us) whether the Affections are obedient to Reason, or run by Sense.</p>
               <p>They are both blows or influences likewise upon the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and there is a kind of concurrence or meeting together of all the faculties of the Soul, as I humbly conceive, in both cases. We are told with what other part than the Brain, <hi>man believeth unto Salvation,</hi> and therefore I do here, in the case of a good and perfect Faith, think the word <hi>Confidence</hi> to be most proper: For though it be a word which some by misuse have rendred of no good sound; yet St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes use of it, in this very case, <note n="(a)" place="margin">2 Cor. 5.6, 7, 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Therefore are we always confident,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>(for we walk by Faith, not by Sight) we are confident I say, and willing</hi> &amp;c. repeating it again. For when a compleat victory is obtained as well over the Affections (and by consequence the Will) as over Reason, there is a confidence in the Soul, a reliance on foreign aid, a trust. But yet certainly since there is no dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting argumentative faculty in the Soul but Reason, neither can there be properly a perswasion of ought else; the thing is chiefly effected in and through Reason, though not by Reason: and if Reason at any time be quite left out in either case, I much doubt whether there will be a good Confidence, or a good Conscience. If men would we should behold their Faith, let us see their Reason too attending on it, or coming after it, and permit us likewise to make use of ours; which if they do, they may be assured we shall have an eye to their works, and not much regard ought else.</p>
               <p>There is ever most talk of those things, we least understand, or are able to perceive or judge of. Whatsoever defects there are in the Soul, or whatsoever Errors in any of the faculties happen to be committed; As when men sin against the very plain light of Reason, if they are blamed, if there be an indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to reclaim them, they are apt to talk of their faith, and their conscience, and take them up as weapons, not only to put by the stroaks of others, who wish or would have them morally honest, but even sometimes make use of the same to offend also.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:50605:176"/>
But when the one or the other is thus brought forth (I will not say to view, I may say to ostentation) doubtless St. <hi>Paul's</hi> words in relation to one, is no unfit reply for either, <note n="(a)" place="margin">Rom. 14.22.</note> 
                  <hi>Hast thou Faith?</hi> (hast thou Conscience?) <hi>have it to thy self before God.</hi> It's He alone can judge of the sincerity of both, but if such would approve them to men, and shew their Faith to be true and their Conscience to be good, they must make it evident by such fruits as are proper to them and arise from them, whereever they are; for Faith worketh by Love: and a good Conscience, being a ready obedience of the Affections to the dictates of Reason, will always act in conformity to its laws. These are by the Apostle joyned together, <note n="(b)" place="margin">1 Tim. 1.19. 1 Tim. 3.9.</note> 
                  <hi>Having faith and a good conscience,</hi> and so we are willing to leave them, and by no means separate them, and pray they be not only joyfully embraced by all, but better apprehended by some. Faith, as it is a bare human perswasion in the Soul (for from thence the word is properly derived as I have said) of the truth or falshood of a thing, or the good or evil, lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or unlawfulness thereof, is no more than a bare assent or consent of Reason to the one or the other; but upon Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son's deceit (for no opinion can alter the nature of a thing as it is in it self, but the same remains as it was, good or evil) the Affections are set upon a very dangerous precipice, because sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to Reason by a Law of Nature; if they obey, they must leap with Reason into a gulf on the one side, and if they disobey, they fall into a miry quagg on the other side, and make good the Apostle's saying, in that very sence of human perswasion, <hi>whatever is not of Faith is sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reason is requisite and necessary in either case to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that thing we call Faith, be it natural, or be it supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral: for that no irrational Creature, be it of never so quick a capacity, can be said in anycase properly to believe, I shall make evident in the conclusion. Now though Reason in its nature or original be as well an heroick and valiant faculty, as the most noble and generous in the Soul, and such a faculty as will not presently yield upon every summons, and yields only when it finds an impossibility of victory, and there is left no cause as well as strength to defend it self against all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition; yet sometimes by a kind of supine negligence and want of exercise of this most noble faculty, it becomes so degenerate, that it not only permits the passions to rule in the Soul as they list, but becomes as it were subordinate to that
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:50605:176"/>
of other mens, and seems to move only according to their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>
               <p>This is that thing which I call or term, <hi>Credulity,</hi> sometimes a weakness, but most commonly a laziness in the Intellective faculty; and a conformity of Reason, or an approbation or allowance thereof, to whatsoever is brought before it, without due examination and trial. This is it, which has caused so many vulgar, as well as dangerous and pernitious Errors; and I dare say, were it not for it, that is a laziness of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, Idolatry had never been, or at least never took footing, as we say, in the World; For never any man was yet so stupid and blockish, as upon consideration and due exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, or the least resistive operation of his Intellective faculty to believe the work of his own hands to excel him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and be brought to fall down before it and worship it, and think that it were a greater crime to dismember it than his brother.</p>
               <p>Now though the contrary, <hi>Incredulity,</hi> may be thought sometimes to have its rise from worse Principles in Nature, and to be, as it often is, the effect of a stubborn refractory Will, or rather the Master's whom that Will serves, <hi>viz.</hi> corrupt Affections, so that we find the Saying after a sort ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in particular persons, <hi>Non persuadebis, etiam si persuaseris</hi>: Yet is there in truth a perswasion, and the fault remains in the inferiour faculties of the Soul, which though they may be more violent in their course, do not usually hold out so long; Nay sometimes the Affections (being as I have said in the hands of God and turned as he pleases) do on the suddain unexpectedly comply with his Vicegerent in the Soul, <hi>Reason,</hi> if that be in the right way, though they disobey its first Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. But if at any time the fault be in the Intellect, by neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and a tame compliance, they then err by a kind of Authority, and being led by a blind Guide, such as makes not use of its own eyes at least, they necessarily both fall into a Ditch. A man may do himself much hurt by always keeping that inward door of the Soul, <hi>Reason,</hi> close shut and barred, and believing nothing beyond Sense, that outward Port of it; and such an one may be termed perverse as well as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous (as our Saviour once called his Disciples) but to leave it alway ready open, and become like a child <note n="(a)" place="margin">Ephes. 4.14.</note> 
                  <hi>tossed to and fro, with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lye in wait to deceive others,</hi> is of more
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:50605:177"/>
dangerous consequence. Those incredulous Disciples of our Saviour, believed to good effect at last; and some have obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of <hi>Thomas,</hi> how his Incredulity at first, wrought a good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect at last, and proved a stronger confirmation of our Saviour's Bodily Resurrection, than the ready belief of the other.</p>
               <p>Besides a perverse Incredulity, caused by the Affections too much addiction to Sense, and to be led only thereby, there may be I confess and sometimes is, a kind of Sceptical Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or Academical reservation in man. A doubting fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Soul, neither expellible by Reason or Sense for the present; But this is rare, attending now and then the most quick and searching brain, and doth often proceed from some kind of humility in the Soul, and then likely in the end, terminates in a clear and setled perswasion; For he who is not apt to doubt, will scarce believe any thing with assurance or as he ought to do.</p>
               <p>That blessed fruitful Plant in Nature, Charity, on which I have thought, and cannot but think, every good and perfect secondary gift, is, and must be ingrafted, seems very apt and ready, as well as powerful, to win Reason's assent, to accept things delivered for true; and so, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> says (as of it self) It <hi>believeth all things &amp;c.</hi> But surely there is no more meant by that, than concerns the Fidelity of the Messenger or Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; that is, we are thereby inclined to think that that man verily believes the truth of those things, which he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade my Reason to accept for true; And truly he who hath but the least grain of perfect Charity in him, can ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily do little less for the most fantastick Dissenter or even a modest sober Turk, than thus to judge favourably of his well-meaning (although 'twere to be wished, the Intellect did not now and then find just ground to rebuke that good Affection in the case) But now should I, or any man, be so charitable, as readily to believe the truth of the thing it self; or that there is a firm indubitable ground for any human opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or exposition obtruded upon me, when I yet continue conscious of my own Errors, and daily defects in point of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in like cases (as surely every man is) I should have no Charity left (which men say begins at home) for my self. And in admitting an infallibility in any other person, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out consulting my own Reason; that very infallible person, however he pleased himself with my belief, would judge me a fit Subject for <hi>Anticyra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:50605:177"/>'Tis good for every man to consult his own Reason through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by it self, before he admit any other to take place in his Soul, and to be possessed (or prepossessed as we say) with any another Spirit than his own. I am verily perswaded there is no man living, let his Affections be up in Arms, and as fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious as they will, or can be, against me, for instance, but his own native Reason (if he have any) consulted and advised barely and simply of it self, will admonish him that he ought not to destroy me. Which thing is a blessed curb in Nature, for the preservation of us Mortals, against the destruction of one another, and so I have that little security in Nature besides God's daily preventing and restraining hand. But if once Reason in man become so facile and pliable, as to have that original engravement wiped out, and defaced, and admit the impression of another; And another man shall become (in God's name shall I say? No) master of his Reason, I have nothing left to trust to for my preservation, but Gods extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary wonderful providence. If man can be so far per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, as to think he do's God service by any unjust or bloody act, or helping to promote or further the same (which no man's own Reason of it self ever drove him to; his passion might, and the gratifying another's passion might induce the perswasion) certainly he is credulous, and credulity in that case is very dangerous which we need not go so far as <hi>Greece</hi> for a sad consequence of, and talk of <hi>Agamemnon</hi> only, when every place affords one, though not the like.</p>
               <p>This kind of perswasion, which some would have to be termed Faith, is chiefly wrought through an inclination in mankind, to what we call <hi>Religion,</hi> wherein St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us he once <hi>lived after the strictest sect, a Pharisee,</hi> and then perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and <note n="(a)" place="margin">Acts 26.5. &amp; 9.</note> 
                  <hi>verily thought with himself,</hi> what our <note n="(b)" place="margin">Joh, 16.2.</note> Saviour foretold: That is, he was perswaded or belived, for I do not take the word, <hi>thought,</hi> in either place to be meant of the bare cogitative faculty, as sometimes it is (especially when Reason is lost, after which manner some barely think themselves Princes, and cannot be said properly to believe they are so) St. <hi>Paul</hi> had his Reason about him, and that Reason, yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or consenting, is properly, a belief. I hear of no such thoughts or belief in him afterwards. And here I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess a little further of my own belief, or perswasion; that that man whoever verily believed it lawful to persecute another to the death by Reason of his dissenting from him in point of
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:50605:178"/>
belief only, never yet believed aright or imbraced a true Faith, as he should.</p>
               <p>Man in contemplation, cannot certainly, fall into any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration so abstruse and full of distraction as that of the strange variety of beliefs in the World, in point of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as we term it: How it happeneth or cometh to pass that the Soul of man, of one original extract, and of no great native difference, should in this one Principle, which is the adoration of some Deity, as its Creator and Preserver, run such various ways and courses, and imbrace such contrary tenets, and each believe they hit on the right in point of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Surely if man were generally left unto himself, and some men had not been possessed with other Spirit than their own, the very Spirit of delusion to assist them; A number of men of profound judgement, and subtile in the maximes of Government, and not subject to have cheats put upon them, had never believed of old, the uncouth dreams of their Poets, the idle tales of an old woman, nor the wandring fancies of melancholy Hermits. There has been of ancient invention, some soporiforous Art over mans Reason, first by laying it to sleep, and then exhaling it into a belief; For no such victory as we read of in old times, could ever be obtained by plain force over mans Reason. And Reason yet continues sure, under a kind of fascinating power, or else we in these our days, and in this corner of the World, who have one infallible foundation laid us, and seem to agree therein, could never raise such va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious superstructures, such towers of different Model and Form, and believe none truly and exactly built, but what is done by our master Builders in select numbers and companies; and then for want of looking down upon that Foundation afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, of which Justice was the level, and Charity the cement (and whereof our superstructures I am afraid do not generally partake) batter each other from our several aspiring Turrets, to the admiration and laughter of any sober Heathen.</p>
               <p>There is no cause of these our distractions, and seeming contending about our God, so readily at all times offers it self to my thoughts, and is so approved of my judgment as that of Credulity; a thing though most common in the vulgar, and men of low degree, yet very incident to human nature in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. Something men would deify and believe above Reason, and in a lazy prosecution thereof, believe even contrary to Reason; that is, they lay aside their own Reason to rest, and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:50605:178"/>
accept anothers, perhaps the first comers, and so the next and the next; especially if he bring them any new and strange matter for a belief. Yet in this compliance, though their Reason presently submit, they usually, through it, take the advice of their Affections, and so soonest believe that which they have in desire, or a ready <hi>Will</hi> to; Which thing <hi>Will</hi> is ever attendant on the Affections. Now there are very few men, but would be wise or so accounted, wiser than their brethren, though they are not so. And thereupon if a man in the least estimation for Wisdom, and withall reputed a sober godly man, shall but begin to pity their Errors with a seeming sorrow, and modestly acquaint them, how long they have been led in darkness by others, their liberty of Conscience (for so it must be intitled) enthralled, and that it is high time to awake, and become wiser and more discerning; and that wiser they are, or shall be, if they will believe him; That man shall not want a favourable attention at first, and that usually terminates in a simple credit in the end.</p>
               <p>That the Soul of man, while it is conjoyned to a body here, is a Prisoner and in a kind of Thraldom, we all agree, who believe it to be celestial and a substance of it self. We naturally affect liberty, and therefore upon the very sound of that one world <hi>Libertas;</hi> Reason, which is or should be Mistress in the Soul, and free of it self, though not so free as perhaps it might be out of the Body, is apt to stir and move. But I wish to God it were his blessed will, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it moved in every man, or in the beginning of its motion, it might through his grace consider a little, this common plausible Doctrine to the Affections, <hi>of liberty of conscience.</hi> The Affections indeed, according to my definition of Conscience, are therein included; and 'tis their liberty we would, that they should not be in subjection to Reason; but our best part we enthral usually by this very hearken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and compliance. Our Reason, and what proceeds from that, though we are under some clouds of the Body, is freer than we imagine, neither can any man restrain it without our assent, and that is the only way of slavery it is subject to in sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendring and yielding it self up to another mans; and therefore to preach up liberty of Conscience, is to me a strange Doctrine. I dare challenge all the Potentates or mighty men of the World to deprive me of my liberty of Conscience, that is a free
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:50605:179"/>
consult of my faculties, alone and by my self, or to believe what I list, which is the result of Reason, it self. Indeed they may, by some hard usage of my Body, hinder the free ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of my Soul, while it is in the Body, and they may separate them at last; but that is the utmost they can do. And they do often hinder the gratification of our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, because to the gratifying of them, there is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily some bodily act or motion; and that, it is to be doubted, is the liberty most men aim at, and catching at that shadow they lose the substance, enslave their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to let their Affections reign; and thus are men taken in a snare, while they think to creep from under a net. This is that medicine for cure of Souls which some men have found out, that, like some sort of poison, tickles the heart till it stupify the brain, pleases the affections so far on the suddain, as that they insensibly attract Reason's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, make their own Reason submit to that of others, because others have best pleased them, and so possessed them. Thus is that excellent gift, Reason, deluded, which God has bestowed on every particular man, in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, for the government of his Affections; and which every man may, and ought to make use of alone, and apart by it self; and is a thing that seldom leads a man right, when it moves by consent or Sympathy, and is perswaded and stirs not, but, according to Chancellor <hi>More</hi>'s story, in company.</p>
               <p>They who thus readily lay aside their scale of Reason, to make use of other mens, for their Affections, may be thought to have it of so weak a make and size, as that it would prove a fruitless endeavour, to advise them not to receive any thing for currant at any time, but what they likewise well try and weigh alone by their own; It would break some say it is so slight, and this is the badge of the generality of mankind under the notion of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar. Well, I do not think many men under that notion so weak but that they might very well and very safely do it, and that it is a restiveness in Reason, and a contracted rustiness, rather than a weakness, which a man might wipe off, and that every man might of himself become able (God assisting him) to direct and govern himself, and with more ease, and surer peace, <hi>work out his own salvation with fear and trembling</hi>; At least if he made any use of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:50605:179"/>
he would soon discern the danger of this Foreign assistance towards his present peace, especially volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry aids without Authority of their Prince, who seldom aim so much at others Spiritual advancement as their own temporal. But for the present we will suppose the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of mankind, thus weak, under the notion of the Vulgar, and thereupon instead of advice to them, we will deliver our thoughts by way of remonstrance to you, who seem a man of a clear discerning judgment (out of that rank) and have taken upon you the care and cure of Souls, and that is only; That you continue ever careful (as I verily think you are of your self at present) not to impose on us any thing, you have not first very well ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated, and digested by your Reason, and besides that, you advise others of your degree, over whom you have any influence, to use the like care.</p>

                  <hi>There is envying, and strife, and divisions</hi> amongst us, and we are carnal, and shall be carnal. But that gift of Reason in us hath nothing of carnality in it, as of it self, but is able to inform us, that as God has no need of our quarrelling or contending for, or about him, so neither can such doings please him, or be acceptable unto him. And therefore it may be somewhat of wonder, that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son can assent, or be transformed into a belief, that the Deity whom we adore, should be invocated in any such case, or made partaker or Patron on either side. Surely when some mens Affections have once deluded their own Reason, there follows a necessary consequence, that that Reason should alledge the tendency of such Affections to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God (who is the protector of all that love and fear him) to delude others too, or else we could never believe at any time, we fought for God, or persecuted any man for God's sake.</p>

               <p>Me thinks the Scribes and the Learned on either side, when they help to foment our differences, and would set us together by the ears (for I am of opinion there never was yet a civil national division or distraction without some Levites or pretended Levites in company) would shew much more of a generous Nature, if they would hang out the right and proper flag, and declare to us what <hi>Aesops</hi> Fox told his Cock in the end, that they must feed on us; and I am sure we had better labour to feed them otherwise, than under pretence of fighting for God, fight for them; which, Reason, if it were not very weak, or rather lazy and credulous, would soon espy we do, in
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:50605:180"/>
most cases. I never doubted but God has appointed and raised up for his service many good Shepherds of our Souls, and such as strive to correct our Errors, and faithfully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to enlighten our Reason, for the well and orderly government of our Affections; such as neither go about to court, or yet terrify our Affections, that they may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by enslave our Reason; But they are rare, and of such I need ask no pardon for these my thoughts set down in writing, if they happen to be seen of any beside your self; they will I know readily pass them by with a charitable cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; And of others I will not ask it; but still continuing to think, Credulity in the vulgar (or more properly a lazy Reason) to have been the Anvil, on which the greatest mischiefs and evils in the World have been hammered and wrought, I presume to advise every man, that he make that good use of his Reason, as to see, it was given him to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and guide himself chiefly, and not to be led thereby. And to our wise men of this World, I say, It is no difficult matter for one of an ordinary capacity, who is minded to get up and ride (for the vulgar is often resembled to a Beast of burthen) to cast a bitt into mens mouths (that is their Affections, whereby they will yield up the rein of their Soul (Reason) to be guided any way the Rider pleases. But he who so does (besides the casuality of a fall here) I must tell him he incurs some future danger; It being a Beast, which is apt to carry a man into perdition at the last; And; in my opinion, a Beast, which seldom or rarely bears a truly good man. If I should change my Metaphor of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding into flying, my thoughts tend to the same effect, That popularity indeed, is a seeming present delightful Air, which many men strive to fly, or at least to flutter in; and some thereby have mounted very high: But if the shout be not so very great, that, like that of <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s story, it break the very air, and cause our Eagles that spy so quick, and see so far beyond other men, to fall to the ground sometimes here, I question much, whether it ever brought a man to any sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of happy rest in the end.</p>
               <p>My thoughts of Faith or belief, were intentional only of looking straight forward, and directly upon it, to behold what, and whence it was; And this kind of reflexion on it, will perhaps be esteemed by you, as very uncomely, and unfit for a person of my condition, and therefore I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:50605:181"/>
to turn my thoughts again into their first channel. And thereupon we continue to think Faith, at utmost, is no more than a perswasion of Reason; If that perswasion be operated and effected barely from man, we call it an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Faith, or Belief; if it be from above, we call it, and will allow it, divine: In either case, we still think it is, Reason yielding, or Reason quiet and at rest. Reason is that Forge in the Soul whereon it is wrought; at least Faith is no other than a termination of Reason's work. Now having owned Reason in the Soul of man, to be a special divine gift, in no wise arising, or possibly to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted out of flesh and blood, according to any ordinary course of Nature, and a thing which distinguishes us from all other Creatures; We cannot but think it here capable of an impression from above, and so may terminate in a blessed Faith; but that is above our reach to define how it comes to pass. The other qualities it has, we may a little observe. It is capable I think <hi>quatenus</hi> human, to make and receive an impression without the help of Sense, nay above and beyond sense. When it is properly active, and makes this impress, and informs a man, for instance, that the fulfilling of Lust is a beastly sordid act (which Sense could never do) and puts some little stop to the Affections and to the Will; I have called it, and do call it Conscience: When it complies, assents, or yields to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace a thing as good or true (which may be without any help of Sense too in some case) I term it Belief; and do think that neither the one or the other, can at all happen to be without Reason; for, it is Reason's assent, that creates a belief, or gives it that denomination. If Reason be absent, 'tis no more than a bare short cogitation of a thing, such as is, or may be in Beast which is driven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the next thought. But belief solely attending Reason, or being the off-spring of Reason, has somewhat of permanency in it; though it be subject to change ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits.</p>

He gives us this instance, <note n="(b)" place="margin">Heb. 11.3.</note> 
                  <hi>Through it we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen, were not made of things which do appear.</hi> The latter part of conclusion, is no more than what every ordinary Heathen might espy from his Reason; that visibility could not be the product of visibility; that the framer and the framed must necessarily differ in a vast degree, and therefore conclude by way of argument from Reason, and as it were rest satisfied; that it was no visible sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, but some eternal omnipotent invisible wise power or mind, that created the World in this admirable visible beauty and lustre as it is. And this as we call it Faith, so it is no more than ordinary. But for the Soul to lay hold on such a thing as <hi>Word</hi> and pierce into the depth of that monosyllable, which Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> with his Eagle eyes had so deep an inspect into, It must I think necessarily be reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down from Heaven, and be an heavenly light which first shewed it unto man. The Power and strength of Reason in man, able of it self upon consideration to raise an evidence of things not seen, is the chief and main ground which induces me to think, that no sober wise man, that is, no man whose Reason is in any measure clear, is an Atheist; but that it must be the <hi>fool</hi> only, who <hi>says in his heart there is no God</hi>: And yet that there are and may be as well rational Infidels, as Christians, since that <hi>Word incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> is above the reach of the clearest human Reason.</p>
               <p>In my Treatise <hi>de Anima,</hi> after my plain way and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, I set down the grounds of my belief, of the immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of an human Soul only, and that was chiefly from its Reason; such a Reason as is able to weigh things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of Sense, I know that human Reason by the delusion of Satan, and for want of good exercise, is often captivated, and brought to accept any thing (almost) for true and current, that is so represented and laid before it, whuch thing I call Credulity; yet that very Credulity is to me a clear evidence of the Soul's immortality, and therefore I mean here to speak a little of Faith or Belief, as it is described by the Author to the <hi>Hebrews, The evidence of things not seen,</hi> for surely by that, we may be distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from all other Creatures. Faith or belief, we men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone have in us (whether by way of ratiocination or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately given us shall not be our present inquiry) a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:50605:182"/>
to imbrace or catch or lay hold on things at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, which capacity we think is only the product of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Reason: A capacity in the Soul of man, which though it may seem at first view to come far short of knowledge, yet in dignity or worth far surmounts any thing, which we call, or can properly so call. Knowledge, such as it is in us or any Creature, is the off-spring of Sense, and Faith the off-spring only of Reason. For of things unseen, or of the true Nature or original cause of any thing, we have no knowledge at all. But that things are so or so, and that they differ <hi>in specie</hi> one from another, we and Beasts have both equal certain knowledge from Sense, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they whose Sense is clearest, may be said to exceed a little therein. Sense certainly penetrates quicker, into the substance of things, than Reason can do into the Nature and causes of them; and therefore the termination of one, may well be accounted <hi>knowledge,</hi> when the other acquires only the title of <hi>Belief</hi>; And yet that belief arises from a much deeper sight, than the other. Which kind of light in the Soul, and such thing as may create a belief, we can in no wise discern in Brutes, although we do discern and allow knowledge in them. Because belief in its lowest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and at the least, proceeds from Reason, and such a Reason, as is or may be separate and distinct from Sense.</p>
               <p>I cannot but allow a kind of Reason in Beasts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant and attendant upon Sense, sufficient to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their election and choice, or, if you please, their will: But it is such, as vanishes with the act, and nothing from thence can amount unto, or be said to be a belief in any case. It is stirred only by, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes with Sense, and the ground of its work being gon and past, there might be a knowledge <hi>pro tempore,</hi> but no such thing as a belief; because there remains no fixed foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps or hold of its operation. But belief, ever depending upon somewhat, and being a thing of permanency and continuance, it must necessarily depend upon such a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as subsists of it self, and is able to work of it self; For that is it which makes a belief: Otherwise there is no more than a cogitation (or memory the renewer of a cogitation) and such as the coming of one usually drives away the other (as I said) both in man and Beast. And though I cannot be said properly, between cogitation and cogitation, to remember a thing all the while; yet I may
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:50605:182"/>
be said to believe the same all the while without so much as a thought of the object matter of my belief. As to knowledge such as it is, in man or Beast, it is but a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent plain demonstration of Sense, and a thing of no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manency without the continued help of Sense. For though I knew a man yesterday, I cannot properly say I know him, till I see him again, and then I may, but I believe all the while I shall know him, if I see him again; and if a man shall ask me the question whether I know such a man, it is most proper for me to say, I believe I do, or shall when I see him. I will give you this plain instance if you please, a little to distinguish knowledge and belief: <hi>The wind blows,</hi> Now seeing the effects of its motion, in the Clouds, on the Trees, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> hearing the noise it causes upon resistance, feeling the coolness of the air ventilated; I know it blows, or there is such kind of motion, and so do's a Beast, but this neither of us know longer than we see, hear or feel the Effects. As concerning any such like future motion; the cause of the Wind, <hi>whence it comes or whither it goes</hi> (which the Text tells us we know not) that is Reason's inquiry; and it must be Reason's eye that beholds ought thereabout; And what is from thence brought into the Soul, is of some continuance, a thing no ways incident to Beasts, and that which we call belief; which, whatever it be, continues the same, till Reason be consulted again, and inform other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. If I believe the Wind to be fluent air; If I believe it to be caused by some fermentation (like that in our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies upon meeting of divers humors) upon the concourse of several Atoms; If I believe it is sent out of the caverns of the Earth, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> my belief in each case, continues all the while the same, till Reason frame another in my Soul. Nay Sense shall not alter a belief, without some consult of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; and therefore a belief once raised or framed do's up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every touch of Sense make a kind of resort to Reason, for its allowance, or disallowance, for its continuance as it is, or its change. For instance, if I once believe that you love me, or have a kindness for me; If after I hear other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise from others, or see a strangeness in your countenance, or feel some hard usage from you; before the alteration of this first setled opinion or belief, there will necessarily be some consult of Reason; whether this or that may not be, and yet your Affection continue firm. Now if Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:50605:183"/>
do not weigh things by it self, but listens only to the introduction of Sense, so far forth as to change my belief without due examination, this is the thing which I call Credulity, and for which, Reason is negligent and to blame.</p>
               <p>Though I allow a Will in Brutes, Imagination or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation, Memory, and such a kind of Reason, as by and through Sense co-operating with those faculties, guides them in a regular motion, and may be said to create a knowledge in them, yet without Sense it is idle, and nothing; And can neither put a stop to the Affections in opposition to Sense, nor create any such thing as a belief; which is a matter effected above and beyond Sense (though not clean contrary to Sense, as some would have us to believe) and through human Reason, and is the consequent in such a Soul, only, as shall be able to work when the windows of Sense shall be shut up, or Sense shall be no more. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Beasts are quick of Sense, and so of knowledge I grant, and may be said to be sensibly rational, but not rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sensible, or so much as to consider their Sense, or raise any belief about it. And this is the utmost I am able to judge of their capacity; for I must confess and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that could I discern more, or could any man dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to me, some certain indubitable sign of any such ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional motion in them at any time, as to give a check to their Affections, which is the thing I call Conscience, or create a light in them out of the reach of Sense, and raise an evidence of things not seen, which is the thing I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge to be, Faith or Belief, and which the weakest human Soul is in some measure capable of (and I doubt not but Divine Grace does sometimes shine upon such beyond our inspection) It would overthrow my opinion of their anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation, or else much shake and batter my belief of our own Immortality.</p>
               <p>The Fowls of the Heaven are of so quick Sense, as that thereby perceiving the alteration of the Air, by a kind of adjunct Reason accompanying that Sense, they <hi>know their appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time</hi> (as 'tis said of the <note n="(a)" place="margin">Jer. 8.7.</note> Stork) and move accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; yet being uncapable to foresee, or judge of any cause thereof, they cannot be said to believe ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, before or after. Undoubtedly the Ox may know his Feeder from another man, as sure as the Feeder knows
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:50605:183"/>
the Ox from another Beast; but the Ox cannot believe any thing of the Feeder, that he may or will hurt him upon a displeasure, as the Feeder may of the Ox; for that must proceed from Reason's inquiry or information, above or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Sense. Many Creatures when they feel pain, or are sick and sensible thereof, have such a kind of Reason ready attendant, as often effectually works their cure without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into natural causes, and so may be said to know the cure; but yet without an inspect into natural causes, 'tis impossible to believe it, and therefore 'tis that rational sight only that creates a belief, and is in no wise the sight of Sense.</p>
               <p>Now when from Reason, there is raised in the Soul of man (especially with concurrence of some Sense, collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral as I may say to the thing believed) a firm and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable belief of any thing, we make use of the word knowledge, and say we know, and yet in truth there is no more than a belief in the case: For instance, I know I shall dye; Now if I had never seen man dy, or heard of death, I should by my Reason, observing my decay and waxing old as a garment, verily believe some such thing; but withal seeing, and hearing continually of the death of others; I rest assured I shall dy, and so say, I know. But my own death being absolutely out of the reach of Sense, I cannot properly be said to know so much, neither does what I say therein, amount to any more than a belief. And so it is in many like cases where we say, We know: as where <hi>Iob</hi> says, as we translate it <note n="(a)" place="margin">Job 19.25.</note> 
                  <hi>I know that my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer liveth,</hi> there is no more to be understood than a firm strong Faith; the like of St. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> 
                  <note n="(b)" place="margin">Luk. 1.77.</note> 
                  <hi>giving knowledge of salvation</hi>: And so I think is St. <hi>Paul</hi> to be understood in that <note n="(c)" place="margin">1 Cor. 2.</note> Chapter where he mentions knowledge so often. Now a Beast neither knows or believes any thing of his own death, for that, as the causes and symptoms of death are out of the reach of his Reason, which only accompanies Sense and is nought without it; So his very death is out of the reach of Sense it self, and he cannot know it. For this reason perhaps some may think them the more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Creature; but if we consider it, and make good use of our Reason, we shall find that over and above that superlative prerogative, of beholding in a manner, and so believing future happiness, we have here a great benefit and advantage by it, above other Creatures; and are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:50605:184"/>
from hence to quit the Affections, which otherwise would be disturbed by the often false alarms of Sense, to which they are subject, and so keep our Soul from being wounded by any thing from without.</p>
               <p>Knowledge I say is a thing of the meaner extract, the product of Sense and in no wise of Reason, neither is Reason the parent thereof in any case, unless in some case of Conscience, a thing so much talked of, and which I have already mentioned. There indeed in case of the will's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation from Justice (which may be said to be a peculiar Sense annexed to Reason, or which human Reason is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with, and called Reason's Eye, without which it cannot properly move.) I may truly tell any man having Reason, if he transgress the rule of Justice, you know in your Conscience yor wrong me, or do that which is evil: In other cases I cannot apprehend how we can be said to know, unless by common Sense. And that surely (<hi>viz</hi>) outward Sense, do's often afford us such an infallible demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, as that Reason cannot oppose it, or raise a belief against it, though without Sense or above and beyond Sense, she may raise a belief. And therefore in such plain cases of ocular demonstration, human Reason is ever silent, and in a manner useless: For why should she labour and travail in vain? Wherefore should I argue within my self, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther white and black be the same, or whether they differ in colour, when my Sense is clear to perceive they do? How should I believe alteration of substance, when I see plainly there is none? Though human Reason be a gift that excels Sense, and raises sometimes such an high and lasting fabrick, as Sense is not able to raise, yet it never throws down Sense's building to do it, or opposes it self clean contrary to Sense. We may keep our Sense and our Reason too, and make use of both; but when we happen utterly to exclude the former, I much doubt whether we retain the latter in its very native force. And therefore I appeal to any man of Reason, whether direct Idolatry be not folly, or rather a phrensy and madness? I am as prone and ready, I hope, to believe as any other man; I look upon it as the most excellent capacity of human Nature, and therefore if a man shall go about to perswade me such a piece of bread is flesh, whereof at first sight I might believe otherwise, I may with some Reason retract my
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:50605:184"/>
opinion, and believe it, and that it might be some dried flesh, by art brought unto the likeness of ordinary bread. But if he shall tell me, this thing I now see is Bread made of Corn, and I believe him; and then he shall forthwith go about to perswade me 'tis flesh; so long as it never was out of my sight, and my Sense tells me it is the very same as it was without alteration, I will reply I know it is the same, and need no assistance of Reason, to believe it the one or the other; and without Reason, Belief is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, nor more than a simple cogitation as I said. Now because we will not, or cannot deny these kind of men who thus believe (or would have us believe) to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise rational, and judicious in other matters; And we are unwilling (and it becomes us not) to call them Fools, or mad men; We will rather chuse to term them, Good natured men; and think such their belief proceeds from that very innocent native goodness or Charity, which is apt to make a man believe all things, and is some excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence or else superfetation of Reason. By which I yet mean no other thing, than what I have on insisted all along to be of dangerous and evil consequence in the Soul, <hi>viz. Credulity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As Reason is the most excellent indowment in the Soul, so it is oftnest abused, and we may daily observe more <hi>leger de main,</hi> and more tricks to deceive us, put upon our Reason, than our Sense. We shall always have our best Affection courted, if not bribed, to gain the consent of that; and if it cannot be perswaded, or prevailed over by fair means; there shall be a thunder through Sense, to raise some other passion in the Soul to force its consent, or at least to keep it quiet from resistance; and we must be made afraid (if feazible) that we may believe, and told that there is no hope of Salvation, if we believe not as our Monitors would have us. This indeed may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a cunning way of application to the Affections to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude Reason rather than to enlighten it. And thus by the false insinuation of others, and the negligence of our selves, Reason instead of being a sure conduct, becomes as it were a false guide, and instead of doing us good, often worketh us the greatest prejudice of any thing in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:50605:185"/>Credulity, (which is Reason blindfolded by another) has doubtless led many men into sundry pernitious Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and so into utter destruction at the last; and hurried them into further mischief, than either their native pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of themselves would have forced them, or their own Imagination could have invented for them; and therefore it cannot seem uncharitable, though it may prove unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, to advise all men to beware of Credulity, and to become cautious how, and what they believe. To avoid which danger, I know no readier way, than for every man to make use of, and exercise that blessed gift God has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on him (and so I may call it) his own Reason; And therefore I might here I think safely, if it happen to be seen, advice every one else as well as you to keep his Reason, as well as elsewhere I did every man (from <hi>Solomon</hi>) to keep his heart <hi>with all diligence</hi>: I do not mean, to keep his Reason a Prisoner, in subjection to his Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as most men do; If he do, they will be deceived to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; but as their guide, free, and without dependance on any, but only that good God who gave it. And if every man would singly follow this advice, having engrafted in his heart that saying, <hi>Quod tibi fieri non vis, &amp;c.</hi> I doubt not but we should see and taste better fruits of mens Faith than now we do. I know not how to separate the word Faith from Reason, or Reason from Faith; If Reason be the ground of every ordinary belief, and I cannot possibly find its rise elsewhere, nor that any Creature can have in his Soul an evidence of things not seen (that is an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary belief) without the special gift of Reason; Why should it be laid aside (as some would) for the introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of that blessed effect in the Soul, which differs only in point of the object matter, and perhaps somewhat in degree? In either case there is no more, than a perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the mind, which can never be without rationality; For without that, the Will and the Affections (blind as they are) necessarily follow Sense, and cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded or prevailed with to imbrace any thing without Sense.</p>
               <p>Without Reason, a Cogitation is the bare work of the Imagination, or it self by it self working. It must have Reason's stamp at least (how weak or blind soever she be) to give it the title of a Belief. And a bare Cogitation
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:50605:185"/>
(as I conceive) being a thing that falls short of a Belief in human Theory, must needs do so much more in Divinity, and will scarce amount to the Faith of a Collier: And if it should, I cannot conjecture any good it will do a man towards future Happiness, how ere it pleases in present fancy.</p>
               <p>Reason is a gift, which no man that has it (how sure soever he be to have it weakned by infirmity or age) would at present part with, to gain the whole present World: And in relation to the future, I trust, he who has bestowed that gift on us, will not be offended with the modest use of it thereabout; since as to this present World we find it does not so far avail the best of us as to make us much happier than the Beasts that perish, who general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make as good use of this present World from Sense, as we do from our Reason.</p>
               <p>So long as we trust not in our Reason, neither suffer it to contend with, or strike at, or batter that Faith, which it self, of it self, is not able to raise, but let it stand by as a spectator; methinks those men who ingross and appropriate to themselves the title of the Faithful (as others do of Infallible) need not make declamations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, nor go about to affright men out of their Reason: But may allow it a <note n="(a)" place="margin">Jam. 1.17.</note> 
                  <hi>good gift</hi> though not a <hi>perfect gift</hi> (since we own both from above) and have so much Charity as to think (or if they please to believe) other men may be saved with it, as well as other men believe, they may be saved without it, or at least its strength; Provided they do not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully sin against it, continue to spurn it, and colourably trample upon it, to raise themselves rather than any saving Faith in other men.</p>
               <p>Men look upon their Belief as a pretious and tender Plant (however raised) not to be touched; and I would offend none in seeming to do it, and therefore I shall say no more of it: But pray God (wherein I hope I cannot offend) who has indowed us with Reason, such a Reason as is capable to take an impress from Heaven, as well as men, and as it were to resolve and melt into a blessed happy and saving Faith; That of his infinite mercy he would frame in us, that Anchor of the Soul, fure and stedfast, which may secure us against all the raging waves of the World; And yet continue to enlighten our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:50605:186"/>
while we travail here; that it may be able to espy and resist all the delusions of Satan, and our own and others Affections marching under the notion and colour of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; And preserve us ever from unreasonable men (whatsoever or howsoever they say they believe) as well as those we term (and reject as) Infidels.</p>
               <p>The Soul of man considered in its ordinary facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties is wonderful, and perhaps a dangerous subject to treat of, but especially as it may be cloathed with graces from without; And he who searches too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly into it, may sooner lose himself than benefit others: From all that I could think of it, I adjudge it immortal, and that is the main termination of my thoughts, which I dare make publick. We may please our selves sometimes with a conceit of knowledge of, I know not what; but all is so little and nothing, that, let go our tenure of immortality, and cast away the thoughts thereof, we are, at best, but the wisest Beasts that perish, and need not a comparison with them. Did I say, cast away those thoughts? They are so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted I think to our Nature, that I dare the boldest man, who denies the subject matter of those thoughts, and would willingly do it, to cast them away, or wholly and perpetually disburthen his Soul of them. Such thoughts as these, to wit, of some future reward and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, have been conjectured from some actions of theirs to be inherent and arising in Mutes; whereof I my self from Sense, and with concurrence of my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, stand convinced; And when I can in like manner be convinced, that such thoughts can be made to arise in the Spirit or Soul of any, the wisest or most intelligent Brute; I shall not then think my self much undervalued, to have such a Beast compared to me. For unless it be, to resolve that question, <hi>What shall I do to inherit eternal life?</hi> Mine, or any mans knowledge signifies but very little. The resolution of that quaery belongs to your of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, an office you have solemnly taken upon you; the cure or care of no mans Soul but my own is commited unto me. The office of King <hi>Philip</hi>'s Crier might better have become me, To tell men they are mortal (which every man owns) than to tell them, they are immortal, which is your duty. Now having in a manner intruded my
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:50605:186"/>
self into your office, and yet referring my self therein to you; If you incourage me to go on and proceed, and so, in a manner, patronize any Error by me therein com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; the fault (as I told you at first) will lye at your door.</p>
               <p>Now to God Eternal, and only of himself Immortal, be adscribed all Praise and Glory. <hi>Amen.</hi>

Let us not abuse thy sacred Name and holy Word, to gratify any evil or ambitious Affection; nor suffer us at length in these our days and in this our Island, through our own precipitant madness and folly, to become the scorn and derision of all that are round about us, and to fall as a prey to some of them.

Look down and behold in goodness our gracious Sovereign, whom thou hast already from banishment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to his just right, and (as it were miraculously) again placed over us; one, who retains so much, and so perfect an Image of thee, as to be just to all men, and merciful to admiration, which is as much as the most unreasonable of Subjects can expect or desire. What human frailties he has been subject to, in mercy pardon. Defend and protect him against the attempts of all his Enemies, and especially those who under colour of his safety, seek his destruction, falsly pretending the advancement of thy Kingdom, and thy Glory. Let not our former unrepented sins of that Nature provoke thee to bring us again into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion and desolation; but be thou gracious unto us, and to all the world besides, that we may all in general see and behold, it is thou alone by whom Princes reign, it is thou alone who bringest the devices of the wicked to none effect, and it is thou alone who art able to shew us the madness and folly of our own ways and inventions: Which, let every one of us in humility beseech thee to do, for thy Son's sake; To whom with thee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
