            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT
HONOVRABLE,
and his singular good
Lord,
ROBERT Earle of SALISBVRY,
Principall Secretarie to his Maiestie, &amp;c.
and the most woorthy Chancellar of the
Vniuersity of CAMBRIDGE,
Grace and peace.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are not many weeks past (Right
Honourable) since a person, disguised
by these dumbe characters of P. R.
had couertly sent forth a Booke, inscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
<hi>A Treatise of Mitigation,</hi>
which he aduentured to addresse vnto
both the <hi>Vniuersities,</hi> especially that, wherein, by the
blessing of God, I haue had my education, and whereof this
is the happinesse, that it hath your Lordship <hi>Chancellar</hi>
and Protector. I therefore esteemed it my dutie in presence
<pb facs="tcp:4721:3"/>
of your Honor, by this <hi>Preamble,</hi> to sponge out such vile
imputations, wherewith he indeuoured through me (alas)
one of <hi>the least of the Prophets</hi> to distaine both my
Mother and her Sister the famous <hi>Vniuersities;</hi> and
those honorable persons vnto whose care and prouidence they
are committed. At the first reading thereof, although (I
confesse) I receiued some such impressions as that I was not
able to imagine that any, professing Diuinity, could be so vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
destitute of humanity, as when he clamorously inueigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
against (as he pretendeth) <hi>multiplicitie of falsifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
he himselfe should most vsually and egregiously fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sifie:
yet then, euen in my greatest iealousie of mine own mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cariage,
I conceiued a double matter of comfort: first, from
my selfe, that knowing I durst present my supplications vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Iudge of the secret thoughts of all hearts, and iust
Reuenger of all lying wickednesse; I did not doubt but that
being able with true confidence to appeare before God, I
should not greatly feare the censure of man. Secondly, from
my Auersarie, presuming that he that would write in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense
of their <hi>Mentall Aequiuocation,</hi> would be found
to aequiuocate in writing. But much more was this my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uination
fortified at the reuiew of his <hi>Treatise;</hi> for euen
as the Greeke Commander, who being in apparance mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
wounded, demanded of his Souldiers, <hi>Numquid tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta
est Ciuitas? numquid clypeus meus integer? Is
the Citie safe? is my shield sound?</hi> And being satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb facs="tcp:4721:3"/>
in both recouered his health, and afterwards became
victorious: So I likewise, vnder so many ghastly wounds
of a virulent pen, hauing generally inquired and vprightly
answered my selfe, that my cause was <hi>safe,</hi> and my consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<hi>sound,</hi> and free from any notorious and wilfull fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie;
I then began more resolutely to confront my Aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
in this Prelude and First assault: and promise (if God
shall be pleased) a more forcible <hi>Incounter,</hi> after that I
haue discharged my part in another taske of more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
namely, in <hi>The Answer</hi> vnto the misconceiued
Catholike <hi>Apologie:</hi> which by this calumnious <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise</hi>
of <hi>P. R.</hi> his <hi>Mitigation,</hi> as by an aduerse tempest,
hath receiued some interruption. This <hi>Preamble</hi> (Right
Honourable) as a Suruey of some particulars, which being
vnfolded, may, if not satisfie the expectation, yet at the
least stay the preiudice and precipitation of some, I do hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
present vnto your Lordship, as vnto a most zealous
Patron of the Truth, a vigilant Discouerer of malignant
practises, a prouident Directer of one of those <hi>Vniuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
whereunto my Aduersarie presumeth to appeale; sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
my selfe vnto the equanimitie of your honourable
iudgement; to which, if by this Briefe it be not manifest,
that <hi>P. R.</hi> hath in this <hi>Treatise</hi> preuaricated in his whole
cause both in the question of <hi>Rebellion</hi> and of <hi>Aequiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
betraied his Countreys State, disgraced the Romish
Schooles, strangled his owne conscience, I refuse not, that
<pb facs="tcp:4721:4"/>
to the crimes obiected against me by him, this may be added,
That I durst affirme thus much before your Lordship. For
whose continuance of health, increase of honour, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
of all Spirituall Graces I shall not
cease to pray. Our Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> preserue
vs to the glorie of his sauing

PREAMBVLATORY
EPISTLE vnto P. R.
the Mitigator.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here be but two Romish Maladies
(Master P. R.) which in my books of
<hi>Discouery</hi> and <hi>Full Satisfaction</hi> might
stand need of your <hi>Mitigation:</hi> the
one is the vsurped and transcendent
Iurisdiction of the Pope aduanced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all Christian Kingdomes, to the troubling or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting
of all Princes and people of contrary Religion;
the other is your professed Art of <hi>mentall Equiuocation.</hi>
The first of these I haue proued to be (in the Protestant
States) the Damme, and the second the Baud to rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion:
therefore haue I been by you censured for <hi>a false
and slandrous Libeller.</hi> But if, as the woman in plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of her cause appealed from the Iudge sleeping vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the same Iudge better informed, you will giue me
leaue to appeale from <hi>P. R.</hi> as he is a <hi>Passionate Railer,</hi>
vnto <hi>P. R.</hi> as he is a <hi>Placable Reasoner;</hi> then I am sure
no man shall proue either me <hi>a false slanderer,</hi> or you a
true <hi>Mitigator:</hi> because you in your <hi>Treatise</hi> haue esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
<pb facs="tcp:4721:5"/>
such a Papall authority, which (after denuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of sentence) may depriue Protestant Kings (in
your opinion Heretikes) of their Kingdomes; making
all such Protestant Princes and all their adherents also
alliable vnto all those penalties, which the Popish Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
by you defended, haue awarded against Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes,
which are, losse of lands, of honours, and of their
liues; so farre, as to allow that euery man may in such
a case sheath his sword in his brothers throat: not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proouing
your fellowes, who conclude that all this
must be done, when there is sufficient meanes of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.
And shall not Protestants (except they will
acknowledge themselues to haue deserued a new Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacre)
call this your doctrine execrable and <hi>rebellious?</hi>
We reade of <hi>Petilian</hi> a Donatist, who to the end he
might moderate and mitigate the sharpe reproach of
the crueltie of his sect intended against the Orthodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xall
Professors, did make a great boast of courtesie and
humanitie: against whom <hi>S. Augustine</hi> writeth thus:
<hi>Isto modo &amp; miluus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aug. lib. 2. adu. Petil. cap. 83.</note> 
               <hi>cùm columbos rapere non potuerit,
columbum se nominat; vbi enim potuistis, &amp; non fecistis?</hi>
That is, <hi>By this meanes</hi> (saith S. Augustine) <hi>a Kite, when
he can not seize vpon a Doue, will be a Doue: for, I pray
you, when did you spare vs, being able to hurt vs?</hi> The
like boast of other Heretikes, called <hi>Rogationists,</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the like Answer:<note place="margin">August. Ep. 48. ad Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</note> to wit: <hi>Nulla bestia, si neminem
vulneret, proptereà mansueta dicitur, si dentes &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
non habet: saeuire vos nolle dicitis, ego non posse ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitror;
si autem possetis, quanta faceretis, quandò nihil
potestis, &amp; non cessatis?</hi> That is, <hi>There is no beast, which
may be called tame, because it doth no hurt when it hath
neither teeth nor talant: You</hi> (Rogationists) <hi>say you will
<pb facs="tcp:4721:5"/>
not mischieue vs; but I rather thinke you can not: for
how will not you do what possibly you can, seeing you cease
not to be doing, when you can do nothing at all?</hi> Are not
these <hi>Rogationists</hi> and you Romanists equally bent to
like mischiefe? Is not your Defence <hi>(P. R.) Miluus &amp;
Columbus, A Kitish Doue?</hi> For by the Title pretending
<hi>Mitigation</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> it may seem to be a <hi>Doue,</hi> but
by the <hi>Treatise</hi> it selfe professing a plaine rebellion, it
proueth a <hi>Kite.</hi> Whereby we may suspect that in the
capitall characters of your name <hi>P.</hi> may betoken a <hi>Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi>
and <hi>R.</hi> a <hi>Rogationist.</hi> Otherwise, answer your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries
sincerely vnto this their Interrogatorie; <hi>Did
you euer spare vs, being sufficiently able to hurt vs?</hi> For
the time past you can not satisfie; for the time to come
you will not ingage your selfe further than your Preface
hath promised, viz. <hi>It is not impossible for vs to liue in
subiection.</hi> But will you know the best way to prooue
your Aduersarie <hi>T. M.</hi> slanderous? Then must you
teach your Disciples to cease to be murderous. Your
second, and (as you call it) <hi>the speciall part,</hi> which is the
Defence of <hi>Mentall Equiuocation,</hi> is no whit better for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified:
for the maine reason to free it from a lie, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the outward speech, [as <hi>I am no Priest]</hi> is mixed
with a <hi>clause reserued in the minde,</hi> [as, <hi>To tell it vnto
you.]</hi> Wherein againe I appeale from your Position to
your Confession, granting, That <hi>there is a mentall Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation,
which no clause of reseruation can saue from a lie.</hi>
Which one Confession is sufficient to conuince all
your Mentall Equiuocators to be apparently liers. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
thus obteined my cause in both questions, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
you rage and raue, disgorging your stomacke,
and casting vpon me all the cankred and galfull termes
<pb facs="tcp:4721:6"/>
it could vtter: yet can I not be offended with you, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

                  </gap>isti: Because you meant to doe me iniurie.</hi> After
you had laboured, by disabling my iudgement concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the cause, to wound me in the head, you proceed
further, to preiudice my conscience, by pretending
<hi>multiplicitie of frauds and falsifications,</hi> seeking thereby
(for so I may call it) to stab me at the heart. But know
(<hi>P. R.</hi>) that your false and calumnious obiections of
<hi>falsifications</hi> are in this <hi>Preamble</hi> so farre discouered,
that I may truly thinke the Scripture verified vpon
you,<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 1.</note> where it is thus written: <hi>Therefore art thou inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable,
ô man, whosoeuer thou be, that iudgest; for doing
the same things, by iudging another thou condemnest thy
selfe.</hi> Therfore I wish you in the feare of God, so to vse

(Oratio, <hi>being</hi> or is ratio) <hi>the reason of man can not be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
discerned better than by the mouth, which is the
messenger of the heart. Therfore let vs see P. R. speaking thus:</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:4721:9"/>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">The trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigat.</hi> Epist. Ded to the Vniuersit. num. 24.</note> 
                  <q>The chiefe proofe of Thomas Morton (to shew our Priests to be
bad Doctors) consisteth in a certaine comparing of them with those
Iewish Priests of the olde law, in Christs time, who taught the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
which watched at the Sepulcher of our Sauiour to say, That
whilest they were sleeping, his Disciples came and stole him away.
<hi>[Common sense</hi> (sayth Thomas Morton) <hi>might haue replied,
How could you tell what was done when you were asleepe?
But mindes inthralled in the opinion of a neuer-erring Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
(which confirmed that answer) could not possibly but
erre with their Priests. Such (alas) is the case of all them &amp;c.]</hi>
Doe you see how substantially he hath prooued this matter? Let vs
examine the particulars: First the storie, then the inference.
About the storie S. Matthew recounteth in the 28. Chapter of his
Gospell, how Christ our Sauiour being raised miraculously from
death to life with a great and dreadfull earth-quake and descent of
an Angell, so as the souldiers which kept the Sepulcher were astoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
and almost dead for feare; some of them ranne and tolde the
Chiefe Priests thereof, who making a consultation with the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
deuised this shift, To giue them store of money, and to bidde
them say, That in the night when they were asleepe his Disciples
came and stole him away: and so they did. And S. Matthew ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
That this false bruit ran currant among the Iewes, euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
that time wherein he wrote his Gospell. This is the narration.
What hath Tho. Morton now to say to this against vs? for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
is all his drift. First, he sayth, as you haue heard, That this
deuice was improbable, and against common sense it selfe. <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sense</hi> (sayth hee) <hi>might haue replied</hi> (to the souldiers)
<hi>What could you tell what was done when you were asleepe?</hi>
See heere the sharpnesse of Tho. Mortons wit aboue that of the
Priests, Scribes, and Pharisees. But what if one of the souldiers
had replied to him thus? We saw it not when we were asleepe, but
afterward when wee were awakened wee perceiued hee was stollen
away. What reioynder would our Minister make? As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
if Tho. Morton were walking with a Communion-booke vnder
his arme thorow a field, and wearied should lie downe to sleepe with
his Booke by his side, and at his awaking should see his Booke gone,
were it against common sense for him to say, That his booke was
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:4721:10"/>
stollen from him while he was asleepe? Or is not this an Assertion
fit for one of those Doctours, whereof S. Paul talketh, that vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
not what they say, nor whereof they affirme? But this will
better yet appeare by the second point, which is his inference.</q>
               </p>
               <p>4 The Minister hath only this to reioyne, That his Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie
P. R. hath shewed himselfe, by this his Inference, both
shamelesse and witlesse. Shamelesse, to impute that for an
absurditie vnto me, which he might haue knowen to be the
wise and learned Inference of ancient Fathers, amongst whom
<hi>S. Augustine</hi> sayth to this Answer of these souldiers thus:<note n="b" place="margin">Aug. tom. 10. homil. 36. ad finem.</note>

or asleepe: if awake, then confesse what was done, <hi>Christ is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
out of the graue:</hi> if asleepe, <hi>then you knew not what was done.</hi>
For say,<note place="margin">P. R. grosly ignorant in Diuinitie.</note> I pray you, P. R. When Christ by the power of his
Godhead raised himselfe out of the graue, had it beene a good
answer of the souldiers (supposing they had slept) to say, <hi>We
know that Christ was stollen out of the graue,</hi> when we were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleepe,
because we found him not when we were awake? This
Inference P. R. doth holde for good: whereby my Reader
may ghesse how acceptable a seruant he would haue been vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
those Iewish Priests, if he had liued in that Synagogue, in
setting on foot that bruit of infidelitie, by perswading the
people, that the souldiers reason was good; the Conclusion
whereof is, <hi>Christ did not rise, but was stollen out of the graue:</hi>
though, I hope, P. R. his faith is not so farre asleepe, as so to
preiudice the chiefe Article of Christian faith, The resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Christ from the dead: without which, as the Apostle
S. Paul teacheth,<note n="*" place="margin">1. Cor. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>our preaching is vaine, and faith vaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5 Howsoeuer, I am sure he hath shewen himselfe heerin very
witlesse, who knowing that I set downe the maine question in
these words in great letters, for distinction sake, <hi>His Disciples
came and stole him away:</hi> specifying the persons, <hi>His Disciples,</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:4721:10"/>
the principall subiect of that question: And could sleeping
souldiers tell what was done of Christs Disciples? As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
If I falling asleepe in the field, and hauing twentie shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
in my purse, one should come and picke my pocket, and
cut my purse; after, I awaking, and conuenting P. R. before
a Magistrate vpon suspition of felonie, should yeeld no other
reason, but that when I was asleepe, sure I am, P. R. came and
cut my purse.<note place="margin">P. R. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by the Text.</note> Then the Iustice of Peace replieth, How know
you that P. R. did it, you being then asleepe? What reioyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
would P. R. teach <hi>Tho. Morton</hi> to make? I could haue ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed
P. R. with a more familiar example, if I had beene bent to
scurrilitie. It is sufficient to vnderstand, that as it pleased God
so to infatuate that lying Priesthood, when they thought
themselues most wise, for the greater glory of Christian faith,
as to build their incredulitie vpon no better foundation than a
fained senselesse report of men asleepe: euen so it falleth out

often it is expresly set downe euen in those places whereunto
P. R. himselfe hath shaped such Answers as his want of grace

not, except he felt his wit wax somewhat blunt, and therefore
meant to deserue the whetstone.</p>
               <p>8 The excellencie of his memorie appeareth in this, that he

Latine clauses he would remember but <hi>one.</hi> Now seeing that
one instance doth confute a generall assertion, as he that shall

wilfully denying that there is any such Latine clause, excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
only <hi>one,</hi> must, vpon the euidence of three and twentie
more, be thought to haue made two and twentie lies at once.
And shall we expect, that when he is brought into exigents

who doth lie so lauishly in a matter so needlesse? No, for an

This Syllogisme I leaue to be discussed by Cambridge Logicians,
where I heare say the man learned his Logike (if he haue any) for
heere he sheweth very little or none at all, no boy being among vs of
foure moneths standing in Logike or Sophistrie, which will not hisse
at this argument, both for forme and matter.—Because
it hath six terminos,—and there should be but three. For it is no
more a Syllogisme than this: viz.</p>

                  <p>Ergo euery Asse hoth two long eares. Where you see there
be six termini, as in Tho. Mortons Syllogisme, without connexion
or dependance one of the other. And as much concludeth this as
that.—And now compare this his skill (I pray you) with that brag
of his in the beginning of his Treatise against Equiuocation, when
he sayd to his Aduersary, <hi>Dare you appeale to Logike? This is
the Art of Arts, and the high tribunall of reason and trueth it

               </q>
               <p>10 I would gladly doe my Aduersary the credit, as to thinke
that not he himselfe, but rather some of his <hi>boyish Sophisters</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:4721:12"/>
hath thus canuased that silly Argument, but that thorowout
his whole Booke I finde him so prodigall of his wit, time, and

Here therefore he calleth that a <hi>Syllogisme,</hi> which I na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

Now there be many formes of reasonings besides <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logismes;</hi>
neither did I, indeed, intend to make an exact and
formall Syllogisme, but only such an Argument, which by

               <p>11 If there had beene either sinew or sappe of Logike in this

he meaneth to play his prize, especially now when so scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

vnto Vniuersities, as though he would heerupon raise
his <hi>Io poean</hi> and triumph. Had we not now reason to expect
as absolute a Syllogisme as all his wit, art, and industrie could
inuent? I am not woorthy (I confesse) to enter in comparison
with men of great learning, because I thinke my selfe inferiour
vnto thousands in our owne Kingdome, yet some Logike I
haue learned, and sometime publikely taught; vpon which
little I dare presume to make a generall appeale to <hi>Cambridge,
Oxford, Rhemes, Rome,</hi> and vnto all Vniuersities, whether of
Protestants or Romanists, whether Christian or Pagan, yea,
euen to his owne hissing boyes and Sophisters, who <hi>P. R.</hi>
sayth <hi>are able to make Syllogismes in one moneth,</hi> and challenge

wee venture our degrees,<note place="margin">The mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his Syllogisme.</note> which wee haue taken in the
Schooles. To come to the point: This Syllogisme can finde
no place either in <hi>mood</hi> or <hi>figure,</hi> by reason of foure capitall
faults. First, there be in it fiue <hi>termini,</hi> as namely, <hi rend="sup">1</hi> 
                  <hi>competen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie:</hi>
                  <hi rend="sup">2</hi> 
                  <hi>God by whom we sweare:</hi> 
                  <hi rend="sup">3</hi> 
                  <hi>euery one competent Iudges to
whom we sweare:</hi> 
                  <hi rend="sup">4</hi> 
                  <hi>in euery oath:</hi> 
                  <hi rend="sup">5</hi> 
                  <hi>either expresly or implica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely:</hi>
whereas, according to his owne censure, there should
be but three. Secondly, these words, <hi>The competencie,</hi> being
part of the <hi>Medium,</hi> should haue beene repeated in the <hi>Minor</hi>
proposition, thus: <hi>But in euery oath there is a competencie of
God by whom we sweare.</hi> Otherwise it is no better than if <hi>P. R.</hi>
should dispute thus:</p>
               <p>Euery <hi>Mitigation</hi> of doctrine concerning rebellious positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which are imputed vnto vs, will procure vs fauour
of the State:</p>
               <p>But this is the doctrine of rebellious positions imputed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:4721:13"/>
Ergo this doctrine of rebellious positions imputed vnto vs
will procure vs fauour of the State.</p>
               <p>The fault in this Syllogisme is because this word, <hi>Mitigation,</hi>
which is part of the <hi>Medium,</hi> is not repeated in the <hi>Minor.</hi>
Thirdly, there should be but one <hi>minus extremum:</hi> with this,
<hi>We sweare by God,</hi> he hath ioyned another in these words, <hi>ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
expresly or implicatiuely:</hi> which words being a part of the
<hi>minus extremum,</hi> should not haue beene omitted in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.
Like as if a man should reason thus:</p>
               <p>Euery penitent Confessarie must receiue absolution:</p>
               <p>But euery Drunkard is a penitent Confessarie, repenting
either of drinking too much, or of drinking too little:</p>
               <p>Ergo, euery Drunkard must receiue absolution.</p>
               <p>The fault of this is the addition to the <hi>minus extremum</hi> [either
for drinking too much, or too little.] The fourth, the Verbe
and <hi>copula [maketh] euery one competent,</hi> is altered in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
into <hi>[Are] competent Iudges:</hi> than the which there can
not be a greater absurditie in Syllogismes. As may appeare
by this like example.</p>
               <p>Euery man in framing his last Will and Testament, maketh
his owne Executor:</p>
               <p>But T. B. frameth his last Will and Testament:</p>
               <p>Ergo T. B. is his owne Executor.</p>
               <p>The fault is the changing of the <hi>copula</hi> or Verbe <hi>[maketh]</hi> into
<hi>[is.]</hi> What will now <hi>P. R.</hi> doe, after that this his montanous
boast of <hi>A true Syllogisme</hi> hath brought foorth this ridiculous
mouse? It is to be feared, that his <hi>hissing Sophisters</hi> will turne
him into a Prouerbe, for thus disgracing their College, calling
him <hi>P. R. the Syllogizer,</hi> when they will note any man so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregiously
absurd, as in his greatest vaunt of skill to bewray
his greatest want. But I may not be so vnthankefull as not to
reforme him, who was so willing to helpe me; thereby to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
him from scorne: and therefore wish him to frame his
<hi>Syllogisme</hi> thus:</p>
               <p>Euery speech, wherein we sweare by God, either expresly or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicatiuely,
doth by the competencie of God, by whom wee
sweare, make the Iudges competent, vnto whom we sweare:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:4721:13"/>
But euery oath is a speech wherein we sweare by God, either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
or implicatiuely:</p>
               <p>Ergo, euery oath doth by the competencie of God, by whom we
sweare, make the Iudges competent, to whom we sweare.</p>
               <p>12 <hi>But I feare lest I may seeme too much to detract from his
skill in Logike, who hath giuen vs so many tokens of his rare
facultie therein, especially in exact</hi> diuiding and subdiuiding; <hi>a
principall property of that Art. As for example:</hi>
                  <note n="l" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mitigat.</hi> chap. 12. num. 4. pag. 485. <hi>initio.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <q>Wherfore all
our speech, saith he, in this place shal be about the second kind of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuocation,
which is false and lying, and thereby also euer vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
which thogh not properly, yet in a general maner, may be called
Equiuocation,<note place="margin">A fond di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision of P. R.</note> as I haue said, for that the hearer is alwayes wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
deceiued or intended to be deceiued by some falsitie, which is
knowen to be such by the speaker, and consequently is plaine lying.
And for that lying also hath beene shewed before to be diuided into
two sorts; the one a materiall lie, when the thing spoken is false in
it selfe, but not so vnderstood by the speaker; the other a formall
lie, when the speaker doth know it, or thinketh it to be false, and yet
speaketh it. This kinde of Aequiuocation, which really is a lie,
must haue also the same subdiuision, so as the one sort thereof may
be called a materiall lying Equiuocation, and the other aformall:
and so much woorse, as a formall lie is in it selfe (which alwayes is
sinne) than a materiall (which often times may be without sinne of
the speaker) by so much is a formall lying Equiuocation worse than
a materiall.</q> 
                  <hi>There is no boy (I thinke) in his College, but hee
can analyse the members of this diuision thus:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A lying Equiuocation is that
which <hi>is knowen to be such
vnto the speaker.</hi> And this
is to be subdiuided, for it
is either</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A materiall lie,</hi> which is when
the thing spoken is a lie in it
selfe, <hi>But not so vnderstood of
the speaker.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Or,</hi> A formall lie, <hi>when the
speaker</hi> Doth know it, and
thinke it to be false.</p>

                  <q>And yet truly
I can not well pretermit, for ending this Chapter, one little note
more, of rare singularitie in this man aboue others, which I scarse
ouer haue obserued in any of his fellowes, and this is, That the very
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:4721:14"/>
first words of Scripture alleged by him in the first page of his booke,
for the poesie of his pamphlet, are falsly alleged, corrupted and
mangled, though they conteine but one only verse of Isay the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet;
and then may you imagine, what libertie he will take to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
afterward thorowout his whole Discourse. His sentence or
poesie is this. <hi>Isay. 29. vers. 9. But stay your selues and woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
they are blinde and make you blinde:</hi> which hee would
haue to be vnderstood of vs Catholikes. But let any man reade the
place of Isay it selfe, &amp; he shall finde no such matter either inwords
or sense, but only the word, <hi>wonder,</hi> to wit; Obstupescite &amp; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miramini,
fluctuate &amp; vacillate, inebriamini &amp; non à vino, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemini
&amp; non ab ebrietate. And according to this are the Greeke
and Hebrew texts also. So as what should mooue T. M. to set
downe so corruptly the very sentence of his booke, and cite the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and verse wherein his fraud may be discried, I know not, except
he obserued not the last clause of the Prophets precept, Mouemini
&amp; non ab ebrietate.</q> And so much for this.</p>
               <p>14 Which is <hi>much</hi> more than any man of a temperate sense
would haue obiected: for <hi>let any man reade</hi> the English trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
and he shall finde the same <hi>words</hi> expresly set downe.
Seeing therefore that <hi>P. R.</hi> doth intimate to his Reader, That
I haue forged a new Text, and that <hi>the words are</hi> by me <hi>falsly
alleged,</hi> can there be a more false, yea and (if wilfull rashnesse
doe not take the vpper hand of impudent boldnesse) a more
shamelesse cauill than this?</p>
               <p>15 <hi>Thus much of the words,</hi> Ye are blinde, &amp;c. <hi>His next
quarrell is against the sense, he repeating the Latine, yet but</hi>
manglingly, <hi>and doth not English it, lest (I thinke) his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Reader might apprehend the sense: or els he left it for
me to translate. Thus then:</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Isa. 29.</note> Be ye astonished &amp; wonder, wauer
ye and reele, ye are drunke, but not with wine, ye are moued, but
not with drunkennesse: because the Lord hath mingled for you the
spirit of slumber, he will shut your eyes, he will couer your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and chiefe ones, which see visions, &amp;c. <hi>The sense of all is
deliuered by S. Hierome</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hierom. Com. in Isa. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>in his Comment vpon the same

and Sauiour would not vnderstand, and haue shut your eyes, that

of them, who boasted they saw secrets, &amp;c. <hi>In all these we heare
of the</hi> spirit of slumber, <hi>of</hi> couering <hi>and</hi> shutting of eyes, <hi>of</hi> not
seeing: <hi>and can these signifie any thing but a spirituall blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse?
Againe,</hi> Pagninus <hi>translateth the text according to our
English:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pagninus.</note> Excaecati &amp;c. They are blinde, and make you blinde.
<hi>And not this only,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pintus.</note> 
                  <hi>but their owne late authorized Doct.</hi> Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
<hi>in his Comment vpon the same place, sayth:</hi> In Hebraeo
est in hunc modum, &amp;c. Thus it is in the Hebrew text (<hi>sayth he</hi>)
Your Priests shall be blinde, and make others blinde.</p>
               <p>16 Let vs conferre circumstances together. First, I am noted
by P. R. to haue forged a text, but am acquitted by the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Translation, <hi>They are blinde, &amp;c.</hi> This then is his first
falshood. And next, for his sense he obiecteth the Latine and
Greeke, but by the exposition of <hi>S. Hierome</hi> both the Greeke
Septuagints and Latine vulgar haue the same sense, to wit,
<hi>Shutting vp of eyes,</hi> which is to be blinde: which may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
his second falshood. In the last place he opposeth the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> text, as different from the English, which by the
iudgement of <hi>Pagninus,</hi> and <hi>Pintus,</hi> is almost the same both in
words &amp; sense, wherein is discouered his third falshood. So as
I can not ghesse what mooued <hi>P. R.</hi> to deale so slanderously
with me, in noting me of <hi>fraud and corruption,</hi> except it be that
he meant we should recken himselfe in the number of these
Priests thus mentioned in the Text, <hi>You are blinde, and make
men blinde:</hi> or in the words following, <hi>You are drunke</hi> but <hi>not
with wine:</hi> With what then? I pray God I may not say with
malice. In this, both P. R. and I may learne a caution, to
take heed wee doe not peremptorily meddle with Hebrew
texts: for if they say true who know him, as I can say of my
selfe, we are but <hi>Alephbetharians</hi> in this language.</p>

               </p>
               <p>19 The second is of the particle <hi>Verè,</hi> which is also as plaine

the Authour he might haue gained grace and dignitie to his
cause. Where then is the sinceritie of this mans conscience?

<hi>anno</hi> 1601. where it is <hi>verè)</hi> if there may be another, then hath
he wilfully bolted out this exception, saying, that <hi>there is but
one Edition.</hi> The guilt of the first must bee needs malice; of
the other, madnesse: wherby (I hope) my Reader may iudge,
that the sinceritie of my conscience heerein hath beene where
it ought, euen in the heart of a <hi>Minister of Truth:</hi> and that it
is no maruell, if the conscience of my Aduersarie hath beene
(according to his profession) in the heart of an Aequiuocator,
who sayth furthermore, <hi>I let that passe,</hi> which notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

wee? Yet this also is excusable in respect of many others,
whereof (so much as the nature of a preamble may require) I

sufficient presumption of the rest. But some will say, in so

kingdome</hi> (which was to make way for the Spanish Inuasion
against England, in 88.) <hi>may be taken by Catholikes.</hi> From
which three testimonies (besides that of <hi>Dolman,</hi> which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth)
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:4721:18"/>
I made bolde to conclude a generall, That all <hi>Romish</hi>
Priests are of the same opinion: and am therefore censured
for a <hi>notable liar:</hi> his reason, <hi>Because three Protestant Princes
haue beene peaceably admitted vnto the Crowne, when yet there
wanted no meanes of disturbance.</hi> It can not be but that this <hi>P.
R.</hi> when he calleth any man <hi>liar,</hi> doth presently licke his
owne lips, as we may perceiue by his strong breath: for first,
I reported not mine owne coniectures, but the expresse posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of their owne principall Doctors,<note place="margin">A calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous falshood.</note> finding no one of that
side, writing of our English cause, to holde the contrary.</p>
               <p>22 Which is heerein more apparently the generall doctrine
of all their Priests, in as much as this Priest <hi>P. R.</hi> euen now,
when the case challenged him to answer concerning that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
yet neither could oppose, of the infinite number of all
his crew, any one Priest who euer set pen to paper to confute
that doctrine, neither durst he in this answer condemne it
himselfe. And therefore where my question is <hi>Deiure,</hi> that
is, of the doctrine, Whether their Priests thinke it lawfull for
subiects to admit a Protestant Prince, and heire apparent, to
succession, he answereth <hi>De facto,</hi> that is, <hi>of the euents of things
that happened,</hi> to wit, That three Protestant Princes haue been
quietly permitted to succeed, giuing his Reader an almes of
a piece of chalke for a morsell of cheese. As for example: It is
a law amongst theeues (no one of them holding the contrary)
not alwayes to robbe, when they may make disturbance, but
then only, when they are in most probable hope to enioy their
prey: so that it falleth out many times, that when they meet
with passengers, they entertaine kinde and courteous talke
with them, and yet dogge them on their way, with purpose
to rob them in some presumed place of aduantage: but then
by the sight of more company of true men they, being fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
of their hope, let them passe without any maner of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P. R.</hi> his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniation manifested by a Simile.</note>
If, notwithstanding such escape, any shall affirme,
that all theeues professe robbery and spoile, whensoeuer their
opportunitie may serue: shall he therefore be termed a slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer
of theeues, and <hi>a notable liar?</hi> I know <hi>P. R.</hi> is wittie, and
can applie this similitude vnto himselfe, whom it most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth:
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:4721:18"/>
for he who in this place bringeth in a triple instance
of Protestant Princes, <hi>who were admitted peaceably to their
Crownes,</hi> insinuating that therefore they were willingly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
on the Romish part, may be easily confuted by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
triple instance taken from himselfe. 1. Of the now K.
of France,<note n="s" place="margin">See heereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter §. 12. num. 38. and §. 13. num. 39.</note> 
                  <hi>who being K. of Nauarre, was resisted, that he should
not succeed in the kingdome of France, lest being in that disposition</hi>
(meaning a Protestant) <hi>he might haue altred religion in France.</hi>
2. of Q. Elizabeth he hath also sayd, that <hi>she was excommunicate
by the Pope,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A falshood full of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion.</note> (by whose Bull she was also pronounced to be no
Queene) <hi>because she had changed religion.</hi> Will they not for the
same reason hinder succession, for the which they haue ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured
to disturbe a possession<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. The third instance is in
our dread Souereigne <hi>K. Iames, P. R.</hi> in his <hi>Dolman</hi> hath held
against his succession to the Crowne foure arguments of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.
Obserue now three singular notes of this mans mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie:
1. He accuseth me to be a slanderer for auouching
a report, prooued true by incontroleable consequence, and
whereunto no instance of any Priest was or could be obiected.
2. He offereth to satisfie a question of <hi>Right</hi> and iustice with
an instance of <hi>fact</hi> and euent, as if he would teach vs to reason
thus: Romish Priests do not say Masse publikely in England:
Ergo they think it vtterly vnlawful that Masse should be sayd
publikly in England. 3. He hath so assoiled the question by
a triple instance, that by another triple instance of his own he
is more strictly and dangerously intangled. Let me mention,
for further discouerie of this his delusion, the <hi>Breue</hi> of <hi>Pope
Clemens</hi> the 8. commanding that at the death of <hi>Q. Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
none should be suffered to succeed, who was not a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
Romish Catholike. This M. <hi>Garnet</hi> confessed at the
Barre, which his confession remaineth in publike Record. If
any shall require a reason why they resisted not his Maiesties
entrance, they can not possibly yeeld any, but only want of
meanes of <hi>disturbance.</hi> So that I might confesse my selfe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>shamelesse</hi> indeed, if I should not blush and sorrow in his
behalfe, to see any man by so presumptuous falshoods to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his owne soule.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:4721:19"/>
23 <hi>Which is yet more visible by the second part of this accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
which</hi> P. R. <hi>inferreth thus:</hi>
                  <note n="t" place="margin">Treatis. of <hi>Mitigat. chap. 2. num. 35. pag.</hi> 72. The obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood out of the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of <hi>Doleman</hi> answered and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> 
                  <q>What or how far this fellow
may be trusted in these his assertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s may be gathered by the last sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of all his discourse in this matter, where he hath these words:
<hi>[F. Parsons (in his Dolman) doth pronounce sentence, that
whosoeuer shall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent to the succession of a Protestant prince,
is a most grieuous and damnable sinner.]</hi> And is it so Sir Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas?
And will you stand to it &amp; lose your credit, if this be falsly and
calumniously alleged? then if you please, let vs heare the Authors
owne words, viz. And now (saith Doleman part. 1. pag. 216.)
to apply all this to our purpose for England, and for the matter wee
haue in hand, I affirme and hold that for any man to giue his helpe,
consent or assistance towards the making of a King, whom he iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
or beleeueth to be faulty in religion, and consequently would
aduance either no religion, or the wrong, if he were in authority, is
a most grieuous and damnable sinne to him that doth it, of what
side soeuer the truth be, that is preferred. So he. And his reason
is, for that he should sin against his own conscience in furthering such
a King. And is there heere any word peculiar of a Protestant
Prince, or of his successour? nay doth not the Text speake plainely
of <hi>making a King,</hi> where none is? doth it not speake also indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
of all sorts of religion, <hi>of what side soeuer the truth be?</hi>
How then can this malitious cauilling Minister expect to bee tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
heereafter, or how may any man thinke that hee speaketh or
writeth out of his conscience, seing him to vse such grosse shifts and
falshoods in so manifest and important a matter? It is no maruell if
he set not his name at large to his booke, as not desirous to haue the
due praise of such desert.</q>
               </p>
               <p>24 Venture my credit, Sir? yes that I will, though I value no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to be more pretious among men, and therefore willingly
put it into this affirmatiue ballance concerning the sentence of
<hi>Doleman,</hi> proouing it true in that sense it hath beene alleged, if
you will put yours in the other, which is the negatiue, our
Reader shall hold the scales, and the euidence of <hi>Dolemans</hi>
booke shall cast it.</p>
               <p>The subiect of our question is, whether <hi>Doleman,</hi> one of
the three Romish Priests, doth account it a <hi>damnable sinne</hi> in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:4721:19"/>
his Catholikes to suffer a Protestant Prince to succeed in the
Crown: after I had proued this to be the Romish doctrine by
the testimony of three Priests, I added this fourth, which was
<hi>Doleman.</hi> Wherefore wee must examine whether this bee the
iudgement of <hi>Doleman</hi> or no. It belongeth to mee to prooue
the affirmatiue, to wit, that this was the iudgement of <hi>Dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>25 <hi>The title of that booke is,</hi> A conference about the next suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
to the Crowne of England (<hi>namely, next after the death
of Q. Elizabeth)</hi> and about all such as may pretend <hi>a right,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
within England or without. <hi>One of the contents of the first
Chapter is, that</hi> Neerenesse of blood may upon iust causes be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
<hi>And of the sixt Chapter: that,</hi> An heire apparent to the
crowne before he be crowned may be iustly put backe. <hi>After this he
proceedeth to expresse his iust causes, the principall hee deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth
in the ninth chapter, the very place now alleged: The
Contentis this,</hi> That one principall cause of excluding any Prince
is diuersitie of Religion. <hi>Whereof he resolueth thus:</hi>
                  <note n="u" place="margin">
                     <hi>Doleman.</hi> part 1. cap. 9. pag. 212.</note> Nothing
can more iustly exclude an heire apparent from his succession, as
want of Religion, nor any cause whatsoeuer iustifie the Common-wealth,
or conscience of particular men, that in this cause should
resist his entrance, than if he find him faulty in this point, which is
the head of all the rest. <hi>Where we see, that the person spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of is</hi>
an heire apparent. <hi>By which word cannot be meant a successor
by Election, but a successour by naturall descent and right of
inheritance. Of this</hi> heire apparent <hi>he</hi>
                  <note n="x" place="margin">
                     <hi>Doleman</hi> pag. 213.</note> 
                  <hi>saith further; that as
when a woman is espoused vnto an husband which is an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,
this contract (by the doctrine of the Apostle) may be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued:
so is the case of an Infidel pretender vnto the Crowne.
And lest any may doubt who in this case may be held an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,
he addeth that</hi>
                  <note n="y" place="margin">Ib. pag. 214.</note> Seeing there can bee but onely one faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileable
vnto saluation, certaine it is that vnto my conscience who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
beleeueth otherwise than I doe, and standeth wilfully in the
same, is an Infidel, for that he beleeueth not that which in my faith
and conscience is the sole sauing faith. <hi>This ground thus laid, he
commeth at last vnto the application before specified, saying:</hi>
And now to apply, &amp;c. <hi>affirming that,</hi> Whosoeuer giueth any
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:4721:20"/>
helpe to the making a King, whom he iudgeth to be faulty in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
is a most greeuous and damnable sinner.</p>
               <p>26 One Syllogisme will assoile the whole doubt.</p>
               <p>Euery man is a damnable sinner, who admitteth any Prince
to succeed in the Crowne,<note place="margin">Maior.</note> whom hee thinketh faultie in
Religion.</p>
               <p>But euery Romish Catholike thinketh all Protestant Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
faulty in Religion.<note place="margin">Minor.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Ergo, euery Romish Catholike, who admitteth of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Prince to succeed in the Crowne, is a damnable
sinner.</p>
               <p>What is there in all this Syllogisme which <hi>Doleman</hi> alias
<hi>Parsons,</hi> can denie to be his Assertion? The <hi>Maior</hi> hee hath
said, <hi>He that admitteth of any to the Crowne, whom he thinketh
to be of faulty religion, is a damnable sinner.</hi> Is it the <hi>Minor?</hi>
why, he hath said that, <hi>There is but one true Religion.</hi> And
<hi>Parsons</hi> being a Romish Priest must intend that all Protestants
in the iudgement of all Catholikes are of <hi>a faulty Religion.</hi>
Will hee then denie the <hi>Ergo</hi> or <hi>Conclusion?</hi> this were against
the Law of Logicke, and then his Sophisters would deride
him. How then can my assertion be thought slanderous, which
necessary consequence of reason prooueth to bee too true?<note place="margin">The idle and ridiculous ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniation of <hi>P. R</hi> discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by two Similies.</note> As
for example, Suppose that this <hi>P. R.</hi> hath promised his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditour
to pay him foure Nobles, at a certaine time appointed,
at what time his Creditour challengeth him saying, Sir you
are to pay mee twenty six shillings eight pence, according to
the words of your owne promise; by and by <hi>P. R.</hi> (purging
his choler) answereth, <hi>This is falsly and calumniously</hi> vrged, was
there any <hi>such word</hi> of twenty six shillings eight pence in all
my promise? Nay did I not expresly say, that I would pay thee
foure Nobles? <hi>What a malitious cauilling Creditor art thou, or
how shall any thinke thou seekest thy debts with good conscience,
seeing thou vsest these shifts and falshoods</hi> in a summe of this <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance?</hi>
Would not by-standers either laugh at him, as at a
lunatike, or else suspect him for a cosening cheater? because he
that promiseth foure Nobles, promiseth twenty six shillings
eight pence, though not in the same literall words, yet in the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:4721:20"/>
reall sense. Or else more pertinently thus: Let vs suppose
this to be a generall doctrine amongst his Catholikes, that <hi>no
person</hi> borne without England can be accounted lawfull heire
to that kingdome: which<note n="y" place="margin">
                     <hi>Doleman</hi> part. 2. cap. 5. pag. 116.</note> 
                  <hi>Doleman</hi> insinuateth by his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
obseruation of the same <hi>Maxime</hi> against the succession of
our dread soueraigne, then the only king of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that
some thus libelling were taken, and by some Protestant accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of treason, for affirming that <hi>K. Iames</hi> had no right to the
Crown of England: the libeller should answer saying: This ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation
is false and slanderous, I named not <hi>K. Iames,</hi> but only
said in generall (though particularly I intended <hi>K. Iames)</hi> that
<hi>none</hi> borne without <hi>England</hi> was a iust successor to the crown:<note place="margin">See a further answer here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in this Preamble.</note>
the Iudge should say, well then thine owne mouth hath
condemned thee, inasmuch as if thou shouldest now say that
there is no king in England, (although none be named) because
the right one, who is <hi>K. Iames,</hi> is disabled, when euery one is
excluded. It is true, (saith the libeller) by iust consequence,
but yet I named none. Would <hi>P. R.</hi> if he heard this, pronounce
this fellow vnguiltie? then is he no <hi>Mitigator:</hi> would he iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
his accuser? then am I no liar. For the case is alike, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
knowing that the scope of that whole booke, called <hi>Dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
and penned by <hi>Parsons</hi> a Priest, is only this, to disable
the titles of all Protestants (yea euen <hi>K. Iames</hi> by name) and
to debarre them all hope of succession in <hi>Great Britaine:</hi> and
to preferre the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> before all other pretenders.

contention that passed betweene Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the seuenth, called
<hi>Hildebrand,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth Emperor of that name, about
the yeere 1070. he citeth the Historiographer <hi>Otto Frisingensis,</hi>
with this ordinary title of <hi>Our Otto,</hi> for that hee writeth that hee
found not any Emperour actually excommunicated or depriued of

that he allegeth this<note n="*" place="margin">Frisin. l. 6. hist. c. 32.</note> 
                     <hi>Frisingensis</hi> quite contrary to his own mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,

               <p>28 In the <hi>Full Satisfaction</hi> Part. 3. Cha. 11. Pa. 28. that which
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:4721:21"/>
was intended to be proued was this: That not till a thousand
yeeres after Christ did euer any Prelate or Pope attempt the
deposing of Emperors and depriuing them of their Crownes.
For proofe heereof I brought in the testimony of <hi>Otto Frisin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gensis</hi>
from the witnesse of <hi>Tolossanus lib. 26. De Repub. cap.</hi> 5.
in these words, <hi>I reade and reade againe, and finde, That Pope
Hildebrand, in the yeere 1060. was the first Pope, who euer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued
an Emperor of his regiment.</hi> Wherein now haue I wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
my conscience? Is it <hi>because Otto Frisingensis is cited con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
to his meaning?</hi> If this should be supposed to be true, yet
could it not preiudice my conscience, because I cited not the
Author himselfe,<note place="margin">A trecherous falshood.</note> but only <hi>Tolossanus</hi> a Romish Doctor, who
reported that sentence of <hi>Frisingensis.</hi> And is not this a fine
treacherie of my Accuser to conceale the Authour, and so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly

and might answer him, That if I be deceiued your owne

the malice of my Accuser, and not (although it
might suffice) to satisfie the point in question, in behalfe
whereof I auouch my Allegation to be true. And why not?
<hi>Otto Frisingensis</hi> (sayth <hi>P. R.) mentioneth ancient examples of
two Emperors, who were excommunicate, both which the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of simple truth leaueth out of purpose.</hi> I left them out of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
(I confesse) otherwise I should haue beene like to your
selfe in this and other such cauilles, who desire to say much,
though nothing to the purpose. For to what purpose, I pray
you, had this beene, seeing our question was not to shew what
Emperors had beene excommunicated, but who, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate,
had been deposed from their Royalties? Then
my case is no otherwise, than supposing that <hi>P. R.</hi> or any
other had beene degraded in any Vniuersitie, and demand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made concerning the time, when this was done: I should
answer (and that truly) that it was in the dayes of Elizabeth
Queene of England:<note place="margin">A dull taxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile sheweth.</note> presently <hi>P. R.</hi> after his ordinary maner
of saluation should call me Liar, because I ought to haue told
that he was admonished and excommuned before he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded.
So dull and friuolous is his present taxation in a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:4721:22"/>
of Antiquity, concerning the time when first any Pope
did take vpon him to depose Emperours. <hi>Frisingensis</hi> sayth
plainly, that <hi>Hildebrand was the first:</hi> he saith moreouer (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
him) that <hi>Hildebrand was constant in punishing faults.</hi>
Say then (good <hi>P. R.)</hi> seeing both these two are true, can one
of them be a lie? As if when two noble men <hi>H.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

in regard of valure and bountie farre more honorable than <hi>H.</hi>
Then I, purposing to answer to the question, report the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds
speech:<note place="margin">A Simile.</note> to wit: <hi>The house of B. is not, by much, so ancient

containe laughter, to heare such a senslesse exception as
this? because that although I omitted the commendation of
bountie, yet did I truly relate the obseruation of Ancientrie,
which was the principall matter in question. I leaue the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication

iealous of his Fathers honor, and therfore will haue it knowen
that he is <hi>commended by Frisingensis,</hi> and yet could not be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
that the next witnesse, whom I<note n="a" place="margin">

Espencaeus,</hi> their owne Romish Bishop, doth plainly auerre,
that <hi>Hildebrand was the first Pope, who without any example of
antiquitie made a schisme betweene Emperours and Popes, and by
his example prouoked the Popes following him, to take armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Kings excommunicate.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A falshood in concealment.</note> This Authour disabling not only
the antiquitie of that rebellious practise of the Pope, but also
condemning the fact it selfe. Therefore hath <hi>P. R.</hi> by wily si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
made as it were a pocketting of this Author, as of a med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.
And was not this a piece of fine fraud?</p>
               <p>29 <hi>But</hi> P. R. <hi>is not contented to haue noted me in the former

                  <q>Otto Frisingensis commendeth Hildebrand, and yet is brought
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:4721:22"/>
in to condemne him. <hi>After this againe he insulteth vpon it in
this sort:</hi> Truly, if any man can shew me out of all the Catholike
writers that be extant, English or other, that euer any one of them
vsed this shamefull fraud in writing, where no excuse can free them
from malicious and witting falshood, then will I grant that this is
not proper to the Protestant spirit alone.<note place="margin">Mark how hainous he maketh his accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> Hitherto, I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
that I neuer found it in any, and if I should, though it were
but once, I should holde it for a sufficient argument not to beleeue
him euer after. And this shall suffice for a taste only of M. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons
maner of proceeding. For that to prosecute all particulars
would require a whole volume, and by these few you may ghesse at
the mans veine and spirit in writing.</q> 
                  <hi>So</hi> P. R.</p>
               <p>30 Aristotle telleth vs of one <hi>Antiphon,</hi> who was of that
weake sight, that whensoeuer he walked he saw his owne i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
reflecting vpon him in the aire. What shall we imagine
of this exclamation against <hi>shamefull and malicious fraud in

of his owne image,<note place="margin">Foure excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent tricks of falshood in one.</note> who hath playd me foure malicious

vpon me, as though I had cunningly pretermitted the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Emperors excommunicate, whereas the question was
only concerning Emperors depriued of their state and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
The second cauill is, Not acknowledging the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of <hi>Hildebrand</hi> in <hi>Otto Frisingensis,</hi> when as I intended
not to proue out of this Author the equitie, but only the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie
of that practise. Thirdly, In making me so pernicious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enuious, as to condemne <hi>Hildebrand</hi> without a witnesse,
when as I produced their owne Bishop <hi>Espencaeus</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
him. Lastly, In charging me with a wilfull peruerting
of the meaning of the Authour <hi>Otto Frisingensis,</hi> when as (if it
had been so abused) yet not I but their owne Doctor <hi>Tolossa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>

               <p>31 The view of all these and other formerly mentioned wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

they could not but make good sport for the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
As for example (for I will faine nothing in their names,
which shal not be consonant &amp; agreeable to their conditions.)
First then the <hi>Moderate Answerer</hi> might haue said, <hi>P. R.</hi>
you haue beene altogether presumptuous to take vpon you
this Answer called the <hi>Mitigation,</hi> knowing that you shall
but bewray your ignorance, because residing <hi>out of England,</hi>
you cannot be rightly experienced <hi>In this our Countrey cause.</hi>
To whom the <hi>Mitigator</hi> might reioine, saying; Nay I haue not
beene arrogant, but thou hast beene rash and precipitant, for
if thou by thy former answer mightest haue been thought suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
for a Replie, what needed such posting to mee <hi>beyond
the seas</hi> for a supplie of a more exact and learned Reioinder?
Then the <hi>Mod. Answerer;</hi> Haue patience, I pray you, For
when I perceiued so many of our Authors obiected, al of them
by due consequent giuing Protestants cause of hatred against
vs, as against those that had by our doctrine decreed a depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
them of their debts, goods, crownes and liues, whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
opportunity might serue, I was enforced to vse this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
for a refuge, taking exceptions to all Authors out of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
who writ of this English case: and to appeale rather to
other Catholikes,<note place="margin">Craft in Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of books.</note> who being in this kingdome, haue written
nothing heereof. This is the ground of my <hi>Moderation,</hi> which
not the truth of our cause, but the necessity of the time did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
at my hands. Whereunto the <hi>Mitigator</hi> thus: Thou hast
done well, and such hath beene the cause of my commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of thy <hi>Answer,</hi> as thou maist perceiue, for I haue said that
<note n="f" place="margin">Mitig. supra.</note> 
                  <hi>I must need<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:4721:24"/>
Not that I could thinke so, but because (thou knowest)
we must commend and iustifie one another, especially in these
times, wherein our malice and madnesse both in doctrine and
practise hath been so fully discouered. And therfore I thought
it necessary also to intitle my Booke a <hi>Mitigation,</hi> concealing
in my mind this reseruation <hi>[To delude my Reader.]</hi> Thus it
must be, when we raise a flame of rebellion, which shall not
succeed, then it is policy to cast about vs some holy-water
sprinkle of plausible termes <hi>Moderation</hi> and <hi>Mitigation,</hi> as
though we intended to quench that with our water, which we
had rather do with oile. The <hi>Moder.</hi> I perceiue you are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
and therfore willingly yeeld you place to answer my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersary,
the rather because I thinke you are troubled with the
disease of some of our Catholike Lawyers, of whom you haue
sayd,<note n="g" place="margin">Treatis. <hi>Mitig.</hi> preface to the Reader <hi>num. 10. P. R.</hi> his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease in so oft writing.</note> 
                  <hi>They itch to be doing,</hi> and answering M. Atturney. This
was also my disease, but I after found a scratch, and so may
you. Then <hi>Mitig.</hi> Tush, wee need not care, namelesse are
blamelesse, for thou settest no name vnto thy <hi>Moderation,</hi>
and I only set downe mute and dumbe characters, which are
as good as nothing, to my <hi>Mitigation.</hi> Againe, we haue many
great and principall oddes of Protestants, besides railing, viz.
When our Aduersary prooueth any thing by many testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
out of our owne Authours, and we are not able to satisfie
the common opinion obiected against vs, then to single out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
allegation of any one of his witnesses, which hee hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
and if thou perceiue him to faile in the manner of alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
squeeze euery such answer to make him, at the least,
seeme to be fraudulent: And if thou canst finde him faulty in
one, it is no matter though all the rest of our Authors cited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
vs be neuer so true, we shall wound the cause in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
as he doth our persons in the cause. Furthermore bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
echoing out against him some opprobrious termes, as

which he hath discouered, and in a manner silenced me. The

for the delight which they finde in an eloquent and inuecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
style of writing (ô mine is excellent!) as <hi>Athenians;</hi> So
that it cannot be but where so many mice be still nibbling at

kept secure vnder the locke and key of the <hi>vowe of obedience,</hi>

his Answer shall prooue me neuer so monstrously calumnious
and slanderous, yet of our Catholikes few can, and none dare
examine or beleeue any thing against a Priest: this is our suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency.
The <hi>Moder.</hi> You haue forgot an other policy we vse,
which is, though our Aduersary write neuer so methodically
and orderly, yet not to follow him exactly in his course, and
commonly to pretermit those authorities which he bringeth,
and wherein is the chiefe strength of his cause. <hi>Mitigat.</hi> And
is not this good policie? he that will cunningly put away a
counterfeit piece of coine in stead of currant, must do it apart
from the other money, for if true and counterfeit be compared
together, the good will discouer the bad, and his booke thou
knowest is <hi>A Discouerie.</hi> Againe, thou maiest perceaue that
when I vse no method my selfe, I challenge him for<note n="h" place="margin">

vs come (<hi>saith he</hi>) to the application of this example against aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation,
which he hath chosen to vse principally about the womans
speech. <hi>The woman is asked</hi> (saith T. M.) <hi>sold you the land for
so much? her answer is, yea for so much, meaning but one half,
&amp; concealing the other, in which dissimulation it is impossible
but that your reserued clause must haue come into her head to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:4721:30"/>
think, but for so much to giue in common: or to signifie vnto
you.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Example of aequiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating in an accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed person.</note> So T. M. teacheth that poore woman to aequiuocate after this
maner of aequiuocation, that is to say, lie: for that now, I suppose, he
hath learned by that which hath beene set downe in our precedent
chap. that to speak an vntruth, or conceale a truth, or vse any aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation,
when we are iustly demanded by our lawfull superior, and
when no iniury or violence is vsed vnto vs, is a grieuous mortall sin
in our Catholike doctrine; and consequently shee being lawfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by S. Peter in a lawfull cause, touching her owne vow and
promise, No clause of Reseruation could saue her speech from lying,
as our Minister doth foolishly imagine.</q> 
                  <hi>So</hi> P. R.</p>
               <p>¶ Know first (gentle Reader) that the last words, viz. <hi>[As
our Minister doth foolishly imagine,]</hi> doe not betoken that the
consequent going before, viz. <hi>[Therefore no clause, &amp;c.]</hi> is my
collection, but the quite contrary: for I said that a clause of
<hi>Reseruation</hi> might aswell haue saued the womans speech from
lying, as the clause which Priests vse can free a Priest: he hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the contrary, because (saith he) <hi>shee being lawfully deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
&amp;c. no</hi> such <hi>clause could saue her speech from lying.</hi> This
kind of phrase is vsuall in our English tongue. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
a man bringeth a peece of some kind of mettall vnto a
gold-smith, which the bringer thinketh to be good gold: the
gold-smith after touch answereth him saying, Friend, this is
not good gold, as you suppose: which words doe not signifie
that the owner did not suppose it to bee good gold: and the
words, <hi>It is not gold,</hi> were the words of the gold-smith, and not
of the owner. So heere: which I therefore explane, to make
it appeare that in these words, <hi>(And consequently no clause of
reseruation could saue her speech from lying) P. R.</hi> hath set down
his owne conclusion. And now we proceed to the maine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in hand.</p>
               <p>47 The supposed Aequiuocation of the <hi>Woman</hi> was this, <hi>I
haue sold it but for so much,</hi> reseruing in her mind (<hi>for ought that
you shall know:</hi>) which is agreeable to their owne example of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuocation
(<hi>I am no Priest</hi>) meaning (<hi>To tell it vnto you</hi>) This
latter <hi>P. R.</hi> hath defended thorow his whole book, and now
of the other hee is inforced by the word of truth to say that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:4721:30"/>
it is <hi>a lie:</hi> yea, and that, <hi>No clause of Reseruation could saue it
from a lie:</hi> From whence it shall inuincibly follow, that Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Aequiuocation is a Satanicall lie. These two speeches being
so semblable in themselues, if he shall say they differ, then must
the difference be either in respect of the speakers, or in respect
of the hearers. But first</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The difference of these two kinde of aequiuocations, viz. of that
woman, and these Priests (the one whereof is confessed to be
A lie) can not be in respect of the speakers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>48 She indeed was a woman, and a Priest is a man, but <hi>P. R,</hi>
knoweth that it is as possible for a Priest, a<note n="a" place="margin">That he do not obiect vnto me the woman pope <hi>Ioan.</hi>
                  </note> man, to lie, as for
a woman to tell a truth. Neither may he obiect, that her lie
was in respect of her vow; for the question in this place is not
about her vow vnto God, whether she had promised to sell
all their possession, and to giue vp the whole price to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
for the common good of the Church, or no: but it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
her speech vnto man about the summe and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the sale of their goods, <hi>Whether solde you</hi> your possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<hi>for so much?</hi> And she answering, <hi>But for so much;</hi> is (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all supposed clause of Reseruation) condemned
by S. Peter for a <hi>Liar.</hi> And this is the very case of <hi>P. R.</hi> for
(if he be a Priest) he hath vowed himselfe to the Order of
Priesthood; and yet being demanded whether he be a Priest
or no, professeth it lawfull for himselfe, by mentall aequiuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
sometime to answer, <hi>I am no Priest.</hi> In the next place
we are to shew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That (concerning the nature of a lie) there can be no difference
betweene that aequiuocation of the woman, and this other
of these Priests, in respect of the hearers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>49 The only cloud of words which may hinder the perfect
view of truth for this confession that all Aequiuocation is a lie,
may seeme to be because she is sayd heerby to haue intended
to deceiue S. Peter, being then a competent Iudge, whereas
the Priests admit no aequiuocation except only in examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and iudgements incompetent. But <hi>P. R.</hi> can not obiect
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:4721:31"/>
this without grosse and stupid contradiction to himselfe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowout
his whole Treatise. For our question is not of decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
or not deceiuing, which is only the effect of lying (as
<hi>P. R.</hi> also euery where acknowledgeth) but it is about the
speech it selfe, and the very nature of a lie. Now that there
can be no difference heereof in regard of hearers, whether
they be competent Iudges or incompetent, our <hi>Mitigator</hi>
himselfe will demonstrate vnto vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First from his one exposition of mentall Equiuocation,</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Treatise <hi>Mitig.</hi> cha. 8. num. 55. pag. 344.</note> 
                  <q>I
say (<hi>sayth he</hi>) that in mentall reseruation the speech agreeth with
the minde of the speaker, for that I truly and really meane that I
am no Priest in that sense I speake it, which may be what pleaseth
me, or that which I list to frame to my selfe: so as I meane I am no
Priest, such as I should be, or such like.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Marke, the truth of Aequiuocation is not suspended vpon
the vnderstanding of the hearer, who may conceiue or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiue
the speech, and so might peruert the speakers truth
into a lie, that seeming false to the hearer, <hi>I am no Priest,</hi> which
in the sense of the speaker (as <hi>P. R.</hi> resolueth) is by vertue of
reseruation (as <hi>To tell it vnto you)</hi> a perfect truth. Well then
the supposed aequiuocation of the woman was such a like fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
<hi>I haue solde it but for so much, to giue it in common,</hi> or, <hi>Tell
it vnto you.</hi> And yet heereof hath <hi>P. R.</hi> concluded, that<note n="c" place="margin">Supra.</note> 
                  <hi>No
clause of reseruation could saue her speech from a lie.</hi> Consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
condemning himselfe and all other mentall Aequiuocators
for phantasticall liars.</p>
               <p>50 Secondly, as we heere finde a woman making a lie vnto
S. Peter, a competent Iudge, so do we read that S. Peter made
a lie vnto a<note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 26. 70.</note> 
                  <hi>woman,</hi> an Examiner incompetent. So that the
difference of hearers doth not alter the nature of the speech.
The reason is that which hath beene already specified, to wit,
because (as is confessed)<note n="e" place="margin">In the same place, num. 46. pag. 338.</note> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>The essence and formalitie of a lie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
that the speech disagree from the minde and vnderstanding
of the speaker.</hi> And yet againe,<note n="f" place="margin">In the same place, num. 47.</note> 
                     <hi>A false speech is only a lie as it
hath the essentiall point before mentioned of dissenting from the
minde of the speaker.</hi> And lastly,<note n="g" place="margin">In the same place, num. 55. pag. 344.</note> 
                     <hi>My speech is truth as it is
truly spoken in my sense, not in the sense of the hearer.</hi>
                  </q> By all
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:4721:31"/>
which is signified,<note place="margin">An euident conuiction of <hi>P. R.</hi>
                  </note> that it is not the person of the hearer, but
the vnderstanding of the speaker, which maketh a lie formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a lie: and consequently, as a slander is a slander, so a lie is a
lie, and truth is truth, whether it be vttered vnto man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
whether to Prince or people; to Simon Peter, or to Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Magus; yea, whether to Archangell or to Sathan; Iudge
competent or incompetent, it can not free a lying speech from
the nature of a lie. So that seeing (notwithstanding the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
supposed clause of Reseruation) there was formally a lie
in her Aequiuocation; it consequently followeth, that the
Priests Aequiuocation must be as formally a lie.</p>
               <p>51 Thirdly, in mentall Equiuocation (sayth <hi>P. R.)</hi> the clause
of Reseruation mixed with the outward speech maketh but
one proposition, which is as true in the minde of the speaker,
as if it were wholly deliuered in the outward speech. As for
example: <hi>I am no Priest,</hi> mixed with this clause conceiued in
minde, <hi>To tell it vnto you,</hi> is as true (in the iudgement of <hi>P. R.)</hi>
as if it had beene without Reseruation fully expressed with
the mouth,<note place="margin">A plaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration.</note> saying, <hi>I am no Priest, to tell it vnto you.</hi> Now then,
say <hi>P. R.</hi> (for I meane to fetter you with your owne shackles)
The woman, when she sayd to S. Peter, <hi>I haue solde it but for so
much,</hi> if she had reserued in her minde this clause, <hi>To giue it
vnto you:</hi> either had it beene by the vertue of Reseruation a
truth, or els (notwithstanding that Reseruation) it had beene
a lie. If the clause of Reseruation might haue made it a truth,
then hath not <hi>P. R.</hi> sayd true in concluding, that <hi>No clause of
Reseruation could saue it from a lie:</hi> if contrariwise the tricke of
Reseruation could not saue it from a lie, then doth not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
clause, <hi>To tell it vnto you,</hi> being mixed with the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
speech, <hi>I am no Priest,</hi> make vp one true proposition.
And consequently, it must be concluded of the Priestly Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation,
as is heere by <hi>P. R.</hi> confessed of the womans, viz.
<hi>No clause of Reseruation can saue their speech from a lie.</hi> For if
she had sayd vnto S. Peter in plaine words <hi>[I haue solde it but
for so much to giue it in common]</hi> or such like, this euery one
knoweth had beene a true speech: yet saying, <hi>I solde it but for
so much,</hi> with mentall reseruation, reseruing in her minde <hi>[To
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:4721:32"/>
giue in common,</hi> or, <hi>To tell it vnto you]</hi> was notwithstanding
this Reseruation (euen by the iudgement of <hi>P. R.)</hi> a flat lie.</p>
               <p>52 Let vs,<note place="margin">The lying woman and the lying Priests pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleled.</note> for conclusion, parallel both these examples which
are very neere a kinne: for if we doe compare speaker with
speaker, that is, the <hi>woman</hi> and a <hi>Priest,</hi> both will be thought
to be Votaries: if outward speech with outward speech, that
is,<note n="h" place="margin">For, <hi>But for so much</hi> hath the nature of a negatiue, &amp; is as much as, <hi>Not for any more.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>I haue solde it but for so much,</hi> and, <hi>I am no Priest,</hi> both
are negatiues: if Reseruation with Reseruation, as <hi>[To tell it
vnto you]</hi> or <hi>[To giue vnto you]</hi> both are mentall: if the forme
with forme, both equally answerable to the mind of the spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker:
if, finally, end with end, both are to deceiue the hearer.
Wherefore <hi>P. R.</hi> granting, that <hi>No clause of Reseruation could
saue her speech from a lie,</hi> must by irrepugnable consequence
be forced to confesse, that his <hi>[I am no Priest]</hi> vttered by a
Priest, to whomsoeuer it be spoken (notwithstanding any
mentall Reseruation of <hi>[To tell it vnto you &amp;c.)</hi> is a Satanicall
and damnable lie.</p>
               <p>53 And where is now <hi>P. R.</hi> his boast of Scriptures, Fathers,
Reasons? where is his challenge of Canonists and Schoole-diuines?
where is his appeale vnto both our Vniuersities?
nay, where is this man <hi>P. R.</hi> himselfe, the new select Aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
for this cause? may he not say heereafter, <hi>I was ashamed,
and therefore I hid my selfe?</hi> so naked doth his deformitie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.
He hath sayd, That his Aduersarie <hi>T. M.</hi> is like one,
who, when the game is desperate, will notwithstanding play
it out, and see the last man borne. Heere hee himselfe hath
made such a blot as can not but be the vnfallible losse of his
whole game, who being pressed with this example out of
<note n="i" place="margin">Act. 5.</note> Scripture, is driuen to such a <hi>vertigo</hi> and giddinesse, that
euen when he would defend his Art of Equiuocating from a
lie, is by consequence from Gods Word forced to confesse an
outward speech, which <hi>No clause of Reseruation could saue
from a lie.</hi> Whereby his owne <hi>Magi</hi> (I doubt not) will be
brought to acknowledge, that <hi>digitus Dei hic est,</hi> this is the
power of Gods truth. Thus being contented, for this present,
to haue my whole cause in both questions, <hi>Aequiuocation</hi> and
<hi>Rebellion</hi> so iustifiable, that my Aduersarie his owne confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

that Images should be worshipped with an honour proper vnto

iudging that the second Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> confirmed by the

no? if they did, then where was the faith of Bellarmine and
Baronius, who say it did not erre in question of <hi>faith?</hi> if those
Fathers iudging the Councell of Nice to erre in faith, did not
erre themselues then it is not preiudiciall to faith to think that

that <hi>P. R.</hi> may not repine, saying: hee hath chosen a

cause, yet not alone, but that the Queen and Counsell (saith Fox)
would also by this mariage, as he affirmed, bring vpon the realme
miserable seruitude, and establish Popish religion. ¶ And the

                     <note place="margin">Fox anno 1554. pag. 1289.</note>
                     <q>That the matter of the marriage is but a Spanish cloake (<hi>saith

                     <hi>So
as in these two points the Minister lieth openly, but more in the

both</hi> Fox <hi>and</hi> Hollinshed <hi>doe ioyntly relate, affirmed</hi> Wiats <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer

<hi>sent from her vnto them, which he also at his arraignment
confessed,</hi> That he and his would haue the gouernance of her
person, the keeping of the Tower, and the placing of her

                  <p>89 The first lie he noteth, is in relating of the <hi>Oration of Q.
Marie,</hi> wherein I sayd there was <hi>no scruple concerning Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi>
and I cited for witnesse <hi>Hollinshed.</hi> This Authour (as we
may perceiue) <hi>P. R.</hi> hath examined, and could finde nothing
in him against me for this first point touching <hi>Q. Maries O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:</hi>
therefore he seeketh other euidence, and bringeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
me the testimonie of <hi>M. Fox,</hi> wherein there is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Religion.</hi> What therefore? Therfore I am by him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
for a liar. Nay, but rather by this opposing <hi>M. Fox
P. R.</hi> hath wilily imitated the fraud of a fox, which crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
men say, doth vsually prey furthest from home. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<hi>P. R.</hi> if he would haue proued me a liar, should haue done
it out of <hi>Hollinsheds</hi> relation of <hi>Q. Maries Oration,</hi> which was
the witnesse whom I produced: but he wanting cause of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe
heerein, doth therefore range further to conuince me
of lying by the testimony which I mentioned not. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
this <hi>Mitigator</hi> hath sayd, That<note n="a" place="margin">Treatise <hi>Mitig.</hi> pag. 92. P. R. confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</note> 
                     <hi>Aduertisement was giuen
him, that this Minister T. M. was Chaplaine vnto my L. of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbury</hi>
(and vpon this Aduertisement doth note me for his
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:4721:48"/>
Graces Chaplaine) when he shall be more certainly informed
that <hi>the Minister</hi> was neuer <hi>Chaplaine</hi> to his Grace, I would
but know whether he will giue his Reader leaue to call him a
Liar, or no. For, if, because he was deceiued in his <hi>Aduertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
he will be iudged a liar, then can not he (a liar) be a fit
man to charge another of <hi>vntruth:</hi> if he will auouch his owne
truth and sinceritie, because he reported nothing not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
by his <hi>Aduertiser</hi> he had been informed, then am I no liar,
who haue sayd no more than whereunto my Authour <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linshed</hi>
did direct me. So that my Aduersarie is now charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
by an argument <hi>à paribus,</hi> either to acquit me, or els to
condemne himselfe. We may suffer professors of the feats of
<hi>Legerdemaine</hi> to delude the beholders, to conuey one mans
ring into another mans pocket, &amp; then call him a cosener; but
for vs Diuines to play such tricks, as he hath done, changing
<hi>Hollinshed</hi> into <hi>M. Fox,</hi> and then to tax me for falshood, is a
deuice inexcusable. His second exception is of no better mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
because euen that purpose of <hi>Wiat,</hi> To keepe the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
wanted not the supposed intention, which was, The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation

some other few such Glozers, but was not then general among

affirme with some Historians, that not aboue an hundred yeres

the French pocks, tooke possession in Christendome, since
which time some parties haue beene miserably afflicted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.
Vpon this Assertion, by the consequent of our <hi>Mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
it must follow, That since these hundred yeeres haue all
Cities, Townes, Villages, Schooles, People, Priests in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome,
yea euen our <hi>Mitigatour</hi> himselfe, become such
a kinde of <hi>Neapolitanes.</hi> And why may not this example fit?
Sure I am, that <hi>mentall</hi> Equiuocating, whomsoeuer it infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth,
is nothing els than a pocke and pestilence in the soule.
We leaue this falshood taken from consequent, and seeke out

                     <hi>This is the first ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
which is giuen vnto the Pope of Rome, that if peraduenture
his name</hi> (before election) <hi>be somewhat vnseemely, he may change
it as soone as he is created. As for example, (which may not bee
spoken without a iest) if peraduenture hee had beene before</hi> (his
creation) <hi>a wicked man, that then he should be called</hi> Bonifacius,
<hi>that is, a good doer: if fearefull, then</hi> Leo, <hi>that is, a Lion: if rusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,

then</hi> Benedictus, <hi>that is, a man of a good report, should
be his name. The first Author of this change of names</hi> (which was
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:4721:53"/>
                     <hi>Anno 1052.) was Pope Sergius Secundus, whose proper name was
Hogs-face: who, that he might auoid the ignominy of his own name,
was permitted to chuse another.</hi>

                  <p>103 Obserue now what I haue reported from <hi>Polydore,</hi> viz.
<hi>that Popes names were changed by antiphrase, or contrary speech,
to couer their defects.</hi> And this is no whit different from the
testimony of <hi>Polydore,</hi> who saith, that <hi>If the Pope were</hi> before
his creation <hi>wicked, he did take the name of godly vpon him: if ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous,
then gentle, &amp;c.</hi> Which kind of alteration of names is
not vnlike a Gregorian, (as some call it) or artificiall couer for
a baldhead. Let therefore the iudicious Reader iudge from
what spirit, whether of ignorance or malice, haue proceeded
these slanderous inuectiues, calling my true relation <hi>malice and
falshood:</hi> and againe, <hi>a malicious lie of the Minister, which hath
neither simplicity nor truth in it.</hi> It is no rare thing for women
of suspected conuersation, lest they should bee called by their
proper names, to miscall honest Matrons first. Peraduenture
<hi>P. R.</hi> vseth the same art in naming me a Liar. But I had rather
interpret his meaning in the best part, to imagine that hee
might meane by his owne open and false detraction to proue
me his Aduersary, to be <hi>A Minister of simple truth.</hi>

who liued in the time of <hi>King Stephen</hi> and <hi>King Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

it, but with this temperament, <hi>vt fertur,</hi> as the report goeth) yet
doth the same <hi>Nauclerus</hi> reiect the same as false, and confuteth it
by the testimonies of all other writers, especially of Italy that liued
with him, and thereby knew best both his life and death. And yet
all this notwithstanding will this false Lad <hi>T. M.</hi> needs set downe
this history as true, affirming it for such, and neuer so much as gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

                  <head>The Answer.</head>
                  <p>105 Not so Sir, both because (as I truly protest) I did not write
this out of the Author himselfe, which I had neuer seene, but
from collection out of some other booke: yet in the relation
it selfe there appeareth no shadow of <hi>malicious falshood.</hi> First,
there could not be <hi>malice</hi> in misquotation of the <hi>Generation,</hi>
as an 139. for 39.<note place="margin">His Cauill compared.</note> which neither added nor detracted anything
from the matter it selfe, no more than to say <hi>Peter</hi> is 10. or an
100. yeeres of age doth conuince a man of fraud who inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
only to prooue that <hi>Peter</hi> is a man. And whosoeuer shall
obiect error of quotation, he may be quoted for one that is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
either what it is to write, or transcribe, or to print; for all
these are subiect vnto misquotations. Now if there bee a fault
in a peece of cloth, must we necessarily iudge that the spinner
was to blame?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, what skilleth it whether it was <hi>Henry</hi> an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
or <hi>Fredericke</hi> an Emperour, that was excommunicated
by the Pope, when as the intended conclusion was onely this,
that <hi>Adrian</hi> the Pope did excommunicate an <hi>Emperour,</hi> and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:4721:54"/>
conspired against him? no more than if, when one should bee
examined of murder, the accuser should say that the mortall
wound was giuen with the right hand; and the party accused
should gainesay it, proouing it was done with the left hand;
could this difference be of any moment, when the maine que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is, whether this man committed the murder, or no? in all
this there is error (I confesse) but yet no falshood.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if where one only witnesse is required, I should
say vnto <hi>N.</hi> you told me (I think) that <hi>A.</hi> did conspire against
<hi>F.</hi> and died miserably. No (quoth <hi>N.)</hi> I did not: but heere is
my brother <hi>V.</hi> that said something to this purpose. In all this
we discerne only an errour in misciting the Authour (<hi>N</hi>) but
no falshood for want of a witnesse. So heere, where <hi>V.</hi> that is,
the Abbat of <hi>Vrspurg</hi> was ready to say that which <hi>N.</hi> that is,
<hi>Nauclerus</hi> was vnwilling to affirme, concerning the conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of <hi>A.</hi> that is, the Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> against <hi>F.</hi> that is <hi>Fredericke</hi>
the Emperour. O but <hi>Abbas Vrspurgensis</hi> did say onely, <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi>
that is, <hi>It is so reported:</hi> and this a man may say of a fable.
But I pray you Sir, what is there in Historiographers of after
times but only case of <hi>report?</hi> So that whosoeuer shall cite any
Historian who was not <gap reason="foreign">

Scribimus enim res gestas affectu nonnunquam plus quàm verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis

death, but that they make no mention of it: neither can <hi>Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clerus</hi>
be said to haue confuted that which he left as doubtfull,
saying, <hi>I know not whether part to beleeue.</hi> As for the truth of the
story (for this is it which we should contend for) wee oppose
the <hi>Abbat Vrspergensis</hi> vnto <hi>Nauclerus.</hi> But it is obiected, <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spergensis</hi>
was an enemie to the Pope. Well; and it may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that the Monke <hi>Nauclerus</hi> was a friend to the Pope.
And therefore we may know that as the bodily sight may bee
hindered aswell by hot rheume as by colde, so falleth it out in

                     <note n="m" place="margin">Bouchier lib. 3. de Abdicat. Hen. 3. cap. 16. pag. 267.</note> Bouchier <hi>in the place controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
doth make a double consideration of a Tyrant; one is, as
he doth iniurie vnto any priuate man</hi> [Qui iusta potestate ad
priuatorum iniurias abutitur.] <hi>In this case he resolueth, That</hi>
à priuato occidi proptereà non licet: <hi>That is,</hi> It is not lawfull for
any priuate man to kill him. <hi>The second consideration of a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
is, as he doth commit any publike iniurie, whether the
case concerne Religion or the ciuill State, whereof he doth
determine thus:</hi> Qui inreligionem ac patriam tyrannidem exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceat,
hunc occidere respub. possit &amp;c. <hi>That is,</hi> The Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
may kill him, who shall tyrannize and iniurie the religion,
and the countrey: it is so manifest that none can doubt of it, but
such as are destitute of common sense: for if the people may arme
themselues against any noisome beast, which may indanger the
common safetie; then much more against such a Tyrant, who is
woorse than any beast. <hi>But who may attempt the execution
heereof? It followeth in the place by me formerly alleged:</hi>
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:4721:56"/>
Priuato cuiuis Tyrannum, quem hostem Resp. iudicauerit, occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere
licitum est. <hi>That is,</hi> It is lawfull for euery priuate man to
kill him, whom the Common-wealth shall iudge to be a Tyrant.
<hi>We see now that</hi> Bouchier <hi>hath defended, both that</hi> No pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
man may kill a Tyrant for iniurie against priuate men, <hi>and
also, that</hi> Any priuate man may kill a Tyrant for common iniuries.</p>
                  <p>111 I haue alleged the latter, <hi>P. R.</hi> hath opposed the former;
both of vs haue affirmed a truth: where then is the falshood?
This must be imputed to him who reporteth a truth, but not
truly, that is, to a false purpose: wherof our Reader may easily
iudge: for I haue obiected the testimonie of <hi>Bouchier,</hi> affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that in the case of common iniuries, whether in matter of
Religion or State, <hi>euery priuate man</hi> is licensed to kill a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant:
and <hi>Bouchiers</hi> words auouch no lesse. <hi>P. R.</hi> opposeth
the other negatiue testimonie of <hi>Bouchier,</hi> denying, that in
<hi>priuate iniuries</hi> any <hi>priuate</hi> man may murder a Tyrant: and
doth he therby conuince me of falshood? Nay rather doth he
not seeke to iniurie me with falshood? For my whole Treatise
of <hi>Discouerie</hi> intendeth only the publike, and neuer medleth
with priuate occasions.</p>
                  <p>112 This will be plaine by example. The common rule of
humanitie teacheth, that the Father, being but an Esquire,
may in priuate conuents and meetings haue place aboue his
sonne, though a Knight; but in places of publike resort, the
Knight,<note place="margin">P. R. con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile.</note> though a sonne, is preferred before his Father. Heere
be two considerations of the sonne and the father; the one is
in respect of priuate, the other in regard of publike occasions.
This Assertion of ciuility standing thus: Suppose my first Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie
the <hi>Moderate Answerer</hi> should auerre that <hi>T. M.</hi> saith
that any sonne, being a Knight, may take place of his father,
being but an Esquire: then my second Aduersarie <hi>P. R.</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this, should oppose and say, It is false which thou alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest,
for <hi>T. M.</hi> sayth the contrary, viz. That any Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an Esquire, may priuately take place of his sonne, though
he be a Knight. Can this his taxation of falshood be thought
true? It is not altogether impertinent? For the assertions of
<hi>T. M.</hi> were two: the first, That any such sonne must be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:4721:57"/>
in publike: the second, That any such father must be
preferred in priuate. And are these contrary? Are they not
both true? And can one truth shoulder out another? The
falshood therefore resteth in the Pleader, who sayd, That the
allegation was false.</p>
                  <p>Wee reade in the Gospell this command of our Sauiour:
<note n="n" place="margin">Matth 23 2.</note> 
                     <hi>The Scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses chaire: whatsoeuer they
bid you obserue, that obserue and doe: but after their works doe
not, &amp;c.</hi> Here we heare vs charged <hi>To do,</hi> and <hi>Not to do</hi> as the
<hi>Pharisees.</hi> And are these contrary? No: for the <hi>[Doe]</hi> is a
commanding to follow their godly doctrine; the <hi>[Doe not]</hi> is
a forbidding to imitate their vngodly life.</p>
                  <p>113 A second crime is in adding (as he sayth) of this clause
<hi>[Which I say by common consent.]</hi> Looke in the Cha. 15. where
the ground of this Position is layed, <hi>That it is lawfull to kill a
Tyrant,</hi> he affirmeth it, saying, <hi>Mirum est quàm magnum affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mando

consent this hath.</hi> Then come to the 16. Chap. vpon the point
now in question, he hath sayd, <hi>He that denieth this, is distitute
of common sense.</hi> If therefore <hi>maruellous consent</hi> according to
<hi>common sense</hi> may be thought more than equiualent vnto a
<hi>common consent,</hi> then is my Aduersarie vnconscionably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious
to accuse me, as saying too much, where I had war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
to haue sayd more.</p>
                  <p>114 It may be, that the striking out of the <hi>words of importance

it is sufficiently condemned without further iudgement: for if
theeues and beasts</hi> (sayth he) <hi>when they suddenly assault vs, may
be resisted without iudiciall proceeding; then much more a tyrant,
who is woorse than any beast.</hi> And this doctrine he assumeth to

iniurie the Countrey, and in Ecclesiasticall transgression, when
he offendeth publikely against Religion: particularly instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing

Church, which he attributeth to the Popes Consistorie. And
yet he magnifieth the murderer (a priuate man) and extolleth
him aboue those who are recorded in holy Writ, not vpon
their priuate spirit, but by diuine inspiration to haue accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished

the same corruptedly: and by a little you may learn much,
<hi>Ex vngue leonem</hi> His words he citeth thus: <hi>Rex humana cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atura
est, quia ab hominibus constituta:</hi> and Englisheth in this
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:4721:58"/>
maner: <hi>A King is but a creature of mans creation.</hi> Where you
see first, that in the translation hee addeth <hi>[but]</hi> and <hi>[mans
creation]</hi> of himselfe: for that the Latine hath no such <hi>but,</hi> nor
<hi>creation,</hi> but <hi>constitution.</hi> Secondly, these words are not the
words of <hi>M. Reinolds,</hi> but only cited by him out of <hi>S. Peter.</hi> And
thirdly, they are alleged heere by <hi>T. M.</hi> to a quite contrary sense
from the whole discourse and meaning of the Author, which was to
exalt and magnifie the authoritie of Princes, as descending from
God; and not to debase the same, as he is calumniated. For proofe
heereof whosoeuer will looke vpon the booke and place it selfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned, shall finde that <hi>M. Reinolds</hi> purpose therein is to
prooue, That albeit earthly principalitie, power and authoritie, be
called by the Apostle, <hi>humana creatura:</hi> yet that it is originally
from God, and by his commandement to be obeyed. His words are
these: <hi>Hinc enim est, &amp;c.</hi> Hence it is, that albeit the Apostle doe
call all earthly principalitie <hi>a humane creature,</hi> for that it is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in certaine men (from the beginning) by suffrages of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
yet election of Princes doth flow from the law of nature, which
God created; and from the vse of reason, which God powred into
man, and which is a little beame of diuine light drawen from that
infinite brightnesse of Almighty God: therefore doth the Apostle
<hi>S. Paul</hi> pronounce, That <hi>there is no power but from God, and
that he which resisteth this power, resisteth God himselfe.</hi>

                  <p>116 This Allegation is, of all which yet I haue found, most
obnoxious and alliable vnto taxation; which (God knoweth
that I lie not) I receiued from suggestion, as the Author there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

for I receiued it as a testimony debasing the authoritie
of Kings: Vpon which presumption (if true) it could be no
falshood in me to insert the particle <hi>But,</hi> especially being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the doctrine of <hi>Card. Bellarmine,</hi> who, that he
may disable the authoritie of a King in comparison of the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
of a Pope, doth defend, That <hi>Kings, being chosen by men,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:4721:58"/>
are not immediatly created by God:</hi> and yet, <hi>The Pope, elected by
Cardinals, hath his authoritie immediatly from God.</hi> What is
this els, but in a certeine degree to distinguish the creation of
a King and creation of a Pope, the one as mans immediate cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature,
the other as Gods? And may it not be lawfull for any
thus to repeate this comparison of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> saying thus:
Kings (after the doctrine of <hi>Bellarmine)</hi> haue their authoritie
immediatly <hi>But</hi> from man, and that the <hi>Pope hath his immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly
from God?</hi> Is the Interiection <hi>But</hi> in this repetition like a

                  <p>118 Furthermore, this I dare aduenture to say in behalfe of
my Suggestor, That though that place alleged doe not agree
vnto the collection, yet the scope of that Chapter and the next
following doth imply as much, proouing that a King may be
deposed by the people. Which doctrine hee there applieth
vnto our English State, and by name to our late Souereigne
<hi>Q. Elizabeth:</hi> which indeed is to account a King nought els

                     <q>But will you heare a case or two more out of the Canon law, how
dexterous Sir Tho<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is in corrupting that which he loueth not, nor
seemeth well to vnderstand. You may read in the 4. page of this his
pamphlet (<hi>the Discouery</hi>) an ancient decree (for so he calleth it)
alleged by him out of <hi>Gratian</hi> in the glosse, determining that though
a man haue sworne to pay money to one that is excommunicated,
yet is he not bound to pay the same, and he allegeth the Latine text
thus: <hi>Si iuraui me soluturum alicui pecuniam, qui excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicatur,
non teneor ei soluere:</hi> If I haue sworne to pay money to
any man that is excommunicated, I am not bound to pay it, adding
this reason: <hi>Quia qualiter cunque possumus, debemus vexare
malos, vt cessent a malo:</hi> We ought to vex euill me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by what means
so euer we may, to the end they may cease from doing euill. In the
allegation of which little text, a man would hardly beleeue how
many false trickes there be, to make Catholike doctrine to seeme o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
and absurd. For first, these words not being found in any
text of law or decision of any Pope or Councell, but only in the glosse
or Commentary, they make not any ancient or modern decree, as the
Minister falsly auoucheth, but rather shew the opinion of him who
writeth the Commentary: if his words were, as heere they are alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.
<hi>The causes.</hi> First, the words of the glosse containe onely an
obiection in these words: What if I haue sworne to pay money to any
person, or haue promised the same vnder some forfeiture, and in the
meane space he, to whom I made the promise, be excommunicated,
am I bound to pay the same, or not? This is his question, and then he
argueth it on both sides: but his resolution is in these words, I doe
beleeue the truer opinion to be, that albeit he that is so exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
do leese the right to demand his money, yet is the other bound
to pay it him. And for this he citeth diuers lawes and reasons. So
heere our Minister not of ignorance, but of falshood taketh the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection
for the resolution. The second deceit is wilfull leauing out
of the first words of the Authour, <hi>Sed quid dices si iuraui?</hi> which
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:4721:60"/>
plainly shew an obiection. Thirdly he allegeth, <hi>Quia qualitercun<expan>
                              <am>
                                 <g ref="char:abque"/>

                           </expan>
&amp;c.</hi> for a reason of the resolution, which is made against that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
Fourthly the true resolution of the Commentator is vtterly
concealed, and the contrary determination put downe for an ancient
decree. Consider, I pray you, how many frauds and falshoods there
be in one little quotation.</q>

                  <p>121 My Aduersary <hi>P. R.</hi> may satisfie himselfe for me, who a
little after concerning this same allegation of this Author hath
said that<note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>Mitig.</hi> pa. 84. num. 52.</note>, <hi>It may seeme to import that hee</hi> (T. M.) <hi>scarce read
the bookes themselues, but cited the same out of some other mans
notes.</hi> Heere, we see, in his vehement crimination of malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
falshood, he hath inserted a charitable and true diuination
of my integrity. I am glad to see in the mingling of a pound of
worme-wood, and ten ounces of gall, hee had the grace to let
fall this dram of sugar, and that so seasonably: For the truth is
that I tooke vp these allegations of <hi>Gratian</hi> vpon credit, and
therefore returne these peeces vnto him, of whom I receiued
them: who is to prooue them currant, and to satisfie for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
                  <p>122 <hi>Thus then he:</hi>

St.</hi> brought vnto the Author of the <hi>Discouery,</hi> which <hi>P. R.</hi> chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth
to be maliciously cited, partly for that the words of the
glosse were only set downe, when the decree is mentioned: wherein
I conceiue <hi>P. R.</hi> complaineth no otherwise, than one, who being
smitten with the scabbard, should complaine that he was not struck
with the sword: So he, because <hi>T. M.</hi> talked of the decree, and vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
only the glosse. For the decree is far more plaine against them
than the glosse, <hi>Nos sanctorum praedestinatorum statuta tenen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
eos, qui excommunicatis fidelitate aut Sacramento con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stricti
sunt, apostolica authoritate à iuramento absoluimus: &amp;
nè sibi fidelitatem obseruent, omnibus modis prohibemus,
quousque ipsi ad satisfactionem veniant.</hi> This is the decree,
which in the generall carrieth as much or more, as is set downe
by him, and so cleereth him from any malice in this point. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
in the very glosse it selfe, (though it was not so fullie
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:4721:60"/>
brought to his hand) is set downe not by way of obiection, but of a
resolute conclusion. For after the obiection and answer the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is: <hi>Probabiliter dici potest, quòd excommunicato non sit
soluendum, cum nemo debeat participare cum eo.</hi> Yea and
further, that in this he was not led by malice, is prooued thus: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he left out another more waighty allegation which was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
him with this, namely, out of <hi>Greg. Decret. lib. 5. Tit. c. 16.

and expresly for the present purpose hath it thus: <hi>Ergo si

iuramenti: in illa autem obligatione &amp; iuramento tacitè
subintelligitur, si talis permanserit, cui communicare liceat.</hi>
Which decree and Glosse doth a great deale more strongly smell of
that impietie, teaching that a man is not bound in such a case to pay
his debt: and yeelding to the Pope a power of absoluing men from
such like obligations. <hi>Thus farre</hi> R. S.</p>

He cannot answer directly, but hee must manifest himselfe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Traitor to his Country, or a preuaricator to his cause.</p>
                  <p>127 His other censure is vpon my interpretation, <hi>Vt fundas
sanguinem, to spill their blood, in stead</hi> (saith he) <hi>of shed their blood.</hi>
Why so? because <hi>otherwise,</hi> (the man may seeme to haue some
pious and religious deuotion in him) <hi>God should be said to be a
blood-spiller.</hi> And must it therefore be rather translated, <hi>shed?</hi>
why, so <hi>God</hi> should bee said to bee <hi>a blood-shedder.</hi> I maruell
what new Dictionary (for he is altogether verbal) <hi>P. R.</hi> doth
follow. I hope that so profound a Clerke will not want a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of his subtilty: let vs heare him. <hi>To spill blood</hi> (saith hee)
<hi>doth signifie an vniust deed.</hi> Is this it? as though <hi>shedding of blood</hi>
might not likewise signify an <hi>vniust deed.</hi> Let him consult with
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:4721:62"/>
their own Remish translation, <hi>Rom. 3. 15. Their feet</hi> (viz. of the
wicked) <hi>are swift to shed blood.</hi> And <hi>Act. 22. 20. When the blood
of the Martyr Stephen was shed.</hi> And <hi>Apoc. 16. 6. They haue
shed the blood of the Saints, therefore hast thou giuen them blood
to drinke.</hi> And <hi>Luc. 11. 50. That the bloud of the Prophets shed
from the beginning of the world may bee required of this generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>P. R.</hi> his ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bish foolery.</note>
Will <hi>P. R.</hi> haue the face to say, that the <hi>blood of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr
Stephen,</hi> and of the <hi>Prophets</hi> by the <hi>Iewes,</hi> or of the <hi>blood
of Saints</hi> by the Heathen was <hi>shed iustly?</hi> Againe, the Rhemists
<hi>Mark. 2. 22. No man putteth new wine into old bottles, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise;
the wine breaketh the bottles, and the wine will be shed.</hi> This
is spoken of the wine, which being shed perisheth. So is it
vulgarly vsed, [drinke is spilt, and drinke is shed.] Now then
what a notable Critick haue I met withall, whom euery good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife
is able to conuince of idle dottage? But this is a man pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledged
to send me to the Vniuersitie to make a Syllogisme,
whom I may more iustly send vnto an Ale-house to learne
English.</p>
                  <p>128 The last point, which is obseruable in our <hi>Mitigator,</hi> is,
that he affirmeth this Canon to haue beene decreed in the 3.
Councell of <hi>Carthage,</hi>
                     <note n="g" place="margin">Reade <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> vpon that Councel. <hi>tom. 1. Conc.</hi>
                     </note> where no such thing can be found.
Therefore must his owne termes of <hi>falshood, fraud, treacherie,</hi>
reuerberate vpon himselfe. And yet againe we may consider
how zealous <hi>P. R.</hi> is in authorizing that Canon, and in vrging
the text of Scripture, saying, <hi>If thy brother; or friend, or wife
will goe about to destroy the truth, let thy hand be vpon him.</hi> To
what end must all this be, but that Protestants, being in their
opinion heretikes, may haue all the penalties which are awar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
against heretikes executed vpon them (as <hi>Bouchier</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
defend) <hi>before,</hi> or at least (as <hi>P. R.</hi> holdeth) <hi>after denuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of sentence?</hi> And consequently Protestants may be, by these
Romishones, without exception of sex, or kindred, or friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
as it was by execution in the cruell <hi>Massacre</hi> in<note n="h" place="margin">

All which proceedeth from a false and perfidious application
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:4721:62"/>
both of the Scripture, and of the Canon. For the law of <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomy</hi>
mentioneth such transgressions, <hi>Who shall intice thee,
saying, Let vs go and serue other gods, which thou hast not knowen,
nor thy fathers before thee.</hi> And the Canon was directed only
against such heretikes, who did ruinate the foundation of
Christian faith. But Protestants are so farre from idolatrie,
that for feare thereof, they haue (in the dayes of <hi>Q. Marie)</hi>
yeelded their bodies to the fire; so farre from heresie, that
they are ready to seale euery fundamental Article of faith with
their blood.</p>
                  <p>A seuenth obiection of

he saw the Romish Arguments most forcibly confuted, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth

God had not prouided sufficiently for his Church.</hi> And
for this he citeth the <hi>Constitution extrauagant</hi> of Pope <hi>Bonifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi>
and sayth, <hi>This obiection is in your extrauagants, and so
it may be called, because it rangeth</hi> extra, that is, <hi>without the

As for example heere: First, this sentence is not in the Popes
<hi>Extrauagant</hi> at all, but only in a certeine addition to the ordinarie
Glosse or Commentarie of <hi>Io. Picard,</hi> which addition was made
by <hi>Petrus Bertrandus</hi> a late Writer. Secondly, this Comment
sayth nothing of deposing of Apostata Princes, but only affirming
the foresayd opinion of Canonists to be true, <hi>That Christ was
Lord absolutely in this life ouer all, not only in spirituall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,

out cunningly the particle <hi>hoc</hi> (this error) and leauing the

the place alledged hath these words: <hi>Postquamper Italiam fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
percrebuisset, &amp;c. After that the fame was spred abroad
thorowout Italy, that K.</hi> Henry <hi>had set his foote in their coasts;
[certatim omnes Italiae Episcopi, &amp;c] All the Bishops of Italy did
flocke by troupes vnto him, receiuing him with all honour woorthie
the magnificence of such a person, and within a few daies after an
armie of an infinite multitude was gathered vnto him: for from
the first time that he was King, they longed for his comming into
Italy, because at this time Italy was pestered with theeuery.</hi> And
what els? It followeth a little after. <hi>Besides, they</hi> (viz. the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and people) <hi>did congratulate his comming, because it was
reported that he came with a resolute courage to depose</hi> (Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry)
<hi>the Pope.</hi> Heere we see it granted by <hi>Lambert</hi> that <hi>All the
Bishops of Italy</hi> were desirous to haue this Pope <hi>Gregory de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.</hi>
But after all this the Emperour goeth to Rome, seeketh
absolution of the Pope, returneth backe againe, and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<hi>Eppo</hi> is sent after to signifie to the Italians this submission
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:4721:68"/>
to the Pope. What now? Now followeth the testimony which
was alledged: <hi>Qui cùm causam Italis exposuisset, &amp;c. When</hi>
Eppo <hi>had told his message to the Italians, all of them began to rage
and fret, &amp;c. casting vpon the Pope all opprobrious reproches,
whom all the Bishops of Italy had before iustly excommunicated,
because by Simonie he had defiled the sea Apostolike.</hi> Could this
Chronologer but acknowledge that the Pope had beene ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated
by the Bishops of Italy, who (as he confessed
in the beginning) did <hi>reioice at the comming of the Emperour,
because he came with a resolution to depose the Pope?</hi> Which is a
thing so notoriously knowne, that neuer Author did denie it:
Insomuch that <hi>Bimus</hi> their last and best authorized Compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
of the Councels, an Author wholly deuoted to that Sea of
Rome, confesseth that<note n="x" place="margin">Binius tom. 3. Conc. pag. 1281.</note> Anno 1076. (viz. the yeere before
this happened, which hath beene related out of <hi>Lambert)
In the Councell of Papia,</hi> a city in Italy, <hi>the Bishops gathered
themselues together, and excommunicated the Pope.</hi> Although
he call that <hi>Councell, Conciliabulum,</hi> and the Bishops <hi>Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticos,
Schismatikes,</hi> as peraduenture <hi>Lambert</hi> also did esteeme
them; yet this trueth is acknowledged of all, that <hi>The Bishops
of Italy did excommunicate this Pope.</hi> Which is all that either
hath, or needed to haue been said. And could this deserue so ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous

of this <hi>Lambertus,</hi> consisteth not in his censure of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending,</hi>

that Pope might be deposed. A collection vsed of all men in
the citing of all Chronologers, knowing that the proper office
of an Historian is to be a witnesse of things done, and not a
Iudge. For if any fauourite of my <hi>Mitigator</hi> should report,
saying thus, That <hi>P. R.</hi> (I doe but suppose this) was expelled
out of a College of <hi>Oxford</hi> by the Fellowes, who did censure

that the Fellowes did him wrong: For I haue heard
him to haue beene accounted by others of very commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

make bold to giue out that the Felowes of a College in <hi>Oxford</hi>
did so censure <hi>P. R.</hi> and name his Author; could any say that
he had abused that testimonie, because he gaue more credit to

whom a fiue yeeres silence had beene inioined: for Protestant
Authours are there cited, as confessing (but how truly we are
not heere to dispute) that some Fathers 400. yeeres after
Christ haue held some Romish positions: notwithstanding
the same Protestant Authours doe condemne those positions
as vtterly superstitious. In which allegations the Apologists
are contented to receiue from Protestants a confession of so
much antiquitie of some Romish Doctrine; and yet often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
doe not acknowledge or regard the iudgement of the
cited Authors in condemning such opinions. Will now <hi>P. R.</hi>
permit vs to answer these <hi>Apologists</hi> after his example, saying,

he did specially affect, confessing to him that he had greatly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

Religion, and say our Euangelists did recount foule things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him (as heere this Minister saith our Historiographer doth
of Pope Gregorie) and namely that he was accused of the Scribes
and Phariseis for casting out Diuels by the power of Belzebub,
for deceiuing the people, for moouing sedition, &amp;c. and the like
crimes, which our Euangelists doe recount indeed, but doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
them also as false and calumnious: were not this as good
a maner of reasoning as this of</hi> Tho. Mortons <hi>out of</hi> Lambertus
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:4721:70"/>
                     <hi>against Pope</hi> Hildebrand, <hi>who is by them so highly commended,
as you haue heard, and his aduersaries condemned?</hi> Thus <hi>P. R.
Thomas Morton</hi> will tell you that your <hi>maner of reasoning</hi> is
not so good. For suppose that <hi>T. M.</hi> in his reasoning had
beene guiltie of some errour, yet this your comparison cannot
be free from blasphemie; the consequence whereof is this:
It is like impietie in <hi>T. M.</hi> in citing the witnesse of <hi>Lambert,</hi>
concerning the opposition of the Bishops of <hi>Italie,</hi> which
<hi>Lambert</hi> condemned; and to giue more credit vnto them
condemning the Pope, than vnto <hi>Lambert</hi> condemning those
Bishops: As it is for a man reading the Gospell, where it is
recorded that the Scribes and Phariseis opposed themselues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Christ, to beleeue rather those Scribes and Phariseis,
condemning Christ, than to giue credit vnto the Euangelists,
condemning the Phariseis. Whosoeuer shall exactly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the Analogie of this comparison, must needs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it to be in a maner blasphemous. For either must Christ
the sonne of God be compared with Pope <hi>Gregorie,</hi> a sinfull
man, and (as some iudge) the man of sinne, as though it were
a like impudencie to say that <hi>Gregorie,</hi> a sinner, might no
more iustly be condemned of the <hi>Italian Bishops,</hi> than Christ,
who was righteousnesse it selfe, of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariseis,</hi>
which in the schoole of Christianitie must necessarily be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
a blasphemie. Or else the likenesse consisteth in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of the reporters, matching the holy <hi>Euangelists</hi> and
their <hi>Monks Frisingensis</hi> and <hi>Lambertus</hi> together, to thinke it
no lesse impietie not to beleeue rather these two <hi>Monks</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
the <hi>Italian Bishops</hi> (who they say were aduersaries to
the Pope) than those Bishops, though condemned by the
<hi>Monks;</hi> then it is not to beleeue rather the Euangelists con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariseis</hi> (who were enemies vnto
Christ) than the same <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariseis,</hi> though condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the Euangelists. But to compare in like beleefe the
holy Euangelists who were <hi>Calami Spiritus sancti</hi> (as <hi>S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
calleth them) that is, <hi>The pens of the holy Ghost,</hi> and could
not erre, and the reports of superstitious <hi>Monks,</hi> who, almost,
could not but erre, is an inference altogether impious.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:4721:71"/>
146 But if <hi>P. R.</hi> (as I hope hee will) wish his consequent to
be rather prooued ridiculous than so sacrilegious, then let him
vnderstand the dissimilitude and vnlikenesse of his compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
For first the iudgement of those Historiographers, <hi>Frisin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gensis</hi>
and <hi>Lambertus,</hi> two Monks, in condemning those <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Bishops</hi> is different from the iudgment of <hi>Sigebert</hi> a Monke,
of <hi>Vrspergensis</hi> an Abbat, of <hi>Benno</hi> a Cardinall: but the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall
Historiographers doe all of them fully consent toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
therefore hee not acknowledging the Euangelists con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
of the Scribes and Pharisies, and that <hi>Lambertus</hi>
his condemnation of the Italian Bishops, are nothing alike.</p>
                  <p>Secondly the Pharisies were of different profession vnto
the Euangelists, the Italian Bishops were of the same religion
with the obiected Historians: therefore to credit the Pharisies
against the Euangelists, and to credit Bishops against Monks,
cannot bee proportionable, But why doe I trouble my selfe
