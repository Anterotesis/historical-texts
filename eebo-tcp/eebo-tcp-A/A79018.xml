            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>¶ A <hi>Proclamation</hi> forbidding all the Tenants or Debtors of ſuch who are in actuall and open Rebellion, or who adhere to, or aſsiſt the Rebells, to pay any Rents or Debts to ſuch Perſons or any of them.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEREAS We have, by Our ſeverall Proclamations, bearing Date the <hi>Eight</hi> Day of <hi>March</hi> laſt and the <hi>Seventh</hi> Day of <hi>Aprill</hi> laſt, publiſhed Our Reſolution to grant out Our Commiſsions for the ſeizing of the Goods, and Sequeſtring the Eſtates of all ſuch Perſons who are in Rebellion or do aſſiſt thoſe who are, to the intent that ſuch their Goods, and Rents, may be ſafely depoſited untill ſuch Time as the Offenders can be brought to a Legall Triall, which ſhall ſpeedily proceed againſt them as ſoone as they can be apprehended, and delivered into the hands of Iuſtice. And We did therefore command all Perſons who were any wayes indebted unto, and all the ſeverall Tenants of all ſuch Perſons, to forbeare to pay any Rents, or Debts due to the ſaid ſeverall Perſon but to detaine the ſame in their hands towards the maintenance of the Peace of the ſeverall Counties, and the Reparation of ſuch men who have ſuffered by the violence of the Rebells. Since which time hath pleaſed God ſo farre, and ſo eminently to bleſſe Our Armies, that We have again reduced ſeverall Counties to Our Obedience, which were for the greateſt part, if not totally, poſſeſſed by the Rebells; And conſidering therefore that it very probable Our ſaid Proclamations were kept from the knowledge of Our good Subjects of thoſe Counties, We have once more thought fit to publiſh the ſame, and do hereby Declare to all Our loving Subjects whatſoever, that as We have already iſſued out ſuch Our Commiſſions into ſeverall Counties, in which We give Authority to the Perſons truſte by Us to diſtinguiſh between thoſe who have been active and malitious Contrivers of this <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and thoſe who have been through Weakneſſe or Feare ſeduced by them; So We will dayly iſſue out other Commiſſions to the ſame Purpoſe. And We doe ſtraitly charge and command all Our loving Subjects of what Condition ſoever, as they will anſwer their Diſobedience at their utmoſt Perills, That they pay no Rents or Debts which now are, or hereafter ſhall grow due to any Perſons who either are, or lately have been in Rebellion, (and have not ſince ſubmitted themſelvs to Us) or to any ſuch who adhere to, or aſſiſt thoſe who are in <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and that they preſume not to receive any Good Money or Stock in truſt for any ſuch Perſons, but that they faithfully accompt, and pay the ſame to ſuch Perſons as either are, or ſhall be intruſted by Us for that Purpoſe, and We ſhall proceed againſt all ſuch Perſons who ſhall wilfully, and peremptorily diſobey Us herein, as againſt Perſons notoriouſly diſaffected to Us and Our Service. And Our Pleaſure is That this Our Proclamation be read in all Churches and Chappells throughout this Our Kingdom.</p>
