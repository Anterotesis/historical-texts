            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The proteſtation and profeſſion of thirteen Popiſh Prieſts, exhibited to Queen <hi>Elizabeth, F. M.</hi> at that time excommunicated, and ſententially depoſed by <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> of her Regal Power</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas it hath pleaſed our moſt gracious Queen (as it appeareth by the late Proclamation) in ſome meaſure to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the fidelitie of us the ſecular Prieſts, native Subjects of her Majeſty: And ſeeing ſhe according to her Princely clemency, hath given an ample earneſt of her favour, and ſome mercy towards us (being all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject by the Laws of this Realm to death, by our return into the Countrey, after our taking the order of Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood ſince the firſt year of her Majeſties Reign) and ſeeing alſo, ſhe being content with the ſincere profeſſion of our Allegiance only which might render her ſecure of our Loyaltie toward her Royal Perſon, Crown, State and Dignitie, requires nothing further. We whoſe Names are under written, being moſt humbly proſtrate at her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties feet, acknowledging our ſelves moſt ſtrongly obliged to her Highneſſe for theſe ſo great favours, are moſt willingly ready to give her Majeſtie in this matter, ſuch fealty, and ſatisfaction, as any Catholick Prieſts can, or ought to give to their Princes.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore we acknowledge and confeſs, that the Majeſtie of our moſt gracious Queen, doth Reign with no leſſe full authoritie and ſuperioritie over us, and the reſt of the Subjects of her Kingdome, then anie of her Anceſtours at anie time ever did. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, we profeſſe that we are willingly readie to obey her commands in all caſes and conditions, ſo far as at anie time, ever anie Chriſtian Prieſts, either in this Kingdome, or anie other Chriſtian Kingdome, are bound by the Divine Law, and Chriſtian Religion, to obey their temporall Prince, as to pay tribute, and all other cuſtomes of the Crown, and to be obedient to her Laws and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates in all civil cauſes; and pray to God, that according to his ſacred will, ſhe may obtein a happy and quiet Reign in this life, and after this life, eternal bliſſe. And this our acknowledgement we conceive to be ſo ſolidly grounded upon the divine word, that noe authoritie nor cauſe, nor pretence of cauſe, can or ought to give us anie juſt and lawfull diſpenſation, more then to anie Proteſtant whatſoever, whereby we ſhould detract our obedience to her Majeſtie in any civil or temporal affairs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſeeing in theſe laſt years there have been manie conſpiracies contrived againſt the Perſon &amp; State of her Majeſtie, &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile enterpriſes undertaken for the invading her Majeſties Dominions, under certain new pretences, &amp; counſells of reſtoring the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Religion by Arms (a thing attempted in other parts of the world againſt her Majeſtie and her Kingdomes, chiefly and ſolely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond anie other, who receeded no leſſe then ſhe, from the Religion of the Apoſtolick See) by which violent endeavours her Majeſtie, otherwiſe of a ſingular clemencie towards her Subjects, might be highly moved to make more ſharp Laws, and to take care to have them executed againſt the Catholicks (who being joined to the See Apoſtolick in matters of Faith and Religion, might eaſily be ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to favour theſe conſpiracies and invaſions) then perhaps, unleſſe theſe acts of hoſtilitie and war had intervened, would ever have been made, or thought upon. We therefore, that we may (even in this particular cauſe) approve our Loyaltie to her Majeſtie, doe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely profeſſe, and by this publick act make known to the whole Chriſtian world, that we in theſe caſes of conſpiracies and machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations againſt her Majeſties life, invaſions, and whatſoever hoſtile attempts, which be made by any forreign Prelate, Prince or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate whatſoever, either jointly, or ſeverally to the perturbation or diſtruction of her Majeſties Perſon, State, Kingdome or Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, under any colour, ſhew, pretence, or deſign of reſtoring the Catholick Religion in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſhall be ready to defend her Majeſties Perſon, State, Kingdomes and Dominions, from all ſuch horrible and violent incurſions, and injuries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And moreover, to detect, and lay open all conſpiracies, plots, which we ſhall underſtand to be undertaken by any Prelate, Prince, or Potentate what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, againſt her Majeſties Perſon or Dominions, for what cauſe ſoever, as was ſaid before; and alſo to our uttermoſt power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt them, and earneſtly perſwade all Catholicks (as much as in us lie) to doe the ſame.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if after any ſentence of Excommunication declared, or to be declared againſt her Majeſtie, or before anie ſuch conſpiracies, invaſions, or horrible attempts, as above, to be made, even the Pope ſhould excommunicate all born within her Majeſties Dominions, that ſhould not receed from the defence of her Majeſtie and her Dominions, and join to the partie of the conſpiratours and invadours, in theſe and the like caſes: We in theſe and all ſuch caſes, doe by no means eſteem our ſelves or the Lay-Catholicks, to be any ways bound by the law of conſcience to obey this, or anie the like cenſures: But notwithſtanding any authority, and whatſoever ſentence of excommunication denounced or to be denounced (as above) will defend our Prince and Countrie, which we think to be our dutie, and yield in temporall cauſes all obedience to her Majeſtie.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, but becauſe it is moſt certain, while we thus endeavour by our Chriſtian and ſincere proteſtation to approve our pious affection and Loyaltie to her Majeſtie, there will not be wanting many who would condemn this our lawfull Act, and interpret it to the worſt ſenſe; and moreover traduce this act of ours with unjuſt cenſures and calumnies to the Chriſtian world, and eſpecially to his Holineſſe, to the great prejudice and hurt of our credits and perſons, unleſſe we ſhould timely prevent their endeavours, we hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſeech her Majeſtie, that as in this our recognition, while we render unto her Highneſſe the things which are <hi>Caeſars,</hi> by her gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious conceſſion it may alſo be lawfull for us, for the avoiding of malevolent ſcandals, by the like publick act openly teſtifie, that we by acknowledging of our obedience to her Majeſty, receed from no law of Chriſtian duty, which we owe to the ſupream Paſtour.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, wherefore we acknowledge &amp; confeſs, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> in that See, is Succeſſour to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp; that he hath not leſs, yet not more ample authority or juriſdiction over us and the reſt of the Chriſtians then that Apoſtle had by the conceſſion &amp; command of our Saviour Chriſt. And that we will be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>obedient to his Holineſſe, as far as we are bound by the Divine Law, which we doubt not may rightly ſtand with our Allegiance which we have profeſſed to our temporal Prince; for as we are moſt ready to pour forth our bloud for the defence of her Majeſty and our Countrey, ſo we are reſolved to part with our life, rather then violate the lawfull au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Catholick Church of Chriſt.</p>
