            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS I was pondering in my Mind of the Work and Wonders of the Lord, and of his great Power and Might, my Spirit was bowed, and my Heart was broken and tendered within me, and I ſaid in my ſelf, <hi>Are the People ſo Blind! Are they all ſo Dark and Ignorant and void of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, that they cannot be awakened, to ſee and behold the Works and Wonders of the Lord! Or do they ſee, and are they not Affected therewith, nor Humbled therefore, nor Afflicted thereunder, as my Spirit hath been this Day:</hi> Conſidering how that the Lord doth ſeem, in divers places, to take away the Fruits and Encreaſe of the Earth; even the ſtaff of Bread, in ſome meaſure, the good and benefit thereof, by the continued Rain, and unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Weather in the time of Corn-harveſt, and gathering in of the Fruits <hi>and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the Year,</hi> giving us to ſee with our Eyes, and not to taſte thereof, and how juſtly may he ſend want and ſcarcity, and cleanneſs of Teeth, inſtead of plenty and fulneſs, becauſe of the Waſte, Exceſs, and Abuſe of his good Creatures, both by Rich and Poor. For how have the Rich and Full waſted and deſtroyed them, in Eating and Drinking Exceſſively; and, through the ill uſe of ſtrong Drink, often abuſe both themſelves and others alſo. And what Unthankfulneſs and Ingratitude hath been in many of the Poor unto God, for his Mercies and Bleſſings beſtowed upon them? And what Pride and High-mindedneſs hath abounded in many places, ſeeking to Exceed and Excel one another therein; as if this were their Crown and Glory, ſetting up their Head-attires at ſuch a height, as hath not been underſtood from former Ages, nor known in a great part of this Age, in the Country in which we Live? And may we not truly ſay, See and behold the Crown of Pride, exalted in a great Meaſure, above what heretofore, ſo that the next Generation can ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exceed this, as theſe have done them that were before them; and what Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Vanity, Laughter and Unſeaſonable and Unprofitable Diſcourſe is uſed and practiſed amongſt Men, reputed Wiſe in the World, and how common are Idle Words, and Evil Communication amongſt the moſt of People, and what frequent and cuſtomary taking God's Holy Name in vain, without all fear or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence; the ſeeing thereof many time is a grief and trouble to tender Conſciences. Oh! That People would be wiſe to conſider their latter End, and the ſhortneſs and uncertainty of their time here, and mind and conſider the Afflicting Hand of God upon ſome, and his ſevere Judgments upon others; and for that ſeveral are taken away by ſhort and ſudden Death, as in a moment, in the twinkling of an Eye; how ſhould theſe things move and provoke People to fear and dread the Lord that made them, and continually ſtand in awe of him; for none of theſe things come to paſs without him, either in doing of them, or in ſuffering them to be done, and that in Judgment or in Mercy; in Judgment to the Wicked and Rebellious that do not Repent and forſake their Evil ways and doings; but in Mercy unto his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and People that Love, Fear, and Serve him in Sincerity, and with an upright Heart. O that People would be awakened, and not ſpend their precious Time in Pride, Vanity, and Lightneſs, in Joaking and Jeſting, without Fear and without Underſtanding; Seeing <hi>the Fear of the Lord is the beginning of Wiſdom, and a good <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding have all they that depart from Evil,</hi> Job 28. and 28. which that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny may ſo do, is the all-deſire of him, who is,</p>
