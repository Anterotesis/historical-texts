         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

concerning
DOVBLE WRITING,
by the Inventor thereof,</head>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Shal not enlarge upon the praiſes of double
writing, for every man beſt knoweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
what uſe he can make of it, leaſt I
thereby ſeem to praiſe my ſelfe, arrogating
indeed what I doe not deſerve. For to ſpeak truth, the
manifold, univerſall, and perpetuall uſes of it to the
Common-wealth, did not at firſt put me upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne,
but the fair hint of the poſſibility of ſuch a thing,
which God unexpectedly put into my minde, co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
with an affection that I have to doe ſomwhat
new and uſefull (though by never ſo ſlight means) and
withall hopes to mend mine own fortunes by benefit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all, rather then prejudicing any, encouraged me to
take pains (although by the ſimplicity of the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
it doth not appear) about the invention. On the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:116410:3"/>
contrary, I confeſſe, that I rather deſerve to be blamed
of dulneſſe, that it hath coſt me any pains at all, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
ſo ſimple and plain things as my Inſtruments are,
and I hope when it ſhall be diſcovered to better heads
to be ſoon made aſhamed by their improvements, that
I have done no more unto them. So that according to
the nature of the thing, I have more reaſon to expect
profit then praiſe for my reward, and perhaps ſome
men have been too apt to believe me herein, thinking
that my procuring a Patent, and deferring the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
doe argue an ambition in me, not only of vaſt but
unreaſonable deſires.</p>
            <p>But I hope to make ſuch men underſtand, that neither
by procuring the Patent, retarding the diſcovery, the
price which I have ſet on it, nor by any other proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I have expreſſed my deſires to be unreaſonable, no
more then the ſatisfaction of them is like to be vaſt.</p>
            <p>For firſt, I had ſcarce any other courſe to take then
to procure a Patent of Priviledge according to the
Laws: For ſhould I have given it away for nothing?
the thing (as many others are) would have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
as of no uſe, becauſe of no price, and I my ſelf
ſhould have been as much jeer'd for my prodigality, as
thanked for my induſtry.</p>
            <p>Should I have petitioned the State for a reward, that
courſe would have diſparaged the buſineſſe, for if it be
of the uſe pretended, it is able to reward it ſelfe, and
why ſhould one petition to give away a benefit? But
beſides all this, their engagements paſt, and imminent
uſe of money (as I was enformed) would have made my
requeſt unſeaſonable.</p>
            <p>Should I have addreſſed my ſelfe to any one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:116410:3"/>
in the City, it is to be feared that after much ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation,
I ſhould have been at laſt anſwered, That ſince
it concerned all Companies as much as any one, unleſs
all would joyn, one would do nothing, and to make all
of them ſo to joyn, was a work beyond my power and
patience.</p>
            <p>As for particular men, I found them generally to
profeſſe a willingneſſe to contribute, but many were
unwilling that others ſhould have the ſame benefit
with them for nothing: beſides, it was impoſſible for
me to bring any conſiderable number of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</p>
            <p>I propounded to ſome freinds, to move the State to
lay an additionall taxe upon writing paper, though
never ſo ſmall, and to employ the ſame towards the
advancement of Arts, ſomwhat (if they thought fit)
according to my printed draught thereof, allowing me
in particular ſome ſmall part of thoſe profits, not only
as a reward of mineinvention, but as an engagement to
labour in the deſigne of promoting Arts. But this
propoſition (being thought too ſubject to debates in
the Houſes, and to croſſe too much the nature of the
times, when men complain enough already of impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions)
was waved, although, could it have been pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued,
it had been the moſt proper and juſt of all other.
For certainly, according to the uſe and expence of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
the uſe of this invention might beſt be meaſured,
and conſequently rewarded, and if men paid a farthing
extraordinary in two of three quires of paper, for the
accommodation of ſuch an Art, and for the carrying on
of publike, profitable, and honourable deſignes, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it had been no crying oppreſſion, ſo that all theſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:116410:4"/>
ſeverall projections being full of impediments, I was
forced upon this more common and legall way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
a Patent of priviledge for 14 years.</p>
            <p>The reaſons why I yet defer the publication of the
ſecret, having obteined a grant from the State of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
are: 1 To obtein Priviledges alſo from ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Neighbouring States.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 Becauſe it is unjuſt that the burthen of rewarding
an univerſall good ſhould lie upon the place only where
it was brought forth.</item>
               <item>2 To make the contributions of each particular man
leſſe conſiderable.</item>
               <item>3 That I might be relieved from other places in caſe
the troubles ſhould renew in <hi>England</hi> (which God
avert) ſo as to break my deſigne here.</item>
               <item>4 That I might improve this bleſſing and Talent of
God to the beſt advantage poſſible, thereby to effect
other things tending to his glory, and the good of the
world: being ſtill reſolved not to fail of my expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
(that is to ſay) never to account upon any thing
but what I ſhall from time to time ſee.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Secondly, Becauſe I had ſome other contrivances
ſtanding upon the ſame principles with this, which upon
the diſcovery of this would have been diſcovered alſo.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Becauſe I would take away all occaſions
which men might have to incur the danger of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
allowed by the Parliament by hindring them ſo
to doe, at leaſt untill I could ſo provide for my ſelfe,
as that I need not to be extreamly rigorous againſt any,
but ſuch as ſhall contumeliouſly affront the Authority
of my grant.</p>
            <p>And this later conſideration (namely the avoyding
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:116410:4"/>
of all ſuits and vexations from the which clamour and
trouble muſt neceſſarily reflect upon my ſelfe) is one
of the grounds why I accept of this ſmall ſumme of
five ſhillings preſent payment, and another is, becauſe
it may happen (though againſt my wiſhes and intereſt)
that the diſcovery may not be made untill about 11
moneths hence, although, if any reaſonable number
ſhall appear, it may be done within leſſe then three.
For it can be no diſadvantage to me to make all conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
haſte ſince after diſcovery I am no longer obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to accept the ſmall rate propounded. A third rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for the ſame is to prevent all grudgings ſuſpition
of injury, picking needleſſe quarrels, and proſecuting
frivolous faults againſt the invention it ſelfe (whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the exacting of a full (though juſt) price may move
captious ſpirits, ſpecially at firſt, til they have found the
goodneſs of their bargain) for in as much as it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to foretell or divine what each man will approve
of or diſlike, ſeeing by daily experience, that all things
(even the beſt) are diverſly received and accepted by
diverſe men, ſo that there are never or rarely any which
all men doe like in all points, and that in the higheſt
degree, wee may not expect ſuch perfections in this
buſineſſe. Onely we preſume that thoſe who ſhall be
moſt froward and exceptious againſt the invention, and
ſhall have leaſt need of it, cannot thinke five ſhillings
ill beſtowed on ſo rare an attempt. For if a man can in
a ſmall time learn for to write as faſt and as fair by this
double, as by the uſuall way, all men allow that it may
in the 14 years (which is the tearm of my priviledge)
ſave ſome hundreds of pounds to ſome men, and excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
more then five ſhillings to any man. Now as to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:116410:5"/>
the matter of faſtneſſe and diſpatch, I ſay, that about
20 perſons of ſuch credit, worth, and judgement (moſt
of them ſtrangers to me) have ſo impartially atteſted
how I have written by the help of this art, double to
other ſwift and expedite writers, that the great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of this Kingdom have acquieſſed in their Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates.
As for the fairneſſe, many hundreds in this City
and elſewhere have ſeen the fairneſſe of my writings
made by it, in compariſon with what I can do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
and all men <hi>(nemine contradicente)</hi> reſt ſatisfied
in its ſufficiencie.</p>
            <p>Having thus cleered theſe two points by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the ſenſes, it remaineth to conſider whether any
man may practice this Art according to my propoſals,
to which, all that I can poſſibly ſay is, that I did it my
ſelfe at the very firſt ſight and handling of the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
having never the reputation of more then an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
dexterity of hand, common to all men that are
familiar with the pen; ſo that if a man ſhould not doe
according to my ſaid propoſitions, I ſhould more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
then I can now diffide. And I believe that I might
have ſet a longer time for the learning of this Art, but
ſhould I have done it, men may take juſt diſtaſte at me,
for undervaluing their abilities ſo far, as not to thinke
them able to attain in an houres ſerious endeavour,
what I my ſelfe did at the firſt aſſay. But ſuppoſe, that
ſome men could not doe according to theſe propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
certainly thoſe are moſt likely to fail, who are
leaſt uſed and able to write, and conſequently ſuch as
have leaſt need of the invention.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe none could do it within the time allotted, but
ſhould either write not ſo fair, or not ſo faſt, or neither
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:116410:5"/>
ſo fair nor ſo faſt. Firſt, though not ſo fair, the inconvenience
is no more eſſentiall to a mans buſineſſe, then to write a few
dayes longer with a bad pen, or other unfit tools. Secondly,
though not ſo faſt; nay, but with halfe the promiſed advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
ſtill I ſay that in much writing the advantage would be
great. Laſtly, though neither ſo faſt nor ſo fair, I affirm, that
yet the defects cannot be ſo great as to weigh down the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
even then, beſides that thoſe defects may be
made up with a little longer times practice. Suppoſe, again, that
a very long time were requiſitie to reduce the hand to the ſame
quickneſſe and faſtneſſe in this as in the common way, yet chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
might be conveniently brought up to it, and others may
better ſwallow this difficulty then that of Short writing and
the like.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, ſuppoſe that it was for ever impoſſible. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
it cannot be ſuppoſed but that a man who can write other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
very fair, may write by this Inſtrument as fair as is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to any buſineſſe whatſoever. And if there be any writing
which requireth a greater beauty then the Inſtrument is able
to afford, yet they are very few, and perhaps ſuch as need no
copying at all, now to write ſuch things by the common way,
will be neither a great nor frequent labour, as for ſwiftneſſe it
can never come behinde the ordinary way, eſpecially if a little
of the fairneſſe be diſpenced withall, and very little otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Now if all theſe conceits were any more then meer ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,
yet there will be ſtill found conveniences in this Art
above what are in the common way, to repair its inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
namely, the likeneſſe of the copies, whereby the labour
of examination (no ſmall matter in many caſes) is ſaved; and
the danger of falſification either prevented or diſcovered. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
many impediments may be leſtned by the alteration of
many indifferent circumſtances, about writing-books and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
now uſuall, as to write in books that open well and eaſily,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:116410:6"/>
rather in thoſe whoſe backs are ſtubborn and ſtiff bound, to
write in folio rather then in ſmaller folds, in ſingle paper ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then in much doubled and boyſterous, with all which
particulars this Art will ſufficiently conſiſt to practiſers nor
monſtrouſly unhandy.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, other ingenious men may, and certainly will ſoon
mend any thing that ſhall be found amiſſe, as to any mans par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
uſe, for mine own part I ſhall never be wanting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
and could at preſent alter the inſtrument in ſeverall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
did I not fear that in making them more fit for one
mans uſe, they would be leſſe fit for anothers; But if any man
ſhall conſiderately better the buſineſſe, I ſhall be willing to
gratifie him proportionably, to what I my ſelfe ſhall gain by
it, and that by ſuch a reaſonable way as I ſhall hereafter more
particularly propound.</p>
            <p>We come to explain our ſelves in ſome other Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
firſt, concerning the manner of diſcovering the Art, when
the time ſhall come; which ſhall be this: <hi>viz.</hi> I will ſome ſpace
before hand appoint a convenient place where all contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
ſhall receive a printed paper, at large deſcribing both by
words and figures, the fabrike, uſe and application of all and
each part of the Inſtrument, and ſuch as have paid for Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſhall there receive them, and there will I alſo give a
weeks conſtant attendance to reſolve all difficulties ariſing to
the leſſe nimble apprehenſions in the practice of the Art.</p>
            <p>Now, as for ſecurity, that it ſhall be ſo diſcovered according
to promiſe, I have taken care, That (in caſe of ſudden death,
or any like accident which may befall me) all impediments
thereof may be removed, by depoſiting in the hands of truſty
and able freinds an Inſtrument exactly fitted, with a punctuall
and clear deſcription of the uſes and applications thereof. Or
if any very ſcrupulous perſon ſhall happen to dream of any
ground of ſuſpition, why I ſhould of purpoſe not diſcover
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:116410:6"/>
it, or can imagine, where and how I can protect my ſelfe from
the diſcredit, the loſſe of all future fruits of my Priviledge, and
the ſuits of every contributer againſt me (which muſt attend
ſo unworthy a piece of folly) he ſhall have ſecurity for his
five ſhillings in that behalfe.</p>
            <p>As for the price of the Inſtruments (which men that deſire
to have them, are to depoſite above the five ſhillings) it is two
ſhillings ſix pence, namely, for thoſe which I conceive to be
of moſt generall and common uſe, which if I can between
this and the time of diſcovery, better and improve, it ſhall be
done at mine own charges, although they ſhould grow dearer
thereby, ſo as (if they become cheaper by my improvement)
to man will think himſelfe wronged if I make no retribution
out of the ſaid price.</p>
            <p>As for the Inſtruments of multiple writing, I would not
have them expected, becauſe their uſe is not generally need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and incomparably more hard then of thoſe for double
onely: Wherefore I have thought it rather fit to reſerve them
for the peculiar uſe of ſome, who for want of better employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
may make a trade of that practice.</p>
            <p>To conclude all, I ſhall be aſhamed of my judgement rather
then my honeſty, if (at the worſt) the diſcovery of a thing ſo
rare, unheard of, thought by many at firſt hearing to be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
ſo neceſſary, and almoſt of hourely uſe to moſt men in
the whole world, as well to thoſe that live in this preſent age,
as to thoſe that ſhall ever live after us, with 14 years licence to
reap the benefit of the ſame, be not well worth five ſhillings,
In all which time if it may ſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ve the writing of ten ſheets onely,
the Contributers can be no loſers by the bargain. For mine
own part, I do not doubt but that thouſands will receive in
that time a thouſand fold profit for their adventure, and have
great cauſe to thank God that he hath given gifts unto men.</p>
