            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Reader, it was the least of
my thoughts to publish this
Sermon in print, but that now
I am forced partly by the solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation
of my friends, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the slanderous speeches of
some new upstart Sectaries in this Towne,
whose unreverent gesture in the Church, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esteeme
of Church prayers, and disgracefull
speeches against the outward splendour of
Gods house, gave mee occasion to Preach it;
and now their ignorant and malicious cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
thereof have necessitated me to publish
it, One calls it a pernicious Sermon, another
sayes it was fit to be preached at <hi>Rome,</hi> a third,
that it is false doctrine. I have preached many
hundred Sermons in this Towne, I have spent
<pb facs="tcp:65120:3"/>
twenty five yeares in this peaceable and well
governed Corporation, I have studied Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
these thirty sixe yeares, and till now I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
knew that I delivered erroneous doctrine;
but perhaps I may bee blind in my owne
cause, therefore I have exposed this Sermon
to the publicke view, that if there be any pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
in it heterodox, I may (being convinced
by the judicious and learned Reader) recant
and retract, if there bee none, that my credit
may be vindicated from the censorious cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of such ignorant criticks.</p>

for prayer it was built and consecrated, from
prayer it is denominated, and our prayers in it are

he would heare from his dwelling place in heaven, and

<hi>But,</hi> &amp;c. this <hi>But,</hi> is the flye that spoyles the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries
oyntment, and the Colloquintida that marres
the pottage. <hi>You,</hi> that is, covetous Priests, captious
Scribes, and hypocriticall Pharisees, who indeed are
painted sepulchers, whited walls, whose religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65120:4"/>
in large Phylacteries, broad fringes, long prayers,
which devoure Widowes houses, the outside of whose
vessels are pure and washed, within full of filth and
corruption, under sheepes skins are ravenous wolves;
But <hi>fromi nulla fides,</hi> trust not outsides, all is not gold
that glisters. Malice, pride, selfe-conceipts are never
more dangerous, then when shrowded with Pharisai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
puritie. These were called in Greeke <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in
Hebrew <hi>Paratzim,</hi> that is Separatists, for other men
they counted prophane, <hi>Gam haerets,</hi> people of the
earth, but themselves the onely holy men in the Land.
With others they would not converse for feare of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement;
therefore the proud Pharisee thanked God,
that hee was not as other men, nor like that Publican,
who notwithstanding went home justified: It is easily
seene of what religion these Pharisees were, and their
avaritious Priests, they made no more reckoning of
the Temple, then of a stable, a sheepfold, a pigeon
house, a counting roome, for else what did oxen and
sheepe, pigeons and money changers doe there? what
is that house built for men, or for beasts? for <hi>Iehovah,</hi>
or for <hi>Mercurie?</hi> Thus you see the qualitie of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
reproved. But what have they done that they must
be lashed? they have not pulled downe the Temple
and burned it, as the Chaldeans did: nor have they
robbed it of its treasures, as <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Crassus</hi> did?
Nor have they so grosly prophaned it as <hi>Antiochus</hi>
and <hi>Caligula</hi> did: nor have they carried away the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims,
the Arke and propitiatorie, the golden Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlesticks,
the Altars, and lavers, nor any other orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and utensils of it, as some furious Pharisees of
this age have done in some places, where they have pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
downe Chancels, defaced Cathedrals, sold away
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65120:5"/>
Organs, Bells, Challices, and the very lead of the
Churches, giving them a warmer cover of thatch, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
them as that prophane Emperour used <hi>Iupiters</hi>
and <hi>Aesculapius</hi> images, from the one pulling away his
golden beard, saying, the gods must alwayes looke
young, and from the other his golden cloake, affirming
that a frize coat would keepe him warmer. Surely the
Jewish Pharisees did not goe so fa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re in this impiety,
therefore they were onely whipped with cords; But
those Christian Pharisees that have layd violent hands
upon the houses of God, have beene partly in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and partly in their posteritie whipped with Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions.
Now though the <hi>Iewes</hi> did not pull downe nor
carry away, yet they did prophane that holy place, by
making it a den of theeves. Was not now <hi>Bethel</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>Bethaven,</hi> the house of God, the house of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie?
Dens and Caves sometimes have beene Mansion
places for good men; <hi>David, Daniel, Elijah,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
in <hi>Achabs</hi> dayes, and many more of whom the
world was not worthy, dwelt in dens and caves of the
earth; But the Temple is not made a den for such men,
but for theeves, and the worst sort of theeves, not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
secret theeves, but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> open robbers, robbing God
of his honour, the people of their money, and the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of its holinesse. But I have held you too long in the
outward portch, let us now enter into the Temple, and
view first the use, secondly the abuse of it. As it is a
house of prayer, that's the use, but as it is a den of
theeves, that is the abuse of it. In handling the Vse,
consider first the generall name, <hi>an house;</hi> 2. the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
name, <hi>a Temple;</hi> 3. The possessor, <hi>God.</hi> 4. The end,
<hi>Prayer.</hi> In handling of which, I desire not onely your
patience, but also your charitable constructions, for let

the flowers be never so wholsome, yet Spiders will
sucke thence nothing but poyson, and some are so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitably
and superciliously censorlous, that what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisheth
not in the palat is accounted erroneous, but
these are of the ignoranter sort, therefore the lesse to
be regarded, for ignorance will still bee an enemie to
knowledge.</p>
            <p>1. A house to distinguish it from the Tabernacle
which properly was a moving Tent or Pavillion, but
no house. 2. A house in respect of habitation, for the

contained the shadows of good things to come: Much
more holy are our Churches, in which wee injoy the

divinitie to account your houses as holy as the Church,

<hi>P.</hi> Martyr, a learned and reverend member of the

idle talking, bargaining, or irreverent gesture in the
Church, and reproves those Ministers that keepe not
fast the Church doores, when there is no divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:
As there is a time, so there is a place for every
thing. Againe, in Hebrew the Temple is called <hi>Heikell,</hi>
from <hi>Iakell</hi> to prevaile. For the Church is <hi>Palaestra</hi> a
wrestling place, when we wrestle here with God by
prayer we prevaile with him, when he wrestles with us
by his Word, then he prevailes with us.</p>
            <p>3. Consider the possessour or owner of this house,
<hi>God,</hi> in the pronoune <hi>my,</hi> it is his by the right of donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> bestowed this house on God,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65120:6"/>
they could not without sacriledge take it againe from
God. Our religious sorefathers bestowed our Churches
on Christ, and I hope their Children will not prove so
degenerate and irreligious, as to take them away from
Christ, except they will doe as <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> and
then they shall be rewarded as they were. 2. His house
by the right of dedication, it was dedicated to God
thrice; 1. By <hi>Solomon</hi> the 10. of <hi>September,</hi> the Sun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the autumne Equinoctiall. 2. When it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>built
after the captivitie in the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> the
Sun being in the vernall Equinoctiall. 3. When it was
prophaned by <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes.</hi> Then <hi>Iud. Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baeus</hi>
dedicated it againe about the 25. of <hi>Decemb.</hi> the
Sun being in the Winter solsticie, the feast of which
dedication was honoured by Christs owne presence,<note place="margin">Iohn 10.</note>
and as the Temple, so our Churches are dedicated too.
That is, appropriated, consecrated, and sanctified by
prayer, and invocation of Gods name, so that what is
sanctified is his and must not be prophaned. 3. Jt is his
house in respect of the manifestation of his presence
more then, then else-where, for not onely was he seene
thus in shadows and representarions, but his voyce was
heard also from off the Mercy seat,<note place="margin">Numb 7. 89.</note> that was upon the
Arke of the testimony from betweene the two Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims.
Even so Christs voyce is more heard, and his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
more seene in the Word and Sacraments within
our Churches then any where else. Where should the
King be more seene and heard then in his owne house?
4. It's his house by inhabitation, for though all our
houses be his because the earth is the Lords, and all
that therein is, yet this house is more specially his; for
though he dwells every where in his generall provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
yet here he dwels more particularly in his spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
favours; therefore we may say of our Churches,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65120:7"/>
what <hi>Iacob</hi> sayd of <hi>Bethel</hi> his Church then: the Lord is
here and wee knew it not. How terrible is this place?
this can be no other then the house of God, &amp;c. the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
in Hebrew was <hi>Hammisken,</hi> a dwelling place,
and in Greeke, a Church is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
because God dwels in it. Therefore
<hi>Nathan</hi> from God tells <hi>David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>am 7 5.</note> that he shall build him
an house to dwell in, for before God had no setled
aboad, nor did dwell in any house from the time he
brought the childrein of <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
in a tent. Againe, if the Church be his house, wee
must not be so base minded, as to thinke a barne or sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
good enough for him; Barnes and stables are for
threshers and hostlers, not for him whom the heaven
of heavens cannot containe. The high and loftie one
that inhabiteth Eternitie, ought to be fitted with a
house in some sort, answerable to the greatnesse of his
M<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iestie;<note place="margin">Chron.</note> Of this mind was <hi>Solomon,</hi> when he sayd, the
house which I build is great, for great is our God
aboue all Gods, except it be in persecution and cases of
necessity, for then we must serve God, where we can, even
in <hi>cryptis</hi> subterraneall caves with the primitive Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:
but in the times of peace and plentie, our Churches
should be <hi>Basilicae,</hi> as they were called antiently, kingly
places, set for the King of Kings to dwell in, and they
shoulde be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as they were wont to be called,
that is comelie and decent places, both in respect of
the structure without, and of the behaviour of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
within. I need not tell you, that parents
expect from their children, masters from their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
Kings from their Subjects a reverent and decent
behaviour; and is not the Lord of this house a Father,
a master, a King, and we his children, servants, subjects?
If then hee be our Lord, where is his reverence? if our
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65120:7"/>
Father, where is his feare? The Lord will have his Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths
hallowed, and his Sanctuarie reverenced, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.
30. <hi>For,</hi> saith he, <hi>I am the Lord,</hi> and this is the Lords
house; called therefore of old <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; for hee hath
some things peculiar to himselfe, as his owne Day, his
owne Feast, his owne Table, his owne People, his owne
House. So then there is the Lords day, the Lords table
the Lords Supper, the Lords people, and the Lords
house. Shall then the Lords people in the Lords house,
when the Lord speakes to them in his Word, or they
to him in their prayers, or when he appeares to them in
in his holy Sacraments, behave themselves irreverently,
unmannerly, vndecently, in his presence, and that under
pretence of avoyding superstition? <hi>Dum vitant stulti vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,
&amp;c.</hi> This is to run from one extreame to a worse, <hi>ex
funio in flammam.</hi> And as you say, out of the frying pan
into the fire. Religion indeed is crucified, as Christ was
between two theeves, <hi>viz.</hi> Superstition and irreverence,
which is a spice of Atheisme; and truly of the two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames.
irreverence is the worst; for superstition is like
the Gyant of <hi>Gath,</hi> with six fingers and sixe toes on each
hand and foot, having more then is required; But Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
without reverence and outward decencie, is like <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donibezec,</hi>
without fingers and toes, peccant in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
which is worse then in the excesse. In the purest
times of the primitive Church, there were <hi>Ostiarij</hi>
doore-keepers, to debarre from entring the Church ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate
Hereticks, Idolaters, prophane livers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, seeing the Church is the house of our Father,
we should delight to be often in it. <hi>David</hi> was glad
when they said to him, we will goe up unto the house of
the Lord. He envies the happinesse of the swallow and
sparrow, that make their nests in the Lords altars; hee
had rather be a doore-keeper in the Lords house, then to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65120:8"/>
dwell in the tents of Kedar. One thing, saith he, have I
desired of the Lord, that I may dwell in the house of the
Lord, all the dayes of my life, to behold the faire beauty
of the Lord, and to visit his holy Temple. See what ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
he gives to the Temple, faire, beauty, holinesse, and
sometimes the beauty of holinesse. Indeed holinesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
his house for ever, and so doth beauty too; For as
the Temple was the type of Christs body, which hee
himselfe calls a Temple, and in which dwelt both beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and holinesse, so our Churches are types of that ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestiall
temple above the new <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> Now there is
alwayes a correspondencie between the type and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type;
our Temples then should be beautifull to put us
in mind of, and to elevate our affections to that beautie
which is in heaven. Therefore the antient counsell of
<hi>Gangra,</hi> held in the purer times of the Church about
324. yeares after Christ, pronounced Anathema against
<hi>Eustachius</hi> and his adherents, who held that Churches
should be neglected, and publick meetings in them left
off, and that there should be no other Churches, but
mens private houses, and no other meetings but conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles;

if we should not maintaine his house, who maintaines
all our houses. Can we beautifie our owne houses, seele
them with Cedar, and paint them with Vermilion, and
suffer Gods house to lye waste? <hi>David</hi> was of another
mind, who would not suffer his eye-lids to slumber, nor
give any rest unto the temples of his head, untill he had
found out a place for the temple of the Lord, an habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">132. 3.</note> There were a sort of hereticks about the yeare
of Christ 1126. who would have all Churches demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
as being needlesse structures, for God dwells not
in temples made with hands. I doubt me the soules of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65120:8"/>
these hereticks by a pythagoricall transanimation, are entred
unto the bodyes of some moderne zelots, who in some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
thought that Religion could not bee sufficiently refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
except Cathedrals had been defaced, and the Queeres
pull'd downe, so that in some places of <hi>Scotland</hi> are to bee
seen, the miserable ruines of goodly fabricks. Amongst the
primative Christians Temples were called <hi>Martyria,</hi> either
because they were built in the places where Martyrs suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
or because the bones of the Martyrs were kept there,
or because they were dedicated to the the memory of the
Martyrs. But now in another sence many magnificent piles
may be called <hi>Martyria,</hi> for in a manner they have suffred
Martyrdome, being defaced and ruinate, torne and maimed
in their chiefe parts, and sacrilegiously robbed of their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
utensils. Shall not the blind Papists that built them,
rise up in judgement against those that spoyled them? Nay,
shall not the very Gentiles condemne them, who spared no
labour and cost to erect proud and magnificent Temples to
their Idoll Gods? witnesse <hi>Iupiters</hi> temple in the Capitoll;

could tell you that the Egyptians spared no cost in building
Temples even to Snakes and Crocodiles. You'l say they
were mad, and I say so too, But if it was madnesse to erect
Temples to false gods, it's far greater madnesse to destroy
the Temples of the true God. I can tell you sad stories of
those who have either robbed or destroyed even idolatrous
Temples. Of <hi>Camhyses</hi> that spoyled the Temples of Egypt,
of <hi>Xerxes</hi> and <hi>Brennus,</hi> who robbed <hi>Iupiters</hi> and <hi>Apollo's</hi> tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
of the stolne gold of <hi>Tholousa;</hi> Of <hi>Pompey, Crassus,</hi> and
others; But if these made fearefull ends that spoyled the
Temples of false gods, surely he that destroyes the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65120:9"/>
of the true God, God will him destroy. Not to cloy you
with multitudes of examples, looke upon the end of <hi>Baltha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi>
the prophaner of the holy vessels. The fearful end of <hi>Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
the robber of holy Churches. And to come neerer home,
the tragical end of the Conquerours Sons, <hi>Richard Rufus,</hi> and
<hi>Henry</hi> the second, Son to Duke <hi>Robert;</hi> Looke on these, and
on all others, who have either sacrilegiously or irreverently
medled with holy things, and you shall see vengeance pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
them close at the heeles. Shall <hi>Achan</hi> for stealing but
a garment dedicated to holy use? And <hi>Azariah</hi> for but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
to strike the Prophet a holy man, and <hi>Vzza</hi> for but
offering to put to his hand rashly to the Arke, a holy
Symboll, be so severely punished? what shall become of
those that have pulled downe the houses of God, and rapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
devoured the Shew-bread, the Priests maintenance,
leaving nothing but crums on the Altar, for those that must
serve all the other? But the greatest mischiefe of all is, that
Religion is often-times made the cloake to cover sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
too holy a garment for so prophane a monster. Shall
religion the beautifull and chaste Daughter of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
be made a Pander for such hainous impietie? Is Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and the outward splendour, or prosperitie of the Church
so inconsistent, that they cannot live and dwell together?
Is there no avoyding of superstition, but by falling into sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge?
No shunning of <hi>Charibdis,</hi> but by falling upon
<hi>Scylla?</hi> There is no necessitie why a man that runs from the
smoke, should fall into the flame. <hi>Thou that abhorrest Idols,</hi>
saith the Apostle, <hi>doest thou commit sacriledge?</hi> Is there not a
meane between both? Is he a Physitian that whilst he goes
about to cure a sicke man, pillages his house, and strips him
naked of all he hath? Sacriledge whilst it cures superstition,
it kills Religion, and if sacriledge be a remedy against the
disease of superstition; I must needs tell you, the remedy is
worse then the disease. But how ever sacriledge did pretend
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65120:9"/>
reformation, yet it intended private benefit. <hi>Iudas</hi> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
charitie, when he would have the oyntment sold, which
was (as he conceived) lavishly wasted upon Christ, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
he intended the filling of his owne bag. The Churches
wealth hath ever an eye-sore to covetous mindes, a morsell
that many gape after, a sop so savorie, that though Satan
enter with it, yet with <hi>Iudas</hi> they will swallow it, it is sweet
to the taste, but bitter in the maw. The Crow in the fable
greedily swallowed down the Snake, which in stead of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
poysoned him. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us there is a sort of
bread, that will turne to gravell, and though Quailes to the
<hi>Israelites</hi> was sweet meat, yet they were seasoned with
sowre sauce, even the wrath of God fell on the wealthiest
of them, whilst the flesh was betweene their teeth; He that
with the Eagle will steale flesh from the Altar, shall be sure
a coale shall set his nest on fire: and whosoever inricheth
himselfe with tythes, or the spoyles of the Church, shall
find that he hath put Eagles feathers in his bed, which in
time will consume all the rest. How many houses, nay
batnes in some places have been built with Church stones?
but there the stone cryes out of the wall, and the beame out
of the timber: Woe to him that buildeth a Towne with
bloud, and erecteth a City with iniquitie, the lands that
have beene purchased with sacrilegious money, have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>Aceldama</hi> a field of blood, which blood hath lighted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

with this sore, it's <hi>immidicabile vulmus,</hi> become so inveterate
and obdurate, that the oyle of preaching cannot soften it. I
will leave it therefore to that great and wise Colledge of
Physitians now assembled, who if they please, they can cure
it, and so I hope they will. And now I passe to the last

disclaimes such kindred as stay without. They that come in

from praying; And when the Eunuch of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> came up
to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> it was to worship in the Temple, and not to
stand without till prayers were done, and then come in to
heare a Sermon, as I shewed not long since upon that place,
which words then were traduced by some, as If I had then
spoken against preaching. I will judge charitably of them,
I thinke they speake rather out of ignorance then malice;

or adoration mentioned there is not hearing of a Sermon;
For I never yet read in sacred or prophane writer, that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
is adoration properly, for hearing being the reception
of the sound is meerely passive; Adoration is the action of
the mind, expressed by a submissive gesture of the body,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65120:10"/>
either in uncovering of the head, or pulling off the shooe,
or bending of the knee, bowing of the body, kissing of the
hand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now hearing being a passion, adoration an action,
they are in divers predicaments, therefore hearing is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
a part of Gods worship or adoration, though it be the
meanes by which we are taught to worship. I have, and
ever will give Preaching its just commendations, yet I will
not Idolize it, it shall have a roome in the Temple, though I
place it not on the pinacle, it shall be a tenant there, but an
under tenant. The chiefe tenant is prayer; the Lord of the
house will not take it well, that the under tenant shall thrust
the chiefe tenant out of doores. Where shall prayer dwell, if
it hath not roome in the house of prayer? Am I an enemy to
Preaching, because I prefer prayer to it? was St. <hi>Paul</hi> an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to faith and hope, because he preferres charity to them?
Let me reade to you this divinitie lesson in the phrase of
S. <hi>Paul;</hi> Now remaine Preaching, Sacraments, Prayer; these
three, but the greatest of these is Prayer. He that hath but
naturall Logick knowes, that the end is more excellent then
the meanes, prayer or the worship of God is the finall cause
or end of preaching. We preach that you may know how
to pray; I will pose these men, as Christ posed the Pharisees,
Whether is the gold, or the Temple that sanctisieth the
gold the greater; Whether the gift, or the altar that sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
the gift; So whether Preaching, or Prayer that sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
our preaching be the greater judge you. There is much
more efficacie in a short devout prayer, then in a long tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Sermon. What Sermon did ever open and shut heaven,
stop the Sun in his full careere, adde fifteene yeeres to ones
life, rayse the dead, and quench the violence of fire? and yet
prayers have done all these. <hi>Moyses</hi> was a good Preacher,
but by his Sermons he could not prevaile against <hi>Amelek,</hi>
his praying not his preaching got him the victorie. There is
a divell whom preaching cannot cast out, but fasting and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65120:11"/>
prayer can. Preaching may prevaile with men, but prayer
prevailes with God, and overcomes too. The effect of
preaching reaches no further then to the eares of those that
be present, but the vertue of prayer extends it selfe, <hi>Vltra
Garamantes &amp; Indos,</hi> to the absent though they were as far
distant from us, as the East is from the West. I must tell
you, it is not so much your hearing, nor our preachings, but
our praying that must divert Gods judgements from us, and
our brethren; its not preaching, but asking, seeking, knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that shall receive, and find, and open heaven gates to
us. I commend you for your often hearing of Sermons,
God blesse them to you; but though you heard never so
many, and these far-fetched, and deere bought too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet
without prayer you shall not prevaile: and thinke not that
your private prayers at home will suffice, you must joyne
with the Congregation; for if the private prayers of <hi>Israel</hi>
and <hi>Iudah</hi> had beene sufficient to divert Gods judgements
from them: <hi>Samuel, Iehosaphat,</hi> and <hi>Ezekiah</hi> would never
have troubled all the people to meet together at <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
I will shut up all with that saying of the great and holy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch
of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in his Apologie to the Emperour <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The
prayer of the people in the place of prayer is an holy and
decent exercise, by which our affections are the more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and God the more easily intreated; In a word, when
wee have done preaching to you, and you have given over
hearing us; The last anchor that you will lay hold on, in
your last houre, when you are rendring your spirits to him
that gave them, will be the prayers of the Minister,
to bee your <hi>Vade mecum,</hi> and to accompany
your soules towards
heaven.</p>
