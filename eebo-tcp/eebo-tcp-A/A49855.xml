         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>II An Abatement of the Motions and Orders, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>FOrasmuch as in Antient times when the master Clerks of the
Chancery (being in those Ages very learned in the Lawes of this
Nation) did contrive all manner of speciall Writs then called ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Writs very pithily, and well, seldome committing any errour
or mistake in any of them. And whereas also the antient Serjeants
at the Law in such times did contrive and draw all speciall pleadings in
like manner, and then were all suits speedily, and with so little Charge
or trouble ended, as the people of this Nation did finde and perceive
that they had full speedy, and equall Justice done unto them, and did
sit down in quiet without multiplying suit upon suit, and turmoile
themselves in trouble and discontent many years together, as hath been
too often used by very many of late, since such master Clerks and
Serjeants have been imployed about other businesses (that is to say) such
master Clerks about References, Reports and Accounts, bringing their
in much greater benefit. And such Serjeants altogether, or for the
most part taken up in moving and arguing at the bars of several
Courts, and pleading at tryalls at the Common Law, and hearing in
the Chancery, whereby few or none can procure them to contrive any
such thing: And (as it is thought) few or none of such master Clerks
can tell how to contrive, or draw any thing which before by such their
predecessours were in those ancient times usually done; by occasion
whereof Suiters in these latter times have been constrained to goe to
Clerks or Attornies to have such things contrived or drawn, whereof
some (who have set themselves forth highest) have been very ignorant,
which many Suiters being but of weak or mean judgements or capacities
could not apprehend; whereby very many mistakes and errours have
been committed and omitted in such things which have caused many
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55013:4"/>
Suits and Causes upon Writs and Bills at Trialls to be lost, and no
further proceedings thereupon to be, but the plaintifs therein forced and
compelled to pay costs to the defendants in such Suits, and divers Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts
to be quashed and overthrown upon matter moved or shewed in
Arrest of Judgement; and also sundry Verdicts to be reversed and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled
by Writs of Errour all three of them many times the one after
another, after the suiters in such actions and suits have been at very
great charge, trouble and labour, and great losses in the hindrance of
them in their Callings and Professions, and thereby many have spent
very much, some as much as the very demand in question, before they
have, or could obtain their just debts and demands; and others have
been so impoverished by the means aforesaid, that they have not been of
ability further to prosecute such suits for their Rights, but have given
over, and lost the same, and many inconveniences and mischiefs, and
such charge and trouble, and losse, have happened in overthrowing,
quashing, and delaying of divers Decrees, Sentences, and Finall orders
in many Courts.</p>
               <p>And whereas of late time, most persons in possession of Messuages,
Lands and Tenements, and wrongfully holding out others, have had
the same by lease, or so claimed, and some of them held over their
terme in the same; and many of those also (who have had the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
right of possession of such Lands and Tenements) have had the
right to the same by leases, whereby most Suits in such case have been
brought, by actions of Ejectments, framed upon Leases which could not
be tryed by writs of Assize, which hath been the most speedy remedy in
this behalf, and Judgements given at the same Assizes, when and where
the Verdicts have been found; and many times one of the parties to
such Actions of Ejectment have departed this life between the day of the
Tryall, and the day in the Bench, then next following, whereby all
the proceedings before mentioned have fell to the ground, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
their Executors or Administrators to begin anew, and by the same
occasion, Writs of Assize be grown so obsolete, that few know how to
proceed, as they should do in the same, and thereby most causes (which
might have been prosecuted by Writs of Assize) have been begun and
ended upon, and by such Actions of Ejectment which have occasioned
divers of such inconveniencies and mischiefs as before are expressed.
And whereas also in these latter times more light hath appeared in all
manner of learning to the severall sorts of the people of this Nation,
then hath in antient times (ten being learned in these times to one in
those; most ordinary people then depending wholly upon the Priest in
most ordinary matters) and it is hoped the people here, will more
and more increase in learning and judgement. And therefore it is
expected, and desired by most, that all manner of proceedings in Law
should be amended, and not run into worse and worse order, as they
have done of latter years.</p>

                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:55013:4"/>
And forasmuch as great, and most pitifull lamentations have been
made to divers persons, in many places by multitudes of people (who
have been turmoiled in Suits in the Court of Chancery, and other
Courts, that many of them have been, and usually are put to divers
unnecessary and excessive charges, by Registers and Enterers, and
writers of Orders, and rules their Deputies, Clerks and Agents in
such Courts; and that divers unnecessary Orders have been made in
such Courts by such Registers, and others with them before mentioned,
and drawn out much longer then hath been, or is necessary, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the note, or notes by them taken upon hearing, and debating
of the matter touching the same, for their own onely lucre, trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
and burthensome to such Courts and Councell there, and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to the parties in, and to such Suits; and that there hath been such
multitudes of Orders in those Suits, that very many (who have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
and defended the same Suits) have given long, and much at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance,
before they have procured, or could procure any Entries or
Copies thereof to be made, by reason (as divers such lamentations have
been) of money or rewards given, or promised to such Registers,
Writers or Enterers, their Deputies, Clerks, Servants or Agents to
draw up such Orders, or rules stricter, or to some other sense then
such Courts did truly direct and order; under colour whereof very
many have complained that many honest and just Causes have miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
and that in the same much charge, perplexity, trouble, travell
and vexation have been to resort to the Counsell in such Suites, and
afterwards to repair unto, or attend with Counsell, the Chancellor,
Judge or Judges (who made, or pronounced the same Rules or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders)
to have the same drawn and entred according to the true sense
thereof.</p>
               <p>And whereas it hath been much complained of, that many others
(who have not undergone such perplexity, trouble, toil, and vexation,
before they have procured, or could procure such Orders or Rules to
be drawn up according to the true sense of the Chancellour, Court,
Judge or Judges, who made or pronounced the same) have been at
great charges in giving large rewards to Registers and enterers of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and Rules, their Deputies or Clerks (who have agited therein:)
And also whereas the like complaints and lamentations have been, that
such Courts have been so full of businesse, that many Suiters could
have no proceedings there without great trouble and charge; and that
divers before, they have had, or could have any end of their businesse
or suites there, have spent as much, or more then that which they
have sued for there, hath been in value; besides, their trouble, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity
