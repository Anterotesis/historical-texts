            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
               </hi> Am conſtrained in a double re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to ſalute thee with a brief Epiſtle. Firſt, by cuſtome, whoſe bare word is holden and imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as a law. Secondly, by neceſſity, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Book being dead, leaving the notes with me: Death interrupting him could not preface it; ſo that either the Book muſt come to thee without an Epistle, or I muſt write one.</p>
            <p>Two things briefly I ſhall acquaint the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der withall: First, with the Authour. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, with the Work.</p>
            <p>For the Author, his name was Mr. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander
<pb facs="tcp:170104:3"/>
Groſs,</hi> Batchelor of Divinity, and Miniſter of <hi>Aſhberton</hi> in the County of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>von;</hi> he was a painful, a faithful Miniſter of Chriſt; a skilful, a powerful diſpenſer of the Word, the proofs of which were his conſtant and inceſſant imployments in preaching twice every Sabbath for many years; yea, and that in the Biſhops times, as alſo that he might keep men from drunkenneſſe and other deboiſt practices, he was wont to preach every Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day in the year.</p>
            <p>Which Miniſtery of his was very effectual, many being converted by him. Thoſe two things which make a compleat man had an happy conjunction in him, <hi>(viz.)</hi> integrity and judgement: yea, he had that which made him a compleat Miniſter, namely, that he would ſpeak his minde fitly, and that he durſt ſpeak it freely; a proof of the former you have cleared in his writings that are already in print, and are printed as he preached, where you may find clear method, ſound proofs, preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſimilitudes, plentiful illustrations, pithy perſwaſions, ſweet inſinuations, powerful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcements. For his freedome of ſpeech in reproving of ſin, even to the faces of the greateſt, many are able to teſtifie, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular inſtances I could give.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:170104:3"/>
            <p>I have heard him very much commended for theſe things:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1</hi> That he was an excellent Scripturiſt; and it is reported that he had them <hi>(ad un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guem)</hi> he was in all his preachings very full of Scripture.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2</hi> That he was bleſſed with an excellent memory, ſeldome uſed any note in his Pulpit, though he alwayes wrote Notes of what he preached.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3</hi> That he was a man furniſhed with that heavenly gift of prayer, in which he excelled moſt men; ſome Miniſters have told me, that they have much admired his ability in that holy Exercize.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4</hi> That he was a man hating novelties, and yet abhorring ſuperstition; he ſtuck cloſe to the antient truths of God, and contended earneſtly for the faith.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>5</hi> That his life was an excellent Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe on his Doctrine; his Doctrine &amp; Life diſagreed not: As he was a Preacher of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe; ſo he was a practiſer of holineſſe. What is ſpoken of Saint <hi>John,</hi> may be ſpoken of him; That he was a burning and ſhining light: and I know that many wicked men that hated him for his goodneſſe, ſhall in the day of their viſitation bleſs God for his good words and good actions.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:170104:4"/>
            <p>In a word, he ſpent his time, his ſtrength, his all for God; and at laſt, he died in a good old age. A little before his death he preached on that paſſage of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee?</hi> and (as I was inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a godly man, his hearer) that he was ſo wonderfully carried forth in his preaching, that he much feared he ſhould not long enjoy him; and ſo it happened, for a ſhort ſpace af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he died, and now injoyes the glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the God whom he ſo faithfully ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>As concerning this work left in my hands, I have little more to ſay, beſides what the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of the blinde man ſaid of their ſonne, (though in ſome reſpects it is newly come forth, yet in regard of the truth and ſubſtance of it) it is old enough, let it ſpeak for it ſelf.</p>
            <p>This I ſhall ſay concerning the Book, that there is nothing in it but what is ſound and orthodox, which cannot be ſaid of many Books that come abroad: the matters contained in the Book are plain and eaſie to be underſtood, food it is for babes, and nouriſhment it may give to strong men.</p>
            <p>A few hints I have here given you of what you may read more largely in the Book:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1</hi> That the Ministers duty, it lies mainly
<pb facs="tcp:170104:4"/>
in the endeavouring the converſion of ſinners, the drawing home of ſouls to God.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2</hi> That the peoples duty lies in attending upon their Miniſters and Miniſtry.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3</hi> That the redemption of Chriſt it is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to ſome of all Nations, but not to all in all Nations, <hi>Matth. 8.11. Rev. 5.9.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4</hi> That men may not at their own pleaſure leave their callings, but follow them while God doth give ability to perform them.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>5</hi> That the Sacrament of Baptiſme muſt be carefully adminiſtred to ſuch as are capable of it; and that it muſt be adminiſtred in pure water without any mixture, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <hi>6</hi> That the clear and open ſhining of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel hath been attended with much contention.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <hi>7</hi> That contentions have been in Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <hi>8</hi> That ſelf-love and ambition are many times an occaſion of contention.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <hi>9</hi> That men have of themſelves no ability to do good.</p>
            <p n="10">
               <hi>10</hi> Gods ſervants muſt not ſeek their own, but the honour of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="11">
               <hi>11</hi> That all the faithful are joyned in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual wedlock with Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p n="12">
               <hi>12</hi> That the Lord Jeſus beareth a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar love to his Ministers.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:170104:5"/>
            <p n="13">
               <hi>13</hi> That Gods faithful Miniſters are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſpecial manner acquainted with his counſels.</p>
            <p n="14">
               <hi>14</hi> That the calling of the Miniſtry requires ſome good preparations and large abilities.</p>
            <p n="15">
               <hi>15</hi> The voice of the Lord Jeſus heard in the Goſpel is the joy and rejoycing of a ſound Chriſtian.</p>
            <p n="16">
               <hi>16</hi> That the converſion of ſinners by the Ministry of the Word is the great joy of the Miniſters thereof.</p>
            <p n="17">
               <hi>17</hi> Thoſe are leaſt conceited of their own goodneſs, that are beſt and moſt ſanctified.</p>
            <p n="18">
               <hi>18</hi> The revelation of the Lord Jeſus unto men is by degrees.</p>
            <p n="19">
               <hi>19</hi> Chriſt the Redeemer, the Son of God, by eternal generation</p>
            <p n="20">
               <hi>20</hi> The Lord Jeſus hath preheminence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and dominion over all creatures.</p>
            <p>Theſe with many more excellent points ſhalt thou find in this little Book worthy your view, God grant that your hearts may be as Cabinets to retain and keep theſe jewels: it is true, that the matters are common, and the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſubject both of many Sermons and printed Books in theſe dayes; yet we know, that the commoneſt meats do yield the moſt wholeſome
<pb facs="tcp:170104:5"/>
nouriſhment, whereas new found diſhes do but clog the ſtomach, and fill the body with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſome humours.</p>
            <p>And for the preventing or removing of all prejudicate opinions which may ariſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Book (as though ſtrumpet like, any baſtardly brood unlawfully begotten ſhould be fathered and faſtened upon ſo divine a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) this I can more than promiſe <hi>(verbo Miniſtri)</hi> that there is nothing in it for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or manner, either ſpurious, or ſurreptiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; nothing but what is genuine, and the Authors own, the immediate iſſue of his working brain, and flowing from his own pen.</p>
            <p>This I ſhall promiſe the Reader, if he ſhall like of what is in this Book, I ſhall preſent him ſhortly with another of this Author: In the mean time I refer this to thy ſerious reading and gracious benefiting, who am</p>

               <p>And as long as we are thus ſlothfull and backward in this behalf it doth diſcover</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we have no bowels of compaſſion towards our bretheren. Who can ſee his brother taken priſoner by the Prince of darkneſs, led away captive in his chain, wounded to the death with ſin, preſſed down under the heavy burden of iniquity, ſtript naked of the rich and pretious garment of true holines, altogether defiled with the dirt and ſlime of Sin, if he have any compaſſion in him, and not <hi>ſeek to deliver him?</hi> how can he choſe but <hi>pray as the Church,</hi> Act. 12.3, 4, 5, 6. &amp; endeavour as the angell, <hi>vers the</hi> 7.8.

How much more to the Souls of our bretheren, captivated by Sathan, led aſtray by or ſunke under the burden of ſin, ſurely this is the trueſt compaſſion, the ſweeteſt mercy, the beſt kindnes to help the Souls of our brother out of the ſnare of Sathan, according to that of <hi>St. Iude vers</hi> 22.23. <hi>And of ſome have compaſſion making a difference, and others ſave with feare pulling them out of the fire, &amp;c.</hi> Men think all the mercy appeareth
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170104:10"/>
in giving food for the belly, apparell for the back, but what is lands and revenews to one confined to perpetuall impriſonment, what is food to the diſeaſed, who needeth Phyſick, what mercy is this to trim the <hi>houſe, and leave the inhabitant in priſon?</hi> I may ſay <hi>as the Lord in Iſa.</hi> 58.5, 6, 7. <hi>Is it ſuch a faſt as I have choſen a day for a man to afflict his ſoule?</hi> Is it to bow down his head like a bulruſh, &amp; to ſpread ſack-cloth and aſhes under him? willt thou call this a faſt and an acceptable day to the Lord? Is not this the faſt that I have choſen? to looſe the bandes of wickednes, to undo the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy burdens, and to let the oppreſſed go free, and that ye breake every yoke? Is it not to deale thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are caſt out, to thy houſe? when thou ſeeſt the naked that thou cover him, <hi>and that thou hide not thy ſelf from thy one fleſh?</hi> So is this the compaſſion the Lord looks on for a man now and then to feed, cloth, the hungry naked body? is not this the compaſſion the Lord looks at to help thy brother off with his wicked bands, to undo his heauy burdens, to break his yokes, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That we have no hearty and ſanctified affection to our bretheren. How can we ſay we love them, if we ſeek <hi>not to remove ſin from them, read</hi> that place, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy brother in thy heart: Thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke thy Neighbour, and not ſuffer ſin upon him.</hi> The love of <hi>Chriſt</hi> appeared not in making his ſervants rich, or advancing them
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170104:11"/>
to worldly dignities, for they are <hi>for the most part a poor deſpiſed people, as it is in</hi> Zeph. 3.13. <hi>But his love appeared in cauſing a light to ſhine to them who ſat in darknes,</hi> Mat. 4.16. <hi>In opening the eyes of the ſpiritually blind, as it is in</hi> Iſa. 35.5, 6. <hi>In turning men from iniquity, as it is in</hi> Acts the 3. verſe 26. <hi>In teaching them to deny ungodlineſs, and worldly luſts,</hi> Tit. 2.12, 13, 14. <hi>In making us the Sons and Daughters of God as you have it in</hi> 1. Iohn 3.1. <hi>In waſhing us from the ſpirituall filthyneſs of ſin,</hi> Eze. 6.7, 9, 10. And in this manner muſt we ſhew our love towards our bretheren, that it may appear we love the Jewel and not the casket, the ſoul, and not the carkaſe, that our love may be faſtned on Gods image, and not on that which is but duſt and aſhes, <hi>that the fruit of our love may be everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting,</hi> Prov. 13.24. <hi>What Solomon ſpeaks there he that ſpareth his rod hateth his ſon, but he that loveth him chaſtneth him betimes.</hi> So in this caſe, he that loveth his field manureth it, he that loveth his tree pruneth it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That we have not unfained love to God. No better argument of love to God, than in ſeeking to take from men that ſin which God doth hate, to reſtore them to holineſs wherein God doth delight, and therefore this is made an argument to <hi>demonstrate Peters</hi> love to Chriſt his feeding his ſheep, <hi>Iohn</hi> 21.17. by this we ſhall gather them home to Gods fold, make them Members of Chriſts body, heires of Gods Kingdom, ſervants in Gods family, Trees in Gods Orchard, ſouldiers fighting Gods
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170104:11"/>
battles, and ſo ſhall ſhew our love to God by being a means of bringing much honour to him, and to them that ſeek not the <hi>good of there bretherens Souls, I may ſay as in</hi> the 1. Joh. 3.17. <hi>How dwelleth the love of God in him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. That we have no feeling of the goodneſs of God in our Souls, of the lively opperation of his word, of our happineſs in being in <hi>Chriſt: had we the ſence of this, we would with David</hi> in Pſa. 66.16. Invite men to us and ſay, <hi>Come and hear all ye, that fear God, and we will tell you what he hath done for our Souls,</hi> and we would being <hi>converted ſtrengthen our bretheren, as you have it in</hi> Luk. 22.32. <hi>Wee would ſay as the Samaritan Woman,</hi> Ioh. 4.29. <hi>come ſee a man which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Chriſt?</hi> and as they that were ſent to ſpye out the Land, when they ſaw it <hi>and how good it was incouraged</hi> the reſt to go to it, ſaying in <hi>Iud.</hi> 18.9. <hi>Ariſe, that we may go up against them, for we have ſeen the Land, and behold, it is very good and are ye ſtill? be not ſloathfull to go, and to enter to poſſeſs the Land.</hi> Even ſo thoſe that have felt and ſeene the goodneſs of the Lord, are ready to incourage others Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to thoſe that ſtand ſtill, ariſe, why ly ye ſtill, why are ye ſlothfull come into the way of God that is ſo good, ſo pleaſant.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That we have no feeling of their miſery, did we feel there ſin as a heavy burden upon our Souls, as a thorne in our ſides, as a burning fire in our own bowels, it would make us mightily to awaken them out of ſin, as the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170104:12"/>
Woman of Canaan, having her Daughter vexed with a divell, cryed out; <hi>have mercy on me O Lord, thou Son of David, for my Daughter is grevouſly vexed with a devill,</hi> Math. 15.22. So will it be with a ſoul that hath had any feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the miſery of ſin, it will cry out, in the behalf of poor ſinners, have mercy, O Lord, for we have bretheren greivouſly vexed with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and devills.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That <hi>we are not greived, to ſee Gods Law transgreſſed as David was in</hi> Pſal. 119.136. <hi>rivers of tears run down my eyes: becauſe they keep not thy law,</hi> the wayes of God neglected, as <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.4. that the name of God is diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>That we are not troubled, at the beholding of their ſinfull converſation as</hi> 2.

               <p>As the benefit repreſented, and ſealed by it to the faithfull is great: So the authority of it is not humane but divine, it was brought into the church by the commandement of God, by the Miniſtry, firſt of <hi>Iohn;</hi> therefore called the Baptiſt, after ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified and confirmed by our Saviour himſelf, being baptized of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and giving commiſſion to his Apoſtles, and Miniſters, to continue the ſame in his Church unto the end.

All other waſhings are nothing worth, the heart remaining uncleane, unwaſht; it is not ſo much the outſide, as the inſide of the platter doth defile the meat, therefore the Lord will have both to be waſhed, <hi>Iames</hi> 4.8. And this <hi>Davids</hi> Prayer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.2, 7. This is Gods promiſe, and the work of his Spirit upon all his choſen chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. This is a teſtimony of his ſureſt love, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.9. The ſweeteſt favour that he beſtowes on any of his ſervants: to waſh away their ſin is a greater mercy and higher honour, than to cloath them with the richeſt raiment, and ſeate them in the moſt eminent places of dignity, for as, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.4. <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſonnes were waſhed with water before they miniſtred in the tabernacle, ſo muſt we waſh, before ever we can Miniſter unto God in any acceptable manner; as, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.8. <hi>Chriſt</hi> waſhed <hi>Peters</hi> feet, elſe he could not have part in him, ſo unleſs we be inwardly wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, we can have no part in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Levit.</hi> 1.9. The inwards and the leggs of the burnt offering was to be waſhed in water: So muſt our inward parts be waſhed before we can offer our ſelves to God.</p>
               <p>Therefore as <hi>Naomi</hi> adviſed <hi>Ruth</hi> intending to, joyne herſelf in wedlock with <hi>Boas, Ruth</hi> 3.3. Waſh thy ſelfe therefore and anoint thee, &amp;c. So let me adviſe as many of you as intend to joyne vour ſelves in this holy wedlock with <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi>

As the water doth ſupply, and make ſoft and tender the grounds whereon it falleth, things caſt into it: So muſt we labour to find our hearts (by vertue of the grace of the Spirit repreſented and comunicated to us in baptiſme) made ſoft and tender, flexible and obedient to the will of God. This is Gods worke in the heart of his people, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.4. Turning the hearts, which were as hard as ſtones, into hearts as tender as fleſh, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26.

               <p n="3">3. As the water doth quench the flaming and burning fire, ſo let us ſtrive to feel the vertue of our baptiſme in extinguiſhing all the fiery luſts that are within us, in quenching all ſinfull and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidinous and diſorderly affections, as a man caſt into a deep water will feel his body cooled, burning heats removed: ſo muſt we ſtrive to feel all unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heats in our Souls, by vertue of this water extinguiſhed; therefore reſembled to a grave, wherein all our luſts are buried, and how ſtrong ſoever before, yet now they are as a dead body, which doth every day more and more conſume, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3, 4, 5, 6.</p>

We muſt imitate our Saviour, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.52. As the children in the family grow, ſo muſt we, as many as are children in Gods family, grow to further perfection in the grace of Gods Spirit.

               <p n="4">4. True knowledge maketh us induſtrious in imbracing all opportunities for the furtherance of the work of grace, to become rich in ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to be freed from ſin more thoroughly, to performe holy dueties more cherefully, more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably, to be able to withſtand temptations more ſtrongly; as a man fallen into the hands of theeves, having his eyes open watcheth every op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to go from them, a wiſe merchant ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth the mart, an underſtanding Husbandman taketh the ſeaſons of the year, ſo will the Children of God entertaine the fitteſt opportunities to pray when their hearts are moſt affected with the fence of ſin, moſt moved with the deſire of grace, <hi>Jon.</hi> 2.1.

                  <p>This muſt therefore cauſe us to ſearch into, and to meditate upon our vileneſſe, to be well acquainted with our unworthineſſe, with the ſway which ſinne and Satan beare within us; with the propenſity, yea violent inclination of our hearts to ſinne, with the puniſhment due to us for our tranſgreſſions, with our own empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and all creatures diſability to ſatisfie Gods juſtice, that we may lift up our hearts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and faſten our eyes wholly and altogether upon the Lord Jeſus; that being ſenſible of

               <p n="1">1. By the abandoning and exiling of ſinne: no man giveth credit to the teſtimony of Chriſt, no man giveth entertainment unto Chriſt, but he thruſteth ſin out of the doores of his heart. No man entertaineth his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign into his houſe, but he cleanſeth his houſe, beautifieth and adorneth the ſeveral roomes thereof; the woman that wiveth her ſelfe in wedlock, putteth off her menſtruous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly rayment; the Sun appearing in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon, the darkneſſe, clouds, miſty and filthy fogs are diſpelled; no man entertaineth Chriſt the Lord of life, the Prince of glory, but he purgeth his ſoule, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.3.

               <p n="2">2. By the neglect; deſpiſing, rejecting of the world: When the Sun appeares, the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles are extinguiſhed; when the Prince com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, the fellowſhip, the preſence of beggars is not regarded; when Chriſt is once entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into the ſoule, ſuch is his Beauty, Fulneſs, Majeſty, Glory, that then the world, though before very glorious, yet now it is as dung, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. As withered graſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.8. As a dead thing void of life, beauty, profit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. As a thing of nought, <hi>Amos</hi> 6.13.

put their confidence in him, have felowſhip with him, as the Scholler with the teacher; they ſit at his feet, they heare his voice,<note place="margin">Lu. 10.39.

               <p>One thing more may be learned out of theſe words from the preparation of Chriſt to his office; as he comming to preach the Goſpel had his commiſſion from God, ſpake no other but the words of God, ſo it ſetteth before us the duty of Gods Meſſengers, and teacheth us:</p>

                  <label>Doctr.</label> That the beſtowing of the ſaving gifts and graces of the Spirit is the choiceſt teſtimony of the love of God; a greater teſtimony of the love of God to fill the veſſels of the ſoul with ſanctification, then to fill the barn with corn, the fold with ſheep, the ſtall with oxen, the cheſt with gold, the life with pleaſure, or to ſet upon the head a crown of worldly honor; therefore when God entred into Covenant with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, promiſed to bee their God, and took them above all the people of the earth, hee doth not promiſe them a paradiſe of pleaſures to dwell in, a river of wordly delights to drink of, a ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe

let the Word bee as your dayly food, as your guid and counſeller, let it ſink into your ſouls, let it work upon your hearts, let it dwell and rule within you, that ſo you at length have the fruition of this faith; pray for it, deſire it, long after it, as earneſtly as ever <hi>Rachel</hi> or <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> did for children, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. go to God in his houſe, in thy family, in thy cloſet, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, evening, at noon-day, at mid-night, and beg for a lively faith; ſay unto the Lord, Thou art undone, thou art but a dead man, if God give not this faith unto thee; ſay that all riches, pleaſures, worldly endowments, are but hay and ſtubble as long as this is abſent: Oh! think of this, go about this, as about a matter of moſt need, of greateſt importance, of chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt uſe, of ſweeteſt conſolation; and as <hi>Naomi</hi> ſaid to <hi>Ruth</hi> of <hi>Boaz, Ruth</hi> 3.18. ſo take thou no reſt till thou haſt finiſhed this thing, till thou haſt by a lively faith joyned thy ſelf in wedlock with the Lord Jeſus; make a covenant with thy ſoul in this, as <hi>David</hi> did in another caſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.4. and when you feel your hearts beginning affectionately to lean upon and cleave unto the Lord Jeſus; pray with the men in the Goſpel, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.24. you ſhall never have juſt cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of your labor in this behalf; nothing can bring you ſo nigh to God as a lively faith; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can give you ſuch acceſs to God; nothing can inable you ſo to prevail with God, and to gain ſo many good things from the hands of God; nothing can ſtand you in ſuch ſtead, and afford you ſo much comfort; the owner of this
