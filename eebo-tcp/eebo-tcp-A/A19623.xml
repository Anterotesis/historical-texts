            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>What is there then that ſhoulde mooue theſe ſortes of men, thus moſt wickedlie, and thus moſt trayterouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb facs="tcp:9568:8"/>
to conſpire the death and deſtruction of ſo gracious a ſoueraigne Ladie and Queene.

Certaine it is, that no man can pleaſe God without faith, as the Scripture ſayth.</p>
            <p>But what then, is it therefore lawfull for the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect <note place="margin">Not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to rebel for religion whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it be.</note> in defence of his faith or Religion, whatſoeuer it be or to aduaunce the ſame, to conſpire the deſtruction of his ſoueraigne, or to rebell and take armes againſt her, (wherein alwayes the perill of the Princes perſonne is imployed) God forbid.

            <p>The famous Clerke Eraſmus, in his Paraphraſe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon <note place="margin">Fraſmus.</note> this place of Scripture, ſpeaketh theſe wordes to Peter, as it were in the perſonne of Chriſt, ſaying.

            <p>If a Prince ſhould ſette forth a Lawe, touching the worſhipping of God, or matter of conſcience againſt the word of God, and limit a paine to the infringers therof, though the Subiect be not indéede bounde in conſcience to obſerue the ſame law, yet he may not reſiſt or oppoſe himſelfe againſt his Soueraigne, but muſt rather ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte himſelfe to the puniſhment of Lawe, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſayth: <hi>Submitt your ſelfe vnto euery ordenaunce of</hi>

of the Scottiſh Quéene, and her fauourers they appeare in that they did thinke that ſhe had right, not to ſuccéede her Maieſtie, but to enioy her Crowne in poſſeſſion, and therefore as ſhe was a moſt impatient competitor thereof, ſo ſhe would haue ſpared no meanes whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, that might haue bereft vs of her Maieſtie, the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie impediment that ſhee could not enioy her deſire.</p>
            <p>Shee was obdurate in malice againſt her royall perſon, notwithſtanding her Maieſtie had ſhewed her all fauour and mercie, as well in preſeruing her hing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as ſauing her life, and ſaluing her henour. And therefore there was no place for mercie, ſince there was no hope that ſhee would haue deſiſted from her moſt wicked attempts.</p>
            <p>Shee boldly and openly profeſſed, that it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for her to mooue inuaſion vppon her Maieſtie, and therefore, as of inuaſion victory might enſue, and of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, the death of the vanquiſhed: ſo did ſhe therby not obſcurely bewraie, that ſhe thought it lawfull, for her to deſtroy her Maieſties ſacred perſonne.</p>
            <p>She did thinke it not onely lawfull, but honorable alſo and meritorious to take her Maieſties life from her, as béeing all ready depriued of her Crowne, by the excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the holy Father. And therefore it was like ſhe would (as ſhe had doone) continually ſéeke it by whatſoeuer meanes.</p>
            <p>That ſhe was gréedie of her Maieſties death, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred it before her owne life and ſafetie, appeareth, for in her direction to one of her late Complices, ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed (vnder couert termes,) that whatſoeuer ſhoulde become of her, that tragicall execution ſhould bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, vpon our moſt gracious ſoueraigne Lady, name<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, the deſtruction of her royall perſonne.</p>
            <p>She was the onely hope of all diſcontented ſubiects,
<pb facs="tcp:9568:12"/>
ſhe was the foundation, whereon all the euill diſpoſed did builde, ſhe was the roote from whence all rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and trecheries did ſpring: And therefore, while this hope laſted, this foundation ſtoode, and thys roote liued, they would haue retained hart, and ſet on foote whatſoeuer theyr deuiſes againſt this Realme, which otherwiſe will fall away, die, and come to nothing.</p>
            <p>All theſe matters her Maieſtie did moſt déepelye conſider of, and yet to the ende it might euidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, howe vnwylling ſhe was to take away y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Quéene of Scots life, ſhe required to vnderſtand by the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and reſolution of the high Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether any other meanes could be thought of, or ſound by anie of them, how the Scottiſh Queenes life might be ſpared, and yet her Maieſties perſonne ſaued out of perill, and the ſtate of the Realme preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in quiet: For her Maieſties further ſatiſfaction, they enteredinto a new conſultation, &amp; for that prupoſe, ſelected a great number of the choyſeſt perſons of the higher houſe of Parliament, to conferre thereof, eyther prinately, or together with the lower houſe: and vppon ſundry conferences had in that behalfe at ſeueral times, it was concluded by the whole aſſemblic of both hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that there could be no other aſſured meanes for the preſeruation of her Maieſties life, continuance of Gods Religion, and quiet of this ſtate, then by the full execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſayd ſentence.</p>
            <p>That if her Maieſtie ſhould be ſafe without taking away the life of the Scottiſh Queene, the ſame were moſt likely and probably to grow by one of theſe means following.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that happilie ſhe myght haue béene reclaimed and become &amp; repentaunt conuert, agniſing her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
<pb facs="tcp:9568:12"/>

            <p>2. Or els, by a more ſtraight guarde might haue béen ſo kept as there ſhould haue béene no feare of the like at tempts after.</p>
            <p>3. Or, that good aſſuraunce might haue béene gyuen by O the, Bondes or Hoſtages, as cautions for her good and loyall demeanour from thenceforth.</p>
            <p>4. Or laſtlie, by Baniſhment, the Realme might haue béene boyded of her perſonne, and thereby the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils further remooued, that might growe to her Maieſty by her preſence.</p>
            <p>All which matters béeing duely pondered, it did yet appeare in all theyr iudgments, that they durſt not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe anie ſecuritie to reſt in any, no, not in all of them.</p>
            <p>For touching her Conuerſion, it was conſidered, that if pietie or duety could haue reſtrained her from ſuch haynous attempts, there was cauſe aboundantlye miniſtred to her on her Maieſties behalfe, when ſhe not onelie protected her againſt the violence of her owne Subiectes, who purſued her to death by Iuſtice, but co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered her honour, when y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſame by publique fame was touched, and by verie heynous and capitall crimes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected and prooued againſt her, before certaine Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie delegates aſſigned to examine the ſame, more then blemiſhed and ſpared her life, when for her former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies and confederacies with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Northren Rebels, her highnes was with great inſtance preſſed by bothe the houſes in the fouretéene yéere of her Maieſties raigne, to do like Iuſtice vpon her as now was deſired, and as her treaſonable practiſes then, hadde moſt iuſtly deſerued.</p>
            <p>And where the penaltie of thys Acte ſufficientlye
<pb facs="tcp:9568:13"/>
notified vnto her, ſhould haue terrified her from ſo wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked attempts, ſhe did neuertheleſſe inſiſt in her former practiſes, as a perſonne obdurate in malice againſt her Maieſtie, and irrecouerable: ſo as there was no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable hope of anie conuerſion, but rather great doubt and feare of relaps, foraſmuch as ſhe ſtoode obſtinatly in the deniall of matter moſt euivently prooued, and moſte iuſtly ſentenced againſt her, and was not entered into the firſt parte of repentaunce. The recognition of her offence, and ſo much the farther off from the true fruits that ſhoulde accompanie the ſame.</p>
            <p>As for a ſurer guarde, and more ſtraite impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it was reſolued, that there was no ſecurity ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, nor yet in the other two meanes propounded of Bondes and Hoſtages. foraſmuch as the ſame meanes that ſhould be practiſed to take her Maieſties life away (which God forbid) would aptly ſerue, bothe for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerie of her perſon, and releaſe of the Bondes &amp; Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtages, that ſhould be giuen for cautions in that behalfe: which béeing vnaptlie atchiued, and to our irreparable leſſe, who ſhould ſue the Bondes, or detaine y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Hoſtages? or béeing detained, what proportion was there in bonds or hoſtages whatſoeuer, to counteruaile the value of ſo precious and ineſtimable a Iewell, as her Maieſtie is to this Realme, and to vs all?</p>
            <p>That ſhée would ſolemnly haue vowed and taken an othe, that ſhe would not haue attempted any thing to the hurt of her Maieſties perſon: Shée had already ſundry time falſifyed her word, her writing &amp; her othe, and held it for an Article of Religion. That faith was not to be holden with Heretickes, of which ſorte ſhee accounted her Maieſtie, and all the profeſſors of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell to be: And therfore there was little reaſon to truſt her in that, whereof ſhe made ſo ſmall a conſcience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9568:13"/>
As for baniſhment, that was a ſtep <hi>de malo in pei<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Upon all which reaſons and matters opened, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titiones made to her Maieſtie as is aforeſayd, ſhe not withſtanding thought good &amp; very neceſſary in ſo great a cauſe to deliberate, as by her moſt wiſe and graue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to the premiſſes, in the ſayd Treatiſe, ſet downe among other things, plainely appeareth: and afterward the ſayd Scottiſh Quéene was executed in the Caſtle of <hi>Fodringham</hi> in the County of North-hampton, (where ſhe was moſt carefully kept, vnder the charge of that right honourable, truſty and right faythfull Counſeller to her Maieſty, Sir <hi>Amyas Pawlett</hi> Knight) on Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday, the 8, of <hi>Feburary.</hi> 1586. And the next day after, there were Bonfiers, ringing of Belles, and ſinging of Pſalmes, by children and many others at the ſayd fiers, in the Cittie of London, whereby appeareth that the people were ioyfull that ſo daungerous an enemie to this Common wealth was taken away.</p>
