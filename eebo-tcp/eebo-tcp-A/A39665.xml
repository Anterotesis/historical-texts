         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I am not of their opinion, the say, The
Heathens may <hi>spell</hi> Christ out of the Sun,
Moon and Stars; yet this I know, That the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratoinal
and inanimate, as well as rational
creatures have a Language; and though not
by <hi>Articulate</hi> speech, yet in a <hi>Metaphorical</hi>
sense, they preach unto man the wisdom, Power,
and goodness of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. There is
(saith the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> Psal. 19. 3.) <hi>No speech,
<pb facs="tcp:42861:3"/>
nor Language where their voice is not heard.</hi>
Or (as <hi>Iunius</hi> renders) there is no Speech, nor
Words, yet without these their voice is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood;
and their Line (i. e. saith <hi>Deodate</hi>)
their writing in gross and plain draughts, is
gone out through all the earth.</p>
                  <p>As man is compounded of a fleshly and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
substance, so God hath endowed the
creatures with a spiritual, as well as fleshly
usefulness; they have not only a natural use in
Alimental and Physical respects, but also a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
use, as they bear the figures and simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of many sublime and heavenly mysteries.
Believe me (saith contemplative <hi>Bernard</hi>)
thou shalt find more in the Woods, than in a
corner; Stones and Trees will teach thee what
thou shalt not hear from learned Doctors. By
a skilful and industrious improvement of the
creatures (saith Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> excellently) we
might have a fuller taste of Christ and Heaven,
in every bit of Bread that we eat, and in every
draught of Beer that we drink, than most
men have in the use of the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>And as the Creatures teach divine and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
things, so they teach them in a perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
and taking manner: <hi>Duo illa nos
<pb facs="tcp:42861:3"/>
maximè movent similitudo, &amp; exemplum,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cicero.</note>
saith the <hi>Orator;</hi> These two things, similitude
and example, do especially move us. Notions
are more easily conveyed to the understanding,
by being first cloathed in some apt Similitude,
and so represented to the sense. And therefore
Iesus Christ the great Prophet, delighted
much in teaching by Parables; and the Prophets
were much in this way also, <hi>Hos. 12. 10. I have
used Similitudes by the Ministry of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi>
Those that can retain little of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
yet ordinarily retain an apt Similitude.</p>
                  <p>I confess it is an humbling consideration,
That man, who at first was led by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God to the knowledge of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
must now by the Creatures learn to know
God. That the Creatures (as one saith) like
<hi>Balaams</hi> Ass, should teach their Master. But
though this be the unhappiness of poor man in
his collapsed state, yet it is now his wisdom to
improve such Helps; and whilst others by the
abuse of Creatures, are furthering their
Perdition, to be the spiritual improvement
of them, promoting our own Salvation.</p>
                  <p>It's an excellent Art to discourse with Birds,
Beasts and Fishes, about sublime and spiritual
<pb facs="tcp:42861:4"/>
Subjects, and make them answer to our Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions;
yet this may be done, <hi>Iob 12. 7, 8.
Ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee,
and the Fowls of the Air, and they shall tell
thee, or speak to the Earth, and it shall teach
thee, and the Fishes of the Sea shall declare
unto thee.</hi> That is (saith neat and accurate
<hi>Caryl</hi>)<note place="margin">Caryl in loc.</note> the creatures teach us when we think
of them; <q>They teach us, though not formally,
yet vertually; the answer and resolve the
question put to them, though not explicitely
to the ear, yet convincingly to the conscience.
So then, we ask the creatures, when we dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
consider them, when we search out the
perfections and virtues that God hath put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
or stampt upon them. To set our mind thus
upon the creature, is to discourse with the
creature; the questions which man ask of
a beast, are only his own Meditations. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
the creatures teach us, when we in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
make out collections, and draw
down a demonstration of the Power, Wisdom,
and Goodness of God in making them, or of
the frailty of man in needing them; Such
Conclusions and Inferences, are the teachings
of the creatures.</q>

Common objects (saith another) may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
two ways;<note place="margin">Mr. Manton.</note> 
                     <hi>viz.</hi> In an argumentative,
and in a Representative way; by reasoning from
them, and by viewing the resemblance that is
betwixt them and spiritual matters.</p>
                  <p>First, In Meditation argue thus, as in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
present case and Similitude of the Apostle. If
an Husbandman upon the ordinary principles
of reason can wait for the Harvest, shall not I
wait for the Coming of the Lord? The day of
Refreshing; the Corn is precious to him, and so
is the coming of Christ to me. Shall he be so
patient, and endure so much for a little Corn?
and not I for the Kingdom of Heaven? He is
willing to stay till all causes have had their
operations, till he hath received the former and
the latter rain, and shall not I, till the divine
decrees be accomplished?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in Meditation, make the resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
and discourse thus within your selves:
This is my Seed-time, Heaven is my Harvest;
here I must labour and toyl, and there rest. I
see the Husbandmans life is a great toyl; no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
thing can be obtained without labour,
and an obstinate patience. I see the Seed must
be hidden in the furrows, rotten and corrupted,
<pb facs="tcp:42861:5"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re it can bring forth with any increase. Our
hopes are hidden, light is sown for the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
all our comforts are buried under the
clods, and after all this there must be long
waiting, we cannot sow and reap in a day; ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
cannot follow, till all necessary causes
have first wrought. Tis not in the power of Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen
to ripen fruits at pleasure, our times
are in the hands of God, therefore 'tis good to
wait; a long-suffering patience will reap the
desired fruit. Thus you have some hints of this
heavenly Art of improving the Creatures.</p>
                  <p>The Motives inducing me to this undertake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
was the Lords owning, with some success
my labours of a like nature,<note place="margin">Navigation Spirituali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</note> together with
the desire and inclination (stirr'd up in me (I
hope, by the Spirit of the Lord) to devote my
vacant hours to his service in this kind. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
that if the <hi>Pharisees</hi> in a blind zeal to
a faction, could compass Sea and Land to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selyte
men to their party, though thereby they
made them sevenfold more the children of the
Devil than before: How much more was I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
by true love to God, and zeal to the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
happiness of souls, to use my utmost en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,
both with <hi>Seamen &amp; Husbandmen,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:42861:5"/>
to win them to Christ, and there by make them
more than seventy-seven-fold happier than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?
Not to mention other incouragements to
this work, which I received from the earnest
desires of some Reverend and worthy Brethren
inviting thereunto; all which I hope the event
will manifest to be a call from God to this work.</p>
                  <p>I confess I met with some discouragement in
my first attempt, from my unacquaintedness
with rural affairs; and because I was to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
in a path (to me) untrodden; but having
once engaged in it, those discouragements were
soon overcome; and being now brought to what
you here see, I offer to your hands these first
fruits of my spare hours.</p>
                  <p>I presume you will account it no disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that I dedicate a Book of Husbandry to
Gentlemen of your quality. This is <hi>Spiritual
Husbandry,</hi> which is here taught you; and yet
I must tell you, that great persons have accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that civil employment (which is must infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
to this) no disparagement to them. <hi>The
King himself is served by the field,</hi> Eccl. 5. 9.
Or as <hi>Montanus</hi> renders the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, <hi>Rex
agro fit servus;</hi> The King himself is a servant
to the field. And of King <hi>Uzziah</hi> it is written,
<pb facs="tcp:42861:6"/>
(2 Chron. 26. 10.) <hi>That he loved Husbandry.</hi>
And <hi>Amos</hi> 7. 1. we read of the <hi>Kings mow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi> Yea, <hi>Pliny</hi> hath observed, That Corn
was never so plentiful at <hi>Rome,</hi> as when the
same men tilled the Land that rul'd the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.
Quasi gauderet terra laureato vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere,
scilicat &amp; aratore triumphali;</hi> As though
the earth it self rejoyced in the Laurel Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>share,
and the triumphant Plowman.</p>
                  <p>What pleasure you will find in reading it, I
know not; but to me it hath been a pleasant
path, from first to last, who yet have been at far
greater expence of time and pains in compiling
it, than you can be in reading it. The Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmans
work you know, is no easie work,
and the Spiritualizing of it hath greater dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
attending it; but yet the pleasure hath
abundantly recompensed the pains. I have
found <hi>Erasmus</hi> his Observation experimental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
true; <hi>Qui literis addicti summus, animi
lassitudinem à studiis gravioribus contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctam;
ab iisdem studiis, sed amaenioribus

(saith he) when they have wearied their spirits
with study, can recreate them again with stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
by making a diversion from that which is
<pb facs="tcp:42861:6"/>
severe and knotty, to some more facile and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Subject.</p>
                  <p>But to hear that God hath used and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
these papers to the good of any soul, will
yield me the highest content and satisfaction
imaginable.</p>
                  <p>May you but learn that Lesson, which is the
general Scope and Design of this Book, <hi>viz.</hi>
How to walk with God from day to day, and
make the several Objects you behold, <hi>Scalae &amp;
alae,</hi> Wings and Ladders to mount your souls
neerer to Him, who is the Center of all blessed
Spirits. How much will it comfort me, and
confirm my hope, that it was the Call of God
indeed which out me upon these endeavours!</p>
                  <p>O Sirs! What an excellent thing would it be
for you, to make such holy improvements of all
these earthly Objects which daily incur your
senses, and cause them to proclaim and preach
to you Divine and heavenly Mysteries, whilst
others make them groan, by abusing them to
sin, and subjecting them to their lusts. A man
may be cast into such a condition, wherein he
cannot enjoy the blessing and benefit of a pious
and powerful Ministry; but you cannot (or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily)
fall into such a condition wherein
<pb facs="tcp:42861:7"/>
any thing (except a bad heart) can deprive you
of the benefits and comforts of those excellent
Serm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ns, and Divinity Lectures, which the
creatures here offer to preach and read to you.</p>
                  <p>Content not your selves, I beseech you, with
that natural sweetness the creatures afford; for
thereof the beasts are capable, as much, if not
more, than you; but use them to those spiritual
ends you are here directed, and they will yield
you a sweetness for transcending that natural
sweetness you ever relished in them; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
you never use the creatures as their
<hi>Lord's,</hi> till you come to see <hi>your Lord,</hi> in and
by them. I confess the discoveries of God in the
Word are far more excellent, cleer and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
<hi>He hath magnified his Word above all
his Name.</hi> And therein are the <hi>unsearchable
riches of Christ,</hi> or rich discoveries of that
grace that hath no footsteps in nature, as the
Apostles expression signifies, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 8.</p>
                  <p>And if that which might be known of God by
the Creatures, leave men without excuse; as
it's manifest, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. How inexcusable
then will those be, who have received not only
the teachings of the creature, but also the grace
of the Gospel in vain! <hi>How shall we escape,
<pb facs="tcp:42861:7"/>
if we neglect so great salvation?</hi> They that
are careless in the day of grace, shall be speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
in the day of judgment.</p>
                  <p>I am sensible of many defects in these Papers
(as well as in my self;) they have doubtless a
taste of the distractions of the times wherein
they were written; nor was I willing to keep
them so long under-hand, as the accurateness
and exactness with which such a subject ought
to be handled did require. Had I designed my
own credit, I should have observed that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
—<hi>Nonnumque prematur in annum,</hi>
(i. e.) To have kept in much longer under the
file, before I had exposed it to publick view;
but I rather inclined to <hi>Solomons</hi> counsel,
<hi>Whatever thy hand finds out to do, do it with
all thy might; for there is no wisdom, nor
knowledge, nor device in the grave, whither
thou art going,</hi> Eccles. 9. 10.</p>
                  <p>I apprehended a necessity of some such means
to be used, for the instruction and conviction
of countrey people; who either are not capable
of understanding truth in another Dialect, or
at least, are less affected with it. The <hi>Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
in every Chapter consists of an Observation
in Husbandry; Wherein, if I have failed in
<pb facs="tcp:42861:8"/>
using any improper expression, your candour
will cover it, and impute it to my unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
in rural affairs—<hi>In magnis voluisse

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Reddition,</hi> or <hi>Application,</hi> you will
find (I hope) both pertinent and close. The
Reflections serious, and such (as I hope) your
Consciences will faithfully improve. I have shut
up every Chapter with a <hi>Poem,</hi> an innocent
Bait to catch the Readers Soul.</p>
                  <p>That of <hi>Herbert</hi> is experimentally true.</p>
                  <l>A Verse may find him that a Sermon flies.</l>
                  <l>And turn delight into a Sacrifice.</l>
                  <p>I should never have been perswaded (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in this scribling Age, wherein we may
complain with the Poet.</p>

To have set my dull fancy upon the Rack to
extort a Poem to entertain my Reader; for I
cannot say with <hi>Ovid, Sponte sua carmen,</hi>

taken much pains to learn the <hi>Poems</hi> in their

at home, and the Servants in the fields,
<pb facs="tcp:42861:8"/>
will learn to exercise themselves this way also.
O, how much better will it be so to do, than to
stuff their memories with obscene Ballads and
filthy Songs, which corrupt their minds, and
dispose them to much wickedness, by irritating
their natural corruption! But these are purer
flames, you will find nothing here of such a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency.</p>
                  <l>'Tis guilt, not Poetry, to be like those</l>

                  <p>I shall add no more, but to beg that God
who instructeth the Husbandman in his civil
Calling, to teach him wisdom spiritually to
improve it; and particularly, that you may

            <head>TO THE
CHRISTIAN READER.</head>
            <p>THere are three things wherein (as it hath
been said, long before my day) the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of Godliness doth chiefly consist:
Prayer, Temptation, Meditation. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
is the Subject of this following Manual.
The Object of Meditation is twofold. First, The
Word: Secondly, The Works of God. The
Works of God are twofold. First, Internal. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
External. The External Works of God are
twofold. First, Of Creation: Secondly, of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
The works of Providence are likewise two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.
First, In things Civil, the Lord ordering and
over-ruling all the affairs and motion of single Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
Families and Nations, in a subserviency to his
own most holy Ends, Designs and Purposes: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
In things Natural, the Lord instructing the
Husbandman to discretion, and teaching him how
to Dress and Till the Earth, that it may give Seed
to the Sower, and Bread to the Eater; as also how
to breed up and manage the Beasts of the field,
both greater and lesser Cattel, for the use and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of Man.</p>
            <p>Meditation upon this lower part of the Works
<pb facs="tcp:42861:10"/>
of God, and his wonderful Providences about them,
may raise our souls very high; and while we wisely
consider these natural things, we may grow more
and more wise, in and for Spirituals and Eternals.</p>
            <p>The worthy and ingenious Author of the ensuing
Discourse, hath supplied us with an excellent help,
for the Spiritualizing of the providential Works of
God in natural things, by godly Meditation; we
chiefly want the help of the holy Spirit (without
which all other helps and helpers are altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient)
to frame and wind up our hearts, for this,
both profitable and delightful duty; yet the help
which the Lord is pleased to give us for our directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in it, by the Ministery of man, is not only, not to
be refused, but thankfully received and improved;
and all little enough to bring our minds to, or keep
them at this work: The best of Saints (on this side
heaven) have (though they are not earthly minded)
much earth in their minds, which like a heavy clog
at their heels, or a weight at their hearts, presseth
them down when they would make an Essay to
mount upward in Meditation. We find it no easie
matter to keep off earthly thoughts, when we are
most seriously engaged in heavenly work; how hard
is it then to get in, and be fixed upon heavenly
thoughts while we are engaged about earthly
work; yea, are (for so is the Husbandman) working
the very earth, and raking in the bowels of it. 'Tis
a great part of our holiness to be spiritually mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
while we are conversing with God through Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ in spiritual duties; but to be spiritually
minded, and to mind spiritual things, when we are
conversing with the clods of the earth, and the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
<pb facs="tcp:42861:10"/>
of the field, when we have to do with
Corn and Grass, with Trees and Plants, with
Sheep and Oxen, when we behold the birds
and fowls of the Air, the worms, and all that
creep upon the ground, then (I say) to be spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
minded, and thence to have our thoughts
ascending and soaring up to God, in heart-affecting
and quickning contemplations, witnesseth an high
degree of holiness, and of gracious attainments. To
make a ladder out to earthly materials, for the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of our selves in spirit up to heaven, is the <hi>Art of
Arts.</hi> Holy and happy indeed are they! who (being
taught of God) have learned this Art, and live in the
daily practise of it. Earthly objects usually hinder us
in our way, sometimes turn us quite out of our way
to heaven. Many plow and sow, dig and delve the
earth, till their hearts become as earthly as the earth
it self: many deal about the beasts of the field, till
themselves become even brutish. Is it not then a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
design which this Author aims and drives at, so
to spiritualize all sorts, or the <hi>whole compass</hi> of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Husbandry, that all sorts of husbandmen may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
spiritual and heavenly? It seems to me a taken
for good, that <hi>God</hi> hath an intendment of some speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
good to the souls of such as are by profession pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<hi>Husbandmen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Richard Steel,</hi> and this Author.</note> seeing he hath lately put it into the
hearts of two faithful Ministers (who with all of that
profession, are Husbandmen in a figure to undertake
though in a different way, this Subject, &amp; to publish
their labours in print, that they may be of use, not
only for the present age, but for posterity.</p>
            <p>And that the Husbandman may be pleased, as
well as profited, in perusing the labours of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
<pb facs="tcp:42861:11"/>
he hath, with singular aptness and acuteness,
contrived and contracted the sum or scope of every
Chapter into an elegant Distich or pair of Verses,
placed at the head of it, and concluded it with a
choice melodious Poem sutable to, and dilating up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the whole matter of it. These the Husbandman,
who can but read, may quickly learn and sing for
his solace, instead of those vain Ballads and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
Rimes, which many of that rank are apt to
buy, and solace themselves withal, without any
benefit, yea, much to their hurt, making their hearts
more corrupt, carnal and vain thereby.</p>
            <p>Let me add one word more to the Reader. This
Book of <hi>Husbandry Spiritualized,</hi> is not calculated
only for the common Husbandman; persons of any
calling or condition, may find the Author working
out such searching Reflections and strong Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
from almost every part and particular of the
Husbandmans work, as may prove, if faithfully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
very useful to them; to some for their awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening,
to consider the state of their souls, whether
in grace or in nature; to others for their instruction,
consolation and encouragement in the wayes of
grace, as also of their proficiency and growth in
those wayes. That the blessing of the Lord, and the
breathings of his good Spirit may go out with it, for
all those gracious purposes, is the hearts desire and
prayer of him, who is,</p>

            <l>But I must leave him, and return again</l>
            <l>To gratulate the author for his pain.</l>
            <l>And here I can't forbear to let my pen</l>
            <l>To tell the world of all the Husbandmen</l>
            <l>That er'e I met, he, he hath hit the vein</l>

            <l>And taught him how to get the greatest gain.</l>
            <l>Wherein he treads a path not trod before,</l>
            <l>By which indeed his skill appears the more.</l>

of my spare hours, which were thus
imployed, when by a sad providence
I was thrust from the society of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
dear friends, into a solitary coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey

me these innocent delights, which I
made out of my lonely walks, whereby the Lord sweetned
my solitudes there. 'Tis like thou wilt find some passages
here, that are harmlesly pleasant; yet, I assure thee, I
know of none that the most <hi>Cynical Reader</hi> can censure
as sinfully light and vain. I must acknowledge to the
praise of God, that I have found some of those (which pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
some of my Readers will call the slightest and most

yea, such a degree of comfort, I do profess, to have found

I may modestly enough say, that the emptiest leaf in this

your troubles and cares are many, and though your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition

            <l>Some bitter troubles Countrey men do meet,</l>
            <l>Wherewith the Lord doth intermix their sweet.</l>
            <p>The <hi>cares</hi> of your <hi>minds,</hi> are commonly no less than
the <hi>paines</hi> of your <hi>Bodies;</hi> it concerns you therefore, to
<pb facs="tcp:42861:18"/>
               <hi>sweeten</hi> what you cannot <hi>avoid;</hi> and I know no better
way for that than what is here directed to. O friends!
what advantages have you, for a spiritual life? Why
may you not have two harvests every year? one for your
Souls, another for you bodies; if you could thus learn
to husband your Husbandry. Methinks spiritual Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
do even put themselves upon you. Husbandmen of
old were generally presumed to be honest and good men;
what else means that saying of <hi>Menander,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <l>Profess thy self an Husbandman,</l>
            <l>And wicked too! believ't that can.</l>
            <p>What you are, godly or wicked is not for me (that am
a stranger to most of you) to determine; but if you are
not godly, its my desire &amp; design to make you so; and I
could not think on a more probable means to accomplish
this honest design, than what I have here used. Methinks
it should be a pleasure to you, when you come weary out of
the fields from plow, or any other labour, to sit down in
the evening, and read that chapter which concerns that
particulars business, &amp; <hi>refresh</hi> your <hi>Souls</hi> even from that
which hath <hi>wearied</hi> your <hi>bodies.</hi> Were your hearts but
heavenly, &amp; more time allowed for spiritual husbandry
your inward comforts, would be much more, &amp; your out
ward gains not a jot less; for it the success of all your
civil labours and imployments depend upon the pleasure
&amp; will of God; (as all that are not Atheists do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge)
then certainly, your business can succeed never the
worse, for your endeavours to please him, upon whose
pleasure it so intirely depends. I have many times li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

up my heart to heaven, whilst these papers were under my
<pb facs="tcp:42861:19"/>
hand, for a special blessing to accompany them,
when they should be in yours. If the Lord accomplish
my desires by them upon your souls, you shall enjoy two
heavens, one here, and another hereafter. Would
not that be sweet? The <hi>Historian</hi> tells us, that <hi>Altiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
Serarius</hi> was sowing corn in the field, when <hi>Q.
Cincinnatus</hi> came to him bare headed, with letters
from the <hi>Senate,</hi> signifying that he was chosen to the

these labours, that many of you will be called from
holding the <hi>Plow</hi> on earth, to wear the <hi>Crown</hi> of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

The Church is God's Husbandry, about which his
Ministers are imployed.</p>
               <p>I shall not here observe my usual Method, (intending no
more but a Preface to the following Discourse) but only
open the particulars wherein the resemblance consists, and
then draw some Corrolaries from the whole. The first I
shall dispatch in these twenty particulars following.</p>
               <p>The Husbandman purchases his fields,<note place="margin">1. Prop.</note> and gives a valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
consideration for them, <hi>Ier.</hi> 32. 9, 10.</p>
               <p>So hath God purchased his Church with a full valuable
price,<note place="margin">Reddit.</note> even the precious blood of his own Son, <hi>Act. 20. 28.
Feed the Church of God, which he hath purchased, or acquired
with his own blood.</hi> O dear-bought inheritance, how much
doth this bespeak its worth? or rather, the high esteem God
hath of it, to pay down blood, and such blood for it; never
was any inheritance bought at such a rate: every particular
elect person, and none but such as are comprehanded in this
purchase, the rest still remain in the devils right. Sin made
a forfeiture of all to justice, upon which Satan entred and

to God's workmen to be rendred useless and unserviceable
to the Churches, by those storms of trouble, which drive
them from their publick Ministerial work. With what a
heavy heart did <hi>Paul</hi> go off from his work at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> Act. 20.
It spends a Minister to preach, but more to be silent. 'Tis a
loud speaking judgment, when God shall say to them as to
<hi>Ezekiel, Son of man, I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of
thy mouth, and thou shalt be dumb,</hi> Ezek. 3. 26. Such silencing
providences, speaking thundring language to gracious hearts,
yet even then, the keepers of the vineyard have a private
vineyard of their own to look after, they have much home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work
when no out-work.</p>
               <p>There is a vast difference betwixt those fields which have
been well husbanded,<note place="margin">16. Prop.</note> and drest by a skilful and diligent
Husbandman; and those that have been long out of husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
How fragrant is the one! how dry and barren the other?
When you pass by a field well dressed and fenced, every
thing prosperous and in exquisite order, you may know
without farther enquiry, that a good Husband lives there.</p>
               <p>Thus stands the case betwixt those places which God hath
blest with a faithful painful Ministry,<note place="margin">Reddit.</note> and such as have none,
or worse than none: For as the Husbandmans cost and pains
appears in the verdant, and fragrant hew of his fields; so a
Ministers pains and diligence is (ordinarily) seen in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
lives, and flourishing graces of the people. The Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> where <hi>Paul</hi> and other holy
instruments spent much of their time and pains became fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
and flourishing Churches, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 2. A special bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
comes along with a godly Minister, to the place where special providence assigns him. Such places like <hi>Gideon's</hi>
fleece, have the dew of heaven lying on them, whiles others round about are dry and barren.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:42861:25"/>
The Husbandman is not discouraged,<note place="margin">17. Prop.</note> though the seed lye
long under the clods, he knows it will spring up at last, and
reward him, or those that come after him, for their pains
and patience in waiting for it.</p>
               <p>Ministers should not be presently discouraged in their
work,<note place="margin">Reddit.</note> because they see but little or no appearance, of all the
seed they have sown among the people. <hi>The servant of the
Lord must be patient towards all, waiting if at any time God will
give them repentance, 2 Tim.</hi> 24. 25. And if it never spring
up in his time, it may after his death; and if so, he shall
not fail of his reward, <hi>Iob. 4. 36, 37. And he that reapeth,
receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal, that both
he that someth, and he that reapeth may rejoyce together; and
herein is that saying true, one soweth, and another reapeth.</hi>
Though Ministers die, yet their words live; yea, their words
take hold of men when they are in the dust, <hi>Zech.</hi> 1. 6.</p>
               <p>Husbandmen find low ground and valleys,<note place="margin">18. Prop.</note> most fertile.
Hills, how loftily soever, they over-top the lower grounds,
yet answer not the Husbandmans pains, as the valleys do.
These are best watered and secured from the scorching heat
of the Sun.</p>
               <p>Experience shews us, that the humblest Saints are most
fruitful under the Gospel.<note place="margin">Reddit.</note> 
                  <hi>These are they that receive with
meekness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ingraffed word,</hi> Iam. 1. 21. whose influences
abide in them, as the rain doth in the low valleys. Happy is
that Minister, whose lot falls in such a pleasant valley. <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
are they that sow beside all such waters, that send forth thither
the feet of the ox and the ass,</hi> Isa. 32. 20. Among these valleys
run the pleasant springs, and purling brooks, which ferti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize
the neighbouring ground. Heavenly Ordinances there,
leave fruitful influences.</p>
               <p>The first Crop is usually the best; and the longer the
Husbandman tills his ground,<note place="margin">19. Prop.</note> the less it produces. After a
few years its vigour and strength if spent.</p>
               <p>The first entertainment of the Gospel is commonly the
best;<note place="margin">Reddit.</note> and what good is done by the Ministry, is often done
at its first entrance. New things are pretty, and very taking.
<hi>Iohn at first was to the Iews a burning and a shining light, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42861:25"/>
they were willing [for a season] to rejoyce in his light,</hi> Ioh. 5. 35.
<hi>Paul.</hi> was highly valued among the <hi>Galatians</hi> at first: such
was their zeal, that they could have pluckt out their eyes and
have given them to him; but how quickly did this full tyde
ebb again? for he complains, <hi>Gal. 4. 15. Where then is the
blessedness ye spake of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, When fields prove barren, and will not quit the
Husbandmans cost,<note place="margin">20. Prop.</note> nor answer the seed he sows in them,
he plucks up the hedges, and layes it waste.</p>
               <p>So when Churches grow formal and fruitless,<note place="margin">Reddit.</note> the Lord
removes his Gospel-presence from them; plucks up the
hedge of his protection from about them, and layes them
open, as waste ground, to be over-run by their enemies,
<hi>Ier. 7. 12. Go to</hi> Shiloh, <hi>and see what I did unto it.</hi> What is

And now go to (saith the great Husbandman) <hi>I will

its green banks, and shady bowers, and herbs, and trees, and
various objects to feed his eyes, and fragrant smells, and sweet
and various tunes of birds, together with the opportunities
of devout contemplation, that he cryed out admiringly,
<hi>Lord! what delights dost thou provide, even for the poor!</hi> How

and shame to Christians. Shall God's Husbandry,
which is so planted, watered, fenced, filled with favours and
mercies, be like the barren heath in the desert? Surely it
should be said of every soul that grows here, as the <hi>Historian</hi>
saith of <hi>Spain,</hi> that there is <hi>nihil infructuosum, nihil sterile;</hi>
nothing barren or unfruitful in it. God's vineyard is plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in a very fruitful hill, <hi>Isa. 5. 1. And surely they that are
planted in the house of the Lord, should flourish in the Court of our
God; they should bring forth fruit, even in old age, to shew that
God is upright,</hi> Psal. 92. 13, 14. <hi>They are created in Christ
Iesus unto good works, which God hath ordained they should walk

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42861:26"/>

                  <p>If the Church be God's Husbandry, then there is such a
special gracious presence of the Lord in his Churches, as is
not to be found in all the world beside. Where may you
expect to find the Husbandman, but in his own fields? there
lyes his business, and there he delights to be. And where
may we expect to find God, but in the Assemblies of his

that in reading them, a man can see little difference betwixt

                  <p>If the Church be God's Husbandry, then those that be
imployed in Ministerial work, ought to be men of great
judgment and experience in soul affairs; for these are the
labourers whom God, the mystical Husbandman imploys
and entrusts about his spiritual Husbandry. Should Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
imploy ignorant persons, that neither understand the
rules, nor proper seasons of Husbandry; how much would
such workmen damnifie and prejudice him? he will not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
such to weed his fields, as know not wheat from tares;
or to prune his trees, that think <hi>Midsummer</hi> as fit for that
work as <hi>December;</hi> much less will God. He qualifies all that
he sends, with wisdom for their work. <hi>His workmen approve
themselves workmen indeed, such as need not be ashamed, rightly
dividing the word of truth,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 15. As <hi>Bezaleel</hi> was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with wisdom, before he was imployed in Tabernacle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work,
so Christ instructs his servants, with skill and insight,
before they are imployed in Ministerial-work. He gives
them a mouth and wisdom, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 15. indues them with
power from on high: as Christ was filled abundantly with
the Spirit for his work, so according to proportion, are those
that are sent by him, <hi>Ioh. 20. 21, 22. As my Father hath sent
me, so send I you.</hi> And as for those that run before they are

                  <p>To conclude, If the Church be God's Husbandry, that
is, if Husbandry have so many resemblances of Gods works
about the Church in it, then how inexcusable is the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Husbandmen, in the things of God, who besides
the word of the Gospel, have the teachings of the Creatures;
and can hardly turn their hands to any part of their work,
but the Spirit hints one spiritual use or other from it to their
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42861:27"/>
souls? How do the Scriptures abound with Parables, and
lively similitudes taken from Husbandry? from the field,
the seed, the plow, the barn, from threshing and winnowing;
similitudes also from planting, graffing, and pruning of trees;
and not a few from the ordering of Cattel. So that, to
what business soever you turn your hands, in any part of
your calling, still God meets you, with one heavenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
or other. But alas! How few are able to improve
their civil imployments to such excellent ends? These things
are but briefly hinted in the Scriptures, and those hints scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
up and down, that they know not where to find, them;
and if they could, yet would it be difficult so to methodize
them, as it is necessary they should be, in order to their due improvement, by Meditation.</p>

them for your use; and in this manner to present them to
you, as you find them in the following Chapters. Read, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,

                  <p>The imployment of the Hsbandman is by all
acknowledged, to be very laborious; there
is a multiplicity of business incumbent on
him. The end of one work, is but the beginning
of another. Every season of the year brings its proper work
with it: Sometimes you find him in his <hi>Fields,</hi> dressing,
plowing, sowing, harrowing, weeding, or reaping; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in his <hi>Barn,</hi> threshing, or winnowing; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42861:29"/>
in his <hi>Orchard,</hi> planting, graffing, or pruning his trees,
and sometimes among his <hi>Cattel:</hi> so that he hath no time
to be idle. And as he hath a multiplicity of business, so
every part of it is full of toyl, and spending labour: He
eats not the bread of idleness, but earns it before he eats it;
and as it were, dips it in his own sweat, whereby it becomes
the sweeter to him. Though sin brought in the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
sweat, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 19. yet now not to sweat would increase
his sin, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 49.</p>

                  <head>APPLICATION.</head>
                  <p>BEhold here the life of a serious Christian, shadowed forth
to the life. As the life of a Husbandman, so the life of a
Christian is no idle, or easie life. They that take up Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
for <hi>ostentation,</hi> and not for an <hi>occupation;</hi> and those
that place the business of it in notions, and idle speculations,
in forms, gestures, and external observances, may think, and
call it so: but such as devote themselves unto it, and make
Religion their business, will find it no easie work to exercise
themselves to godliness. Many there are, that affect the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
and <hi>sweet</hi> of it, who cannot endure the labour, and
<hi>sweat</hi> of it. If men might be indulged to divide their hearts
betwixt God and the World, or to cull out the cheap and
easie duties of it, and neglect the more difficult and costly
ones, it were an easie thing to be a Christian: but surely to
have respect to all God's commandments, to live the life, as
well as speak, the language of a Christian: to be holy in all
manner of conversation, is not so easie. This will be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
by comparing the life of a Christian, with the life of
a Husbandman, in these five particulars: Wherein it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will
appear that the work of a Christian, is by much the hardest
work of the two.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The Husbandman hath much to do, many things to look
after; but the Christian more: If we respect the extensive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his work, he hath a large field indeed to labour in,
<hi>Psal. 119. 96. The commandment is exceeding broad;</hi> of a vast
extent and latitude, comprizing not only a multitude of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42861:29"/>
acts, and duties, and guiding the Offices of the outward
man about them, but also taking in every thought and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the inner man within its compass.</p>
                  <p>You find in the Word, a world of work cut out for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;
there's hearing work, praying work, reading, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating,
and self-examining work; it puts him also upon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
watch over all the corruptions of his heart. Oh, what
a world of work hath a Christian about them? For of them
he may say, as the <hi>Historian</hi> doth of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> They are never
quiet, whether conquering, or conquered. How many weak
languishing graces hath he to recover, improve, and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then?
There is a weak faith, a languishing love, dull and
faint desires to be quickned and invigorated. And when all
this is done, what a multitude of work do his several relations
exact from him? he hath a world of business incumbent on
him, as a parent, child, husband, wife, master, servant, or
friend; yea, not only to friends, but enemies. And beside all
this, how many difficult things are there to be born and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
for Christ? and yet will not God allow his people in
the neglect of any one of them: neither can he be a Christian
that hath not respect to every command, and is not holy, in
all manner of conversation, <hi>Psal. 119. 6. 2 Pet.</hi> 3. 11. every
one of these duties, like the several spokes in a wheel come
to bear in the whole round of a Christians conversation:
so that he hath more work upon his hands than the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman.</p>
                  <p>The Husbandman's work is confessed to be Spending <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
work, but not like the Christians. What <hi>Augustus</hi> said of
the young <hi>Roman,</hi> is verified in the true Christian, <hi>Quicquid
vult válde vult.</hi> Whatsoever he doth in Religion, he doth
to purpose. Under the Law, God rejected the <hi>Snail</hi> and the
<hi>Ass,</hi> Levit. 11. 30. <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. 13. And under the Gospel,
he allows no sluggish lazy Professor, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 11, 13.
Sleepy duties are utterly unsuitable to the living God; he
will have the very spirits distilled and offered up to him in
every duty, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 24. he bestows upon his people the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
substance and kernel of mercies, and will not accept
from them the shells and shadows of duties; not the skin,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42861:30"/>
but the inwards, and the fat that covereth the inwards, was
required under the Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 30. And every sacrifice
under the Gospel, must be <hi>sacrificium medullatum,</hi>
a sacrifice
full of marrow; observe the manner in which their work is
to be performed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 11. in serving God, servent in spirit, or hissing
hot.</p>
                  <p>2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. in securing salvation, diligent; or doing it
throughly, and enough.</p>
                  <p>1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 7. in godliness, exercising, or stripping them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,

                  <p>
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 24. in the pursuit of happiness, striving, even

                  <p>
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 7. in prayer, serving God instantly; or in a
stretched-out manner; yea, pouring out their hearts before
him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 62. 8 as if the body were left like a dead corps
upon the knees, whilst the spirit is departed from it, and
ascended to God. This is the manner of his work: judge
then how much harder this work is, than to spend the sweat
of the brow in manual labour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The Husbandman finds his work as he left it, he can begin
one day, where he left the other; but it is not so with the
Christian, a bad heart, and a busie devil, disorder and spoyl
his work every day. The Christian finds not his heart in the
morning, as he left it at night; and even when he is about
his work, how many set-backs doth he meet with? Satan
stands at his right hand (the working hand) to resist him,
<hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 1. when he would do good, evil (the evil of his own
heart and nature) is present with him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The Husbandman hath some resting days, when he throws
aside all his work, and takes his recreation; but the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
hath no resting day, till his dying day; and then he
shall rest from his labours. Religion allows no idle dayes,
<hi>but requires him to be always abounding in the work of the Lord,
1 Cor.</hi> 15. 58. When one duty is done, another calls for him;
the Lord's day is a day of rest to the Husbandman; but no
day in the week so laborious to the Christian. O 'tis a
spending day to him. When he hath gathered in the crop of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42861:30"/>
one duty; he is not to sit down satisfied therewith, or say as
that rich worldling did, <hi>Luke 12. 19. Soul take thine ease,
thou hast goods laid up for many years,</hi> but must to plow again,
and count it well if the Vintage reach to the seed-time, <hi>Lev.</hi>
26. 5. I mean, if the strength, influence, and comforts of
one duty, hold out to another duty; and that it may be so,
and there be no room left for idleness, God hath appointed
ejaculatory prayer, to fill up the intervals, betwixt stated
and the more solemn duties. These are to keep in the fire,
which kindled the morning, sacrifice, to kindle the evening
sacrifice. When can the Christian sit down and say, now all
my work is ended, I have nothing to do, without doors, or
within?</p>
                  <p>Lastly, There is a time when the labour of the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is ended; old age and weakness takes him off from all
imployment; they can only look upon their labourers, but
cannot do a stroke of work themselves; they can tell you
what they did in their younger years, but now (say they) we
must leave it to younger people; we cannot be young always:
but the Christian is never super-annuated as to the work of
Religion; yea, the longer he lives, the more his Master ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
from him. When he is full of dayes, God expects he
should be full of fruits, <hi>Psal. 9. 14. They shall bring forth fruit
in old age, they shall be fat and flourishing.</hi>

                  <head>OBSERVATION.</head>
                  <p>INdustry and diligence is the way to thrive and grow rich
in the world.<note place="margin">Upon the thriftiness of the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</note> The earth must be manured, or its increase
is in vain expected; <hi>Qui fugit molam, fugit farinam;</hi> he that
refuses the mill, refuses the meal, (saith the Proverb) the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
soul shall be made fat. <hi>Solomon</hi> hath two proverbs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
thriftiness and increase in the world. In <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 4. he
saith, <hi>The hand of the diligent maketh rich.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 22. he saith,
<hi>The blessing of the Lord maketh rich.</hi> These are not <hi>contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
but <hi>confirmatory</hi> each of other; one speaks of the <hi>principal,</hi>
the other of the <hi>instrumental</hi> cause. Diligence without Gods
blessing will not do it; and that blessing cannot be expected
without diligence; therefore Husbandmen ply their business
with unwearied pains, they do even lodge in the midst of
their labours, as that good Husband <hi>Boaz</hi> did, <hi>Ruth</hi> 2. 3. they
are <hi>parsimonious</hi> of their time, but <hi>prodigal</hi> of their sweat and
strength, because they find this to be the thriving way.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>APPLICATION.</head>
                  <p>AS nature opens her treasures to none but the diligent,
so neither doth grace. He that will be <hi>rich,</hi> must be a
<hi>painful</hi> Christian; and whosoever will closly ply the trade
of godliness, shall comfortably and quickly find, <hi>That in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Gods commands there is great reward,</hi> Psal. 19. 11. God is a
<hi>bountiful rewarder of such as diligently seek him,</hi> Heb. 11. 6.
They must not indeed work for wages,<note place="margin">Non mercurii sed operarii.</note> nor yet will God suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
their work to go unrewarded; yea, it sufficiently rewards
it self, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 6. and its reward is twofold, (1) present, and
in part; (2) future and in full, <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 29, 30. Now in this
time an hundred-fold, even from suffering, which seems
the most unprofitable part of the work, and in the world
to come, life everlasting. If you ask what present
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42861:32"/>
advantage Christians have by their diligence? I answer, as
much and more than the Husbandman hath from all his toyls
and labours. Let us compare the particulars, and see what
the Husbandman gets, that the Christian gets not also. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
your gains, and you'l quickly see the odds.</p>
                  <p>You get credit and reputation by your diligence; 'tis a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
commendation and honour to you, to be active and stirring
men: But how much more honour doth God put upon his
laborious servants? 'Tis the highest honour of a creature,
to be active and useful for its God. Saints are called <hi>vessels
of honour,</hi> as they are fitted for the Masters use, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 21.
Wherein consists the honour of <hi>Angels,</hi> but in this; that they
are ministring spirits, serviceable creatures? And all the
<hi>Apostles</hi> gloried in the title of servants. The lowest office
in which a man can serve God, even that of a <hi>Nethinim,</hi> or
door-keeper, which was the lowest order or rank of officers
in the house of God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44. 10, 11. is yet preferred
by <hi>David</hi> before the service of the greatest Prince on earth,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 84. 10. 'Tis no small honour to be active for God.</p>
                  <p>You have this benefit by your labour, that thereby you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
avoid loose and evil company, which would draw you into
mischief. By diligence for God, the Christian also is secured
from temptations; <hi>God is with them, while they are with him,
2 Chron.</hi> 15. 2. Communion with God in the way of duty,
is a great preservative against temptations. The <hi>School-men</hi> put the question, how the Angels and glorified Saints become
impeccant? and resolve it thus: That they are secured from
sin, by the beatifical vision; and sure-I am, that the visions
of God, not only in glory, but now also in duty, are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous
defences against sin; and they that are most
active for God, have the fullest and clearest visions of God,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 21.</p>
                  <p>You have this benefit by your labour, that it tends much <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
to the health of your bodies. The Christian hath this bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
by his labour, that it tends to a faithful state of soul;
<hi>The way of the Lord is strength to the upright,</hi> Prov. 10. 29. As
those that follow their daily labours in the field, have much
more health than Citizens that live idly, or Scholars that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42861:33"/>
live a sedentary life. So the active Christian enjoys more
spiritual health, and is troubled with fewer complaints than
others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> By diligence in your civil imployments, you preserve
your estates, and are kept from running behind-hand in the
world. <hi>Bayliffs</hi> trouble not such mens doors; they usually
have the fore-foot of their neighbours. And by activity and
diligence for God, souls are kept from backsliding, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
back in their graces and comforts. Remissions and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions
in our duties, are the first steps and degrees by which
a soul declines and wastes, as to his spiritual estate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Your pains and diligence in the fields, makes your beds
sweet to you at night, <hi>Eccl. 5. 12. Rest is sweet to a labouring
man, whether he eat little or much.</hi> But the diligent life of a
Christian makes the clods of the valley, his grave sweet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 12. 2 King. 20. 3. Remember now, O Lord,
how I have walked before thee,</hi> &amp;c. Think Christian, how sweet
it will be for thee when thou comest to dye; to say then as
thy Redeemer did, when near his death, <hi>Ioh. 17. 4, 5. I have
finished the work thou gavest me to do; and now, O Father, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
me with thine own self.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> The expence of your sweat fills your purses, you get estates
by your diligence and labour; but what are your gains to the
gains of Christians? They can get in an hour, that which
they will not part with for all the gold and silver on earth,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 14.</p>
                  <p>So that compare these labourers as to all their advantages,
and you shall see, that there is no trade like that which the
diligent Christian drives.</p>

and sloth,<note place="margin">Reflections of the slothful soul.</note> which is attended with so many spiritual wants!
and can I wonder at it, when I refuse the painful way of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

be had with wishes, I should not want them; but to dig

21. 25. If every duty were to be rewarded presently with
gold, would I not have been more assiduous in them, than I
have been? And yet I know that a heart full of the grace and
comfort of the holy Ghost, is better than a house full of gold
and silver. O what a composition of stupidity and sloth am
I! I have been all for the short cut to comfort, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
experience teacheth, that the farther way about, by
painful duty, is the nearest way to it. What pains do Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen

                  <p>Secondly, if there be such great rewards attending dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
in duty, then why art thou so apt (O my soul) to cast
off duty, because thou findest not present comfort in it? how
quickly am I discouraged, if I presently find not what I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
in duty? Whereas, the Well is deep, and much pains
must be taken to draw up those waters of joy, <hi>Isa.</hi> 12. 3.
there is a golden vein in the mount of duty, but it lyes deep;
and because I meet not with it as soon as I expect, my lazy
heart throws by the shovel, and cryes, Dig I cannot.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if this be indeed the rich and thriving trade,<note place="margin">The world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> why <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
do I peddle about the poor low things of the world so much,
neglecting the rich trade of godliness for it? O, how much
of my time and strength have these things devoured? Had
I imployed that time in communion with God, would it not
have turn'd to a better account? Think'st thou in earnest,
O my soul, that God hath indowed thee with such excellent
faculties, capable of the most divine and heavenly imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or that Iesus Christ hath shed his invaluably precious
bloud, or that he hath sent forth the glorious spirit of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and all this to fit men for no higher or nobler imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
than these?</p>
                  <p>Is this the end of thy wonderful creation? Doth God
whirl about the heavens in endless revolutions, to beget time
for this? or doth he not rather expect that the weightiest
work should engross thy greatest strength, and choicest
hours? O, that I could once consider, what a good Master

Christians serve, who will not only abundantly reward them
at night; but brings them their food into the field to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage

                  <p>THough the labours of Husbandmen are very great and
toylsom, yet with what cheerfulness do they go through
them? It is very delightful to hear the melody they make
by whistling, as they follow the Plow; yea, the very horses
have their Bells, which make a pleasant noise. <hi>Horses</hi> (saith
Mr. <hi>Fuller) will do more for a whistle, than a whip;</hi> and their
Bells do as it were, gingle away their weariness. I have been
often delighted with this Country musick, whereby they
sweeten their hard labours with an innocent pleasure, and

Against both he prayes <hi>equally,</hi> not <hi>absolutely;</hi> that had been
his sin, but comparatively and submissively to the will of
God. He had rather, if God see it fit, to avoid both these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams;

Or, according to the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> give me my prey or

among them; they bring them enough to preserve
their lives, but not more than enough to lye mouldering in
the nest. Such a proportion <hi>Agur</hi> desired; and the reason
why he desired it, is drawn from the danger of both the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams.
He measured (like a wise Christian) the conveniency
or inconveniency of his estate in the world, by its suitableness
or unsutableness to the end of his being; which is the service
of God. He accounted the true excellency of his life to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist

he could not see how a <hi>redundancy</hi> or too great a <hi>penury</hi> of

in our daily bread, by a daily providence. It is betwixt

a refreshing shower to their souls, as well as bodies. Most

look upon all as coming in an ordinary natural course, and

                  <p>Many mercies come unask'd for, and they require thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness;
but when mercies come in upon prayer, and as a

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Say,<note place="margin">A convictive Reflection</note> O my soul! dost thou not remember, when like the
beloved Disciple thou <hi>layest</hi> in <hi>Iesus</hi> bosome? how didst thou
sweeten communion with him? how restless and impatient
wast thou in his absence! Divine withdrawments were to
thee as the hell of hell: What a burden was the world to
me in those dayes! Had it not been for conscience of my
duty, I could have been willing to let all lye, that communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with Christ might suffer no interruption. When I awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
in the night, how was the darkness enlightned by the
heavenly glimpses of the countenance of my God upon me?
How did his company shorten those hours, and beguile the
tediousness of the night? O my soul, speak thy experience,
is it now as it was then! No, no, those dayes are past and
gone, and thou become much a stranger to that heavenly
life. Art thou able with truth to deny this charge? When
occasionally I pass by those places, which were once to me
as <hi>Iacob's Bethel</hi> to him; I sigh at the remembrance of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
passages betwixt me and heaven there; and say with <hi>Iob,</hi>
Chap. 29. <hi>O that it were with me as in moneths past, as in
the dayes when God preserved me, when his candle shined upon my
head, when by his light I walked through darkness, when the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
was yet with me, when I put on righteosness and it cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

things, my soul is poured out within me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is thy obedience to the commands of Christ, and motions
to duty, as free and cheerful as they were wont to be? Call
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to mind, my soul, the times when thou wast born down the
stream of love to every duty, if the spirit did but whisper
to thee, saying, <hi>Seek my face,</hi> how did my spirit eccho to his
calls? saying, <hi>Thy face Lord will I seek,</hi> Psal. 27. 8. If God
had any work to be done, how readily did I offer my service?
Here am I lord, send me. My soul made me as the chariots

<hi>his commandments were not grievous,</hi> 1 Iohn 5. 3. <hi>Non tardat

no such excuses and delayes as there are now. No,
such was my love to Christ, and delight to do his will, that
I could no more keep back my self from duty, than a man
that's carried away in a crowd.</p>
                  <p>Or lastly, tell me, O my soul, dost thou bemoan thy self,
or grieve so tenderly for sin, and for grieving the holy Spirit
of God, as hou wast wont to do? When formerly I had
fallen by the hanbd of a temptation, how was I wont to lye
in tears at the Lord's feet, bemoaning my self? how did I
hasten to my closet, and there cry like <hi>Ezra,</hi> Chap. 9. 6.
<hi>O my God, I am ashamed, and blush to look up unto thee.</hi> How did
I sigh and weep before him, and like <hi>Ephraim,</hi> smite upon my
thigh, saying, <hi>What have I done?</hi> Ah my soul how didst thou
work, strive, and cast about, how to recover thy self again?
hast thou forgotten, how thou wouldst sometimes look up
and sigh bitterly; Ah! what a God have I provoked? whjat
love and goodness have I abused? sometimes look in and
weep, Ah! what motions did I withstand? what a good spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
have I grieved? Ah! my soul thou wouldst have abhor'd
thy self, thou couldst never have born it, had thy heart been
as stupid and as relentless then as now. If ever a poor soul had

                  <p>ALthough the industry and skill of the Husbandman can
make some ground that was useless and bad, good for
tillage or pasture, and improve that which was barren, and
by his cost and pains make one Acre worth ten; yet such is
the nature of some rocky or miry ground, where the water
stands, and there is no way to cleanse it, that it can never be
made fruitful. The Husband-man is fain to let it alone, as an
incurable piece of wast and worthless ground; and though
the Sun and clouds shed their influences on it, as well as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
better Land, yet that doth not at all mend it. Nay, the
more showers it receives, the worse it proves. For these do no
way fecundate or improve it; nothing thrives there, but worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
flags and rushes.</p>

                  <p>(1) In miry places the water hath not free passage, but
stands and settles there. So it is with these barren souls;

hearers, as it doth in these.</p>
                  <p>(2) In a miry place, the earth and water is mixt together;
this mixture makes mire. So when the truths of God do
mix with the corruptions of men, that they either hold some
truths, and yet live in their lusts, or else when men do make
use of the truths of God to justifie and plead for their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Or,</p>
                  <p>(3) When as in a miry place, the longer the water stands
in it, the worse it grows; so the longer men abide under
Ordinances, the more filthy and polluted they grow: These
are the miry places that cannot be healed, their disease is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable,
desperate.</p>
                  <p>O this is a sad case, and yet very common! Many persons
are thus given over; as incorrigible and hopeless, <hi>Rev. 22. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Let him that is filthy, be filthy still.</hi> Ier. 6. 29. <hi>Reprobate silver

<hi>make the heart of this people fat, their ears dull,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Christ executes by the Gospel that curse upon many souls,
which he denounced against the figtree, <hi>Mat. 21. 19. Let
no fruit grow on thee henceforth for ever, and immediately the fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree
withered away.</hi> To be given up to such a condition, is a
fearful judgement indeed, a curse with a witness; the sum of
all plagues, miseries and judgments, a fatal stroke at the root
it self. It's a wo to have a bad heart, (saith one) but it's the
depth of wo, to have a heart that shall never be made better.
To be barren under the Gospel is a sore judgement, but to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:42861:48"/>
have that <hi>pertinax sterilit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s,</hi> a pertinacious barrenness; this
is to be twice dead, and pluckt up by the root, as <hi>Iude</hi>
speaks.</p>
                  <p>And to shew you the woful and miserable state and plight
of such men, let the following particulars be weighed.
(1) Its a stroke at the soul it self, an inward spiritual judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and by how much the more inward and spiritual any
judgement is, by so much the more dreadful and lamentable.
As soul mercies, are the best of mercies; so, soul-judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
are the saddest of all judgements. If it were but a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
stroke upon the body, the loss of an eye, an ear, a hand,
a foot, though in it self it would be a considerable loss; yet
it were nothing to this. <hi>Omnia Deus dedit duplicia</hi> (saith <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom</hi>)
speaking of bodily members; God hath given men
double members, two eyes, if one be lost, the other sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
its wants; two hands, two ears, two feet, that the fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of one, may be supplyed by the help of the other; <hi>animam
vero unam;</hi> but one soul, if that perish, there is not another
to supply its loss. The soul, saith a <hi>Heathen,</hi> is the man, that
which is seen is not the man. The Apostle calls the body a
vile body, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 21. and so it is compared with the soul;
and <hi>Daniel</hi> calls it the <hi>Sheath,</hi> which is but a contemptible
thing to the sword, which is in it. O it were far better that
many bodies perish, than one soul; that every member were
made the seat, and subject of the most exquisite torture, than
such a judgement should fall upon the soul.</p>
                  <p>(2) It's the severest stroke God can inflict upon the soul
in this life, to give it up to barrenness; because it cuts off
all hopes, frustrates all means, nothing can be a blessing to
him. If one come from the dead, if Angels should descend
from heaven to preach to him; there is no hope of him. If
God shut up a man, who can open? <hi>Iob</hi> 12. 14. As there was
none found in heaven or earth, that could open the seals of
that book, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 5. so is there no opening by the hand of
the most able and skilful Ministry, those seals of hardness,
blindness and unbelief, thus impressed upon the spirit. Whom
j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>stice so locks up, mercy will never let out. This is that
which makes up the <hi>Anathema Maranatha,</hi> 1 Cor. 16. 22.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42861:48"/>
which is the dreadfullest curse in all the book of God, cacursed
till the Lord come.</p>
                  <p>(3) 'Tis the most indiscernable stroke to themselves, that
can be, and by that so much the more desperate. Hence
there is said to be powred out upon them the spirit of slumber,
<hi>Isa. 29. 10. The Lord hath powred out upon you the spirit of deep
sleep, and hath closed your eyes. Montanus</hi> renders it, The Lord
hath mingled upon you the spirit of deep sleep. And so it is an
allusion to a soporiferous Medicine mingled and made up of
<hi>opium</hi> and such like stupifactive ingredients, which casts a
man into such a dead sleep, that do what you will to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
he feels, he knows it not. <hi>Make their eyes heavy, and their
ears dull; lest they should see, and hear, and be converted,</hi> Isa. 6.
9, 10. This is the heart which cannot repent, which is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 5. For men are not sensible at all of this
judgment, they do not in the least suspect it, and that is
their misery. Though they be cursed trees which shall never
bear any fruit to life, yet many times they bear abundance
of other fair and pleasant fruits to the eye, excellent gifts and
rare endowments? And these deceive and undo them. <hi>Mat.
7. 22. We have prophecyed in thy name;</hi> this makes the wound
desperate, that there is no finding of it, no probe to search
it.</p>
                  <p>(4) 'Tis a stroke that cuts off from the soul all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and sweetness of Religion. A man may pray, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ar, and
confer, but all those duties are dry stalks unto him, which
yield no meat, no solid substantial nutriment; some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
touches upon the affections he may sometimes find in
duty, the melting voice or Rhetorick of the Preacher may
perhaps strike his natural affections, as another Tragical sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
pathetically delivered may do; but to have any real com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with God in Ordinances, any discoveries or views
of the beauty of the Lord in them, that he cannot have;
for these are the special effects and operations of the Spirit,
which are alwayes restrained.</p>
                  <p>God hath said to such, as he did to them. <hi>Gen. 6. 3. My

would alwayes follow, unless miraculously stopt and
hindred; but it works like <hi>a moral instituted cause,</hi> whose effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
and success depends upon the arbitrary concurrence of
the Spirit with it. <hi>The wind blows where it listeth, so is ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

one that is born of the Spirit,</hi> Ioh. 3. 8. <hi>Of his own will begat he
us by the word of truth.</hi> Ordinances are as the pool of <hi>Bethesda,</hi>
which had its healing vertue only when the <hi>Angel</hi> moved the
waters; but the spirit never moves savingly upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Ordinances, for the healing of these souls, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
years soever they lye by them. Though others feel a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
power in them, yet they shall not. As the men that
travelled with <hi>Paul,</hi> when Christ appeared to him from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
they saw the light, but heard not the voice, which he
heard to salvation: So it is with these, they see the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
hear the words, which are words of salvation to others,
but not so to them. Concerning these miserable Souls, we
may sigh and say to Christ, as <hi>Martha</hi> did concerning her
brother <hi>Lazarus;</hi> Lord, if thou hadst been here, in this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
or in this prayer, this soul had not remained dead. But
here is the woe that lyes upon him, God is departed from the
means, and none can help him.</p>
                  <p>(5.) 'Tis such a stroke upon the spirit of man, as is a
fearful sign of his eternal reprobation. 'Tis true we cannot
positively say of a man in this life, he is a reprobate, one
that God will never shew mercy to; but yet there are some
probable marks of it upon some men in this world, and they
are of a trembling consideration where-ever they appear?
of which this is one of the saddest, 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 3. If our Gospel
be hid, tis hid to those that are lost, in whom the God of this world
hath blinded the minds of them which believe not; lest the light of
the glorious Gospel of Christ, who is the Image of God, should shine
unto them.</hi> So <hi>Act. 13. 48. As many as were ordained unto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life believed. Ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep,</hi> Ioh.
10. 26. And again, <hi>Mat 13. 11. To you it is given to know the
mysteries of the Kingdom, but to them it is not given.</hi> There can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42861:49"/>
be a more dreadful Character of a person marked out for
wrath, than to continue under the Ordinances, as the Rocks
and miry places do under the natural influences of heaven.
What blessed opportunities had <hi>Iudus?</hi> he was under Christ's
own Ministry, he often heard the gracious words that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
out of his mouth; he was night and day in his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
yet never the better; and why? because he was <hi>the son
of perdition;</hi> that is, a man appointed to destruction and
wrath.</p>
                  <p>(6) And lastly, to add no more. 'Tis such a stroke of God
upon the soules of men, as immediately foreruns hell and
damnation, <hi>Heb. 6. 8. But that which beareth thorns and bryars
is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing, whose end is to be burnt.</hi> So
that look as some Saints in this world, have had a prelibation
or foretaste of heaven, which the Scripture calls <hi>the earnest of
the Spirit;</hi> so this is a precursor of hell, a sign of wrath at
the door. We may say of it, as 'tis said of the pale horse in
the <hi>Revelation,</hi> that hell follows it. <hi>If a man abide not in me</hi>
(saith Christ, <hi>Iohn 156.) he is cast forth as a branch and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered;</hi>
which is the very state of these barren, cursed souls,
And what follows? Why, saith he, men gather them, and
cast them into the fire, and they are burned. Lo this is the
vengeance which the Gospel executes upon this barren
ground.</p>

to manage and guide the plow. The Hebrew word
which we translate to plow, signifies to be intent, as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer
is about some curious piece of work. The plow must
neither go too shallow nor too deep in the earth; it must
not indent the ground by making crooked furrows, nor leap
and make baulks in good ground; but be guided as to a just
depth of earth, so to cast the furrow in a straight line, that
the floor or surface of the field may be made plain. As it is
<hi>Isa.</hi> 28. 25. And hence that expression, <hi>Luke 9. 62. He that
puts his hand to the plow, and looks back, is not fit for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven.</hi> The meaning is, that as he that plows, must
have his eyes alwayes forward, to guide and direct his hand
in casting the furrows straight and even; (for his hand will
be quickly out when his eye is off). So he that heartily
resolves for heaven, must addict himself wholly and intently
to the business of Religion, and not have his mind intangled
with the things of this world, which he hath left behind him;
whereby it appears, that the right management of the plow,
requires as much skill as strength.</p>

                  <p>(3.) The plow rends the earth in parts and pieces, which
before was united, and makes those parts hang loose, which
formerly lay closs. Thus doth the spirit of conviction rend
in sunder the heart, and its most beloved lusts, <hi>Ioel. 2. 13.
Rent your <unclear>hearts</unclear>, and not your garments;</hi> that is, rather then
your garments; for the sense is comparative, though the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
be negative. And this rending implyes, not only acute
pain; flesh cannot be rent asunder without anguish; nor yet
only force and violence; the heart is a stubborn and knotty
piece and will not easily yield, but it also implies a dis-union
of parts united: as when a garment, or the earth, or any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuous
body is rent; those parts are separated which fomer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cleaved together. Sin and the Soul were glewed fast toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
before, there was no parting of them, they would as
soon part with their lives, as with their <hi>lusts;</hi> but now when
the heart is rent for them truely; it is also rent from them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlastingly,
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 7. 15. to 19.</p>
                  <p>(4) The plow turns up, and discovers such things as lay
hid in the bosome of the earth before, and were covered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a fair green surface, from the eyes of men. Thus when
the Lord plows up the heart of a sinner by conviction, then
the secrets of his heart are made manifest, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 24, 25.
the most secret and shameful sins will then our; <hi>for the word
of God is quick and powerful, sharper than any two edged sword,
piercing even to the dividing of the soul and spirit, the joynts and

of the heart, Heb.</hi> 4. 12. It makes the fire burn inwardly, so
that the soul hath no rest till confession give a vent to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Fain would the shuffling sinner conceal and hide his
shame; but the word follows him through all his sinful shifts,
and brings him at last to be his own, both accuser, witness
and judge.</p>

                     </gap>) The work of the plow is but <hi>opus ordinabile:</hi> a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative
work in order to fruit. Should the Husbandman
plow his ground never so often, yet if the seed be not cast in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42861:53"/>
and quickned, in vain is the Harvest expected. Thus convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
also is but a preparative to a farther work upon the soul
of a sinner. If it stick there, and go no farther, it proves
but an abortive or untimely birth. Many have gone thus far,
and there they have stuck; they have been like a field plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but not sowed, which is a matter of trembling conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
for hereby their sin is greatly aggravated, and their
eternal misery so much the more increased. O when a poor
damned creature shall with horror reflect upon himself in
hell, how near was I once under such a Sermon, to conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion?
My sins were set in order before me, my conscience
awakened and terrified with the guilt of them; many p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and resolves I had then to turn to God, which had they
been perfected by answerable executions, I had never come
to this place of torment; but there I stuck, and that was my
eternal undoing. Many souls have I known so terrified with
the guilt of sin, that they have come roaring under horrors
of conscience to the Preacher; so that one would think such
a breach had been made between them and sin, as could never
be reconciled; and yet, as angry as they were in that fit with
sin, they have hug'd and imbraced them again.</p>
                  <p>(6) 'Tis best plowing when the earth is prepared and
mollified by the showers of rain, then the work goes on
sweetly and easily. And never doth the heart so kindly melt,
as when the Gospel clouds dissolve, and the free grace and
love of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> comes sweetly showing down upon it;
then it relents and mourns ingeniously, <hi>Ezek. 16. 63. That
thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy

thee for all that thou hast done.</hi> So it was with that poor peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
<hi>Luke</hi> 7. 38. when the Lord Iesus had discovered to
her the super-abounding riches of his grace, in the pardon of
her manisold abominations; her heart melted within her, she
washed the feet of <hi>Christ</hi> with tears. And indeed, there is
as much difference betwixt the tears which are forced by the
terrors of the law, and those which are extracted by the
grace of the Gospel, as there is betwixt those of a condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
malefactor, who weeps to consider the misery he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:42861:53"/>
and those of a pardoned malefactor, that receives his
pardon at the foot of the ladder, and is melted by the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and clemency of his gracious Prince towards him.</p>
                  <p>(7) The plow kills those ranck weeds that grow in the
field, turns them up by the roots, buries and rots them. So
doth saving conviction kill sin at the root, makes the soul
sick of it, begets indignation in the heart against it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>

                  <p>HUsbandmen are very careful and curious about their
Seed-corn, that it may not only be clean and pure, but
the best and most excellent in its kind, <hi>Isa. 28. 25. He east<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in the principal Wheat.</hi> If any be more full and weighty
than other, that is reserved for Seed. 'Tis usual with Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen
to pick and lease their Seed-corn by hand, that they
may separate the Cockel and Darnel, and all the lighter and
hollow grains from it, wherein they manifest their discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for according to the vigor and goodness of the Seed, the
fruit and production is like to be.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>APPLICATION.</head>
                  <p>THe choice and Principal Seed-corn with which the fields
are sowed, after they are prepared for it, doth admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably
shadow forth those excellent principles of grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
into the regenerate soul. Their agreement, as they are
both seed, is obvious in the ten following particulars, and
their excellency above other principles in seven more.</p>
                  <p>The earth at first naturally brought forth Corn, and every
Seed yielding fruit, without humane industry; but since the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
curse came upon it, it must be plowed and sowed, or no fruit
can be expected. So man at first had all the principles of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
in his nature, but now they must be infused by regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42861:56"/>
or else his nature is as void of holiness as the barren
and untilled desart is of Corn.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The earlier the Seed is sown, the better it is rooted and
enabled to endure the asperities of the Winter; so when
grace is early infused, when nature is sanctified in the bud,
grace is thereby exceedingly advantaged. 'Twas <hi>Timothies</hi>
singular advantage, that he knew the scriptures of a
Child.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Frosts and snows conduce very much to the well rooting
of the seed, and makes it spread and take root much the
better. So do Sanctified afflictions, which usually the people
of God meet with after their calling, and often in their very
Seed-time, 1 <hi>Thes. 1. 6. And you became followers of us and
of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction.</hi> But if
they have fair weather then, to be sure they shall meet with
weather hard enough afterwards, <hi>Heb. 10. 32: But call to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
the former dayes, in which after ye were illuminated,
ye indured a great fight of afflictions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> When the Seed is cast into the earth, it must be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
up by the harrow; the use whereof in Husbandry, is
not only to lay a plain floor (as they speak) but to open and
let in the Corn to the bosome of the earth, and there cover it
up for its security, from birds that would devour it. Thus
doth the most wise God provide for the security of that
grace, which he at first disseminated in the hearts of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
He is as well the finisher as the Author of their grace,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2. And of this they may be confident, that he that
hath begun a good work in them, will perform it unto the day
of Christ. The care of God over the graces of his people,
is like the covering of the seed for security.</p>
                  <p>Seed-Corn is in its own nature, of much more value and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> worth than other Corn; the Husbandman casts in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
wheat. So are the seeds of grace sown in the renewed
soul; for it's called, <hi>The seed of God, 1 Iohn 3. 9. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

all the glory of this world; its more precious than gold
which perishes, I <hi>Pet. 1. 7. The price of it is above rubies, and
all that thou canst desire is not to be comp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

There is a great deal of Spirit and vigour in a little Seed,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
though it be small in bulk, yet it is great in vertue and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay.
Gracious habits are also vigorous and efficatious things.
Such is their efficacy that they overcome the world, 1 <hi>Ioh.
5. 4. Whatsoeve is born of God, overcometh the world.</hi> They
totally alter and change the person in whom they are. <hi>He that
persecuted us in times past, now preacheth the faith which once
he destroyed.</hi> They enable the soul to do and suffer great things
for God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 33, 34, 35.</p>
                  <p>The stalk and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ar are potentially and virtually in a small <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
grain of Corn. So are all the fruits of obedience which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
afterwards bring forth to God, vertually contained in
those habits of seeds of grace. 'Tis strange to consider, that
from a mustard-seed (which as Christ saith is the least of all
seeds) should grow such great branches, that the birds of the
Air may build their nests in them. Surely the heroical and
famous acts and atchievements of the most renowed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
sprang from sinall beginnings at first, to that eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and glory.</p>
                  <p>The fruitfulness of the seed depends upon the Sun and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>
rain, by which they are quickened, as is opened largely in
the next Chapter. And the principles of grace in us have as
necessary a dependance upon the assisting and exciting grace
without us. For though it be true, they are immortal seeds;
yet that is not so much from their own strength, as from the
promises made to them, and that constant influx from
above, by which they are revived and preserved from time to
time.</p>
                  <p>The seed is fruitful in some soyls more than in others,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/>
prospers much better, and comes sooner to maturity. So doth
grace thrive better, and grow faster in some persons than in
others. <hi>Your faith groweth exceedingly,</hi> 2 Thes. 1. 3. <hi>Whilst the
things that are in others are ready to die,</hi> Rev. 3. 2. Though no
mans heart be naturally a kind soyl to grace, yet doubtless
grace is more advantaged in some dispositions than in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p>And lastly, their agreement as Seed appears in this, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
Seed-corn is scattered into all parts of the field, as propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42861:57"/>
and equally as may be. So is grace diffus'd into all
the faculties, judgment, will, and all the affections are sowed
with these new principles, <hi>The God of peace sanctifie you whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
1 Thes.</hi> 5. 23.</p>
                  <p>And thus you see, why principles of grace are called seed.
Now in the next place, (which is the second thing promised
and mainly designed in this Chapter) to shew you the choice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and excellency of these holy principles with which san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
souls are embellisht and adorned, and to convince you
that true grace excels all other principles, by which other
persons are acted, even as the principal wheat doth the chaff,
and refuse stuff. I shall here institute a comparison betwixt
grace, and the most splendid common gifts in the world,
and its transcendent excellency above them all will evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appear in the seven following particulars.</p>
                  <p>The most excellent common gifts come out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> treasury of God's bounty, and that in a natural way,
they are but the improvement of a mans natural abilities
or (as one calls them) the sparks of nature blown up by the
wind of a more benign and liberal education; but principles
of grace are of a divine and heavenly original and extraction
not educed or raised from nature, but supernaturally infused
by the Spirit from on high, <hi>Ioh. 3. 6. That which is born of
the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the spirit is spirit.</hi> When
a soul is sanctified by them, <hi>he partakes of the divine nature,</hi>
2 Pet. 1. 4. <hi>Is born not of flesh, nor of blood, nor of the will of
man, but of God, Ioh.</hi> 1. 13. In this respect they differ from
gifts, as the heavenly Manna which was rained down from
heaven, differs from common bread, which by paines and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
the earth produces in a natural way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The best natural gifts afford not that sweetness and solid
comfort to the soul that grace doth; they are but a dry stalk
that affords no meat for a soul to feed on. A man may have
an understanding full of light, and an heart void of comfort
at the same time; but grace is a fountain of purest living
streams of peace and comfort, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 8. Believing we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
with joy unspeakable and full of glory: light is sown for the
righteous, and joy for the upright in heart.</hi> All true pleasures
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:42861:57"/>
and delights are seminally grace, <hi>Psal.</hi> 97. 11. they are
sown for them in these divine and heavenly graces, which
are glory in the bud.</p>
                  <p>Gifts adorn the person, but do not secure the soul from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
wrath. A man may be admired for them among men, and
rejected eternally by God. Who can considerately read that
sixth Chapter of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and not tremble to think in
what a forlorn case a soul may be, though set off and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plisht
with the rarest endowments of this kind, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 22.<note place="margin">Like a precious stone in a toads head.</note>
We read, that many shall say to <hi>Christ</hi> in that day, Lord,
Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name, and in thy name
cast out devils, &amp;c. and yet themselves at last cast out as a
prey to Devils. How divinely and rhetorically did a <hi>Balaam</hi>

2. 8. What profound and excellent parts had the Heathen
<hi>Sages</hi> and <hi>Philosophers?</hi> These things are so far from securing
the soul against the wrath to come, that they often expose
it unto wrath, and are as oyl to encrease the eternal burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
but now gracious principles are the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
as the Apostle calls them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. Things that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and have salvation in them. These are the things on
which the promises of Salvation run; and these treasures are
never found but in elect vessels. Glory is by promise assured
and made over to him that possesses them. There is but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
point of time, betwixt him and the glorified spirits above.
And how inconsiderable a matter is a little time, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
and winds up apace? For <hi>now is our salvation nearer than
when we believed.</hi> And hence the scriptures speaks of them as
already saved, <hi>Rom. 8. 24. We are saved by hope,</hi> because its
as sure as if we were in heaven. We are made to sit in heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
places.</p>
                  <p>Gifts may damnifie the person that possesses them; and it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
may be better in respect of a mans own condition he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had them. <hi>Knowledge</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>Puffeth up. 1 Cor.</hi>
8. 1. maketh the soul proud and flatulent. 'Tis a hard thing
to know much, and not to know it too much. The Saints
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42861:58"/>
knowledge is better than the Schollars; for he hath his own
heart instead of a Commentary to help him. <hi>Aristotle</hi> said
a little knowledge about heavenly things, though conjectural,
is better than much of earthly things, though certain. <hi>The
world by wisdom knew not God</hi> (saith the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21.)
<hi>(i. e.)</hi> their learning hanged in their light, they were too
wise to submit to the simplicity of the Gospel. The excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
parts of the old Hereticks, did but serve to midwi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the world the monstrous birth of soul-damning heresies.
<hi>Cupit abs te ornari diabolus,</hi> as <hi>Austin</hi> said to that ingenious
young Scholler; The devil desires to be adorned by thee.
But now grace in its self is not subject to such abuses, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be the proper <hi>univocal cause</hi> of any evil effect: It cannot
puff up the heart, but alwayes humbles it; nor serve the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
designs, but ever opposes them.</p>
                  <p>Gifts may be given a man for the sake of others, and not
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> out of love to himself, they are but as an excellent dish of
meat which a man sends to nurse, not for her sake so much
as for his Child that sucks her. God indeed makes use of
them to do his children good, the Church is benefitted by
them, though themselves are but like Cooks, they prepare
excellent dishes on which the Saints feed, and are nourished,
though themselves tast them not. They <hi>dona ministrantia
non sanctificantia,</hi> ministring but not sanctifying gifts, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
not from the good will of God to him that hath
them, but to those he benefits by them. And oh, what a sad
consideration will this be one day to such a person, to think,
I helped such a soul to heaven, while I my self must lodg in
hell?</p>
                  <p>Sin in the raign and power of it, may cohabit with the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> most excellent natural gifts under the same roof, I mean in
the same heart. A man may have the tongue of an <hi>Angel,</hi>
and the heart of a <hi>Devil.</hi> The wisdome of the <hi>Philosoph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

out, but hide their vices. The learned <hi>Pharisees</hi> were but
painted sepulchers; gifts are but as a fair glove drawn over
a foul hand. But now grace is incompatible with Sin in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
it purifies the heart, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 9 cleanses the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,

                  <p>Lastly, Gifts must leave us at last. <hi>Whether there be know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
that shall cease. All flesh is grass and the goodliness of it
as the flower of the grass; the grass withers, the flower fadeth,
but the word of the Lord abideth for ever,</hi> Isa. 40. 6, 8. Many
times they leave a man before death. One knock, if it hit
right (as one saith) may make a wise man a fool, but to be
sure, they all leave us at death. <hi>Doth not his excellency which is

And as the doctrine of the Gospel is rain, so Gospel Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
are the clouds in which those heavenly vapours are
bound up. The resemblance lyes in the following parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The rain comes from heaven, <hi>Acts 14. 17. He gave us
rain from heaven and fruitful seasons,</hi> &amp;c. The doctrine of
the Gospel is also of an heavenly extraction and descent,
they are heavenly truths which are brought to you in earthen
vessels things that were hid in God, and come from his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 9. What <hi>Nicodemus</hi> said of <hi>Christ,</hi> is in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
true of every faithful dispenser of the Gospel, <hi>Thou
art a teacher come from God,</hi> Ioh. 3. 2. You are not to look
upon the truths which Ministers deliver, as the meer effects
and fruits of their inventions and parts, they are but the
Conduits through which those celestial waters are conveyed
to you. 'Tis all heavenly, the <hi>Officers</hi> from heaven, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 12.
Their <hi>Doctrine</hi> from heaven, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 8, 9. The <hi>efficacy</hi> and

Lord</hi> (saith <hi>Paul) that have I delivered unto you, 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 23.
The same may every Gospel Minister say too. That's the
first.</p>
                  <p>And then (2ly) The rain falls by divine direction and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> appointment; <hi>He causes it to rain upon one city and not upon
another,</hi> Amos, 4. 7. You shall often see a cloud dissolve and
spend it self upon one place, when there is not a drop within
a few miles of it. Thus is the Gospel sent to shed its rich in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
upon one place, and not upon another; It pours
down showers of blessings upon on Town or Parish, whilst
others are dry like the ground which lay neer to <hi>Gideons</hi> wet
fleece. <hi>To you is the word of this salvation sent,</hi> Act. 13. 26.
<hi>Sent</hi> it comes not by <hi>chance,</hi> but by <hi>Commission</hi> and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and its sent <hi>to you</hi> by special direction. Ministers can
no more go whither they please, than the failing clouds can
move against the wind. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy,</hi> two fruitful clouds
(that sent down many sweet refreshing showers upon every
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:42861:61"/>
place whither they came) the Lord sent them through <hi>Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia</hi>
and <hi>Galatia</hi> but forbad them to preach the word in <hi>Asia,
Acts.</hi> 16. 6. And when they essayed to go into <hi>Bit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ynia,</hi>
the spirit suffered them not, <hi>v.</hi> 7. But a man of <hi>Macedonia</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to <hi>Paul</hi> in a vision, and prayed him, saying, come over
to <hi>Macedonia</hi> and help us, <hi>v.</hi> 9. Thus you see, how the <hi>mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi>
as well as the <hi>natural</hi> clouds, are moved according to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
counsel; and though Ministers are not now disposed to
their respective places, in such an extraordinary way, yet
there is still a special hand of the Spirit guiding their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which is seen partly in qualifying them or such a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and partly in drawing out their hearts to elect and call
them, and inclining their hearts to accept the call.</p>
                  <p>There is a great deal of difference in showers of rain <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
that fall upon the earth. Sometimes you have an hasty
shower, which makes the wayes fleet, and the streets run,
but it's gone presently, the earth hath but little benefit by it;
and sometimes you have a sweet, gentle, soaking rain, that
moderately soaks to the root and refreshes the earth abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly,
This is called <hi>the small rain,</hi> and the former, <hi>the great
rain of his strength, Iob</hi> 37. 6. So it is in these spiritual show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
the effects of some sermons, (like a sudden spout of rain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>)
are very transient; that touch the heart a little for present
by way of conviction or comfort, but it fleets away imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
<hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>m.</hi> 1. 23. At other times the Gospel like a setled
moderate rain, soaks to the root, to the very heart. So did
that sweet shower which sell, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. It searcheth the
root, it went to the heart; the influences' of it are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
abiding, and do much longer remain in, and refresh
the heart, than the rain doth the earth. There be effects left
in some hearts, by some Sermons and duties, that will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
out of it so long as they live. <hi>I will never forget thy precepts,
for by them thou hast quickened me, Psal.</hi> 119. 92.</p>
                  <p>The rain is most beneficial to the earth, when there come <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
sweet, warm Sun-blasts with it, or after it. This the scripture
calls, <hi>a clear shining after rain, 2 Sam.</hi> 23. 4. by which the
<hi>seminal vertue</hi> of the earth is drawn forth, and then the herbs
and flowers, and Corn sprout abundantly. So it is with
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:42861:62"/>
Gospel showers, when the Sun of righteousness opens upon
poor souls under the word, darting down the beams of grace
and love upon them, whilst they are attending on it, (just as
you sometimes see a sweet shower fall while the Sun shines
out) O how comfortable is this! And effectual to melt the
heart! and as the warm rain is most refreshing, so when the
word comes warmly, from the melting affections of the
Preacher, who imparts not only the Gospel, but his own
soul with it, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 8. This doth abundantly more good
than that which drops coldly from the lips of the unaffected
speaker.</p>
                  <p>Showers of rain do exceedingly refresh the earth, as a man
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> is refreshed by a draught of water, when his spirits are even
spent. O how welcome is a shower to the thirsty ground!
Hence the little hills are said to rejoyce on every side, yea to
shout for joy, and sing when a shower comes, <hi>Psal.</hi> 65. 12, 13.
but never was shower of rain so sweetly refreshing to the
thirsty earth, as Gospel-showers are to gracious hearts,
<hi>Col.</hi> 4. 8. It comforts their very hearts. What joy was
there in <hi>Samaria,</hi> when the Gospel came to that place? <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 8. It revives the soul, its <hi>mel in ore, melos in aure, jubilum
in corde,</hi> honey in the mouth, melody in the ear, and a very
Iubilee in the heart.</p>

grace in the heart, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. 7. And there could be, (in an
ordinary way) no spring of grace without it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29. 18.
And as this former rain is necessary to cause the first spring
of grace, so also it hath the use of the latter rain to ripen
those precious fruits of the Spirit in the souls of Belivers,
<hi>Eph. 4. 11, 12, 13. He gave some Apostles, and some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
and some Evangelists, and some Pastors and teachers, for
the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Ministry for the
edifying of the body of Christ, till we all come in the unity of the
faith, and the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man,
unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ. Were all
the elect</hi> converted unto God, yet still there would be a necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a Gospel Ministry.</p>
                  <p>After a great glut of rain, usually there comes a drought; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
'tis a common Countrey Proverb <hi>Wet and dry pay one another.</hi>
And truly when a people are glutted with a fulness of
Gospel-mercies, it's usual with God to shut up and restrain
the Gospel-clouds, that for a time (at least) there be no
dews upon them, and thereby teach them to prize their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
(because common) mercies at an higher rate. For as
a good man once said, mercies are best known by the back,
and most prized when most wanted. <hi>In those dayes the word of
the Lord was precious, there was no open vision, 1 Sam.</hi> 3. 1. It
is with spiritual as with temporal food, slighted when plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
but if a famine once come, then every bit of bread
is precious. <hi>Ierusalem</hi> remembred in the dayes of her affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and of her misery, all her pleasant things that she had
in the dayes of old, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1. 7. 'Tis both a sinflul and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous

                  <p>Prayer is also the golden key which opens these mystical

themselves at their feet, would thus bespeak them: <q>What

rain and dews of heaven, as hath been shewed, which being
restrained, a spirituall famine necessarily follows: a famine
of all the most terrible. Now to shew you the analogy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
this and a temporal famine, that therein you may see
what cause<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you have to be deeply affected with it, take it in
thse six following particulars.</p>
                  <p>A famine is caused by the failing of bread, or that which
is in the stead, and hath the use of bread. D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>inties and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:42861:67"/>
rarities may fail, and yet men may subsist comfortably.
As long as people have bread and water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they will not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish;
but take away bread once, and the spirit of man fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:
Upon this account bread is called a staff, <hi>Psal.</hi> 105. 16.
because what a staff is to an aged or feeble man, that bread is
to the faint and feeble spirits, which even so do lean upon it.
And look what bread is to the natural spirits, that, and more
than that, the word is to gracious spirits, <hi>Iob 23. 12. I have
esteemed the words of thy mouth, more than my necessary food.</hi> If
once God break this staff, the inner man, that hidden man of
the heart, will quickly begin to fail and faulter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> It is not every degree of scarcity of bread, that presently
makes a famine, but a general failing of it; when no bread
is to be had, or that which is, yields no nutriment. For a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
may as well be occasioned by Gods taking away, <hi>panis
nutrimentum,</hi> the nourishing vertue of bread, that it shall
signifie no more as to the end of bread, than a chip, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1. 6.
as by taking away <hi>panem nutrientem,</hi> bread it self, <hi>Isa.</hi> 3. 1.
And so it is in a spiritual famine, which is occasioned ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by Gods removing all the Ordinances, and making
vision utterly to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ail; or else, though there be preaching
prayer and other Ordinances left, (at least, the names and
shadows of them) yet the presence of God is not with them.
There is no marrow in the bone, no milk in the breast; and
so, as to soul-subsistance, 'tis all one, as if there were no such
things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> In a corporeal famine, mean and course things become
sweet and pleasant; famine raises the price and esteem of
them. That which before you would have thrown to your
dogs, now goes down pleasantly with your selves. To the
hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 7 'Tis the
Dutch Proverb, and a very true one, hunger is the best

'Tis storied of <hi>Artaxerxes Memor,</hi> that when he was fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and said, <hi>Cujusmodi voluptatis hactenus in expernus fuit?</hi> Oh,

                     <hi>Darius</hi> drank the pudled water, that had been defiled with
dead carcases which had been slain in that famous battel, he
professed he never drank more pleasant drink. And famous
<hi>Hunniades</hi> said, he never fared more daintily, than when (in
a like exigence) he supped upon bread, onions, and water,
with a poor Shepheard in his cottage.</p>
                  <p>Iust so, doth the famine of the Word raise the price and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem,
of vulgar and despised truths. O what would we give
for one of those Sermons, one of those Sabbaths we former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enjoyed? <hi>In those dayes the word of the Lord was precious.</hi>
When God calls to the enemy to take away and remove his
contemned, but precious dainties, from his wanton Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and a spiritual famine hath a little pinched them, they
will then learn to prize their spiritual food at a higher
rate.</p>
                  <p>In time of famine some persons suffer more than others.
It falls heaviest and pincheth hardest upon the poorer sort,
as long as any thing is to be had for money, the rich will
have it. So it falls out in a spiritual famine; although the
most experienced, and best furnished Christians, will have
enough to do to live in the absence of Ordinances, yet they
are like to subsist much better, than weak, ignorant, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced
ones. Some Christians have Husbanded their
time well, and like <hi>Ioseph</hi> in the seven years <hi>plenty,</hi> laid up
for a <hi>scarcity.</hi> The Word of God dwells richly in them.
Some such there are, as <hi>Iohn</hi> calls young men, who are strong,
and the word of God remaineth in them, of whom it may be
said, as <hi>Ierom</hi> spake of <hi>Nepotianus,</hi> that by long and assiduous
meditation of the Scriptures, he had made his breast the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Library of Christ. But others are babes in Christ; and
though God will preserve that good work which he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
in them, yet these poor babes will soonest find, and
be most concerned in the loss of their spiritual Fathers and
Nurses.</p>

we not this day read our sin in our punishment? O what nice

people in the dayes of plenty? Methods, tones and gestures,
were more regarded than the excellent treasures of divine
truths. Ah my soul! I remember my fault this day? little

but if it die, it brings forth much fruit.</hi> The death of the Corn
in the earth is not a total death, but only the corruption or
alteration of it: for if once the seminal life and vertue of
it were quite extinguisht, it could never put forth blade or
ear without a miracle. Yet, because that alteration is a kind
of death, therefore Christ here uses it as a fit illustration of
the resurrection. And indeed there is nothing in nature more
apt to illustrate that great mystery. What a fragrant, green
and beautiful blade do we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>EVen thus shall the bodies of the Saints arise in beauty
and glory at the resurrection. <hi>They are sown in dishonour,
they are raised in glory; they are sown natural bodies, they are
raised spiritual bodies, 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 43, 44. The Husbandman
knows, that though the seed rot in the earth, yet it will rise
again. And the believer knows, <hi>That though after his skin
worms destroy his body, yet in his flesh he shall see God,</hi> Iob 19.
25, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the resemblance betwixt the seed sown, and
springing up; and the bodies of the Saints dying, and rising
again, lyes in these following particulars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:42861:71"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, the seed is committed to the earth from whence it
came, so is the body of a Saint; earth it was, and to earth
it is again resolved. Grace exempts not the body of the best
man from seeing corruption, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 10. Though Christ be
in him, yet the body is dead; that is, sentenced to death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of sin, <hi>Heb. 6. ult, It is appointed for all men once to
dye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, The seed is cast into the earth in hope, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.
10. Were there not a resurrection of it expected, the
Husbandman would never be willing to cast away his Corn.
The bodies of Saints are also committed to the grave in
hope, <hi>I Thes. 4. 13, 14. But I would not have you to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
brethren, concerning those which are asleep, as them which
have no hope; for if we believe that Iesus dyed and rose again,
even so also them which sleep in Iesus shall the Lord bring with
him.</hi> This blessed hope of a resurrection, sweetens, not only
the troubles of life, but the pangs of death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the seed is cast into the earth seasonably, in its
proper season. So are the bodies of the Saints, <hi>Ioh. 5. 26.
Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, as a shock of corn cometh
in, in its season.</hi> They alwayes dye in the fittest time, though
sometimes they seem to dye immaturately. The time of their
death was from all eternity prefixt by God, beyond which
they cannot go, and short of which they cannot come.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The seed lyes many dayes and nights under the clods, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it rise and appear again. <hi>Even so man lyeth down, and
riseth not again till the heavens be no more,</hi> Iob 14. 12. The
dayes of darkness in the grave are many.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> When the time is come for its shooting up, the earth that
covered it can hide it no longer, it cannot keep it down a day
more; it will find or make a way through the clods. So in
that day when the great trump shall sound, bone shall come
to his bone, and the graves shall not be able to hold them a
minute longer. Both Sea and earth must render the dead
that are in them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> When the seed appears above ground again, it appears
much more fresh and orient than when it was cast into the
earth. God cloaths it with such beauty, that it is not like
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42861:71"/>
to what it was before. Thus rise the bodies of Saints, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellously
improved, beautified and perfected with spiritual
qualities and rich endowments; in respect whereof they are
called spiritual bodies, I <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 43. not properly, but

so our bodies after the resurrection shall be above these ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
and distempers; for we shall be as the Angels of
God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 30. Yea, our vile bodies shall be changed,
and made like unto Christs glorious body; which is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
pitch, and ascent of glory and honour, that an humane
body is capable of, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 21. Indeed the glory of the
soul shall be the greatest glory; that's the orient invaluable
jem; but God will bestow a distinct glory upon the body,
and richly enammel the very case in which that precious
jewel shall be kept. In that glorious morning of the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
the Saints shall put on their new fresh suits of flesh,
richly laid and trimmed with glory. Those bodies which in
the grave were but dust and rottenness, when it delivers them
back again, shall be shining and excellent pieces, absolutely
and everlastingly freed. (1) From all natural infirmities
and distempers; death is their good Physician, which at
once freed them of all diseases. 'Tis a great Affliction
now to many of the Lord's people, to be clog'd with so
many bodily infirmities which render them very unservice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to God. <hi>The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</hi>
A crazy body retorts and shoots back its distempers upon the
soul with which it is so closely conjoyned; but though now
the soul (as <hi>Theophrastus</hi> speaks) payes a dear rent for the
Tabernacle in which it dwells, yet when death dissolves that
Tabernacle, all the diseases and pains under which it groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
shall be buried in the rubbish of its mortality; and when
they come to be re-united again, God will bestow rich gifts
and dowries, even upon the body, in the day of its re-espousals
to the soul. (2) It shall be freed from all deformities, there
are no breaches, flaws, monstrosities in glorified bodies;
but of them it may much rather be said, what was once said
of <hi>Absalom, 2 Sam. 14. 25. That from the crown of his head, to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:42861:72"/>
the sole of his foot; there was no blemish in him.</hi> (3ly.) It shall
be freed from all natural necessities, to which it is now sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
in this its animal state. How is the soul now disquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and tortured with cares and troubles, to provide for a
perishing body? Many unbelieving and unbecoming fears,
it is now vexed with. What shall it eat? and what shall it
drink? and wherewithal shall it be cloathed? <hi>But meats for the
belly, and the belly for meats; God shall destroy both it and them,
1 Cor. 6. 13. (i. e.)</hi> as to their present use and office; for
as to its existence, so the belly shall not be destroyed. But
even as the Masts, Poop and Stern of a Ship abide in the
harbour after the voyage is ended, so shall these bodily
members, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> excellently illustrates it. (4ly.) They
shall be freed from death, to which thenceforth they can
be subject no more; that formidable adversary of nature
shall affault it no more. <hi>For they which shall be accounted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
marry nor are given in marriage, neither can they dye any
more; for they shall be equal to the Angels, and are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God, being the children of the resurrection,</hi> Luk. 20. 35, 36

and single spirits without bodies, as the Angels are, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual

We shall then live upon God, and act freely, purely,
and delightfully for God; for all kind of living upon, and
delighting in creatures, seems in that Text (by a Synech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche
of the part which is ordinarily in Scripture put for
all creature-delights, dependencies, and necessities) to be
excluded. Nothing but God shall enamour and fill the soul,
and the body shall be perfectly subdued to the spirit. Lord,

rest? hath thy body been such a pleasant habitation to thee,
that thou shouldst be so loath to part with it, though but for
a time? and with assurance of receiving it again with such a
glorious improvement? I know (O my soul) that thou hast
a natural inclination to this body, resulting from the dear
and strict union which God himself hath made betwixt thee
and it! yea, even the holiest of men do sometimes sensibly
feel the like in themselves; but beware thou love it not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately
of inordinately; 'tis but a creature, how dear
soever it be to thee: yea, a fading creature, and that which
now stands in thy way to the full enjoyment of God. But
say my soul, why are the thoughts of parting with it so
burdensom to thee? Why so loath to take death by its cold
hand? Is this body thy old and dear friend? True, but yet
thou partest not with it upon such sad terms, as should deserve
a tear at parting. For mayest thou not say of this departure,
as <hi>Paul</hi> of the departure of <hi>Onesimus,</hi> Philem. <hi>v. 15. It
therefore departeth for a season that thou mayest receive it for ever.</hi>
The daye of re-espousals will quickly come, and in the mean

                  <head>APPLICATION.</head>
                  <p>HOw difficult soever it be to discern the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
wheat and tares; yet doubtless the eye of sence
can much easier discriminate them, than the most quick and
piercing eye of man can discern the difference betwixt spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
and common grace: for all saving graces in the Saints
have their counterfeits in hypocrites. There are <hi>similar
works in these,</hi> which a spiritual and very judicious eye may
easily mistake for the <hi>saving and genuine effects</hi> of the sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Doth the Spirit of God convince the consciences of his
people, of the evil of sin? <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 9. Hypocrites have
their convictions too, <hi>Exod. 10. 16. Then</hi> Pharoah <hi>called for</hi>
Moses <hi>and</hi> Aaron <hi>in hast, and he said, I have sinned against the
Lord your God, and against you.</hi> Thus was <hi>Saul</hi> also convicted,
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 24.</p>
                  <p>Doth true conviction and compunction work reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of life, in the people of God? even hypocrites also
have been famous for their reformations. The unclean spirit
often goes out of the formal hypocrite, by an external refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;
and yet still retains his propriety in them, <hi>Mat.</hi>
12. 43, 44. For that departure is indeed no more than a
politick retreat. Many that shall never escape the damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of hell, have yet escaped the pollutions of the world,
and that by the knowledge of the Son of God, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi>
2. 20.</p>
                  <p>Doth the Spirit of the Lord produce that glorious and
supernatural work of faith, in convinced and humbled souls?
in this also the hypocrite apes and imitates the believer, <hi>Acts
8. 13. Then</hi> Simon <hi>himself believed also,</hi> Luke 8. 13. <hi>These are they which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Doth the precious eye of faith, discovering the transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
excellencies that are in Christ, inflame the affections of
the believing soul with vehement desires and longings after
him? Strange motions of heart have also been found in hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:42861:75"/>
towards Christ and heavenly things, <hi>Iohn 6. 34.
Lord evermore give us this bread,</hi> Mat. 25. 8. <hi>Give us of your
oyl, for our lamps are gone out.</hi> With what a rapture was <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi>
transported, when he said, <hi>Let me dye the death of the
righteous, and my last end be like his?</hi> Numb. 23. 10.</p>
                  <p>Doth the work of faith in some believers bear upon its
top branches, the full ripe fruits of a blessed assurance?
Lo! What strong confidences, and high-built perswasions of
an interest in God, have sometimes been found, even in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified ones? <hi>Ioh. 8. 54. Of whom you say, that he is your
God, and yet ye have not known him.</hi> To the same height of
confidence arrived those vain souls, mentioned in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 19.
Yea, so strong may this false assurance be, that they dare
boldly venture to go to the judgment seat of God, and there
defend it, <hi>Mat. 7. 22. Lord, Lord, have we not prophecyed in
thy name?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Doth the Spirit of God fill the heart of the assured be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
with joy unspeakable and full of glory, giving them
through faith a prelibation or foretaste of heaven it self, in
those first fruits of it? How near to this comes that which
the Apostle supposes may be found even in Apostates! <hi>Heb.</hi>
6. 8, 9. who are there said, <hi>to taste the good word of God, and
the powers of the world to come.</hi> What shall I say if real
Christians delight in Ordinances, those that are none may
also delight in approaching to God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 32. It may
be you will say, though the difference be not easily discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in their active obedience; yet, when it shall come to
suffering, there every eye may discern it: the false heart
will then flinch, and cannot brook that work. And yet, even
this is no infallible rule neither; for the Apostle supposes,
that the <hi>Salamander</hi> of hypocrisie may live in the very flames
of Martyrdom, 1 <hi>Cor. 13. 3. If I give my body to be burnt,
and have not charity.</hi> And it was long since determined in
this cafe, <hi>Non paena, sed causa facit Martyrem;</hi> so that without
controversie, the difficulty of distinguishing them is very
great.</p>
                  <p>And this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> difference will yet be more subtile and undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scernable,
if I should tell you, that as in so many things, the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:42861:75"/>
hypocrite resembles the Saint: so there are other things
in which a real Christian may act too like an hypocrite.
When we find a <hi>Pharoah</hi> confessing, an <hi>Herod</hi> practising, as
well as hearing, a <hi>Iudas</hi> preaching Christ, an <hi>Alexander</hi>
ventring his life for <hi>Paul;</hi> and on the other side, shall find
a <hi>David</hi> condemning that in another, which he practised
himself; an <hi>Hezekiah</hi> glorying in his riches, a <hi>Peter</hi> dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
and even all the Disciples forsaking <hi>Christ</hi> in an hour
of trouble and danger. O then! how hard is it for the eye
of man to discern betwixt chaff and wheat? how many up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
hearts are now censured, whom God will clear? how
many false hearts are now approved, whom God will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn?
men ordinarily have no clear convictive proofs, but
only probable symptoms, which at most can beget but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectural knowledge of anothers state. And they that shall
peremptorily judge either way, may possibly, wrong the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
of the upright; or on the other side, absolve and
justifie the wicked. And truly, considering what hath been
said it is no great wonder that dangerous mistakes are so
frequently made in this matter. But though man cannot, the
Lord both can, and will perfectly discriminate them. <hi>The
Lord knoweth who are his, 2 Tim.</hi> 2. 19. He will have a day
perfectly to sever the tares from the wheat, to melt off the
varnish of the most resplendent and refined hyocrite, and to
blow off the ashes of infirmities, which have covered and
obscured the very sparks of sincerity in his people. He will
make such a division as was never yet made in the world,
how many divisions soever there have been in it. <hi>And then
shall men indeed return, and discern betwixt the righteous and
the wicked, betwixt him that serveth God, and him that serveth
him not.</hi> Mean while (my soul) thou canst not better imploy
thy self, whether thou be sound or unsound, than in making
these reflections upon thy self.</p>

of my censorious spirit; for I have often
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:42861:76"/>
boldly anticipated thy judgment, and assumed thy preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
although thou hast said, <hi>Why dost thou judge thy brother?
and why dost thou set at nought thy brother? we shall all stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the judgment seat of Christ; for it is written, as I live (saith
the Lord) every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
to God. Let ut not therefore judge one another any more,</hi>
Rom. 14. 10, 11, 12, 13. And again. <hi>He that judgeth me is the
Lord. Let us therefore judge nothing before the time, until the
Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and make manifest the counsels of the heart; and then shall
every man have praise of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>What if God will own some of them for his Sons, to
whom I refuse to give the respect of brethren? I may pass
hasty and headlong censures upon others, but where is my
commission for so doing? I want not only a commission, but
fit qualifications for such a work as this. Can I pierce into
the heart as God? can I infallibly discover the hidden mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
ends, and principles of actions? Besides, O my soul!
thou art conscious of so much falsness in thy self, that were
there no other consideration, that alone might rest in a thee
from all uncharitable and hasty censures. If others knew
but what I know of my self, would they not judge as severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of me, as I do of others?</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Though I may not judge the final state of another, yet I

since every saving grace in a Christian hath its counterfeit in
the hypocrite, how needful is it, for thee, (O my soul) to
make a stand here, and solemnly to ponder this great questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on!
whether those things whereon I depend as my best evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
for the life to come, be the real, or only the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
works of the Spirit? whether they be such as can now
endure the test of the Word, and abide a fair tryal at the bar
of my own conscience?</p>
                  <p>Come then, my soul! set the Lord before thee, to whom
the secrets of all hearts are manifest; and in the awful
sence of that great day, make true answer to these heart-dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
queries; for though thou canst not discern the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:42861:76"/>
difference betwixt these things in another, yet thou mayest
and oughtest to discern it in thy self; for what man knows
the things of a man, save the spirit of man that is in
him?</p>
                  <p>First, Is my obedience uniform? am I the same man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
in all times, places and companies? or rather, am I not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
and curious in open and publick; remiss and careless, in
private and secret duties? sincere souls are uniform souls,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 6. the hypocrite is no closet-man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 5.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Doth that which I call grace in me, oppose <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
and mortifie, or doth it not rather quietly consist with, and
protect my lusts and corruptions? true grace tollerates no
lust, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. No, not the bosom darling-corruption, <hi>Psa.</hi>
18. 23.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Doth that which I call my grace, humble,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
empty and abase my soul? or rather, doth it not puff it up
with self-conceitedness? all saving grace is humble grace,
1 <hi>Cor. 15. 10. But the soul which is lifted up, is not upright;</hi>
Hab. 2. 4.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, Canst thou (my soul) rejoyce and bless God for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
the grace imparted to others? and rejoyce, if any design
for <hi>Christ</hi> be carried on in world by other hands? or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
dost thou not envy those that excel thee, and carest for
no work in which thou art not seen?</p>
                  <p>But stay my soul, it is enough: If these be the substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial

                  <p>THere are (amongst many others) three critical and
dangerous periods, betwixt the seed-time and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest.
The first, when corn is newly committed to the earth,
all that lyes uncovered is quickly pickt up by the birds; and
much of that which is but slightly covered, is stockt up as
soon as it begins to sprout, by Rooks and other devouring
fowls, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 4. but if it escape the fowls, and gets
root in the earth, yet then is it hazarded by noxious weeds,
which purloin and suck away its nourishment, whilst it is yet
in the tender blade. If by the care of the vigilant Husba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
it be freed from choaking weeds; yet lastly, as great
a danger as any of the former still attends it; for often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
whilst it is blowing in the ear, blastings, and mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dews,
smite it in the stalk, which cuts off the juice and sap
that should ascend to nourish the ear; and so shrivels and
dries up the grain whilst it is yet immature, whereby it
becomes like those ears of corn in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> vision, which
were thin, and blasted with the East-wind;<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or like the
ears the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaks of upon the house top, wherewith
the reaper filleth not his arms.</p>

                  <p>TRue grace from the infancy to the perfection thereof,
conflicts with far more greater dangers, amongst
which it answerably meets with three dangerous periods
which marvellously hazard it: So that it is a much greater
wonder that it ever arrives at its just perfection. For (1) no
sooner hath the great Husbandman disseminated these holy
seeds in the regenerate heart, but multitudes of impetuous
corruptions immediately assault, and would cetainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
them like the fowls of the air, did not the same arm
that sowed them, also protect them. It fares with grace, as
with <hi>Christ</hi> its Author, whom <hi>Herod</hi> sought to destroy in his
very infancy. The new creature is scarce warm in its seat,
before it must fight to defend its self. This conflict is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
set forth in that famous Text, <hi>Gal. 5. 17. The flesh
lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh, and these
are contrary the one to the other; so that ye cannot do the things
that ye would.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By <hi>flesh</hi> here, understand the corruption of nature by
original sin, and the sinful motions thereof; by <hi>spirit,</hi> not
the soul, or natural spirit of man, but the Spirit of God in
man, <hi>viz.</hi> those graces in men which are the workmanship
of the Spirit, and therefore called by his name. The oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
betwixt these two is expressed by lusting (<hi>i. e.</hi>) desiring
the mutual ruine and destruction of each other; for even when
they are not acting, yet then they are lusting, there is an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
disposition against each other; which opposition is
both a <hi>formal</hi> and an <hi>effective</hi> opposition. There are two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
forms to men in every Saint, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 9, 10. From
hence an effective opposition must needs follow, for as
things are in their natures and principles, so they are in their
operations and effects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> workings alwayes follow beings;
fire and water are of contrary qualities, and when they
meet, they effectively oppose each other. Sin and grace are
so opposite, that if sin should cease to oppose grace, it
would cease to be sin; and if grace should not oppose sin,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42861:78"/>
it would cease to be grace. And this doth much more endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
the work of grace, than any other enemy it hath; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it works against it more <hi>inwardly, constantly,</hi> and <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagiously,</hi>
than any thing else can do. (1) More inwardly;
for it hath its being and working in the same soul where grace
dwells, yea, in the self same fame faculties, so that is not only
sets one faculty against another, but the same faculty against
it self, the understanding against the understanding, and the
will against the will, so that ye cannot do the good, nor
yet the evil that ye would; not the good that ye would,
because when the spirit moves to good, and beats
upon the heart by divine pulsations, exciting it to duty,
the flesh crosses and opposes it there; and if it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
totally hinder the performance of a duty, yet it
lames the soul upon the working hand, whereby the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
is not so spiritual, free and composed, as it desires;
nor yet the evil that you would commit, if grace were not
there, because when lust stirs in its first motions, grace puts
a rub in its way. <hi>How can I do this great wickedness, and sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God?</hi> Gen. 39. 9. And if it cannot (which for the
most part it doth) hinder the acting of sin, yet it so engages
the will against it, that it is not committed with complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and full consent, <hi>Rom. 7. 15. What I do, I allow not.</hi> (2) It
opposes it more <hi>constantly,</hi> it's like a continual drooping: a
man can no more flie from this enemy, than from himself.
There is a time when the devil leaves tempting, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 11.
but no time when corruption ceases from working. And
lastly, it opposes grace more <hi>advantagiously</hi> than any other
enemy can do, for it is not only alwayes in the same soul
with it, but it is there naturally; it hath the advantage of
the soyl which suits with it. And yet, oh the wonder of free
grace! it is not swallowed up in victory, it escapes this hazard.</p>
                  <p>But (2ly.) it soon meets with another, though it escape
this, even by temptations which strike desperately at the
very life of it; for these like the weeds, with seemingly
loving imbraces, clasp about it; and did not the faithful
God now make a way to escape, instead of an Harvest, we
should have an heap: For, alas, what are we! to wrestle
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42861:79"/>
with principalities and powers, and spiritual wickednesses in
high places?</p>
                  <p>Lastly, sad relapses like blasts and rustings do often fade
and greatly endanger it, when it's even ready for the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest.
Thus it fell out with <hi>David,</hi> whose last wayes were not
like his first; and yet by this, these holy fruits are not utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
destroyed, because it is the seed of God; and so is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal,
1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 4, 5. and also because the promises of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance
and victory made to it, cannot be frustrated; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
which these are excellent, <hi>Isa. 54. 10. Ier.</hi> 34. 40.
1 <hi>Cor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. 8. Psal. 1. 3. Psal. 125. 1. Ioh.</hi> 4. 14. So that
here is matter of unspeakable comfort; though the flesh
say, <hi>Ego deficiam,</hi> I will fail thee; though the world say,
<hi>Ego decipiam,</hi> I will deceive thee; though the devil say,
<hi>Ego eripiam,</hi> I will snatch thee away; yet as long as <hi>Christ</hi>
saith, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee; thy graces
are secure, in the midst of all these enemies.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> THis soul of mine was once plowed up by conviction,<note place="margin">The Apostates Reflection.</note>
and sown (as I thought) with the seed of God. In those
dayes many purposes and good resolutions began to chink
and bud forth, promising a blessed Harvest: But O! (with
what consternation and horror should I speak it;) the cares
and pleasures of this life, the lusts and corruptions of my
base heart springing up, have quite destroyed and choakt it;
by which it appears, it was not the seed of God, as I then
imagined it to be; and now my expected Harvest shall be
an heap, in the day of grief, and desperate sorrow, <hi>Isa.</hi> 17. 11.
I had convictions, but they are gone: troubles for sin, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of duties, but all is blasted, and my soul is now as a
barren field, which God hath cursed.</p>
                  <p>Wo is me! I have revolted from God, and now that
dreadful word, <hi>Ier.</hi> 17. 5, 6. is evidently fulfilled upon me;
<hi>For I am like the heath in the desart, that seeth not when good
cometh; my soul inhabits the parched places of the wilderness.</hi>
Alas! all my formal and heartless duties were but as so many
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:42861:79"/>
scare-crows in the field, which could not defend these
slight workings from being devoured by the infernal fowls.
Had these principles been the seed of God, no doubt they
would have continued and overcome the world, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 19.
Wretched soul! thy case is sad, it will be better with the
uncultivated wilderness, than with such a miscarrying soyl,
unless the great Husbandman plow thee up the second time,
and sow thy heart with better seed.</p>
                  <p>And are the corruptions of my heart to grace, what fowls,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
weeds,<note place="margin">The careless souls reflection</note> and mildews are to the corn? O what need have I
then to watch my heart, and keep it with all diligence; for
in the life of that grace is wrapt up the life of my soul. He
that carries a candle in his hand in a blustring stormy night,
had need to cover it close, lest it be blown out, and he left
in darkness. O let me never say, God hath promised it shall
persevere, and therefore I need not be so solicitous to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it; for as this inference is quite opposite to the nature
of true grace and assurance, which never incourage to care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessness,
but provoke the soul to an industrious use of means
to preserve it. So, it is in it self an irrational and sensless
conclusion, which will never follow from any Scripture
promise: for although it is readily granted, that God hath
made many comfortable and sweet promises to the graces of
his people, yet we must expect to enjoy the benefits &amp; blessings
of all those promises, in that way and order in which God hath
promised them; and that is in the careful and diligent use of
those means which he hath prescribed, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 36, 37. for
promises do not exclude, but imply the use of means, <hi>Act.</hi>
27. 31. I know my life is determined to a day, to an hour,
and I shall live out every minute God hath appointed; but
yet, I am bound to provide food, raiment and physick to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, let all doubting Christians reflect seriously <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
upon this truth,<note place="margin">The doubting souls reflection</note> and suck marrow and fatness out of it to
strengthen and establish them against all their fears; your

soul, lift up thine eyes and look upon the fields; the
corn lives still, and grows up: though birds have watcht to
devour it, snows have covered it, beasts have cropt it, weeds
have almost choakt it, yet it's preserved. And hath not God
more care of that precious seed of his own spirit in thee,
than any Husbandman hath of his corn? hath he not said,
<hi>That having begun the good work in thee; he will perfect it to the
day of Christ?</hi> Phil. 2. 6. Hath he not said, <hi>I give unto them eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

not many times said, and thought of it, as thou dost now, and

patient therefore my Brethren, for the coming of the Lord draws
neer.</hi> There are three great Arguments to perswade Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
to a long-suffering and patient frame under sufferings.
(1) The example of Christ, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 7. to think how quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he suffered all injuries and difficulties with invincible pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
is sufficient to shame the best of Christians, who are
of such short Spirits. I have read of one <hi>Elezarius</hi> a noble
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:42861:81"/>
man, that when his wife wondered at his exceeding great
patience in bearinig njuries; he thus answered her, You
know sometimes my heart is ready to rise with indignation
against such as wrong me, but I presently begin to think of
the wrongs that Christ suffer'd, and say thus to my self, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
thy servant should pluck thy beard, and smite thee
on thy face, this were nothing to what thy Lord suffer'd:
he suffered more and greater things; and assure your self
(wife) I never leave off thinking on the injuries done to my
Saviour, till such time as my mind be still and quiet. To this
purpose it was well noted by <hi>Bernard,</hi> speaking of Christ's
humiliation; was Christ the Lord of glory thus humbled
and emptied of his fulness of glory? and shall such a worm
as I swell? (2) The desert of sin, <hi>Lam. 3. 39. Why doth the

to the present similitude) do the expectations, and hopes of
a blessed harvest, and reward in heaven. This made <hi>Abraham</hi>
willing to wander up and down many years as a stranger in
the world; for he looked for a City that hath foundations,
whose builder and maker is God. The hopes of such a harvest
is incouragement enough to work hard, and wait long; yet
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:42861:82"/>
some Christians are so impatient of it, that they would fain
be reaping before the time; but as God hath by an unalterable
law of nature, appointed both the seasons of seed time and
harvest (which are therefore called the appointed we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ks of
the harvest) <hi>Ier.</hi> 5. 24. and these cannot be hasten'd; but
when we have done all that we can on our part, must wait till
God send the former and latter rain, and given every natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
cause its effect. So is it in reference to our spiritual har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest;
we are appointed to sweat in the use of all God's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments,
and when we have done all, must patiently
wait till the divine decrees be accomplished, and the time of
the promise be fully come; In due time we shall reap, if we
faint not. To which patient expectation, and quiet wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the glory to come, these following considerations are
of excellent use.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> As the Husbandman knows when the Seed-time is past,
it will not be long to the harvest; and the longer he waits,
the neerer still it is. So the Christian knows, <hi>It is but yet a
little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry,</hi>
Heb. 10. 37. <hi>And that now his salvation is nearer than when he
first believed,</hi> Rom. 13. 11. What a small point of time is
our waiting time, compared with eternity? yet a few dayes
more, and then comes the long expected and welcome har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The Husbandman can find other work to do, before the
reaping time come; he need not stand idle, though he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
yet reap. And cannot a Christian find any work to do for
God, till be come to heaven? O, there is much work to do
and such work as is only proper to this season. You may
now reprove sin, exhort to duty, succour the distressed, this
is good work, and this is your only time for such work; the
whole of eternity will be taken up in other imployments, <hi>I

2 Pet.</hi> 1. 13, 14. q. d. I know I have but a little time
to work among you, I am almost at heaven; and therefore
am willing to husband this present moment as well as I can

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:42861:82"/>
about you upon the multitude of forlorn sinners, speak now to
them for God, speak now to God for them; for shortly you
shall so speak more, you shall see them no more till you

up and be doing: If you had done all you were to do for
your selves and them, he would have you to heaven immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately,
you should not wait a moment longer for your
glory.</p>
                  <p>Husbandmen know, though they cannot yet gather in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
precious fruits of the earth, yet all this while they are ripen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and preparing for the harvest; they would not house it
green or take it before its time. And is not this also my
preparation time for glory? As God prepared heaven for
his people, by an eternal <hi>decree,</hi> Mat. 25. 34. by an act of <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi>
Heb. 11. 10. by the death of Christ, which made a
purchase of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 19, 20. and by his ascension into it,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. 2, 3. So the reason why we are kept here, is in order
to our sitting for it. Heaven is ready, but we are not fully
ready; the Barn is fit to receive the corn, but the corn is not
yet fit to be gathered into it. <hi>But for this self same thing God
is now working us,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 5. he is every day at work, by
Ordinances, and by providences, to perfect his work in us;
and as soon as that is finished, we shall hear a voice like that,
<hi>Rev. 11. 12 Come up hither, and immediately we shall be in
the spirit:</hi> for how ardently soever we long for that desirable
day, Christ longs for it more than we can do.</p>
                  <p>The Husbandman is glad of the first fruits, that incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
him, though the greatest part be yet out; and have not
you received the first fruits of that glory? have you no earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ests,
pledges, and first fruits of it? 'Tis your own fault, if
every day you feed not upon such blessed comforts of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>Rom. 8. 23. Rom. 5. 2. 1 Pet.</hi> 8. 9. O how might the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposing

sweetned with such prelibations of the glory to come!</p>
                  <p>Husbandmen know 'tis best to reap, when 'tis fit to reap; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
one handful fuly ripe, is worth many sheaves of green corn.
And you know, heaven will be sweetest to you, when you
are fittest for it, the child would pluck the apple while it's

green, but he might gather it easier, and taste it sweeter,
by tarrying longer for it. We would fain be glorified <hi>per sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi>
When we have got a taste of heaven, we are all in hast
to be gone. Then, O that I had wings as a dove! I would
flie away, and be at rest. Then we cry to God for our selves,
as <hi>Moses</hi> for his sister <hi>Miriam, Heal her [now] O God, I beseech
thee,</hi> Num. 12. 13. Clorifie me now, O Lord, I pray thee!
But surely, as God hath contrived thy glory in the best of
wayes, so he hath appointed for thee the fittest of seasons; and
when ever thou art gathered into glory, thou shalt come as a
shock of corn in its season.</p>

                  <p>VVHen the fields are white to harvest, then Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
walk through them, rub the ears, and finding
the grain full and solid, they presently prepare their Sithes
and Sickles, send for their harvestmen, who quickly reap
and mow them down; and after these follow the binders, who
stitch it up; from the field where it grew, it's carried to the
Barn where it is threshed out; the good grain gathered
into an heap, the chaff separated and burnt, or thrown to the
dunghil, how bare and naked do the fields look after harvest
which before were pleasant to behold? When the harvest
men enter into the field, it is (to allude to that, <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. 3.)
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:42861:85"/>
before them, like the garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> and behind them a
desolate wilderness; and in some places its usual to set fire to
the dry stubble, when the corn is housed; which rages furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
and covers it all with ashes.</p>

                  <p>THe Application of this, I find made to my hands, by
Christ himself in <hi>Mat. 13. 38, 39. The field is the
world, the good seed are the Children of the kingdom, the tares are
the children of the wicked one, the enemy that sowed them is the
devil, the harvest is the end of the world, the reapers are the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The field is the world; there both the godly and ungodly
live and grow together, till they be both ripe, and then
they shall both be reaped down by death; death is the Sickle
that reaps down both. I will open this Allegory in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing

begin to gather and grow black, he hurries in his corn with
all possible hast, and houses day and night.</p>
                  <p>So doth God the great Husbandman, he hurries the Saints
into their graves, when judgments are coming upon the
world, <hi>Isa. 57. 1. The righteous perish and no man layeth it to
heart, and merciful men are taken away; none considering that
the righteous is taken away from the evil to come. Methusalah</hi> died

God their father, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 22. For look, as these blessed spirits
did exceedingly rejoyce at their conversion, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 10. and
thought it no dishonour to minister to them whilst they stood
in the field <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 14. So when they are cut down, by death,
they will rejoyce to be their convoy to heaven.</p>
                  <p>When the corn and weeds are reap'd or mowed down <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
they shall never grow any more in that field; neither shall
we ever return to live an animal life any more after death <hi>Iob

Lastly, (to come home to the particular object of this
Chapter (the reapers are never sent to cut down the harvest
till it be fully ripe; neither will God reap down Saints or
sinners, till they be come to a maturity of grace or wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ss.
Saints are not reap'd down till their grace be ripe,
<hi>Iob. 5. 26. Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, as a shock
of corn cometh in in his season.</hi> 
                     <q>Not that every godly man
dies in such a full old age (saith Mr. <hi>Caryl</hi> on the place)
but yet in one sense it is an universal truth, and ever fulfilled;
for whensoever they die, they die in a good age; yea,
though they die in the spring and flower of their youth,
they die in a good old age (<hi>i. e.</hi>) they are ripe for death
when ever they die: When ever a godly man dies, it's
harvest time with him, though in a natural capacity he be
cut down while he is green, and cropt in the bud or blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som;
yet in his spiritual capacity, he never dies before he
be ripe. God ripens his speedily, when he intends to taks
them out of the world speedily; he can let out such warm
rayes and beams of his spirit upon them, as shall soon
maturate the seeds of grace into a preparedness for glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The wicked also have their ripening time for hell, and
judgement; God doth with much long<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>suffering endure the
vessels of wrath, prepared for destruction. Of their ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for judgment the scripture often speaks, <hi>Gen. 15. 16.
The sin of the</hi> Amorites <hi>is not yet full.</hi> And of <hi>Babilon,</hi> it's said,
<hi>Ier. 51. 13. O thou that dwellest upon many waters, thine end
is come and the measure of thy covetousness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis worth remarking, that the measure of the sin, and
the end of the sinner come together. So <hi>Ioel 3. 13. Put ye
in the sickle, for the harvest of the earth is ripe, for the press is
full, the fats overflow, for their wickedness is great.</hi> Where note,
sinners are not cut down till they be ripe and ready. Indeed
they are never ripe for death, nor ready for the grave; that
is, fit to die: yet they are alwayes ripe for wrath, and ready
for hell before they die. Now as Husbandmen judge of
the ripeness of their harvest, by the colour and hardness of
the grain; so may we judge of the ripeness both of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:42861:86"/>
Saints and Sinners, for heaven or hell, by these following
signs.</p>

stoops lower than when it was green. When the
people of God are near ripe for heaven, they grow more
humble and self-denying, that in the dayes of their first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.
The longer a Saint grows in this world, the better
he is still acquainted with his own heart, and his obligations
to God; both which are very humbling things. <hi>Paul</hi> had one
foot in heaven, when he called himself the chiefest of sinners,
and least of Saints, 1 <hi>Tim. 1. 15. Eph.</hi> 3. 8. A Christian in
the progress of his knowledge and grace, is like a vessel cast
into the Sea, the more it fills the deeper it sinks. Those
that went to study at <hi>Athens</hi> (saith <hi>Plutarch</hi>) at first coming,
seemed to themselves to be wise men; afterwards, only lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of wisdom, and after that, only thetoricians, such as
could speak of wisdom, but knew little of it, and last of all
Ideots in their apprehensions; still with the increase of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
laying aside their pride and arrogancy.</p>
                  <p>When harvest is nigh, the grain is more solid and pithy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
than ever it was before; green corn is soft and spungy, but

ferverous and sprightly, but those of a grown Christian are
more judicious and solid; their love to Christ abounds more
and more in all judgment, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 9. The limbs of a Child
are more active and plyable, but as he grows up to a perfect
state, the parts are more consolidated and firmly knit. The
fingers of an old Musician are not so nimble, but he hath a

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:42861:87"/>
the groanings and hastenings of ready Christians to their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected

smite for sin any more, the day of that sinner is at hand, his
harvest is even come. The greatest violation of conscience
is the greatest of sins; this was the case of the forlorn <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi>
among whom Satan had such a plentiful harvest; the
patience of God suffered them to grow till their consciences
were grown seared and past feeling, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 19. When a

Reader, if thou be gone thus far, thou art almost gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all hope of recovery. Towards other sinners, God
usually exercises more patience, but with such he makes
short work. When <hi>Iudas</hi> turns Traitor to his Lord, he is
quickly sent to his own place. Such as are again intangled
and overcome of those lusts they once seemed to have clean
escaped, these bring upon themselves swift damnation, and
their Iudgment lingers not, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 3, 20.</p>
                  <p>He that can endure no reproof or controul in the way of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
his sin, but derides all counsel, and like a strong current,
rages at, and sweeps away all obstacles in his way, will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fall into the dead lake, <hi>Prov. 29. 1. He that being often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
hardeneth his neck shall suddenly be destroyed and that
without remedy.</hi> This is a death spot, a hell spot, where ever
it appears. From this very sypmtom the Prophet plainly
predicted the approaching ruine of <hi>Amaziah, 2 Chron. 25. 16.
I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast
done this, and hast not hearkened to my voice.</hi> He that will not
be timely <hi>counselled,</hi> shall be quickly <hi>destroyed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, when a man comes to glory in his sin, and boast <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
of his wickedness, then its time to cut him down; <hi>whose

                  <p>You see now, what are the signs of a full ripe sinner; and
when it comes to this, either with a Nation, or with a single
person, then ruine is near, <hi>Ioel. 3. 13. Gen.</hi> 15. 16. It is in the
filling up of the measure of sin, as in the filling of a vessel
cast into the Sea, which rowls from side to side, taking in
the water by litle and litle, till it be full, and then down it
sinks to the bottom. Mean while, admirable is divine pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,

                  <p>GOod husbands are careful in Summer to provide for
Winter, then they gather in their Winter store; food
and fewel for themselves, and fodder for their cattel. <hi>He
that gathers in Summer is a wise son, but be that sleeps in harvest
is a son that causes shame,</hi> Prov. 10. 5. A well chosen season is
the greatest advantage to any action, which as it is seldom
found in haste, so it is often lost by delay. 'Tis a good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb
which the frugal <hi>Dutch</hi> have among them; <hi>Bonus Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatius,
facit bonum Bonifacium;</hi> a good Saver, will make a
good Benefactor. And 'tis a good Proverb of our own; He
that neglects the occasion, the occasion will neglect him.
Husbandmen know that Summer will not hold all the year,
neither will they trust to the hopes of a mild and favourable
Winter, but in season provide for the worst.</p>

                  <head>APPLICATION.</head>
                  <p>VVHat excellent Christians should we be, were we but
as provident and thoughtful for our souls? 'tis doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
a singular point of Christan wisdom, to foresee a day of
spiritual straits and necessities, and during the day of grace
to make provision for it. This great Gospel truth is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
shadowed forth in this natural Observation, which I
shall branch out into these seven particulars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Husbandmen know there is a change, and vicissitude of
seasons and weather; though it be pleasant Summer weather
now, yet Winter will tread upon the heel of Summer;
frosts, Snows, and great falls of rain must be expected. This
alternate course of seasons in nature is setled by a firm Law of
the God of nature, to the end of the world. <hi>Gen. 8. 22. Whilst
the earth remaineth, seed time and harvest, cold and heat, winter
and summer, day and night, shall not cease.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And Christians know, that there are changes in the right
hand of the most High, in referrence to their spiritual seasons.
If there be a <hi>Spring time</hi> of the Gospel, there will also be an
<hi>Autmn;</hi> if a day of <hi>prosperity,</hi> it will set in a night of <hi>adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity;
for God hath set the one over aginst the other,</hi> Eccles. 7. 14.
In heaven there is a day of everlasting serenity, in hell a night
of perfect and endless horror and darkness; on earth, light
and darkness take their turns, prosperity and adversity, even
to souls as well as bodies, succeed each other. If there be
a Gospel day, a day of grace now current, it will have its
period and determination, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 6.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Common prudence and experience enables the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
in the midst of Summer, to foresee a Winter, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for it before he feel it; yea natural instinct teaches this
to the very birds of the air, and beasts of the field.</p>
                  <p>And spiritual wisdome should teach Christians to exercise
their foreseeing faculties, and not suffer them to feel evil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they fear it. But O the stupifying nature of sin!
Though the Stork in the heavens knows her appointed time,
and the Turtle, Crane and Swallow the time of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:42861:90"/>
yet man, whom God hath made wiser than the fowls of
the air, in this acts quite below them, <hi>Ier.</hi> 8. 7.</p>
                  <p>The end of Gods ordaining a summer season, and send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
warm and pleasant weather, is to ripen the fruits of the
earth, and give the Husbandman fit opportunity to gather
them in.</p>
                  <p>And God's design in giving men a day of grace, is to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
them with an opportunity for the everlasting happiness
and salvation of their souls, <hi>Rev. 2. 21. I gave her a space to
repent.</hi> It is not a meer reprieval of the soul, or only a delay
of the execution of threatned wrath, though there be much
mercy in that; but the peculiar aim of this patience and
bounty of God, is to open for them a way to escape the wrath
to come, <hi>by leading them to repentance,</hi> Rom. 2. 4.</p>
                  <p>The Husbandman doth not find all harvest seasons alike
favourable, sometimes they have much fair weather, and meet
with no hindrance in their business; other times 'tis a catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
harvest, but now and then a fair day, and then they must
be nimble or all is lost.</p>
                  <p>There is also great difference in Soul-seasons, some have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
had a long and a fair season of grace; an hundred and twenty
years did God wait upon the old world, in the Ministry of
<hi>Noah.</hi> Long did God wait on the gainsaying <hi>Israelites,</hi> Isa.
42. 14. <hi>I have a long time held my peace, I have been still and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frained
myself.</hi> Others have a short and catching season, all
lies upon a day, upon a nick of time, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 30.</p>
                  <p>A proper season neglectd and lost, is irrecoverable. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
things in Husbandry must be done in their season, or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be done at all for that year; if he plow not, and sow not
in the proper time, he loses the harvest of that year.</p>
                  <p>'Tis even so as to spiritual seasons. Christ neglected, and
grace despised, in the season when God offers them, are irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverably
lost, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 28. then (that is, when the season
is over) they shall call upon me but I will not hear. O, there
is a great deal of time in a short opportunity! that may be
done or prevented, in an hour rightly timed, which cannot
be done or prevented in a mans life-time afterwards. There
was one resolved to kill <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> such a day; the night
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:42861:91"/>
before, a friend sent him a letter to acquaint him with it, but
he being at supper, and busie in discourse, said, to morrow is
a new day, and indeed it was, <hi>dies novissima,</hi> his last day to
him; whence it became a Proverb in <hi>Greece. To morrow is
a new day.</hi> Our glass runs in heaven, and we cannot see how
much or little of the sand of God's patience is yet to run
down; but this is certain, when that glass is run, there is
nothing to be done for our souls, <hi>Luke 19. 42. O that thou
hadst known at least in this thy day, the things that belong to thy
peace, but now they are bid from thine eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Those Husbandmen that are careful and laborious in the
Summer, have the comfort and benefit of it in Winter; he
that then provides fewel, shall sit warm in his habitation,
when others blow their fingers. He that provides food for
his family, and fodder for his cattel in the harvest, shall eat
the fruit of it, and enjoy the comfort of his labours,
when others shall be exposed to shifts and straits. And he that
provides for eternity, and layes up for his soul a good foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
against the time to come, shall eat when others are
hungry, and sing when others howl, <hi>Isa.</hi> 65. 13. A day of
death will come, and that will be a day of straits to all neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
souls; but then the diligent Christian shall enjoy the
peace and comfort that shall flow in upon his heart, from his
holy care and sincere diligence in duties? as 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 12.
This is our rejoycing, the testimony of our conscience, that in all
sincerity and godly simplicity, we have had our conversation in this
world. So Hezekiah, 2 King. 20. 3. Remember now, O Lord,
how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart.</hi>
A day of judgement will come, and then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oolish virgins, who
neglected the season of getting oyl in their lamps, will be
put to their shifts; then they come to the wife, and say, give
us of your oyl, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 8, 9. but they have none to spare, and
the season of buying is then over.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> No wise Husbandman will neglect a fit opportunity of ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
in his hay and corn, upon a presumption of much
fair weather to come; he will not say, the weather is setled,
and I need not trouble my self, though my corn and hay be fit
for the house, yet I may get it in another time as well as now.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:42861:91"/>
And no wise Christian will lose a present season for his
soul, upon the hopes of much more time yet to come; but
will rather say, now is my time, and I know not what will
be hereafter; hereafter I may wish to see one of the dayes
of the Son of man, and not see it, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 22. 'Tis sad to
hear how cunning some men are to dispute themselves out of
heaven, as if the devil had hired them to plead against their
own souls; sometimes urging the example of those that were
called at the eleventh hour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 6. and sometimes that
of the penitent thief: But, O! to how little purpose is the
former pleaded; they that were called at the eleventh hour
were never called before, as these have been, no man had
hired; that is, called or invited them to Christ, and for the
thief, (as Mr. <hi>Fenner</hi> rightly observes) it was a singular and
extraordinary example. It was done when Christ hang'd
on the Cross, and was to be inaugurated; then Kings manifest
such bounty, and pardon such crimes, as are never pardoned
afterwards. Besides, God was then in a way of working
miracles; then he rent the rocks, open'd the graves, raised
the dead, and converted this thief; but God is now out of
that way.</p>

                  <p>I Have indeed been a good Husband for the world;<note place="margin">The careless souls reflection</note> with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
what care and providence have I looked out for my self
and family, to provide food to nourish them, and cloaths to
defend them against the asperities of Winter? mean while
neglecting to make provision for eternity, or take care for
my soul. O my destitute soul! how much have I slighted
and undervalued thee? I have taken more care for an horse
or an ox, than for thee; a well stored-barn, but an empty
soul. Will it not shortly be with me, as with that careless
Mother, who when her house was on fire, busily bestir'd her
self to save the goods, but forgot the child? (though it were
saved by another hand) and then minding her child, ran up
and down like one distracted wringing her hands, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
O my child, my child! I have saved my goods, and lost
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:42861:92"/>
my child, such will be the case of thee, my soul, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.
26. Besides how easie will my conviction be at the Bar of
Christ? will not my providence and care for the things of
this life, leave me speechless and self-condemned in that day?
What shall I answer when the Lord shall say, Thou couldst
foresee a Winter, and seasonably provide for it? yea, thou
hadst so much care of thy very beasts, to provide for their
necessities, and why tookest thou no care for thy soul? was
that only not worth the caring for?</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Is it so dangerous to neglect a present proper season of

time, neither am I sure, that he who is, will ever vouchsafe
an hour of grace in old age, to him that hath neglected many
such hours in youth; neither indeed is it ordinary for God
so to do. 'Tis storied of <hi>Caius Marius Victorius,</hi> who lived
about 300 years after Christ, and to his old age continued a
<hi>Pagan,</hi> but at last being convinced of the Christian verity,
he came to <hi>Simplicianus</hi> and told him, he would be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian;
but neither he, nor the Church could believe it, it
being so rare an example for any to be converted at his age:

<hi>Caius Marius Victorius</hi> is become a Christian. This was

                  <p>GOd gives to every seed its own body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 38.
At first he created every Tree and herb of the field,
having its seed in it self, for the conservation of the <hi>species;</hi> and
they all inviolably observe the Law of their Creation. All
fruits naturally rise out of the seeds, and roots proper to
them. <hi>Men do not gather grapes of thorns, nor figs of thistles.</hi>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:42861:93"/>
Such productions would be monstrous in nature and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the juice or sap of the earth be the common matter
of all kind of fruits, yet it is specificated according to the
different sorts of Plants and seeds it nourishes. Where
Wheat is sown, it's turned into Wheat; in an apple Tree, it
becomes an apple; and so in every sort of Plants or seeds,
it's concocted into fruit proper to the kind.</p>

                  <p>TRanslate this into spirituals, and the proposition sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
forth by it, is fully expressed by the Apostle,
<hi>Gal. 6. 7. What a man sows, that shall be reap; they that sow to
the flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption; and they that sow to the
spirit, shall of the spirit reap life everlasting.</hi> And as sure as the
harvest follows the seed-time, so sure shall such fruits and
effects result from the seeds of such actions. <hi>He that soweth
iniquity, shall reap vanity,</hi> Prov. 22. 8. <hi>And they that now go
forth weeping, and bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
rejoycing bringing their sheaves with them,</hi> Psal. 126. 5. The
sum of all is this, That our present actions have the same re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and relation to future rewards and punishments, as
the seed we sow in our fields, hath to the harvest we reap
from it. Every gracious action is the seed of joy, and every
sinful action the seed of anguish and sorrow, to the soul that
sowed it. Two things are sensibly presented to us in this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>That as the seed sown, is presently covered from our sight <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
under the clods, and for some time after we see no more of
it, and yet at last it appears again, by which it's evident to
us that it is not finally lost: So our present actions, though
<hi>physically</hi> transient, and perhaps forgotten, yet are not lost,
but after a time shall appear again in order to a retribution.</p>
                  <p>If this were not so, all good and holy actions would be to
the loss of him that performed them. All the self-denial,
spending duties, and sharp sufferings of the people of God,
would turn to their damage, though not in point of honesty,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:42861:94"/>
yet in point of personal utility; and then also, what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
would there be betwixt the actions of a man and a
beast, with respect to future good or evil? yea, man would
then be more feared and obeyed than God, and souls be
swayed in all their motions, only by the influence of present
things; and where then would Religion be found in the
world? 'Tis an excellent note of <hi>Drexellius;</hi>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The other thing held forth in this similitude is, That ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the nature of our actions now, will be the fruit
and reward of them then. Though the fruit or consequence
of holy actions, for the present may seem bitter, and the
fruit of sinful actions sweet and pleasant, yet there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more certain, that that their future fruits shall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their present nature and quality, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10.
Then <hi>Dionisius</hi> shall retract that saying, <hi>Ecce quam prospera

sacriledge. Sometimes indeed (though but rarely) God
causes sinners to reap in this world, the same that they have

passage to this purpose, concerning <hi>Valens</hi> the <hi>Emperor,</hi> who
was an <hi>Arrian,</hi> and a bitter persecutor of the Christians:
This man, when eighty of the Orthodox Christians failed
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:42861:94"/>
from <hi>Constantinople</hi> to <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> to treat with him about
the points of <hi>Arrianism,</hi> and to settle the matter by way of
dispute; the <hi>Emperour</hi> hearing of their arrival, while they
were yet in the Harbour, and not a man landed, caused the
Ships to be fired wherein they were, and so consumed them
all. Not long after, in his Wars against the <hi>Goths,</hi> he was
overthrown; and hiding himself in a little Cottage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

reap'd what he sowed, burning for burning, the very same

turned,<note place="margin">Cum video ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la sata bonis, ignoscite queso: sollicitor nullos esse putare Deos. <hi>Ovid.</hi>

Though now it seem but a common mercy to most, and a

den to some; yet the people of God were wont to esteem
it a choice mercy, and rejoyced greatly in it. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 16. 21.
there's joy that a man is born into the world. (3) <hi>The joy of
conquests</hi> and victories, when men divide the spoyl. And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>The joy of Harvest;</hi> these two we find put together as
principal matters of joy, <hi>Isa. 9. 3. They joy before thee, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the joy in Harvest, and as men rejoyce when they divide
the spoyl.</hi> The joy of Harvest is no small joy; <hi>Gaudium
messis, est messis gaudii,</hi> the joy of harvest, is the harvest of
their joy. 'Tis usual with men, when they have reaped down
their harvest, (or cut the neck, as they call it) to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
their joy by shoutings, and loud acclamations.</p>

                  <p>THus, and unspeakably more than thus, do Saints rejoyce
and shout for joy, when they reap the favour and love
of God, for which they laboured in many a weary duty. This
joy of harvest, as great as it is, and as much as carnal hearts
are lifted up with it, is but a trifle, a thing of nought, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with yours; after they have sown to themselves in
righteousness, and waited for the effects and returns of their
duties with patience, and at last come to reap in mercy,
either the full harvest in heaven, or but the first fruits of it
on earth, yet rejoyce, <hi>with joy unspeakable and full of glory,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8. This puts more gladness into their hearts, than when
corn and wine increases,</hi> Psal. 4. 7. Carnal joyes are but soul-Fevers,
the Agues of the inner-man; there is as great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

be purchased by it: but yet it is not like Christ, the object of
a Saints joy; though it answers many things it doth not
answer all things as Christ doth; turn it into what you will,
it hath but a limited and respective usefulness: but Iesus
Christ is all in all to believers, and out of him their faith can
fetch all supplies; he is their health in sickness, their
strength in weakness, their ease in pain, their honour in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
their wealth in poverty, their friend in friendlessness,
their habitation when harbourless, their enlargement in
bonds, the strength of their hearts, and life of their life. O
he is a full Christ, and what ever excellencies are scattered
among all the creatures, do meet all in him, and much more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> You rejoyce when you have gotten in your harvest, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
now you can free those engagements, and pay those
debts which you have contracted. 'Tis a comfort to be out
of debt, and you may lawfully rejoyce that God gives you
wherewith to quit your engagements, that you may owe to
man any thing but love: but still the joy of harvest falls
short of the joy of Saints; for you rejoyce that you are, or
have wherewith to help your selves out of mens debts: but
they rejoyce that they are out of God'd debt, that his book
is cancelled, and their sins pardoned; that by reason of the
imputed righteousness, of Christ, the Law can demand no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
from them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. O, what matter of joy is
this!</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="155" facs="tcp:42861:97"/>
You rejoyce, because now your corn is out of danger, all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
the while it was abroad it was in hazard, but now it's
housed you fear not the rain. But Christians rejoyce, not
because their corn is safe, but because their souls are so. All
the while they abode in an unregenerate state, they were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
moment in danger of the storms of wrath; but now
being in Christ, that danger is over; and what compare is
there betwixt the safety of a little corn, and the security of
an immortal soul?</p>
                  <p>Your joy is but in a gift of common providence. <hi>Turks</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
and <hi>Heathens</hi> can rejoyce with your joy, but the joy of a
Christian is a peculiar favour and gift of God. Corn is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to all Nations, even the most barbarous and wicked have
store of it; but Christ is the portion but of a few, and those
the dearly beloved of God. <hi>Luther</hi> said of the whole <hi>Turkish
Empire</hi> (where is the best and greatest store of corn) that it
is but a crumb which the Master of the Family throws to the
dogs. He that had more corn than his Barns could hold,
now wants a drop of water to cool his tongue. Christ is a
gift bestowed only upon God's Elect.</p>
                  <p>Your joy will have an end; the time is coming, that when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
you have reaped down your harvests, your selves must be
reaped down by death, and then you shall rejoyce in these
things no more; but when your joy is ended, then is the joy
of Saints perfected; they reap their harvest, when you
leave your harvest: their consolation is everlasting.</p>
                  <p>God an separate your joy from these ejoyments, even <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
while you have them, as well as when you leave them. 'Tis
one thing for a man to have riches and full Barns, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing to have comfort in them, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5. 19, 20. But
now the joy of Christians is a thing inseparable from their
enjoyment of Christ: Indeed the sense of their interest may
be lost, and so the acts of their joy intermitted; but they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
have it in the seed, if not in the fruit, <hi>Psal. 97. 11.
Ioy is sown for the upright;</hi> he hath it still in the principle,
and in the promise.</p>
                  <p>The joy of Harvest-men, for the most part, is only in their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>
harvest, and in such earthly things; take that away, and their
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:42861:98"/>
joy ceases. Earthly hearts are acquainted with no higher
comforts; but the people of God can joy in him, and take
comfort in their earthly enjoyments too; and what comfort
they take in these things, is much more refined and sweet
than yours; for they enjoy all these things in God, and his
love in giving them, puts a sweetness into them, that you are
unacquainted with. Thus you see, how far your joy falls
short of theirs.</p>

here I have given thee (with <hi>Ishmael</hi>) the fatness of the earth:
Thou shalt not say, but thou hast tasted of thy Creator's

thou shalt have from me: There be others in the world, to
whom I have denyed these things, but for them I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served

                  <p>HUsbandmen having to do with divers sorts of grain
some more tough and stubborn; others more free and
tender, do not beat all alike in the threshing floor; but as
they have threshals of several sizes, so they bestow on some
grain more, on other fewer strokes, according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
qualities of the grain to the threshed. This observation
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:42861:100"/>
the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> hath, <hi>Chop.</hi> 28. v. 27. <hi>The Fitches are not
thereshed with a threshing instrument, neither is the Cart-wheel
turn'd about upon the Cummin, but the Fitches are beaten out
with a staff, and the Cummin with a rod.</hi> The manner of beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out the corn in ancient times, was far different from that
which is now in use among us; they had the Cart-wheel,
which was full of iron spokes or teeth, and the hoofs of
beasts for the harder sort of grain, as Wheat, Rye and Barley,
a staff or flail for the Fitches, and a rod or twig for the Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min;
all which instruments were proportioned according to
the nature of the grain.</p>

that; but yet I will do it moderately, I will not lay on
without measure or mercy, as I intend to do upon the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
but will mete out your sufferings in a due proportion,
even as a careful Physician in prescribing pills or potions to
his Patients, hath regard as well to the ability of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient

God, O <hi>Israel,</hi> will not afflict thee according to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

90. 11. that would break thee to pieces, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 38. Nor

As it shall be much less than what I could inflict; so it shall

my power, nor thy desert, shall be the rule of my proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
but I will do it with moderation and mercy, as thou

proportion his instruments to the quality of the grain before
him, will exercise the like wisdom and mildness towards the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:42861:100"/>
thee, and the similitude betwixt the Husbandmans thresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his corn, and the Lords afflicting his people, stands in
these particulars.</p>
                  <p>The Husbandmans end in threshing the corn, is to separate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
it from the husks and chaff; and God's end in afflicting his
people, is to separate them from their sins, <hi>Isa.</hi> 27. 9. In
measure when it shooteth forth, he will debate with it, (<hi>i. e.</hi>)
he will moderately correct them; and what the end of those
corrections are, the next words inform us; <hi>By this therefore
shall the iniquity of</hi> Iacob <hi>be purged, and this is all the fruit to
take away his sin.</hi> God uses afflictions, as we use sope, to
cleanse away filthiness, and fetch out spots, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 35.
he aimes not at the destruction of their persons, but of their
lusts.</p>
                  <p>If the Husbandman have cockle, darnel, or pernicious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
tares before him in the floor among his corn, he little regards
whether it be bruised and battered to pieces by the threshold
or no; 'tis a worthless thing, and he spares it not. Such
cockle and tares are the enemies of God; and when these
come under his flail, he strikes them without mercy; for
these, the Lord prepares a new sharp threshing instrument
having teeth, which shall beat them to dust, <hi>Isa. 41. 15. The
daughter to</hi> Babylon <hi>is like a threshing floor; 'tis time to thresh
her,</hi> Ier. 51. 33. And when that time is come, then (in
allusion to the beast, that was to tread out the corn) <hi>Sion's
horn shall be of iron, and her hoofs brass,</hi> Mich. 4. 13. He
smites not his people, according to the stroke of them that
smote them; the meaning is, his strokes on them shall be d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
strokes. They shewed no mercy to <hi>Sien,</hi> and God will shew
no mercy to them.</p>
                  <p>When the husks and chaff are perfectly separated from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
the grain, then the Husbandman beats it no more. When
God hath perfectly purged and separated the sins of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
then afflictions shall come to a perpetual end, he will
never smite them again; there is no noise of the threshing
instrument in heaven; he that beat them with his flail on
earth, will put them into his bosom in heaven.</p>
                  <p>Though the Husbandman layes on, and beates his corn, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
                     <pb n="162" facs="tcp:42861:101"/>
if he were angry with it, yet he loves and highly prizes it,
and though God strike and afflict his people, yet he sets a
great value upon them? and it is equally absurd to infer
God's hatred to his people from his afflicting of them, as the
Husbandmans hatred of his corn, because he threshes and
beats it <hi>Heb. 12. 6. Whom the Lord loveth he correcteth, and
chasteneth every son whom he receiveth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Though the Husbandman thresh and beat the corn, yet he
will not bruise or hurt if he can help it; though some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
more and harder strokes that others, yet none shall
have more than it can endure. And though the Lord afflict
his servants, yet he will do them no hurt, <hi>Ier.</hi> 25. 6. Some
need more rods that others, but none shall have more than
they can bear; the Lord knows the measures and degrees
of his servants faith and patience, and accordingly shall their
tryals be, <hi>Psal. 103. 13, 14. Like as a father pities his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
so the Lord pitieth them that fear him; for he knows their
frame, he remembers they are but dust; he makes a way to escape,
that they may be able to bear it, 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 13. This care and
tenderness of God over <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>is afflicted, is eminently discovered
in three particulars.</p>
                  <p>(1) In not exposing them to, till he have prepared them

eminent discoveries of his love immediately before, and as

What then shall I think of my condition, who prosper

me as on a weed, and not as his corn; and 'tis too probable
that I am rather reserved for burning, than threshing. Some

                  <head>APPLICATION.</head>
                  <p>MEn have their winnowing dayes, and God hath his; a
day to separate the chaff from the wheat, the godly
from the ungodly, who shall both be held up to the wind,
but only the wicked shall be driven away by it. Such a day
God hath in this world, wherein he winnows his wheat, and
separates the chaff. There is a double fanning or winnowing
of men here in this world; one is <hi>doctrinally,</hi> in which sense
I understand that Scripture, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 12. spoken of Christ,
when he was entring into his Ministerial work, <hi>His fan is
in his hand, and he shall throughly purge his floor, and gather his
wheat into the garner, but he will brun up the chaff with unquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chable
fire.</hi> The preaching of the Gospel is as a fan in Christs
hand, and it is as much as if <hi>Iohn</hi> had thus told the <hi>Iews,</hi> that
though there were the many hypocrytical ones among them, that
had now a place and name among the people of God, and
gloried in their Church-priviledges, yet there is a purging
blast of truth coming, which shall make them fly out of the
Church, as fast as chaff out of the floor. Thus Christ win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nows
or fans the world doctrinally: The other is <hi>judicially,</hi>
by bringing sore and grievous tryals and sufferings upon the
Churches, for this very end, that those which are but chaff,
(<hi>i. e.</hi>) empty and vain Professors may be such winds as these,
be separated from his people.</p>
                  <p>The Church increases two wayes, and by two divers
means <hi>extensively,</hi> in breadth and numbers, and <hi>intensively,</hi> in
vigour and power; peace and prosperity cause the first,
sufferings and adversity the last; and well may a day of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:42861:103"/>
be called a winnowing day, for then were the people
of God tossed to purpose, as corn in the si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>st thereby. Of such a winnowing day the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
speaks, <hi>Amos 9. 9, 10. I will sift the house of</hi> Israel
<hi>among all Nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the
least grain fall upon the earth, all the sinners of my people shall die.
(q. d.)</hi> I will cause great agitations and tossings among you
by the hands of the <hi>Assyrians</hi> and <hi>Babylonians,</hi> into whose
Countryes you shall be disperst and scattered, yet I will so
govern those your dispersions by my providence, that not one
good grain, one upright soul shall eternally perish; but the
sinners of my people, the refuse stuff, that shall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.</p>
                  <p>To the same purpose speaks another Prophet, <hi>Zeph. 1. 1, 2.
Gather your selves together,</hi> (or as some read) <hi>fan your selves,</hi>
yea, fan your selves, <hi>before the decree bring forth, and the day
pass as the chaff.</hi> He doth not mean, that the time shall pass as
the chaff, but there is a day of affliction and distress coming
in which the wicked shall pass as the chaff before the wind;
and yet notwithstanding, all these winnowings upon earth,
much chaff will still abide among the corn; therefore God
hath appointed another day for the winnownig of the world,
even the day of judgment, in reference to which it is said,
<hi>Psal. 1. 4, 5. The ungodly are not so, but are like the chaff which
the wind drives away; therefore the ungodly shall not stand in
judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous; (i. e.)</hi>
God hath a day wherein he will fift the world, like corn in a
sieve, and then the wicked shall appear to be but chaff,
which God will eternally separate from his wheat. I will
not strain the similitude, but fairly display it in these seven
particulars.</p>
                  <p>The chaff and wheat grow together in the same field, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
upon the same root and stalk. In this, wicked men are like
chaff, who not only associate with the people of God, but
oftentimes spring up with them in the same families, and
from the same root, or immediate Parents, <hi>Mal. 1. 2. was
not Esau, Iacobs brother;</hi> yet the one was wheat, the other
chaff. Instances of this are infinite.</p>
                  <p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The Husbandman would never endure the husks, chaff, and
dry stalks to remain in the field, if it were not for the good
corns sake; he would quickly set fire on it, but that the corn
is among it, which he highly prizeth; and be assured, God
would never suffer the wicked to abide long in this world
were it not for his own<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>act that were dispersed among them.
Except the Lord had such a remnant dispersed in the world,
he would quickly set fire to the four quarters, and make it like
<hi>Sodom, Isa.</hi> 1. 9.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The chaff is a very worthless thing, the Husbandman cares
not what becomes of it, and of as little worth are wicked
men, <hi>Prov. 10. 20. The heart of the wicked is little worth.</hi>
The heart is the principal part of the man, and yet that's but
chaff, no worth in it; his lands, his cloaths, &amp;c. are worth
somewhat, but his heart is worth nothing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Though chaff in it self be nothing worth, yet, it is of some
use ot the corn whiles 'tis standing in the field; the stalk
bears up the ear, and the chaff covers the grain, and defends
it from the injury of the weather. Thus God makes wicked
men of use to his people, in outward society; they help to
support and protect them in this world, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 16. The
earth helped the woman, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) worldly men for carnal ends
helpt the Church, when a flood of persecution was poured
out. The Church often helps the world, it receives many
benefits from the people of God; and sometimes God over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rules
the world to help his Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> When the chaff and wheat are both brought forth and
held up to the wind in one sieve, they fall two wayes; the

quite away: So although for a time godly and ungodly abide

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> If there be any chaff among the corn, it will appear when
it is sifted in a windy day, it cannot possibly escape if it
be well winnowed; much more impossible it is for any

the closest hypocrite shall then be detected, for God will

will not cast away a perfect (i. e.)</hi> an upright hearted) <hi>man, Iob</hi>
8. 20. He that's appointed to judge the world is mine; and
his imputed righteousness will make me full weight in the
balance. Bless the Lord (O my soul) for sincerity; this will
abide, when common gifts and empty names will flee as the
chaff before the wind.</p>

                  <head>OBSERVATION.</head>
                  <p>A Wild tree naturally springing up in the wood or
hedge, and never graffed or removed from its native
soyl, may bear some fruit, and that fair and beautiful to the
eye, but it will give you no content at all in eating, being
alwayes harsh, sower and unpleasant to the taste; but if such
a stock be removed into a good soyl, and graffed with a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
kind, it may become a good tree, and yield store of choice
and pleasant fruit.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>APPLICATION.</head>
                  <p>UNregenerate men who never were acquainted with the
mystery of spiritual union with Iesus Christ but still
grow upon their natural root, old <hi>Adam,</hi> may by the force
and power of natural principles bring forth some fruit,
(which like the wild hedge fruit we speak of) may indeed
be fair and pleasant to the eyes of men, but God takes no
pleasure at all in it; its sower, harsh, and distasteful to him,
because it springs not from the spirit of Christ, <hi>Isa, 1. 13.
I cannot away with it, it is iniquity,</hi> &amp;c. but that I may not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle
the thred of my discourse, I shall (as in the former
Chapters) set before you a paralel betwixt the best fruits of
natural men, and those of a wild ungraffed tree.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The root that bears this wild fruit is a degenerate root,
and that's the cause of all this sowerness and harshness in the
fruit it bears; it's the seed of some better Tree accidentally
blown, or cast into some waste and bad soyl, where not being
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:42861:107"/>
manured and ordered aright, it's turned wild: So all the
fruits of unregenerate men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>low from the first <hi>Adam,</hi> a
corrupt and degenerate root; he was indeed planted a right
seed, but soon turned a wild and degenerate plant; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the root from which every man naturally springs, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts
all the fruit that any man bears from him. It's observed
by <hi>Gregory,</hi> pertinent to my present purpose, <hi>Genus humanum
in parente primo, velut in radice putruit;</hi> Mankind was putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in the root of his first parent, <hi>Matt. 7. 18. A Corrupt tree
cannot bring forth good fruit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This corrupt root spoyls the fruit, by the transmission of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
its sower and naughty sap into all the branches and fruits
that grow on them; they suck no other nourishment, but
what the root affords them, and that being bad, spoyles all:
for the same cause and reason, no mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> natural or unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
man can ever do one holy or acceptable action, because
the corruption of the root is in all those actions. The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of our drawing corruption into all our actions, from
this cursed root <hi>Adam,</hi> is expressed by a quick and smart In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogation,
<hi>Iob 14. 4. Who can bring a clean thing out of an
unclean? not one.</hi> The sense of it is well delivered us (by Mr.
<hi>Caryl in loc.</hi>) This question (saith he) may undergo a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
construction; First, thus: Who can bring a morally
clean person, out of a person originally unclean? and so he
layes his hand upon his birth-sin: Or, secondly, (which
speaks to my purpose) it may refer to the action of the same
man, man being unclean, cannot bring forth a clean thing;
(<hi>i. e.</hi>) a clean or holy action; that which is originated, is
like its Original. And that this sower sap of the first stock
(I mean <hi>Adams</hi> sin) is transmitted into all mankind, not only
corrupting their fruit, but ruining and withering all the
branches; the <hi>Apostle</hi> shews us in that excellent parallell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the two <hi>Adams,</hi> Rom. 5. 12. <hi>Wherefore as by one man]</hi>
one, not only <hi>in individuo, sed in specie,</hi> one representing the
whole root or stock, <hi>sin entered into the world]</hi> not by imitation
only, but by propagation? and this brought death and ruine
upon all the branches.</p>
                  <p>Although these wild hedge-fruits be unwholsom and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:42861:108"/>
to the taste, yet they are fair and beautiful to the
eye; a man that looks upon them, and doth not know what
fruit it is, would judge it by its shew and colour to be excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
fruit; for it makes a fairer shew oftentimes, than the
best and most wholsome fruit doth: Even so, those natural
gifts and endowments which some unregenerate persons
have, seem exceeding fair to the eye, and a fruit to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired.
What excellent qualities have some meer natural men
and women? what a winning affability? humble condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
meekness, righteousness, ingenious tenderness and
sweetness of nature! As it was (hyperbolically enough) said
of one, <hi>In hoc homine, non peccavit Adam; Adam</hi> never sinned
in this man; meaning, that he excelled the generality of <hi>Adams</hi>
children in sweetness of temper and natural endowments.
What curious phantasies, imble wits, solid judgments, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious
memories, rare elocution, &amp;c. are to be found
among meer natural men? by which they are assisted in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing'
praying, preaching and writing, to the admiration
of such as know them! But that which is highly esteemed
of men, is abomination to God, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 15. it finds no accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with him, because it springs from that cursed root of
nature and is not the production of this own spirit.</p>
                  <p>If such a stock were removed into a better soyl, and gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> with a better kind, it might bring forth fruit pleasant
and grateful to the Husbandman; and if such persons (before
described) were but regenerated and changed in their spirits
and principles, what excellent and useful persons would they
be in the Church of God? and then their fruits would be
sweet and acceptable to him. One observes of <hi>Tertullian, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen,</hi>
and <hi>Ierome,</hi> that they came into <hi>Canaan,</hi> laden with
<hi>Egyptian</hi> gold, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) they came into the Church full of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
humane learning, which did Christ much service.</p>
                  <p>When the Husbandman cuts down his woods or hedges,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> he cuts down these Crab-stocks with the rest, because he va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues
them not any more than the thorns and brambles among
which they grow; and as little will God regard or spare
these natural branches, how much soever they are laden with
such fruit. The threatning is universal, <hi>Iohn 3. 3. Except you
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:42861:108"/>
be regenerate and born again, you cannot enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of heaven.</hi> And again, <hi>Heb. 12. 14. Without holiness, no
man</hi> (be his natural gifts never so excellent) <hi>shall see God.</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellished
nature, is nature still; <hi>That which is born of the
flesh, is but flesh,</hi> however it be set off with advantage to the

in the day of judgment; what doth it avail me that

Will my Iudge be charm'd with a rhetorical tongue? Things

as I am ignorant of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the mystery of Regeneration?
My head hath often aked with study, but when did my heart

grace for ever to be admired! Ah, what cause have I to be
thankful to free grace, and for ever to walk humbly with my
God: the Lord hath therefore chosen an unlikely, rugged,

                  <head>OBSERVATION.</head>
                  <p>WHen the Husbandman hath prepared his graffs in the
season of the year, he carries them, with the tools
that are necessary for that work, to the tree or stock he intends
to ingraft; and having cut off the top of the limb, in some
strait smooth part, he cleaves it with his knife or chissel, a
little beside the pith; knocks in his wedge to keep it open,
then (having prepared the graff, he carefully sets it into the
cleft joyning the inner side of the barks, of graff and stock
together (there being the main current of the sap) then pulls
out his wedge, binds both together (as in barking) and clayes
it up, to defend the tender graff and wounded stock, from
the injuries of the Sun and rain.</p>
                  <p>These tender cyences quickly take hold of the stock, and
having immediate coalition with it, drink in its sap, concoct
it into their own nourishment, thrive better, and bear more
and better fruits than ever they would have done upon their
natural root, yea, the smallest bud, being carefully inoccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
and bound close to the stock, will in short time become
a flourishing and fruitful limb.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>APPLICATION.</head>
                  <p>THis carries a most sweet and lively resemblance, of the
souls union with Christ by faith; and indeed there is
nothing in nature that shadows forth this great Gospel-my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
like it: 'Tis a thousand pities, that any who are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
about, or are but spectators of such an action, should
terminate their thoughts (as too many do) in that natural
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:42861:110"/>
object, and not raise up their hearts to these heavenly medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
which it so fairly offers them.</p>
                  <p>When a twig is to be ingraffed, or a bud inocculated, it's <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
first cut off by a keen knife from the Tree on which it natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
grew.</p>
                  <p>And when the Lord intends to graft a soul into Christ, the
first work about it is cutting work, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. their hearts
were cut by conviction and deep compunction; no cyence is
ingraffed without cutting, no soul united with Christ with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a cutting sense of sin and misery, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>When the tender shoot is cut off from the Tree, there are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
(ordinarily) many more left behind upon the same Tree, as
promising and vigorous as that which is taken; but it pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Husbandman to chuse this, and leave them.</p>
                  <p>Even so it is in the removing or transplanting of a soul by
conversion, it leaves many behind it in the state of nature,
as likely and promising as it self, but so it pleaseth God to
take this soul, and leave many others; yea, often such as grew
upon the same root; I mean, the immediate parent, <hi>Mal.
1. 2. was not</hi> Esau, Iacob's <hi>brother (saith the Lord) yet I loved</hi>
Iacob, <hi>and I hated</hi> Esau.</p>
                  <p>When the graffs are cut off, in order to this work, 'tis a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
critical season with them; if they lye too long before they
are ingraffed, or take not with the stock, they dye, and are
never more to be recovered; they may stand in the stock a
while, but are no part of the Tree.</p>
                  <p>So when souls are under a work of conviction, it is a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
time with them; many a one have I known then to
miscarry, and never recovered again; they have indeed for
a time stood like dead graffs in the stock, by an external dead
hearted profession, but never came to any thing; and as
such dead graffs, either fall off from the stock, or moulder
away upon it, so do these, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 19.</p>
                  <p>The Husbandman when he hath cut off graffs, or tender <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
buds, makes all the convenient speed he can to close them
with the stock; the sooner that's done, the better; they get
no good by remaining as they are. And truly it concerns the
servants of the Lord, who are imployed in this work, of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:42861:111"/>
ingraffing souls into Christ, to make all the haste they can,
to bring the convicted sinner to a closure with Christ. As
soon as ever the trembling Iaylor cryed out, <hi>What shall I do to
be saved? Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> immediately direct him to <hi>Christ,</hi> Act.
16. 30, 31. They do not say, it's too soon for thee to act
faith on <hi>Christ,</hi> thou art not yet humbled enough, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in the Lord <hi>Iesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> There must be an incision made in the stock before any
bud can be inocculated, or the stock must be cut and cleaved,
before the cyence can be ingraffed according to that in the
Poet. <hi>Venerit insitio, fac ramum ramus adoptet. (i. e.)</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>To graffs, no living sap the stocks impart;</l>
                        <l>Unless you wound, and cut them neer the heart.</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>Such an incision or wound was made upon <hi>Christ,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to our ingraffing into him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 19. 34. the opening of
that deadly wound gives life to the souls of believers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> The graff is intimately united, and closly conjoyned with
the stock, the conjunction is so closs, that they become one
Tree.</p>
                  <p>There is also a most closs and intimate union betwixt
Christ, and the soul that believeth in him. It is emphatical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expressed by the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 17. He that is joyned
to the Lord, is one spirit.</hi> The word imports, the nearest, closs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
and strictest union. <hi>Christ</hi> and the soul cleave together in
a blessed oneness, as those things do that are glewed one to
another; so that, look as the graff is really in the stock, and
the spirit or sap of the stock is really in the graff, so a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
is really (though mystically) in <hi>Christ;</hi> and the Spirit
of <hi>Christ</hi> is really communicated to a believer. <hi>I live,</hi> saith
<hi>Paul, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. <hi>He that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him,</hi> 1 Ioh. 4. 16.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Graffs are bound to the stock, by bonds made of hay or
flags; these keep it steddy, else the wind would loose it out
of the stock.</p>
                  <p>The believing soul is also fastened to Christ, by bands
which will secure it from all danger of being loosed off from
him any more. There are two bonds of this union; the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
on God's part, this is the firm bond of union, without
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:42861:111"/>
which we could never be made one with Christ, <hi>Rom. 8. 9.
If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his;</hi> and
<hi>faith</hi> on our part, <hi>Eph. 3. 17. That Christ may dwell in your
hearts by faith.</hi> These hold strongly.</p>
                  <p>Though the stock be one and the same, yet all graffs do <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>
not thrive and flourish alike in it, some out-grow the rest;
and those that grow not so well as the others do, the fault is
in them, and not in the stock: So it is with souls really uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to <hi>Christ;</hi> all do not flourish alike in him, the faith of
some <hi>grows</hi> exceedingly, 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 3. the things that be in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are ready to die, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 2. and such souls must charge
the fault upon themselves. <hi>Christ</hi> sends up living sap enough,
not only to make all that are in him living, but fruitful
branches.</p>

the ingraffed cyence and the stock? what honour and
glory then hath Christ conferred upon me, a poor unworthy
creature? What! to be made one with him, to be a living
branch of him, to be joyned thus to the Lord. Oh! what a
preferment is this! it is but a little while since I was a wild
and cursed plant, growing in the wilderness amongst them
that shall shortly be cut down and faggotted up for hell, for
me to be taken from amongst them, and planted into Christ,
O my soul! fall down and kiss the feet of free grace, that
moved so freely towards so vile a creature! the dignities and
honours of the Kings and Nobles of the earth, are nothing
to mine; 'twas truly confessed by one of them, that it is a
greater honour to be a member of Christ, than the head of
an Empire. Do I say, a greater honour than is put upon the
Kings of the Earth? I might have said, it's a greater honour
than is put upon the Angels of heaven? for to which of them
said Christ at any time, thou art bone of my bone, and flesh
of my flesh? <hi>Behold! what manner of love is this!</hi> 1 Ioh. 3. 1.</p>
                  <p>Look again upon the ingraffed cyences, O my soul! and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
thou shalt find, that when once they have taken hold of the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:42861:112"/>
stock, they live as long as there is any sap in the root; and
because he liveth, I shall live also, for my life is hid with
Christ in God, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 3. The graff is preserved in the stock,
and my soul is even so, <hi>preserved in Christ Iesus,</hi> Iude 1.</p>
                  <p>Am I joyned to the Lord as mystical part, or branch of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> him; how dear art thou then, O my soul, to the God and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of my Lord Iesus Christ? What! a branch of his dear
Son! What can God with-hold from one so ingrafted?
<hi>Eph. 1. 6. All is yours</hi> (saith my God) <hi>for ye are Christs, and
Christ is Gods, 1 Cor.</hi> 3. 23.</p>
                  <p>Once more, draw matter of instruction, as well as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> from this sweet observation. Seeing God hath put all
this honour upon thee, by this most intimate union with his
Christ, look to it (my soul) that thou live and walk as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a soul, thus one with the Lord; be thou tender over
his glory doth not that which strikes at the root, strike at the
very life of the graff? and shall not that which strikes at the
very glory of Christ, tenderly touch and affect thee? yea, be
thou tenderly affected with all the reproaches that fall upon
him from abroad, but especially with those which redound
to him from thine own unfruitfulness. O, disgrace not the
root that bears thee; let it never be said, that any evil fruit
shall be found upon a branch that lives and is fed by such a
root.</p>

                  <p>But these laden branches are soon eased of their burden,
for as soon as they are ripe, the Husbandman ascends the tree,
and shaking the limbs with all his might, causes a fruitful
shower to fall like hailstones upon the ground below, which
being gather'd to a heap, are carried to the pound, broken
all to pieces in the trough; and squeez'd to a dry lump in the

                  <p>THis small remains of fruit, which are either left upon
the tree, or gather'd in for an hoard, do well resemble
that small number of Gods elect in the world, which free
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:42861:113"/>
grace hath reserved out of the general ruine of mankind.
Four things are excellently shadowed forth to us by this si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude.</p>
                  <p>You see in a fruitful Autumn, the trees even opprest and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
overladen with the weight of their own fruits before the
shaking time come, and then they are eased of their burden.
Thus the whole creation groans under the weight of their
sins who inhabit it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 22. the creatures are in bondage,
and by an elegant <hi>Prosopopeia,</hi> are said, both to groan and
wait for deliverance. The original sin of man brought an
original curse, which burdens the creature, <hi>Gen. 3. 17. Cursed
is the ground for thy sake;</hi> and the actual sin of man brings
actual curses upon the creature, <hi>Psal.</hi> 107. 34. Thus the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of the world load and burden it, as the limbs of a
tree are burdened, and sometimes broken with the weight of
their own fruit.</p>
                  <p>You may observe it in your Orchards every year, what
abundance of fruits daily fall, either by storms; or of their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
own accord; but when the shaking time comes, then the
ground is covered all over with fruit. Thus it is with the
world, that mystical tree, with respect to men, that inhabit
it; there is not a year, day or hour, in which some drop not,
as it were, of their own accord by a natural death; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
wars and Epidemical plagues blow down thousands to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
into their graves, these are as high winds in a fruitful
Orchard, but when the shaking time, the Autumn of the
world comes; then all its inhabitants shall be shaken down
together, either by death, or a translation equivolent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
                  <p>When fruits are shaken down from their trees; then the
Husbandman separates them; the far greatest part for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
pound, and some few he reserves for an hoard, which are
brought to his table, and eaten with pleasure. This excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
shadows forth that great separation, which Christ will
make in the end of the world; when some shall be cast into
the wine-press of the <hi>Almighties</hi> wrath, and others preserved
for glory.</p>
                  <p>Those fruits which are preserved on the tree, or in the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:42861:114"/>
hoard, are comparatively but an handful to those that are
broken in the pound. Alas! 'tis scarce one of a thousand,
and such a small remnant of Elected souls hath God reserved
for glory.</p>
                  <p>I look upon the World as a great Tree, consisting of four
large limbs or branches; this branch or division of it on
which we grow, hath doubtless a greater number of Gods
elect upon it, than the other three; and yet when I look with
a serious and considering eye upon this fruitful <hi>European</hi>
branch, and see how much rotten and withered fruit there
grows upon it, it makes me say as <hi>Chrysostom</hi> did of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
<hi>Antioch,</hi> Ah, how small a remnant hath <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>
among these vast numbers! <hi>Many</hi> indeed <hi>are called,</hi> but, ah,
<hi>how few are chosen!</hi> Mat. 20. 16. Alas! they are but as
the gleanings when the vintage is done; here and there one
upon its outmost branches. To allude to that, <hi>Isa.</hi> 17. 6.
it was a sad Observation which that searching Scholar (Mr.
<hi>Brierwood</hi>) long since made upon the world, that dividing it
into thirty equal parts, he found no less than nineteen of
them wholly overspread with Idolatry and Heathenish dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness!
and of the eleven remaining parts, no less than six are
<hi>Mahumetans;</hi> so that there remain but five of thirty, which
profess the Christian Religion at large; and the far greater
part of these remaining five, are invellop'd and drowned in
Popish darkness; so that you see the reformed <hi>Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
is confined to a small spot of ground indeed. Now, if
from these we substract all the grosly ignorant, openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane,
meerly civil, and secretly hypocritical; judge then in
your selves, how small a scantling of the world falls to
Christs share!</p>
                  <p>Well might Christ say, <hi>Mat. 7. 14. Narrow is the way, and
strait is the gate, that leadeth unto life, and few there be that
find it.</hi> And again, <hi>Luke 12. 32. Fear not, little, little flock.</hi> The
large piece goes to the devil, a little remnant is Christs,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 27. Saints in Scripture are called <hi>jewels,</hi> Mal. 3. 17.
Precious pearls and diamonds, which the Latines call <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones.
Quia nulli duo simul reperiuntur</hi> (saith <hi>Pliny</hi>) because
nature gives them not by pairs, but one by one. How many
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:42861:114"/>
pebbles to one pearl? Sutable to this notion, is that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
of the Prophet, <hi>Mich. 7. 1, 2. W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

when they have gathered the Summer fruits, as the grape glean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the vintage, there is no cluster to eat; my soul desired the
first ripe fruits; the good man is perished out of the earth, and
there is none, (i. e.</hi> none comparatively) <hi>upright among men.</hi>
The <hi>Prophet</hi> alludes to a poor hungry man, that after the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
time is past, comes into an Orchard, desiring some
choice fruits to eat, but alas! he finds none; there is no clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster;
possibly here and there a single Saint, like a single apple,
here and there one after the shaking time. True Saints are
the worlds rarities.</p>

                  <p>AFter many years patience, in the use of all means to
recover a fruit Tree, if the Husbandman see it be
quite dead, and that there can be no more expectation of any
fruit from it, he brings his ax and hews it down by the root;
and from the Orchard its carried to the fire, it being then
fit for nothing else; he reckons it imprudent to let such a
useless tree abide in good ground, where another might be
planted in its room, that will better pay for the ground it
stands in. I my self once saw a large Orchard of fair, but fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
trees, all rooted up, rived abroad, and ricked up for the
fire.</p>

                  <p>THus deals the Lord by useless and barren Professors
who do but cumber his ground, <hi>Mat. 3. 10. And now
also, the ax is laid to the root of the trees; therefore every tree that
brings not forth good fruit, is hewn down and cast into the fire.</hi>
And <hi>Luke 13. 7. Then said the dresser of the vineyard, Behold,
this three years I came seeking fruit on this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ig-tree, and find none,
cut it down, why cumbereth it the ground?</hi> These three years,
alluding to the time of his Ministery, he being at that time
entring upon his last half year, as one observes, by harmonizing
the Evangelists; so long he had waited for the fruit of his
Ministery, among those dead-hearted <hi>Iews:</hi> now his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

they the ground? I will plant others, (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Gentiles</hi>) in
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:42861:116"/>
their room. This hewing down of the barren tree doth in a
lively manner shadow forth Gods judicial proceedings against
formal and empty Professors under the Gospel; and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance
clearly holds in these following particulars.</p>
                  <p>The tree that is to be hewen down for the fire, stands in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
the Orchard among other flourishing trees, where it hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
the benefit of a good soyl, a strong fence and much
culture; but being barren, these priviledges secure it not
from the fire. It is not our standing in the visible church,
by a powerless profession among real Saints, with whom we
have been associated, and enjoyed the rich and excellent wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terings
of Ordinances, that can secure us from the wrath of
God, <hi>Mat. 3. 8. 9. Bring forth fruits meet for repentance, and
think not to say within your selves, we have</hi> Abraham <hi>to our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
Neither <hi>Abraham,</hi> nor <hi>Abrahams</hi> God, will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
such degenerate children; if <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith be not

runs in your <hi>veins.</hi> 'Twill be a poor plea for <hi>Iudas,</hi> when he

                  <p>The Husbandman doth not presently cut down the tree <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
because it puts not forth as soon as other trees do, but waits
as long as there is any hope, and then cuts it down. Thus doth
God wait upon barren dead-hearted persons, from Sabbath
to Sabbath, and from year to year; for the Lord is long-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
to us-ward, and not willing that any should peri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of God waited in the dayes of <hi>Noah</hi> upon those dry
trees, who are now smoaking and flaming in hell, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 20.
He waits long on sinners, but keeps exact accounts of every
year and day of his patience, <hi>Luke 13. 7 These three years.</hi>
And <hi>Ier.</hi> 25. 3. These 23 years.</p>

blow, and falls before it. No more can the stoutest sinner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
the fatal stroke of death, by which the Lord hews him
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:42861:117"/>
down, <hi>Eccles. 8. 8. There is no man that hath power over the
Spirit, to retain the Spirit; neither hath he power in the day of
death, and there is no discharge in that war.</hi> When the pale
horse comes, away you must into the land of darkness;
Though thou cry with <hi>Adrian,</hi> O my poor soul, whither art
thou going! die thou must, thou barren Professor; though
it were better for thee to do any thing else than to die. What
a dreadful screech will thy conscience give, when it sees
the ax at thy root! and say to thee, as it is, <hi>Ezek. 7. 6. An

Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> and Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> when he
perceived whereto he must) wherefore must I die? If the
whole Realm would save my life, I am able either by policy
to get it, or by riches to buy it. Fye (quoth he) will not
death be hired? will riches do nothing? No, neither riches
nor policy can then avail.</p>

that way it will fall, when it is cut down; and as it falls so
it lies, whether to the South or North, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 11. 3. So it
fares with these mystical trees; I mean fruitless Professors.
Had their hearts and affections inclined and bended heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
whilst they lived, that way no doubt they had fallen at
their death; but as their hearts inclined to sin, and ever
bended to the world; so when God gives the fatal stroke;
they must fall hell-ward, and wrath-ward; and how dreadful
will such a fall be?</p>

out of the world by death, he shall never be associated
with the Saints any more. He may then say, farewell all ye

                  <head>OBSERVATION.</head>
                  <p>MAny Husbandmen are excessively careful about their
cattel, rising themselves early, or causing their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to rise betimes to provender and dress them. Much
time is spent in some Countreys, in trimming and adorning
their Horses with curious trappings and plumes of feathers;
and if at any time a beast be sick, what care is taken to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
and heal them? you will be sure they shall want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that is necessary for them; yea, many will chuse ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to want themselves, than suffer their Horses so to do;
and take a great deal of comfort to see them thrive and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper
under their hands.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>APPLICATION.</head>
                  <p>VVHat one said of bloudy <hi>Herod,</hi> who slew so many
children at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> That it were better to be his
swine, than his Son, may be truly enough applyed to some
Parents and Masters, who take less care for the saving the
souls of their children and servants, than they do for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of those beasts which daily feed at their stalls and cribs.
Many there be who do in reference to their souls, as <hi>Iacob</hi>
did, with respect to the preservation of their bodies, when he
put all the herds of cattel before, and his Wives and little
ones behind, as he went to meet his brother <hi>Esau.</hi> 'Tis a
weighty saying of a grave Author; <hi>It's vile ingratitude to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
when cattel multiply,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ienk.</hi> on <hi>Iude</hi> par. 2. p. 170.</note> 
                     <hi>and repine when children increase;
its Heathenish distrustfulness, to fear, that he who provides for your
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:42861:120"/>
beasts, will not provide for your children; and it's no less than
unnatural cruelty to be careful of the bodies of beasts, &amp; careless
of the souls of children.</hi> Let us but a little compare your care
and diligence in both respects, and see in a few particulars,
whether you do indeed value your own, or your children and
servants souls, as you do the life and health of a beast.</p>
                  <p>Your care for your very Horses is expressed early, whilst <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
they are but Colts, and not come to do you any service; you
are willing to be at pains and cost, to have them broken and
brought to their way. This is more than ever many of them
did for their children; they can see them wild and profane,
naturally taking a stroke or way of wickedness, but yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
were at any pains or cost to break them; these must be
fondel'd and cockered up in the natural way of their own
corruption and wickedness, and not a rod or reproof used
to break them of it.</p>
                  <p>'Tis observed of the <hi>Persians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Clárks</hi> Mir. p. 506.</note> that they put out their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to School as soon as they could speak, and would not see
them in seven years after, lest their indulgence should do
them hurt.</p>
                  <p>You keep your constant set times, morning and evening,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
to feed, water and dress your cattel, and will by no means
neglect it once; but how many times have you neglected
morning and evening duties in your families? yea, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
be there, whose very tables, in respect of any worship
God hath there, do very little differ from the very cribs and
mangers at which their horses feed? As soon as you are up
in a morning, you are with your beasts before you have been
with your God; how little do such differ from beasts? and
happy were it, if they were no more accountable to God
than their beasts are?</p>
                  <p>The end of your care, cost and pains about your cattel is,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
that they may be strong for labour, and the more serviceable
to you; thus you comply with the end of their beings. But
how rare a thing is it, to find these men as careful to fit their
posterity to be useful and serviceable to God in their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
which is the end of their beings? If you can make
them rich, and provide good matches for them, you reckon
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:42861:121"/>
that you have fully discharged the duty of parents; if they
will learn to hold the Plow, that you are willing to teach
them: But when did you spend an hour to teach them the
way of salvation?</p>
                  <p>Now to convince such careless Parents of the heinousness
of their sin, let these four Queries be solemnly considered.</p>
                  <p>Whether this be a sufficient discharge of that great duty
which God hath laid upon Christian Parents,<note place="margin">Qu. 1.</note> in reference to
their families? That God hath charged them with the souls
of their families is undeniable, <hi>Deut. 6. 6, 7. Eph.</hi> 6. 4. If God
had not cloathed you with his authority, to command them
in the way of the Lord; he would never have charged them
so strictly to yield you obedience as he hath done, <hi>Eph. 6. 1.
Col.</hi> 3. 20. Well, a great trust is reposed in you, look to your
duty, for without dispute you shall answer for it.</p>
                  <p>Whether it be likely,<note place="margin">Qu. 2.</note> if the time of youth (which is the
moulding age) be neglected, they will be wrought upon to
any good afterwards? Husbandmen, let me put a sensible
case to you; Do yo not see in your very horses, that whilst
they are young, you can bring them to any way; but if once
they have got a false stroke, and by long custom it be grown
nutural to them, then there is no breaking them of it: yea,
you see it, in your very Orchards, you may bring a tender
twig to grow in what form you please; but when its grown
to a sturdy limb, there is no bending it afterwards to any
other form than what it naturally took. Thus it is with
children, <hi>Prov. 22. 6. Train up a child in the way he should go,
and when he is old he will not depart from it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whether,<note place="margin">Qu. 3.</note> if you neglect to instruct them in the way of the
Lord, <hi>Satan,</hi> and their own natural corruptions, will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
them in the way to hell? Consider this ye careless Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents;
if you will not teach your children, the Devill will
teach them; if you shew them not how to pray; he will shew
them how to curse and swear, and take the name of the Lord
in vain; if you grudge time a pains about their souls, the
Devil doth not. Oh, 'tis a sad consideration, that so many
children should be put to School to the devil!</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Qu. 4.</note> What comfort are you like to have from them when they
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:42861:121"/>
are old, if you bring them not up in the nurture and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
of the Lord when they are young? Many Parents
have lived to reap in their old age, the fruit of their own folly
and careless<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ess, in the loose and vain education of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
By <hi>Lieurgus</hi> his Law, no Parent was to be relieved by
his children in age, if he gave them not good education in
their youth; and it is a Law at this day among the <hi>Switzers,</hi>
that if any child be condemned to die for a capital offence,
the Parents of that child are to be his executioners; these
Laws were made to provoke Parents to look better to their
charge. Believe this as an undoubted truth; That that child
which becomes (through thy default) an instrument to
dishonour God, shall prove sooner or later, a son or daughter
of sorrow to thee.</p>

set in their own practise before me; many a time when I have
sinned against the Lord, have they stood over me with a rod
in their hands, and tears in their eyes, using all means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
me; but like an ungracious wretch I have slighted all
their counsels, grieved their hearts, and imbittered their lives

in one family with them, but shortly I shall be separated from

and to bless God that they can see any creature below them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
gives us a famous instance in the following story:
Two <hi>Cardinals</hi> (saith he) riding in a great deal of pomp to
the Council of <hi>Constance,</hi> by the way they heard a man in the
fields; weeping and wailing bitterly, they rode to him, and
asked what he ailed? perceiving his eye intently fixed upon
an ugly toad, he told them that his heart was melted with the
consideration of this mercy, that God had not made him such
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:42861:123"/>
a deformed and loathsom creature, though he were formed
out of the same clay with it: <hi>Hoc est quod amare fleo,</hi> said he,
This is that, that makes me weep bitterly. Whereupon one
of the <hi>Cardinals</hi> cryes out, Well said the Father, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
will rise and take heaven, when we with all our
learning shall be thrust into hell. That which melted the
heart of this poor man, should melt every heart when we
behold the misery to which these poor creatures are subject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
And this will appear a mercy of no slight consideration,
if we but draw a comparison betwixt our selves, and these
irrational creatures, in these three particulars.</p>
                  <p>Though they and we were made of the same mould and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
clay, yet how much better hath God dealt with us, even as
to the outward man? the structure of our bodies is much
more excellent. God made other creatures by a word of
command, but man by counsel; it was not be Thou, but let
us make man. We might have been nude stones without
fence, or beasts without reason, but we were made men. The
noble structure and symetry of our bodies invites our souls,
not only to thankfulness, but admiration. <hi>David</hi> speaking of
the curious frame of the body, saith, <hi>I am wonderfully made,
Psal.</hi> 139. 14. or as the vulgar reads it, painted as with a
needle; like some rich piece of needle-work curiously em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broydered
with nerves and veins. Was any part of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

                        </gap>us</hi> an
hundred years time to imagine a more commodious situation,
configuration, or composition of any one part of a humane
body; and (as one saith) of all the Angels in heaven had
studied to this day, they could not have cast the body of man
into a more curious mould.</p>
                  <p>How little ease or rest have they? they live not many <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
years, and those they do is in bondage and misery, groaning
under the effects of sin; but God hath provided better for
us, even as to our outward condition in the world; we have
the more rest, because they have so little. How many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hments
and comforts hath God provided for us, of which
they are uncapable? if we be weary with labour, we can take
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:42861:124"/>
our rest; but fresh or weary, they must stand to it, or sink
under it from day to day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> What a narrow capacity hath God given to beasts! what
a large capacity to man! Alas! they are only capable of a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
sensitive pleasure; as you shall see sometimes, how they
will frisk in a green pasture, this is all they be capable of,
and this death puts an end to; but how comprehensive are
our souls in their capacities? we are made in the image of
God; we can look beyond present things, and are capable of
the highest happiness, and that to all eternity; the soul of a
beast is but a material form, which wholly depending upon,
must needs dye with the body; but our souls are a divine
spark or blast; and when the body dyes, it dyes not with it,
but subsists even in its separated state.</p>

and unserviceable to my Creator and Benefactor, that hath
done me good all my dayes; those poor creatures that sweat
and groan under the loads that I lay upon them, never sinned
against God, nor transgressed the Laws of their Creation as
I have done; and yet God hath dealt better with me than
with them. Oh that the bounty of God, and his distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and melt my heart into thankfulness! O that I might consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
seriously what the higher and more excellent end of my
Creation is, and might more endeavour to answer and live
up to it! Or else (O my soul) it will be worse with thee
than with the beasts. 'Tis true, they are under bondage and

their pains, and ease them of all their heavy loads; but I
shall groan to all eternity, under a heavier burden than ever
they felt; they have no account to give but so have I. What
comfort is it that I have a larger capacity than a beast hath?
that God hath endowed me with reason, which is denied to
me? Alas! this will but augment my misery, and enlarge
me to take in a greater measure of anguish.</p>

                  <p>THe care and pains you take to recover your lost cattel,
carries a sweet and lively representation of the love of
<hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> in the recovery of lost sinners. <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>
came on purpose from heaven upon a like errand, to seek and
to save that which was lost, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 11. There are several
particulars in which this glorious design of Christ, in seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and saving lost man, and the care and pains of Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in recovering their lost cattel, do meet and touch, though
there be as many particulars also in which they differ; all
which I shall open under the following heads.</p>
                  <p>We sometimes find that cattel will break out of those very <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
fields where they have been bred, and where they want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
that is needful for them. Iust thus, lost man departed
from his God, brake out of that pleasant enclosure where he
was abundantly provided for, both as to soul and body; yet
then he brake over the hedge of the command, and went
astray, <hi>Eccles. 7. 29. Lo this only have I found, that God made
man upright, but he sought out to himself many inventions.</hi> He

put him into, but would be trying new conclusions to the

                  <p>Strayers are evermore sufferers for it; all they get by it,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
is to be pinned and pounded; and what did man get by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
from his God, but ruin and misery to soul and body?
Will you have an abreviate of his sufferings and losses? (the
full account none can give you) why, by straying from his
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:42861:126"/>
God, he lost the rectitude and holiness of his nature; (like
a true strayer) he is all dirty and miry, overspread and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smeared
both in soul and body, with the odious filthiness of
sin; he lost the liberty and freedom of his will to good; a
precious jewel of inestimable value: This is a real misery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd
by the fall, though some have so far lost their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings
and humility, as not to own it; he hath lost his
God, his soul, his happiness, and his very bowels of compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
towards himself in this miserable state.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> When your cattel are strayed, yea, though it be but one of
the Flock or Herd, you leave all the rest, and go after that
which is lost: So did <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> who in the fore-cited
place, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 12. compares himself to such a Shepherd;
he left heaven it self, and all the blessed <hi>Angels</hi> there, to
come into this world to seek lost man. O the precious esteem,
and dear love that Christ had to poor man! How did his
bowels yearn towards us in our lost state! How did he pity
us in our misery! As if he had said, Poor creatures, they
have lost themselves, and are become a prey to the devil, in a
perishing state; I will seek after them, and save them. The
Son of man is come to seek and to save.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> You are glad when you have found your strayers; much
more is Christ, when he hath found a lost soul. O 'tis a great
satisfaction to him to see the fruit of the travel of his soul;
Isa. 53. <hi>Yea, there is more joy in heaven over one sinner that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth,

clog them, to prevent their wandring again, and stop
up the gaps with thorns; and so doth God oftentimes by such
souls as are recovered and brought home to Christ; he hangs
a clog of affliction to prevent their departure from God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7.</p>
                  <p>But then there are five particulars in which Christ seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
lost souls, and your seeking lost cattel differ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Your cattel sometimes find the way home themselves, and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:42861:126"/>
return to you of their own accord; but lost man never did,
nor can do so; he was his own destroyer, but can never be
his own Saviour; it was impossible for him to have lost his
God, but having once lost him, can never find him again of
himself. Alas! his heart is bent to backsliding, he hath no
will to return. Hear how Christ complains, <hi>Ioh. 5. 40. Ye
will not come unto me.</hi> Mans recovery begins in God, not in
himself.</p>
                  <p>Your servants can find, and bring back your lost cattel as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
well as you; but so cannot Christs servants. Ministers may
<hi>discover,</hi> but cannot <hi>recover</hi> them; they daily <hi>see,</hi> but cannot
<hi>save</hi> them; <hi>lament</hi> them they can, but <hi>help</hi> them they cannot;
<hi>intreat</hi> and beg them to return they can and do, but <hi>prevail</hi>
with them they cannot. <hi>Melancthon</hi> thought when he began
to preach, to perswade all; but old <hi>Adam</hi> was too hard for
young <hi>Melancthon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You seek all the cattel that are strayed from you, especially <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
the best; but <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> only seeks poor lost man. There
were other creatures, and such as by nature were more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
that lost their God and themselves; I mean, the
<hi>Apostate Angels;</hi> but he came not to seek them: Herein his
singular love to man appears.</p>
                  <p>When you have recovered and brought home your lost <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
cattel, you may lose them the second time, and never reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them again; but so cannot Christ. Man once recovered,
is for ever secured by him. <hi>All that thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

kept, and not one of them is lost, but the son of perdition;</hi> and
he was never savingly found, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 12.</p>
                  <p>Though you prize your cattel, yet you will not venture <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
your life for the recovery of them; rather let them go than
regain them with such an hazard; but <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> not only
ventured, but actually laid down his life to recover, and
save lost man: He redeemed them at the price of his own
blood; he is that good Shepherd that laid down his life for
the Sheep. O the surpassing love of Christ to lost souls!</p>

The same effect hath the prosperity of the wicked, it makes
them wanton; their life is but a diversion from one pleasure

like a flock, and their children dance; they take the timbrel, and
harp, and rejoyce at the sound of the Organ; they spend their

                  <p>PRovident and careful Husbandmen do not only labour to
supply their own necessities while living, but to lay up
something for their posterity when they are gone; they do
not only leave to their children what their progenitors left
them, but they desire to leave it improved and bettered.
None but bad husbands and spend-thirfts are of the mind
with that <hi>Heathen Emperor Tiberius,</hi> who having put all into
such confusions in the <hi>Empire,</hi> that it might be thought the
world would end with him; yet pleased himself with this
apprehension, that he should be out of the reach of it; and
would often say, When I am dead, let heaven and earth min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle;
if the world will but hold my time, let it break when I
am gone: But provident men look beyond their own time,
and do very much concern themselves in the good or evil of
their posterity.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>APPLICATION.</head>
                  <p>VVHat careful Husbands do, with respect to the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
they make for their children, that all prudent
Christians are bound to do, with respect to the truths com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to them, and do them, to be transmitted to succeeding
Saints.</p>
                  <p>In the first age of the world, even till the Law was given,
faithful men were instead of books and records; they did
by oral tradition convey the truths of God to posterity; but
since the sacred truth hath been consigned the writing, no such
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:42861:131"/>
tion (except full consentient with that written word) is to
be received as authentick; but the truths therein delivered
to the Saints, are by verbal declarations, open confessions,
and constant sufferings, to be preserved and delivered from
age to age. This was the constant care of the whole cloud of
witnesses, both ancient and modern, who have kept the
word of Gods patience, and would not accept their own lives,
liberties or estates; no, nor the whole world in exchange,
for that invaluable treasure of truth; they have carefully pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
<hi>Solomons</hi> counsel, <hi>Prov. 23. 23. Buy the truth, but sell it
not;</hi> they would not alienate that fair inheritance, for all the
inheritances on earth. Upon the same reasons, that you are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to part with, or embezel your estates, Christians also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to part with the truths of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> You will not waste or alienate your inheritance, because
it's precious and of great value in your eyes; but much more
precious, are Gods truths to his people. <hi>Luther</hi> professed, he
would not take the whole world for one leaf of his Bible.
Though some profane persons may say with <hi>Pilate,</hi> What is
truth? yet know, that any one truth of the Gospel, is more
worth than all the inheritances upon earth; they are the
great things of Gods Law, and he that sells them for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
things in this world, makes a soul-undoing bargain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> You will not waste or part with your inheritance, because
you know your posterity will be much wronged by it. They
that baffle or drink away an estate, drink the tears of their sad
widows, and the very blood of their impoverished children.
The people of God do also consider, how much the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to come are concern'd in the conservation of the truths
of God for them; it cuts them to the heart, but to think,
that their children should be brought up to worship dumb
idols, and fall down before a wooden or a breaden God. The
very birds and beasts will expose their own bodies to appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
danger of death, to preserve their young. Religion doth
much more intender the heart and bowels, than nature
doth.</p>

a Christian accounts it the highest reproach in the world, to
be a traitor to, or an <hi>Apostate</hi> from the truths of God, When
the primitive Saints were strictly required to deliver up their
Bibles, those that did so, were justly branded and husht out
of their company, under the odiou title of <hi>Traditores,</hi> or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverers.</p>

know its hard recovering an estate again, when once you
have lost it. Christians do also know, how difficult it will be
for the people of God in times to come, to recover the light
of the Gospel again, if once it be exinguished. There is no
truth of God recovered out of <hi>Antichrists</hi> hands, without
great wrestlings, and much blood. The Church may call
every point of reformed doctrine and discipline so recovered,

                  <p>To conclude, rather than you will part with your estates,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
you will chuse to suffer many wants and hardships all your
lives; you will fare hard, and go bare, to preserve what you
have for your posterity: But the people of God have put
themselves upon far greater hardships than these, to preserve
truth; they have chosen to suffer reproaches, poverty, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
death, and the most cruel torments, rather than the loss
of Gods truth. All the <hi>Martyrologies</hi> will inform you, what
their sufferings have been, to keep the word of Gods pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
they have boldly told their enemies, that they might
pluck their hearts out of their bodies, but should never pluck
the truth out of their hearts.</p>

                  <p>VVE generally find, men are not more careful in trying
gold, or in keeping it, than they are in examining
their Deeds, and preserving them; these are virtually their
whole estate, and therefore it concerns them to be careful of
them: If they suspect a flaw in their Lease or Deed, they
repair to the ablest Counsell, submit it to his judgment, make
the worst of their cause, and query about all the supposeable
dangers with him; if he tell them their case is suspicious and
hazardous, how much are they perplexed and troubled? they
can neither eat, drink, or sleep in peace, till they have a good
settlement; and willing they are to be at much cost and pains
to obtain it.</p>

                  <p>THese cares and fears, with which you are perplexed in
such cases, may give you a little gimpse of those trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles

about their eternal condition, which perhaps you have been

ever you were ingaged by a cunning and powerful adversary
in a Law-suit for your estate, may give you a little glimpse
of spiritual troubles; and indeed it is no more but a glimpse
of it: For as the loss of a earthly (though fair) inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
is but a trifle to the loss of God, and the soul to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
so you cannot but imagine, that the cares, fears, and
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:42861:133"/>
solicitudes of souls about these things, are much, very much
beyond yours. Let us compare the cases, and see how they
answer to each other.</p>
                  <p>You have evidences for your estates, and by them you hold <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
what you have in the world. They also have evidences for
their estate in Christ, and glory to come; they hold all <hi>in
capite,</hi> by vertue of their intermarriage with Iesus Christ;
they come to be enstated in that glorious inheritance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>ained
in the Covenant of grace. You have their tenure in
that Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 22, 23. All is yours, for ye are
Christs, and Christ is Gods. Faith unites them to him; and
after they believe, they are sealed by the Spirit of promise,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 13. They can lay claim to no promise upon any other
ground; this is their title to all that they own as theirs.</p>
                  <p>It often falls out, that after the fealing and executing of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
your Deeds or Leases, an adversary finds some dubious clause
in them, and thereupon commences a Suit of Law with you.
Thus it frequently falls out with the people of God, who
after their believing and sealing time, have doubts and scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
raised in them about their title. Nothing is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
than for the devil and their own unbelief to start con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies,
and raise strong obj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ctions against their interest
in Christ, and the Covenant of promises. There are cunning
and potent adversaries, and do maintain long debates with
the gracious soul, and reason so cunningly and sophistically
with it, that it can by no means extricate and satisfie it self;
alwayes alledging, that their title is worth nothing, which
they poor souls are but to apt too suspect.</p>
                  <p>All the while that a Suit in Law is depending about your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
title, you have but little comfort or benefit from your estate;
you cannot look upon it as your own, nor lay out moneys in
building or dressing, for fear you should lose all at last. Iust
thus stands the case with doubting Christians, they have little
comfort from the most comfortable promises, little benefit
from the sweetest duties and Ordinances; they put of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

willing to get the ablest counsel you can to advise you: So
are poor doubting Christians, they carry their Cases from
Christian to Christian, and from Minister to Minister, with
such requests as these; Pray tell me, what do you think of
my condition? deal plainly and faithfully with me; these
be my grounds of doubting, and these my grounds of hope.
O hide nothing from me! And if they all agree that their
case if good, yet they cannot be satisfied till God say so too,
and confirm the word of his servants; and therefore they
carry the case often before him, in such words as those, <hi>Psal.

of all at last? So it is with gracious souls, their eyes are held
waking in the night, by reason of the troubles of their hearts,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 77. 4. Such fears as these are frequently returning upon
their hearts. What if I should be found a self-deceiver at
last? What if I do but hug a phantasm instead of Christ?
how can this, or that, consist with grace? Their meat and
drink doth them little good; their bodies are often macerated,
by the troubles of their souls.</p>

have met with troubles and clamours about my estate!
but as for spiritual troubles, and those soul-perplexing cases
that christians speak of, I understand but little of them. I
never called my everlasting state in question, nor brake an
hours sleep upon any such account. Ah, my supine and
careless soul I little hast thou regarded how matters stand, in
reference to eternity! I have strongly conceited, but never
throughly examined, the validity of my title to Christ and
his promises; nor am I able to tell, if my own conscience
should demand, whereupon my claim is grounded!</p>
                  <p>O my soul! why art thou so unwilling to examine how
matters stand betwixt God and thee? art thou afraid to look
into thy condition? least by <hi>finding</hi> thine <hi>hypocrisie,</hi> thou
shouldest <hi>lose</hi> thy <hi>peace;</hi> or rather thy security. To what
purpose will it be to shut thine eyes against the light of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,
unless thou couldst also find out a way to prevent
thy <hi>condemnation?</hi> Thou seest other souls, how attentively
they wait under the word, for any thing that may speak to
their conditions. Doubtless thou hast heard, how frequently
and seriously they have stated their conditions, and opened
their cases to the Ministers of Christ. But thou, O my soul!
hast no such cases to put, no doubts to be resolved; thou wilt
leave all to the decision of the great day, and not trouble thy
self about it now. Well, God will decide it, but little to thy

my doubts and scruples to thine Ordinances, waiting
for satisfaction to be spoken there. I have carried them to
those I have judged skillfull and faithful, begging their resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

renewed. O my God do thou decide my case! tell me how
the state stands betwixt thee and me; my dayes consume in
trouble, I can neither do, or enjoy any good, whilst things
are thus with me; all my earthly enjoyments are dry and
uncomfortable things; yea, which is much worse, all my
duties and thine Ordinances prove so too, by reason of the
troubles of my heart! I am no ornament to my profession,
nay, I am a discouragement and stumbling-block to others!
I will hearken and hear what God the Lord will speak, O
that it might be peace! if thou do not speak it none can;
and when thou doest, keep thy servant from returning again
to solly, lest I make fresh work for an accusing conscience, and
give new matter to the adversary of my soul!</p>

questioning but she would please the pallat as well as the
ear; but when the Nightingale was brought him, and he saw
what a poor little creature it was, truly said he, thou art <hi>vox

home, observe him in his private conversation and retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and then you will judg <hi>Plutarchs</hi> note as applicable

charm most sweetly, and set her spirit all on work, when
she perceives she hath ingaged attention; so doth the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite,
who lives and feeds upon the applause and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation

                  <p>HEaring a whole quire of Birds chirping and twinking
together, it ingaged my curiosity a little to enquire
into the occasion of that convocation, which mine eye
quickly inform'd me of; for I perceived a dead Hawk in the

them to sing his knell, who like a <hi>Cannibal</hi> was wont to feed
upon their living bodies; tearing them limb from limb, and
scaring them with his frightful appearance. This Bird which
living was so formidable, being dead the poorest Wren or
Titmouse fears not to chirp or hop over. This brings to my
thoughts the base and ignoble ends of the greatest Tyrants
and greedy ingroffers of the world, of whom (whilst living)
men were more afraid than birds of a Hawk, but dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came

                  <p>VVHen I saw how hardly the poor Bird was put to it to
save her self from her enemy, who hover'd just over
the bush in which she was fluttering and squeeking, I could
not but hasten to relieve her, (pity and succour being a due
debt to the distressed) which when I had done, the bird would
not depart from the bush, though her enemy were gone; this
act of kindness was abundantly repaid by this Meditation,
with which I returned to my walk. My soul, like this Bird,
was once distressed, pursued, yea, seized by Satan, who had
certainly made a prey of it, had not Iesus Christ been a sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
to it in that hour of danger. How ready did I find
him to receive my poor soul into his protection? then did he
make good that sweet promise to my experience, Those that
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:42861:139"/>
come unto me, I will in no wise cast out. It call'd to mind
that pretty and pertinent story of the Philosopher, who
walking in the fields a Bird pursued by a Hawk, flew into
his bosom; her took her out, and said, <hi>Poor bird, I will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wrong thee, nor expose thee to thine enemy, since thou camest
unto me for refuge.</hi> So tender, and more than so, is the Lord
Iesus to distressed souls, that come unto him. Blessed Iesus!
how should I love and praise thee? glorifie and admire thee,
for that great salvation thou hast wrought for me. If this
Bird had faln into the claws of her enemy, she had been
torn to pieces indeed, and devoured, but then a few minutes
had dispatcht her, and ended all her pain and misery; but had
my soul fallen into the hand of Satan, there had been no end
of its misery.</p>
                  <p>Would not this scared Bird be flusht out of the Bush that
secured her, though I had chased away her enemy? and wilt
thou (my soul) ever be enticed or scared from Christ thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge?
O let this for ever ingage thee to keep close to Christ,
and make me say with <hi>Ezra;</hi> and now, O Lord! since thou

thy commandments?</p>

and the plain peasants; how spruce and richly
adorned with shining and various coloured feathers, (like
scarlet, richly laid with gold and silver lace) are those? how
plainly clad, in a home-spun countrey russet are these?
Fine feathers (saith our proverb) make proud Birds; and
yet the feathers of the Sparrow, are as useful and beneficial,

by which I see, that the greatest worth doth not alwayes lye

and homely garments as useful and beneficial topoor despised
Christians, as the ruffling and shining garments of wanton
Gallants are to them, and when God shall strip men out of

                  <p>OBserving the Mole working industriously beneath, and
the Bird watching so intently above; I made a stand to
observe the issue. When in a little time the bird descends and
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:42861:140"/>
seizes upon a worm, which I perceived was crawling apace
from the enemy below that hunted her, but fell to the share
of another which from above waited for her. My thoughts
presently suggested these Meditations from that occasion;
me thought this poor worm seem'd to be the Emblem of my
poor soul, which is more endangered by its own lusts of pride
and covetousness, than this worm was by the Mole and
Bird; my pride, like the aspiring Bird watches for it above;
my covetousness, like this subterranean Mole, digging for it
beneath. Poor soul! what a sad Dilemma art thou brought
to? If thou go down into the caverns of the earth, there
thou art a prey to thy covetousness that hunts thee; and if
thou aspire, or but creep upward, there thy pride waits to
ensnare thee. Distressed soul! whither wilt thou go? ascend
thou mayest, not by a vain elation, but by a heavenly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
beside which, there is no way for thy preservation;
the way of life is above to the wise, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Again, I could not but observe the accidental benefit this
poor harmless Bird obtained by the labour of the Mole, who
hunting intentionally for her self, unburroughed and ferrited
out this worm for the Bird, who possibly was hungry enough,
and could not have been relieved for this time, but by the
Mole, the fruit of whose labours she now fed upon. Even
thus the Lord oft-times makes good his word to his people:
<hi>The wealth of the wicked is laid up for the just.</hi> And again, <hi>The
earth shall help the woman.</hi> This was fully exemplified in
<hi>David,</hi> to whom <hi>Nabal</hi> that churlish muck-worm speaks all
in possessives. Shall I take my bread &amp;c. and give it to one
I know not whom; and yet <hi>David</hi> reaps the fruit of all the
pains and toyl of <hi>Nabal</hi> at last. Let it never incourage me to
idleness, that God sometimes gives his people the fruit of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
sweat; but if povidence reduce me to necessity, and
disable me from helping my self, I doubt not then but it will
provide instruments to do it. The Bird was an hungry and

again, to prevent a greater mischief. 'Tis storied of <hi>Basil,</hi>
that for many years he was sorely afflicted with an inveterate

of it, al last God removed it; but instead thereof he was

adorned the branches on which they grew, like so many
rich jewels, or glittering pendents; and further observing,
how these persumed blossoms dropt off, being bitten with the
frost and discoloured all the ground, as if a shower of snow
had fallen; I said, within my self, these sweet and early
Lord, in the days of my first acquaintance with him. Oh!
what fervent love? panting desires, and heavenly delights
beautified my soul in those dayes! the odoriferous scent of
the sweetest blossoms, the morning breath of the most fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant

my first affection were inriched. O! happy time, thrice

                  <p>I Have often observed, that when the blossoms of a tree,
set and knit, though the flourish thereof be gone, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

yet then the fruit is much better secured from the danger of

in which so many trees miscarry and lose their fruit. And

creature-enjoyments in the world; which being moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and cautiously used and enjoyed, may for a long time yield
sweetness to the Possessor of them; but if once the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
seize too greedily upon them, and squeeze them too hard,
they quickly wither in our hands, and we lose the comfort
of them; and that either through the souls surfeiting upon
them, of the Lord's righteous and just removal of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

the beauty of holiness upon the inner man; this abides fresh

(the seat of natural beauty) is become an abhorrent and
loathsome spectacle. Holiness enammels and sprinkles over
the face of the soul with a beauty upon which Christ himself
is enammour'd, even imperfect holiness on earth is a Rose that
breaths sweetly in the bud; in heaven it will be full blown,
and abide in its prime to all eternity.</p>

                  <p>HOw much care is necessary to preserve the life of some
Flowers? They must be boxed up in the Winter,
others must be covered with glasses in their springing up, the
finest and richest mould must be sifted about the roots, and
assiduously watered, and all this little enough, and sometimes
too little to preserve them, whilst other common and worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
flowers grow without any help of ours; yea, we have no
less to do, to rid our gardens of them, than we have to make
the former gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thus stands the case with our hearts, in reference to the
motions of grace and sin. Holy thoughts of God must be
assiduously watered by prayer, earthed up by Meditation,
and defended by watchfulness; and yet all this is sometimes
too little to preserve them alive in our souls. Alas! the heart
is a soyl that agrees not with them, they are tender things,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:42861:151"/>
and a small matter will nip and kill them. To this purpose
is the complaint of the divine Poet.</p>

                  <p>But vain thoughts, and unholy suggestions, these spread
themselves, and root deep in the heart, they naturally agree
with the soyl; so that it is almost impossible at any time to
be rid of them. 'Tis hard to forget what is our sin to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>

frosts, and yet without frosts they would neither live

without water they cannot subsist; they are refreshed and
cheered by the heat of the Sun, and yet that heat sometimes
kills and scorches them up. Thus lives my soul, troubles
and afflictions seem to kill all its comforts; and yet without
