            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Sir, I do not much wonder that you are not well informed concerning that Ceremony; but I wonder rather, that one of your Perſwaſion ſhould deſire (as you ſeem) to be informed in any thing that likes not his humour.</p>

               <p>To inform you rightly then in this point, Firſt, it muſt be ſuppoſed, that ſome place ought neceſſarily to be ſet apart for the publick Worſhip of God, and for Holy Duties; which is ſuch a truth, and ſo conſonant to reaſon, and the Practice of all Gods People in the

               <p>Secondly, it will then follow, that all Chriſtians who deſire to walk in the ways of God, and in the ſteps of the Godly, are oblieged to come unto ſuch places ſet apart for God and Holy Duties; there to offer up Prayers and Praiſes to God, and ſolemnly and duly to Worſhip and Adore him; for to this very end are the Houſes of God ſet apart from all common uſes, that Gods People may there aſſemble themſelves to Worſhip him together, and may by their joint Prayers Beſiege Gods Throne, as with an Army, and take Heaven by force.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, it muſt be granted, that ſuch Religious Publick Worſhip to be by all duly performed in Gods Houſe, ought not to be performed lamely and by halves, as by the Soul only, without the Body; or the Body only, without the Soul; but it muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and intire, as far as Mortals can attain to; it muſt be a Service made up of both Soul and Body; the whole Man muſt be ingaged diligently therein: Firſt, the Soul is oblieged, that this Worſhip be internal, hearty and unfeigned; then the Body is ingaged that it be a viſible Worſhip exemplary to others, but very humble and lowly, expreſſing the inward reverence of the Soul, and augmenting and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the ſame.</p>

               <p>Indeed <hi>Andrew</hi> I was once almoſt of your mind, until
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62865:3"/>
I had ſeriouſly conſidered, firſt, that ſuch Adoration being a bodily act, muſt of neceſſity be done towards ſome part of the Church, either towards the upper end or towards the lower end, towards the ſides, or roof, or pavement of the Church, Secondly, that if every man ſhould be at liberty to bow which way his fancy or accident guided him, this would be a manifeſt violation of that Apoſtolical Precept, <hi>[Let all things be done decently and in order, 1 Cor.</hi> 14. 40.] and that it would be moſt unbecoming a Chriſtian Aſſembly, over which the God of Order and Unity doth preſide, and on which an orderly Army of Angels continually do wait. Thirdly, that all the Holy Fathers of the Primitive Church (to whom God gave in a more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful manner, the Spirit of Wiſdom and Piety) did with all the People committed to their charge, exhibit this bodily Worſhip of God towards one and the ſame place, and that was towards the Eaſt, and towards the Altar, which was alwaies placed in the Eaſt End of all Churches.</p>

               <p>Firſt, it is enough to any man that loves not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious, that all our Anceſtors thought fit ſo to do, though we ſhould not now know their reaſons for the ſame.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we know they had amongſt other reaſons this one, That the Altar, whereon Chriſts Body and Blood is ſolemnly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated, and at which we eat the Bread of Life and drink the Cup of eternal Salvation; and the Sacrifices of Prayer and Praiſes were wont to be offered, was to be eſteemed the beſt, the principal and moſt Holy part of all the Church Goods; which is aſſerted by all the ancient Fathers; and for this reaſon the Altar was uſed to be guarded with Rails, and to be placed in the higheſt part of the Church; whereas the <hi>Baptiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium</hi> or Font was wont to be placed at firſt without the Church in the Church-yard: and afterwards within the Church, but towards the lower end and near the Entrance.</p>

               <p>I remember that the Primitive Chriſtians were accuſed for Worſhiping the Sun, becauſe they were wont to Worſhip God with their faces towards the Eaſt; and thoſe amongſt you that in their Prayers lift their Eyes towards Heaven or the Roof of the Church, may with as

               <p>It is true, that neither bowing towards the Altar, nor ſtanding up at <hi>Glory be to the Father, &amp;c.</hi> nor to be bare-headed all the timewe are within the Church, nor many other things, are commanded us by any expreſs Order of the Church, which yet are lawfully lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Piouſly performed by us, only by virtue of Catholique or Univerſal Cuſtom, which is to be regarded alwaies as an implicit command of the Church, by all that will own themſelves Sons of the Church: And therefore our Church thought it ſuperfluous to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſuch things, as (being ſo uſual and well known) none but meer cavillers would ever ſcruple to do.</p>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62865:4"/>
before the Popiſh Tranſubſtantiation was once dreamt of, eſpecially ſo long as we uſe the word Altar in that Catholique and Univerſal ſenſe, which they ever uſed the ſame?
