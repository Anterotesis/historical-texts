            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>TIs with the Higheſt Veneration due to Your Graces Illuſtrious Worth and Quality, that I preſume to make this Addreſs to a Perſon of Your Graces Eminence and Greatneſs. And indeed, the only Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement for that Confidence, is, That this Diſcourſe is onely Liſted under Your Graces Banner. Your Grace has been pleaſed to be the firſt Aſſertor of that Juſtice, which in this Age of the World, wanted onely ſo Great a
<pb facs="tcp:60047:3"/>
Name to Eſpouſe and Vindicate it. For alas, whatever (tho never ſo rational) has or could be urged in the Defence of Chriſtian Clemency and Tenderneſs, by any leſs Hand, would have been overbourn by the preſent Impetuous Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent againſt it; And therefore they only wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo unintereſted a Champion as Your Grace to Patronize them. If any leſs Perſon had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted it, preſently the opprobious Name of a <hi>Non-con,</hi> or a <hi>Tub-Preacher,</hi> would have been thrown in his Teeth, and all Reaſons whatever, upon a <hi>Toleration,</hi> tho never ſo Convincing, would have been inſtantly Blaſted (how unjuſtly ſoever) with the Old Brand of Great is <hi>Diana</hi> of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> as if Publiſh'd, Maintain'd, and cryed up only for the Service or Intereſt of a Party or Faction. But Your Grace has the happineſs of a Station and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter above the Reach of ſo feeble and ſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a Calumny, whilſt Your Generous Pen has been pleaſed to adapt that Truth which Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice may Snarl at, but cannot Bite.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60047:3"/>
I confeſs indeed, the General, nay only Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments urged againſt a <hi>Toleration,</hi> is that Clamorous pretence, of its Danger to the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> through an Indulging of Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Antimonarchical Principles, which under the Mask and Cover of Tenderneſs of Conſcience, have been, or may be diffuſed thro' the Kingdom, and ſeveral Republick Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and Poyſonous Deſigns, have or may be hatcht and nouriſht under the unhappy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of <hi>Liberty of Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And truly, Perſecution for Diſſent, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Faith, without this plauſible Apology, would not have ſo much as a Shadow of Excuſe to Protect it from the Infamy of a more than <hi>Pagan</hi> piece of Cruelty. But alas, this weak Pretext, when truly and duely weigh'd, will quickly fall to the Ground. For that there have been, and may be again, thoſe Atheiſtical and Diabolical perſons, who Villanouſly, under the Veil of Religion, play the blackeſt of Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and carry on their own ambitious and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<pb facs="tcp:60047:4"/>
Intregues, under that Golden Viſor, is a moſt undoubted and too ſad Truth. But is that a ſufficient Plea, why thoſe, whoſe utmoſt Aime is the Innocent Worſhip of God, untaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any ſuch Diſloyal Thoughts, ſhould not only be Loaded with their Reproach, and Stig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized with their Brand, but alſo be equally involved in their Condemnation, <hi>viz.</hi> Fined, Haraſt, Impriſon'd, Beggard, and Ruin'd as ſuch. If the <hi>Government</hi> has had Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of thoſe Antimonarchical Principles ſo fomented, undoubtedly that Experience has given it Diſcretion enough to prevent the future Effects of them, and to diſtinguiſh betwixt the <hi>Guilty</hi> and the <hi>Innocent.</hi> Let every <hi>Judas</hi> therefore have his <hi>Judas</hi> Fate; which may the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of the Nation and Government take care to ſee Executed: And thoſe that urge the denyal of a <hi>Toleration</hi> from their Jealouſie only of the forementioned Danger, muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſuſpect a very great Imbecility in the Adminiſtration, that can find no better Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
<pb facs="tcp:60047:4"/>
then rooting up the Flower, to keep the Spider from ſucking Poyſon out of it.</p>
            <p>This whole Diſcourſe therefore, being abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely free from the leaſt intention of favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any of thoſe falſe Pretenders to Religion and Chriſtianity, thoſe wicked Enemies of Magiſtracy, the Sacred Ordinance of God, is only an Endeavour to evince the Reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Chriſtian forbearance to our weak Brother, purely and only as ſuch.

               <p>IT is not the Will of the Great and Wiſe God, to appoint any Forcible Ways or Courſes to bring Men and Women to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to his Worſhip: But Chriſt was pleaſed to Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate his Apoſtles (to whom he committed the Keyes of his Church) to Preach and Declare the Chriſtian Doctrine: And they that ſucceed them in their Office, are not by Might or by Power, but by gentle Invitation, and the influence of his kind Spirit, to inform the Judgment, convince the Conſcience, and ſo to perſwade the Children of Men to be Reconciled unto God. And who is Man that he ſhould take another Courſe, and will not reſt in God's Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? <hi>Now we are Ambaſſadors for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you through us; we pray you in Chriſts ſtead, be ye reconciled to God.</hi>

               <p>THe uſing outward Compulſion in matters of Conſcience, does only ſerve to make Men Hypocrites, but works no ſaving Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. If Men conform to any Worſhip or way thereof, with an unwilling Mind, they cannot ſerve God aright, though the Worſhip be Right, becauſe the Heart of the Worſhipper is not Right. God calls for the Heart, <hi>My Son, give me thy Heart.</hi> If it were not for Compulſion, the Man would be in ſome other Practice or Profeſſion; and when he Conforms only to ſave his Perſon or his Purſe, he is the Servant of Man, and not the Servant of God, and this is not to Save his Soul. <hi>Not by Conſtraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but a ready mind.</hi>

Upon this the Poor People of many Pariſhes go a Begging, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers preſently were ſo great, that the Juſtices were fain to meet, and conſulting together, conclude upon it to get the Mans Fines to be diſcharged. This being done, <hi>Peard</hi> returns to his buſineſs, takes the Poor off their hands, and finds them again the ſame Living.</p>
               <p>In like manner, about 14 Years ſince, the Biſhop of <hi>Sarum</hi> ſends forth Inſtructions into all the Pariſhes of his Dioceſs for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to Church, or citing them to his Coutt. There were Eighty Clothiers Nonconformiſts of ſeveral Judgments in the County of <hi>Wilts,</hi> who being Alarum'd by this Summons, think of withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Trade, (the time for Proviſion of their Wool favouring ſuch a ſuſpention) but conſidering what a Number of Poor depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on them, ſome Imploying 500, ſome a 1000 People under them, who were capable of getting no other maintenance: Beſides that, the Farmer was no leſs concerned than the Spinner and the Carder, who could have no Money for his Wool; fearing alſo that if they ſhould give over on a ſuddain, there might ſo much Clamour enſue as might turn into ſome uproar, they agree upon ſending up eight or ten of their ſufficient Men to repreſent their Caſe to the King and Council. Orders are taken hereupon that the Arch-Biſhop Writes
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60047:7"/>
to the Biſhop to deſiſt, and aſſurance is given by both the Secretaries to the Clothiers for their ſafety in keeping on their Imployment.</p>
               <p>What thoſe Juſtices and what the Council at that time ſaw con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for that Shire, and thoſe Towns, will be diſcerned (I doubt not) by the conſiderate, to be of the like Emolument throughout the Nation.</p>
               <p>And this brings to my remembrance a certain Propheſie, that is now much in Mens Mouths, and hath been going for Scores of Years, <hi>That after Eighty</hi> Five, England <hi>ſhall</hi> Thrive: which though I have hitherto regarded (I muſt confeſs,) when I have heard the words but as Rhime only, yet if it ſhall pleaſe the King at his coming now to the Throne, to give Liberty of Conſcience to his People, according to the deſign of this Paper, I ſhall not doubt but to ſee the matter really accompliſhed. The Riches of a Nation are the Bodies of Men; for the greatneſs of a Kingdom certainly conſiſts not in a vaſt continent of Ground, but in the Multitude of its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants; and the Thriving of the People, lyes in the encreaſe of Trade, Manufacture and Commerce, as is intimated. <hi>An Act for Univerſal Toleration</hi> (Stated rightly, that is, of all, ſo far as they are Tolerable, whereof the Wiſdome of a Parliament is the fitteſt Judge) would produce both theſe; It would bring People that are Perſecuted in our Neighbour Nations about their Religion, to <hi>England,</hi> as it does, or hath done to <hi>Holland;</hi> and they muſt bring their Hands and Buſineſs with them. Beſides, the Infinite In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement it would give to many, who now keep in their Monys, by Reaſon of their Obnoxiouſneſs to the Law, which they would bring forth moſt Induſtriouſly into Imployment, as ſoon as they could ſee themſelves ſafe, and their Conſciences out of danger. <hi>And when</hi> Iſſachar <hi>ſaw that Reſt was good, and the Land that it was Pleaſant, he bowed his Shoulder to Bear, and became a Servant unto Tribute.</hi>

his Deceaſed Brother in his Example of Clemency, which we may hope for in this point of Indulgence. We have his Royal Word for thus much, and his Word, we all hear, may be Preſumed upon, ſo far as the meaning may be Preſumed. I do not therefore here Preſume upon his meaning, but the Clemency of the late King, and Tenderneſs to his Subjects in his Gracious Purpoſes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge them in the point of Liberty of Conſcience, does appear ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently to all Men on Record. In his Declaration from <hi>Breda, April</hi> 1660. <q>We do declare (ſays he) a Liberty to Tender Conſciences, and that no Man ſhall be diſquieted, or called in Queſtion for differences in Opinion, in the matters of Religion, which doth not diſturb the Peace of the Kingdome; and that We ſhall be ready to conſent to ſuch an Act of Parliament as upon mature deliberation ſhall be offered to us, for the full grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Indulgence.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In his Declaration Dated <hi>October</hi> 1660. <q>We do again renew what we have formerly ſaid in our Declaration from <hi>Breda,</hi> for the Liberty of Tender Conſciences. That no Man ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted or called in Queſtion for differences in Opinion in matters of Religion, which do not diſturb the Peace of the Kingdom, and if any have been diſturbed in that kind ſince our Arival here, it hath not proceeded from any direction of ours.</q>
               </p>
               <p>At the opening of the Parliament on the Eighth of <hi>May,</hi> 1661. <q>I do Value my ſelf much upon keeping my Word, and upon mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good whatſoever I Promiſe to my Subjects.</q>

               <p>Again in his Speech to both Houſes on <hi>July</hi> the <hi>8th</hi> 1661. <q>It is to put my ſelf in Mind, as well as you, that I (I think ſo often as I come to you) mention to you my Declaration from <hi>Breda;</hi> and let me put you in mind of another Declaration Publiſhed by your ſelves about the ſame time, which I am perſwaded made mine the more effectual, an Honeſt, Generous, and Chriſtian De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, Signed by the moſt Eminent.

Again in his Declaration of <hi>Decem.</hi> 1662. <q>Concerning the Non performance of our Promiſes, we well remember the very words from <hi>Breda,</hi> viz. we Remember well the Confirmations we have made of them, ſince upon ſeveral occaſions in Parliament, and as all theſe things are ſtill freſh in our Memory, ſo are we ſtill firm in the Reſolution of performing them to the full. And further, We do ſtill conceive our ſelves ſo far engaged both in Honour, and what we owe to the Peace of our Dominions, which we Profeſs we can never think ſecure whilſt there ſhall be a colour left to the Malitious and Diſaffected to Inflame the Minds of ſo many Multitudes, upon the ſcore of Conſcience, with deſpair of ever obtaining any effect of our Promiſes for their Eaſe.</q> After all, we have his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging Declaration indeed, for fulfilling all his Promiſes, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an end to a preceding violent Proſecution of the Act againſt Conventicles, <hi>March</hi> 1672.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It being Evident, by the ſad experience of Twelve Years, that there is little Fruit of all thoſe forcible courſes; we think our ſelves obliged to make uſe of that Supream Power which is not only Inherent in us, but hath been declared and Recognized to be ſo by ſeveral Statutes and Acts of Parliament, and therefore do now accordingly Iſſue out this our Declaration for the quieting the Minds of our good Subjects in theſe points, for Inviting of Strangers in this Conjuncture to come and Live under us, and for the better Incouragement of all, to a chearful following their Trade and Callings, from whence we hope (by the bleſſing of God) to have many good and happy advantages to our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q> There are many Gracious Sayings here might be added upon this, which the late King uttered in return to the Miniſters who brought him the Thanks of ſeveral Counties for this his Declaration, fit to be Recorded, as of extraordinary kindneſs, but ſeeing it hath pleaſed the Divine Providence to take him from us, who ſhould have made them good, I am content they be Interred with him.</p>
               <p>The Words of our preſent Soveraign are I am ſure of more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment now to us, which as they make all this which is brought to be material, and for which the whole Nation is Addreſſing him with their Thanks (among whom I know no cauſe why I may not

                  <hi>Then after Five Days</hi> Ananias <hi>the High Prieſt deſcended with the Elders, and an Orator Named</hi> Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullus, <hi>who when he was called forth,</hi> ſpake thus, <hi>Seeing that by thee we enjoy great Quietneſs, and that by thee very Worthy Deeds have been done to this Nation, we accept it always and in all places, moſt Noble Felix, with all Thankfulneſs.</hi>

               <p>IT is not like in the Three firſt Centuries of the Church, that any thing is to be found in the Chriſtian writings, for the uſe of the Sword in Religion, whilſt themſelves were under it.
