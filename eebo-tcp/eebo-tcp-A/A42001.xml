            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

AN ALARM To the Falſe SHEPHEARDS: Sounded forth before the Indignation of the Lord be poured out upon Them. This is the Word which I received from the Lord, the <hi>24th.</hi> of the <hi>12th.

which is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is to come; <hi>This is he who was the firſt and the laſt, which was dead and is alive, and liveth for evermore:</hi> and this Word is true from the beginning, as ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119. 160. <hi>Thy Word is true from the beginning, and every one of thy righteouus Judgments endureth for ever:</hi> and <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>Thy Word is a Lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my paths:</hi> and by this Word was <hi>Davids</hi> ſteps ordered, which Word he hid in his heart, and in this Word he meditated; and ſaith <hi>David</hi> in a certain place, <hi>I rejoyce at thy Word, as one that findeth great ſpoil;</hi> and this is the Word which we bear Teſtimony unto, in which is life, <hi>and he that hath this word hath life, and he that hath not this word hath not life; ſo he that hath this word may ſpeak it,</hi> as <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 28 29. <hi>He that hath my word let him ſpeak my word faithfully; What is the Chaff to the Wheat,</hi> ſaith the Lord? for ſaith the Lord, <hi>Is not my Word like a fire, and like an hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?</hi> and we know the Word in us as the Scripture declareth, that cutteth down and burneth up that which is contrary to God in us; and we know him <hi>who ſits as a Reſiners fire, to burn up all that is contrary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; for who amongſt the ſons of men can dwell with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring fire? or who can dwell with everlaſting burnings?</hi> Now this is he that can dwell with everlaſting burnings, he that walketh righteouſly, and ſpeaketh uprightly; he that deſpiſeth the gain of oppreſſion, that ſhaketh his hands from holding of Bribes, that ſtoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his eyes from ſeeing of evil; he only can dwell with the Word of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this is the Word of God which Judgeth the wicked man for his wickedneſs; and this is he which was in the beginning with the Father, before the Heavens were framed, or the foundations of the Earth were laid; and this Word we bear teſtimony unto, <hi>which became fleſh and dwell amongſt the Apoſtles,</hi> as the Scripture of truth declareth; and by the ſame Word is the World kept to this day, ſtanding in the water and out of the water, and all things are upheld by him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Who being the brightneſs of his glory, and the expreſs image of his perſon, and upholding all things by the Word of his power;</hi> and this Word we bear teſtimony is nigh people, as the Scripture of truth declareth; <hi>in the heart, and in the mouth.</hi>

But it may be ſaid, did not the Apoſtles preach Chriſt in the Scriptures? or did they not bid people look for him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Nay, the Apoſtles preached <hi>Chriſt the word, nigh in the heart and in the mouth,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>there is no need to ſay, who ſhall deſcend, or who ſhall aſcend, or go beyond the Seas,</hi> but what ſaith it? <hi>the word is nigh in the heart and in the mouth, that you may hear it and do it; and this is the more ſure word of Propheſie, which you will do well if you take heed unto, as unto a light that ſhineth in a dark place;</hi> and there was them who had the word of God abiding in them, to whom <hi>John</hi> writ, 1 John 2. 14. <hi>I have written unto you young men, becauſe you are ſtrong and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one;</hi> and this word is to be known within the anointed of God, as, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 27. <hi>But the anointing which ye have received of him, abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you, but as the ſame anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie; and even as it hath taught you, ye ſhall abide in him.</hi> And the word of God which <hi>Paul</hi> was a Miniſter of, we bear teſtimony unto, which word he did not preach till he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in him, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 15, 16. ſaith he, <hi>When it pleaſed God who ſeperated me from my mothers womb, and called me by his grace, to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen:</hi> So now people may plainly ſee, that <hi>Paul</hi> did not preach Chriſt, who is the word, till he was revealed in him, and this was the end of his Miniſtry, and of his travail, who ſaid, <hi>I travail in birth again till Chriſt be formed in you;</hi> he did not ſay he travelled till they profeſſed Chriſt or Scriptures, or talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him, but till <hi>he was formed in them,</hi> for he was in them, as ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. <hi>Examine your ſelves, whether you be in the faith, prove your own ſelves, know you not your own ſelves, how that Jeſus Chriſt is in you except ye be reprobates:</hi> and when he writ to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> Col. 3 16. ſaid, <hi>Let the</hi> word <hi>dwell in you richly in all wiſdome;</hi> and this word we bear teſtimony un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, which we know St. <hi>Paul</hi> declareth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12. <hi>The word of God is quick and powerful, and ſharper than any two edged ſword, piercing even to the dividing aſunder of ſoul and Spirit, and of the joynts, and marrow; and is a diſcerner of the thoughts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the heart:</hi> ſo this is the word of God which divides be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61529:6"/>
the pretious and the vile in people, that which cuts down the unruly nature, that is the word of God, <hi>yea the ſword of the ſpirit is the word of God,</hi> and ſo that which cuts down the wicked one in people, the ſame reconcileth to God, and this word was committed unto the Apoſtles, for ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>He hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation;</hi> ſo the ſame word which cutteth down the man of ſin in people, the ſame reconciles to God, as the Scriptures of truth decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</p>
               <p>Yea, but it may be ſaid, Chriſt ſaid, ſearch the Scriptures, then cannot we find Chriſt if we ſearch them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Jews ſearched the Scriptures, <hi>and thought in them to have eternal life, for they are they which teſtifie of me,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>but you will not come to me, that you may have life:</hi> ſo friend whoſoever thou art, I do not deny but thou maiſt ſearch the Scriptures which teſtifieth of Chriſt, but thou can never have life till thou come to that which Scripture teſtifieth of, which is Chriſt Jeſus the word of God.</p>
               <p>Yea, but it may be ſaid, we had thought the Scriptures had been the Word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Nay Friend, <hi>by the Word the World was made,</hi> which was before Scriptures was, <hi>which Word abideth and endureth for ever;</hi> the Scriptures did not make the World, but the Word which the Scripture teſtifieth of, <hi>which he that hath it hath life, he that hath not the Word, hath not life;</hi> ſo <hi>it is the ingrafted Word which is able to ſave the ſoul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then ſome may object and ſay, if thou ſayes Chriſt is the Word, and the Word is but one, then thou denies Scriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Nay, the Scriptures of truth I own, which was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken forth as the holy Men of God was moved of the holy Ghoſt, which are good in their places; yea, let my Pen fall out of my hand, and my arm from my ſhoulder, and my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, rather then I ſhould deny the Scriptures of truth, for they I truly own, which teſtifieth of the Word; but the Scriptures are Words, as <hi>Exod.</hi>
