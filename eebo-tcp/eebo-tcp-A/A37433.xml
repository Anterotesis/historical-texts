            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>REformation of Manners is a
Work so Honourable, and at
This Time so absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
that, like the Reform of our Money,
it can be no longer delayed.</p>
            <p>The Ways by which the present Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of Vice has been let in upon the
Nation, and by which it maintains the
Tyranny it has usurp'd on the Lives of
the Inhabitants, are too plain to be hid.
The following Sheets aim at the Work,
by leading to the most direct means, <hi>Viz.</hi>
Reformation by Example. Laws are, <hi>in
Terrorem</hi> Punishments, and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
<pb facs="tcp:42796:3"/>
Compel and put a Force upon
Mens Minds; but Example is Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasive
and Gentle, and draws by a
Secret, Invisible, and almost Involuntary
Power.</p>
            <p>If there can be any Remedies propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
more proper to bring it to pass, they
that know them would do well to bring
them forth. In the mean time the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
thinks Conscience in the Minds of
Men Impartially Consulted, will give a
<hi>Probatum</hi> to the following Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal;
and to that Iudgment he refers all
those who Object against it.</p>

            <head>THE
Poor Man's PLEA
TO
All the Proclamations, Declarations, Acts
of Parliament, &amp;c. which have been,
or shall be made, or publish'd, for a
Reformation of Manners, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
Immorality in the Nation.</head>
            <p>IN searching for a proper Cure of an Epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick
Distemper, Physicians tell us 'tis
first necessary to know the Cause of that
Distemper, from what Part of the Body, and
from what ill Habit it proceeds; and when the
Cause is discover'd, it is to be removed, that the
Effect may cease of it self; but if removing the
Cause will not work the Cure, then indeed they
proceed to apply proper Remedies to the Disease
it self, and the particular part afflicted.</p>
            <p>Immorality is without doubt the present
reigning Distemper of the Nation: And the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42796:4"/>
King and Parliament, who are the proper
Physicians, seem nobly inclin'd to undertake
the Cure. 'Tis a Great Work, well worthy their
utmost Pains: The Honour of it, were it once
perfected, would add more Trophies to the
Crown, that all the Victories of <hi>this Bloody War,</hi>
or the Glories of <hi>this Honourable Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as a Person under the Violence of a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
sends in vain for a Physician, unless he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves
to make use of his Prescription; so in
vain does the King attempt to reform a Nation,
unless they are willing to reform themselves,
and to submit to his Prescriptions.</p>
            <p>Wickedness is an Ancient Inhabitant in this
Country, and 'tis very hard to give its Original.</p>
            <p>But however difficult that may be, 'tis easy
to look back to a Time when we were not so
generally infected with Vice as we are now;
and 'twill seem sufficient to enquire into the
Causes of our present Defection.</p>
            <p>The Protestant Religion seems to have an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>question'd
Title to the first introducing a strict
Morality among us; and 'tis but just to give the
Honour of it where 'tis so eminently due. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of Manners has something of a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Consequence in it from Reformation in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
For since the Principles of the Protestant
Religion disown the Indulgencies of the <hi>Roman</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:42796:4"/>
Pontiff, by which a Thousand Sins are, <hi>as Venial
Crimes,</hi> bought off, and the Priest, <hi>to save God
Almighty the trouble,</hi> can blot them out of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
before it comes to his hand; common
Vices lost their Charter, and men could not sin
at so cheap a Rate as before. The Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
has in it self a natural tendency to Virtue,
as a standing Testimony of its own Divine Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,
and accordingly it has very much suppress'd
Vice and Immorality in all the Countries where it
has had a Footing: It has civiliz'd Nations, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
the very Tempers of its Professors: Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
and Humanity has gone hand in hand in
the World; and there is so visible a difference
between the other Civiliz'd Governments in the
World, and those who now are under the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Powers, that it carries its Evidence in it
self.</p>
            <p>The Reformation, begun in <hi>England</hi> in the
days of King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, and afterwards
gloriously finished by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> brought
the <hi>English</hi> Nation to such a degree of Humanity,
and Sobriety of Conversation, as we have reason
to doubt will hardly be seen again in our Age.</p>
            <p>In King <hi>Iames</hi> the First's time, the Court af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
something more of Gallantry and Gaiety,
Luxury got footing; and Twenty Years Peace,
together with no extraordinary Examples from
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42796:5"/>
the Court, gave too great Encouragement to
Licentiousness.</p>
            <p>If it got footing in King <hi>Iames</hi> the First's
time, it took a deep Root in the Reign of his
Son; and the Liberty given the Soldiery in the
Civil War, dispers'd all manner of Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
throughout the Kingdom. That Prince,
though very Pious in his own Person and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
had the Misfortune to be the first King of
<hi>England,</hi> and perhaps in the whole World, that
ever establish'd Wickedness by a Law: By what
unhappy Council, or secret ill Fate he was gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to it, is hard to determine; but the <hi>Book of
Sports,</hi> as it was called, that Book to tolerate
the Exercise of of all sorts of Pastimes on the
Lord's Day, tended more to the vitiating the
Practice of this Kingdom, <hi>as to keeping that Day,</hi>
than all the Acts of Parliament, Proclamations,
and Endeavours of future Princes have done,
or perhaps ever will do, to reform it.</p>
            <p>And yet the People of <hi>England</hi> express'd a
general sort of Aversion to that Liberty; <hi>and
some,</hi> as if glutted with too much Freedom, when
the Reins of the Law were taken off, refused
that Practice they allow'd themselves in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:42796:5"/>
In the time of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, Lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and all manner of Debauchery arriv'd at its
Meridian: The Encouragement it had from
the Practice and Allowance of the Court, is an
invincible Demonstration how far the Influence
of our Governors extends in the Practice of the
People.</p>
            <p>The present King and his late Queen, whose
Glorious Memory will be dear to the Nation
as long as the World stands, have had all this
wicked Knot to unravel. This was the first
thing the Queen set upon while the King was
engaged in his Wars abroad: She first gave all
sorts of Vice a general Discouragement; and
on the contrary, rais'd the value of Virtue and
Sobriety by her Royal Example. The King
having brought the War to a Glorious Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and settled an Honourable Peace, in his
very first Speech to his Parliament proclaims a
New War against Prophaneness and Immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and goes on also to discourage the Practice
of it by the like Royal Example.</p>
            <p>Thus the Work is begun nobly and regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and the Parliament, the General Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
of the Nation, readily pursues it by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting
Laws to suppress all manner of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are Great Things, and well improv'd,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42796:6"/>
would give an undoubted Overthrow to the
Tyranny of Vice, and the Dominion Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
has usurp'd in the hearts of men.</p>
            <p>But we of the <hi>Plebeii</hi> find our selves justly
aggriev'd in all this Work of Reformation; and
the Partiality of this Reforming Rigor makes
the real Work impossible: Wherefore we find
our selves forced to seek Redress of our Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
in the old honest way of Petitioning
Heaven to relieve us: And in the mean time,
we solemnly Enter our Protestation against all
the Vicious Part of the Nobility and Gentry of
the Nation; as follows:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> We Protest, That we do not find im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially
enquiring into the matter, and speaking
of Moral Gooodness, that you are one jot better
than we are, <hi>your Dignities, Estates and Quality except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
'Tis true, we are all bad enough, and we
are willing in good Manners to agree, that
we are as wicked as you; but we cannot find
on the exactest Scutiny, but that in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
of Vice, the Devil has taken care
to level Poor and Rich into one Class, and is
fairly going on to make us all Graduates in the
last degreee of Immorality.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We do not find that all the Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,
Declarations, and Acts of Parliament
yet made, have any <hi>effective Power</hi> to punish <hi>you</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:42796:6"/>
for your Immoralities, as they do us. Now,
while <hi>you</hi> make Laws to punish <hi>us,</hi> and let <hi>your
selves</hi> go free, though guilty of the same Vices
and Immoralities, those Laws are unjust and
unequal in themselves.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, the Laws do not express a Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to <hi>you</hi> and Punishment to <hi>us;</hi> and therefore
the King and Parliament are free, as King and
Parliament, from this our Appeal; but the
Gentry and Magistrates of the Kingdom, while
they execute those Laws upon us the poor Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and themselves practising the same Crimes,
in defiance of the Laws both of God and Man,
go unpunish'd; <hi>This</hi> is the Grievance we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
against, as unjust and unequal.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, till the Nobility, Gentry, Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Peace, and Clergy, will be pleased
either to reform their own Manners, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
their own Immoralities, or find out some
Method and Power impartially to punish them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
when guilty, we humbly crave leave to
object against setting any Poor Man in the
Stocks, or sending them to the House of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
for Immoralities, as the most unequal
and unjust way of proceeding in the World.</p>
            <p>And now, Gentlemen,</p>
            <p>That this Protestation may not seem a little
too rude, and a Breach of good Manners to our
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42796:7"/>
Superiors, we crave Leave to subjoin our hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Appeal to your selves; and will for once,
knowing you as <hi>English</hi> Gentlemen, to be Men
of Honour, <hi>make you Iudges in your own case.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Gentlemen, We appeal to your selves,
whether ever it be likely to perfect the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of Manners in this Kingdom, without
you: Whether Laws to punish us, without your
Example also to influence us, will ever bring
the Work to pass.</p>
            <p>The first Step from a loose vicious Practice
in this Nation, was begun by King <hi>Edward</hi> the
Sixth, back'd by a Reform'd Clergy, and a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Nobility: Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> carried it on.
'Twas the Kings and the Gentry which first
again degenerated from that strict Observation
of Moral Virtues, and from thence carried Vice
on to that degree it now appears in. From the
Court Vice took its Progress into the Countrey;
and in the Families of the Gentry and Nobility
it harbour'd, till it took heart under their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
and made a general Sally into the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and We the Poor Commons, who have
been always easy to be guided by the Example
of our Landlords and Gentlemen, have really
been debauch'd into Vice by their Examples:
And it must be the <hi>Example of you the Nobility and
Gentry of the Kingdom,</hi> that must put a Stop to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42796:7"/>
the Flood of Vice and Prophaneness which is
broken in upon the Countrey, or it will never
be done.</p>
            <p>Our Laws against all manner of Vicious Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
are already very severe: But Laws are
useless insignificant things, if the Executive
Power which lies in the Magistrate be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted.
The Justices of the Peace have the Power
to punish, but if they do not put forth that Power,
'tis all one as if they had none at all: Some have
possibly exerted this Power; but whereever it
has been so put forth, it has fallen upon us the
poor Commons: These are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all Cobweb Laws,
in which the small Flies are catch'd, and the
great ones break through. My Lord-Mayor has
whipt about the poor Beggars, and a few scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
Whores have been sent to the House of
Correction; some Alehousekeepers and Vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
have been Fin'd for drawing Drink on the
Sabbath-day; but all this falls upon us of the
Mob, the poor <hi>Plebeii,</hi> as if all the Vice lay
among us; for we do not find the Rich Drunkard
carri'd before my Lord Mayor, nor a Swearing
Lewd Merchant Fin'd, or Set in the Stocks. <hi>The
man with a Gold Ring and Gay Cloths,</hi> may Swear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Justice, or at the Justice; may reel home
through the open Streets, and no man take any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42796:8"/>
of it; but if a poor man get drunk, or swear an
Oath, he must to the Stocks without Remedy.</p>
            <p>In the second place, We appeal to your selves,
Whether Laws or Proclamations are capable of
having any Effect towards a Reformation of
Manners, while the very Benches of our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are infected with the scandalous Vices of
Swearing and Drunkenness; while our Justices
themselves shall punish a man for Drunkenness,
with a <hi>God damn him, set him in the Stocks:</hi> And
if Laws and Proclamations are useless in the
Case, then they are good for nothing, and had
as good be let alone as publish'd.</p>
            <p>'Tis hard, Gentlemen, to be punish'd for a
Crime, by a man as guilty as our selves; and
that the Figure a man makes in the World, must
be the reason why he shall or shall not be liable
to a Law: This is really punishing men for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
poor, which is no Crime at all; as a Thief
may be said to be hang'd, not for the Fact,
but for being taken.</p>
            <p>We further Appeal to your selves, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
to inform us, whether there be any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
reason why you should be allow'd the full
Career of your corrupt Appetites, without the
Restraint of Laws, while you your selves agree
that such Offences shall be punished in us, and do
really execute the Law upon the Poor People,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42796:8"/>
when brought before you for the same things.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, That the Work of Reformation of
Manners may go on, and be brought to Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
to the Glory of God, and the great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the King and Parliament: That De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery
and Prophaneness, Drunkenness, Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and all sorts of Immoralities may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd,
we humbly propose the Method which
may effectually accomplish so great a Work.</p>
            <p>(1.) That the Gentry and Clergy, who are
the Leaders of us poor ignorant people, and our
Lights erected on high places to guide and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
us, would in the first place put a voluntary
force upon themselves, and effectually reform
their own Lives, their way of Conversing, and
their common Behaviour among their Servants
and Neighbours.</p>
            <p>1. The Gentry. They are the Original of
the Modes, and Customs, and Manners of their
Neighbours; and their Examples <hi>in the Countries
especially</hi> are very moving. There are three se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Vices, which have the principal Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the greatest part of Mankind, <hi>viz.</hi>
Drunkenness, Swearing, and Whoring; all of
them very ill becoming a Gentlemen, however
Custom may have made them Modish: Where
none of these Three are in a House, there is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
something of a Plantation of God in the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42796:9"/>
Family; for they are such Epidemick Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
that hardly Human Nature is entirely free
from them.</p>
            <p>1. Drunkenness, that brutish Vice; a Sin so
sordid, and so much a Force upon Nature, that
had God Almighty enjoyn'd it a Duty, I believe
many a man would have ventur'd the loss of
Heaven, rather than have perform'd it. The
Pleasure of it seems to be so secretly hid, that
wild Heathen Nations know nothing of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
'tis only discover'd by the wise people of
these <hi>Northern</hi> Countries, who are grown Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficients
in Vice, Philosophers in Wickedness, who
can extract a Pleasure to themselves in losing
their Understanding, and make themselves sick
at heart for their Diversion.</p>
            <p>If the History of this well bred Vice was to be
written, 'twould plainly appear that it begun
among the Gentry, and from them was hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
down to the poorer sort, who still love to be
like their Betters. After the Restitution of King
<hi>Charles</hi> the Second, when drinking the King's
Health became the distinction between a <hi>Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi>
and a <hi>Roundhead,</hi> Drunkenness <hi>began its Reign,</hi>
and it has Reign'd almost Forty Years: The
Gentry caress'd this Beastly Vice at such a Rate,
that no Companion, no Servant was thought
proper, unless he could bear a Quantity of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42796:9"/>
Wine; And to this day 'tis added to the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of a Man, as an additional Title, when
you would speak well of him, <hi>He is an honest
drunken Fellow;</hi> as if his Drunkenness was a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation
of his Honesty. From the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of this nasty Faculty, our Gentlemen have
arriv'd to the teaching of it; and that it might
be effectually preservd to the next Age, have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
early instructed the Youth in it. Nay, so
far has Custom prevail'd, that the Top of a
Gentleman's Entertainment has been to make
his Friend drunk; and the Friend is so much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd
to it, that he takes that for the effect of
his Kindness, which he ought as much to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted
at, as if he had kick'd him down Stairs:
Thus 'tis become a Science; and but that the
Instruction proves so easy, and the Youth too
apt to learn, possibly we might have had a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
erected for it before now. The further
perfection of this Vice among the Gentry, will
appear in two things; that 'tis become the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of their Glory, and the way of expressing
their Joy for any publick Blessing. <hi>Iack,</hi> said a
Gentleman of very high Quality, when after the
Debate in the House of Lords, King <hi>William</hi> was
voted into the vacant Throne; <hi>Iack,</hi> (says he)
<hi>God damn ye</hi> Jack, <hi>go home to your Lady, and tell her
we have got a Protestant King and Queen; and go
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42796:10"/>
and make a Bonfire as big as a House, and bid the
Bntler make ye all drunk, ye Dog:</hi> Here was Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing
to the Devil, for a Thanksgiving to God.
Other Vices are committed as Vices, and men
act them in private, and are willing to hide them;
but Drunkenness they are so fond of, that they
will glory in it, boast of it, and endeavour to
promote it as much as possible in others: 'Tis
a Triumph to a Champion of the Bottle, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
how many Quarts of Wine he has drank
at a sitting, and how he made such and such
honest Fellows drunk. Men <hi>Lye</hi> and <hi>Forswear,</hi>
and <hi>hide it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and are <hi>asham'd of it,</hi> as indeed they
have reason to do: But Drunkenness and Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
are Accomplishments People value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
upon, repeat them with pleasure, and affect
a sort of Vanity in the History; are content all
the World should be Witnesses of their Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,
have made the Crime a Badge of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to their Breeding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and introduce the practice
as a Fashion. And whoever gives himself the
trouble to reflect on the Custom of our Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in their Families, encouraging and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
this Vice of Drunkenness among the poor
Commons, will not think it a Scandal upon the
Gentry of <hi>England,</hi> if we say, That the Mode of
drinking, as 'tis now practised, had its Original
from the Practice of the Country Gentlemen,
and they again from the Court.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:42796:10"/>
It may be objected, and God forbid it should
not, That there are a great many of our Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Gentlemen, who are Men of Honour
and Men of Morals; and therefore this Charge
is not universal. To which we answer, 'Tis
universal for all that, because those very Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
though they are negatively clear as to the
Commission of the Crimes we speak of, yet are
positively guilty, in not executing that Power
the Law has put into their hands, with an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
Vigor. For where was that Gentleman or
Justice of the Peace ever yet found, who executed
the Terms of the Law upon a Drunken, Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Lewd Gentleman, his Neighbour, but the
Quality of the Person has been a License to the
open Exercise of the worst Crimes; as if there
were any Baronets, Knights, or Squires in the
next World; who because of those little step<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Custom had raised them on, higher than their
Neighbours, should be exempted from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Judicature; or that as Captain <hi>Vrats</hi> said,
who was Hang'd for Murth'ring Esquire <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hynn,
God would show them some respect as they were Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If there were any reason why a Rich Man
should be permitted in the publick Exercise of
Open Immoralities, and not the Poor Man,
something might be said: But if there be any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42796:11"/>
it lies the other way; for the Vices of
a Poor Man affect only himself; but the Rich
Man's Wickedness affects all the Neighbourhood,
gives offence to the Sober, encourages and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
the Lewd, and quite overthrows the weak
Resolutions of such as are but indifferently fix'd
in their Virtue and Morality. <hi>If my own Watch
goes false, it deceives me and none else; but if the
Town Clock goes false, it deceives the whole Parish.</hi>
The Gentry are the Leaders of the Mob; if they
are Lewd and Drunken, the others strive to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
them; if they Discourage Vice and Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,
the other will not be so forward in it,
nor so fond of it.</p>
            <p>To think then to effect a Reformation by
Punishing the Poor, while the Rich seem to
Enjoy a Charter for wickedness, is like <hi>taking
away the Effect, that the Cause may cease.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We find some People very fond of Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing
a Vice, they would have all of it to
themselves; they must, as my Lord <hi>Rochester</hi>
said of himself, <hi>Sin like a Lord;</hi> little sneaking
Sins won't serve turn; but they must be Lewd
at a rate above the Common Size, to let the
World see they are capable of it.</p>
            <p>Our Laws seem to take no Cognizance of
such, perhaps for the same reason that <hi>Lycurgus</hi>
made no Law against <hi>Parricide,</hi> because he would
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42796:11"/>
not have the Sin named among his Citizens.</p>
            <p>Now the Poor Man sees no such Dignity in
Vice, as to study Degrees; we are downright
in Wickedness, as we are in our Dealings; if
we are Drunk, 'tis plain Drunkenness; Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Whoring, is all Blunderbus with us; we
don't affect such Niceties in our Conversation;
and the Justices use us accordingly; nothing
but the Stocks, or the House of Correction is
the Case, when we are brought before them;
but when our Masters the Gentlemen come to
their Refin'd Practice, and Sin by the Rules of
Quality, we find nothing comes of it but false
Heraldry, the Vice is punish'd by the Vice, and
the Punishment renews the Crime.</p>
            <p>The Case in short is this; the Lewdness,
Prophaneness, and Immorality of the Gentry,
which is the main Cause of the General De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery
of the Kingdom, is not at all toucht by
our Laws, as they are now Executed; and while
it remains so, the Reformation of Manners can
never be brought to pass, nor Prophaneness and
Immorality Suppress'd; and therefore the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
the Poor distinctly is a Mock upon
the good Designs of the King and Parliament;
an Act of Injustice upon them to punish them,
and let others who are as guilty go free; and
a sort of Cruelty too, in taking the advantage
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42796:12"/>
of their Poverty to make them suffer, because
they want Estates to purchase their Exemption.</p>
            <p>We have some weak Excuses for this Matter,
which must be considered: As,</p>
            <p>(1). The Justice of the Peace is a <hi>Passive
Magistrate,</hi> till an information be brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, and is not to take notice of any thing,
but as it is laid in Fact, and brought to an Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davit.
Now if an Affidavit be made before a
Justice, that such or such a man Swore, or was
Drunk, he must, he cannot avoid Fining him; the
Law obliges him to it, let his Quality be what
it will; so that the Defect is not in the Law, not
in the Justice, but in the want of Information.</p>
            <p>(2). The Name of an Evidence or Informer
is so scandalous, that to attempt to inform against
a man for the most open Breach of the Laws of
Morality, is enough to denominate a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
for Society; a Rogue and an Informer are
Synonimous in the Vulgar Acceptation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so
much is the real Detection of the openest
Crimes against God, and Civil Government,
Discouraged and Avoided.</p>
            <p>(3). The Impossibility of the Cure is such, and
the Habit has so obtain'd upon all Mankind, that
it seems twisted with Human Nature, as an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix
to Natural Frailty, which it is impossible
to separate from it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:42796:12"/>
For Answer;</p>
            <p>1. <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Tis true, the Justice of the Peace is in
some respect a <hi>Passive Magistrate,</hi> and does not act
but by Information, but such Information would
be brought if it were encouraged; if Justices of
the Peace did acquaint themselves with their
Neighbourhood, they would soon hear of the
Immoralities of the Parish; and if they did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially
Execute the Law on such as offended,
without respect of Person, they would soon have
an Account of the Persons and Circumstances.
Besides, 'tis not want of Information, but want
of punishing what they have information of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
A Poor Man informs against a Great Man, the
Witness is discouraged, the man goes unpunish'd,
and the Poor Man gets the scandal of an Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
and then 'tis but too often that our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices
are not men of extraordinary Morals them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
and who shall Inform a Justice of the
Peace that such a man Swore, when he may be
heard to Swear himself as fast as another? or
who shall bring a man before a Justice for being
Drunk, when the Justice is so Drunk himself, he
cannot order him to be set in the Stocks?</p>
            <p>(2.) Besides, the Justice has a power to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
any Fact he himself sees committed, and
to enquire into any he hears of casually; and if
he will stand still and see those Acts of Immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42796:13"/>
committed before his Face, who shall bring
a Poor Man before him to be punished? Thus I
have heard a Thousand horrid Oaths sworn on a
Bowling Green, in the presence of a Justice of
the Peace, and he take no notice of it, and go
home the next hour, and set a man in the Stocks
for being Drunk.</p>
            <p>As to the Scandal of Informing, <hi>'tis an Error
in Custom,</hi> and a great Sin against Justice; 'tis
necessary indeed that all Judgment should be
according to Evidence, and to discourage Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
is to discourage Justice; but that a man
in Trial of the Morality of his Neighbour, should
be ashamed to appear, must have some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Cause.</p>
            <p>(1.) It proceeds from the Modishness of the
Vice; it has so obtain'd upon mens Practices,
that to appear against what almost all men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove,
seems malicious, and has a certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
either of Revenge, or of a Mercenary
Wretch, that Informs meerly to get a Reward.
'Tis true, if no Reward be plac'd upon an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
no man will take the trouble; and
again, if too great a Reward, Men of Honour
shun the thing, because they scorn the Fee; and
to Inform meerly for the Fee, has something of
a Rascal in it too; and from these Reasons arises
the backwardness of the People.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:42796:13"/>
The very same Rich men we speak of are the
persons who discourage the Discovery of Vice,
by scandalizing the Informer; a man that is any
thing of a Gentleman scorns it, and the Poor still
Mimick the Humour of the Rich, and hate an
Informer as they do the Devil. 'Tis strange the
Gentlemen should be asham'd to detect the
Breach of those Laws, which they were not
asham'd to make; but the very Name of an
Informer has gain'd so black an Idea in the minds
of People, because some who have made a Trade
of Informing against People for Religion, have
misbehaved themselves, that truly 'twill be hard
to bring any man either of Credit or Quality to
attempt it.</p>
            <p>But the main thing which makes our Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
backward in the prosecution of Vice, is their
practising the same Crimes themselves, and they
have so much wicked Modesty and Generosity in
them, being really no Enemies to the thing it
self, that they cannot with any sort of freedom
punish in others, what they practise themselves.</p>
            <p>In the Times of Executing the Laws against
Dissenters, we found a great many Gentlemen
very Vigorous in prosecuting their Neighbours;
they did not stick to appear in Person to disturb
Meetings, and demolish the Meeting Houses,
and rather than fail, would be Informers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42796:14"/>
the reason was because they had also a
dislike to the think; but we never found a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
Gentleman, or Justice of the Peace for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to do thus, because they approved of it.
Now were our Gentlemen and Magistrates real
Enemies to the Immoralities of this Age, did
they really hate Drunkenness as a Vice, they
would be forward and zealous to root the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of it out of the Neighbourhood, they would
not be backward or asham'd to detect Vice, to
disturb Drunken Assemblies, to disperse those
Plantations of Leachery, the Publick Bawdy-Houses,
which are almost as openly allowed as
the <hi>Burdelloes</hi> in <hi>Italy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> They would be willing
to have all sorts of Vices Suppress'd, and glory
in putting their hands to the Work; they would
not be asham'd to appear in the detecting Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery,
nor afraid to embroil themselves with
their Rich Neighbours. 'Tis Guilt of the same
Fact which makes Connivance, and till that
Guilt be removed, the Gentlemen of <hi>England</hi>
neither will, not can indeed with any kind of
Honour put their hands to the work of Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it in their Neighbours.</p>
            <p>But I think 'tis easy to make it appear that
this difficulty of Informing may be removed, and
there need not be much occasion for that Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
Employment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:42796:14"/>
'Tis in the power of the Gentry of <hi>England</hi>
to Reform the whole Kingdom without either
Laws, Proclamations, or Informers; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their Concurrence, all the Laws, Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,
and Declarations in the World will
have no Effect; the Vigour of the Laws con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in their Executive Power; Ten thousand
Acts of Parliament signify no more than One
single Proclamation, unless the Gentlemen, in
whose hands the Execution of those Laws is
placed, take care to see them duly made use
of; and how can Laws be duly Executed,
but by an Impartial Distribution of equal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and Punishments, without regard to the
Quality and Degree of the Persons? The Laws
push on the Justices now, and they take care
to go no faster than they are driven; but
would the Justices push on the Laws, Vice
would flee before them as Dust in the Wind,
and Immoralities would be soon Suppress'd;
but it can never be expected that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
should push on the Laws to a free Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of Immoralities, till they Reform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and their Great Neighbours Reform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that there may be none to punish who are
too big for the Magistrate to venture upon.</p>
            <p>Would the Gentry of <hi>England</hi> decry the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dishness
of Vice by their own Practice; would
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42796:15"/>
they dash it out of Countenance by disowning
it; that Drunkeness and Oaths might once come
into <hi>disesteem,</hi> and be out of Fashion, and a man
be valued the less for them; that he that will
Swear, and be Drunk, shall be counted a <hi>Rake,</hi>
and not fit for a Gentleman's Company. This
would do more to Reforming the rest of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
than all the Punishments the Law can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict;
the Evil encreased by Example, and must
be suppress'd the same way. If the Gentry
were thus Reform'd, their Families would be
so too: No Servant would be Entertain'd, no
Workman Employ'd, no Shopkeeper would be
Traded with by a Gentleman, but such as like
themselves, were Sober and Honest; <hi>a Lewd,
Vicious, Drunken Footman must Reform or Starve,</hi> he
would get no Service; a Servant once turn'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
for his Intemperance, would be entertain'd
by no body else; <hi>a Swearing Debauch'd Labourer
or Workman must Reform, or no body would Employ
him;</hi> the Drunken whoring Shopkeeper must
grow Sober, or lose all his Customers and be
Undone. <hi>Interest and good Manners would Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
us</hi> of the poorer sort, there would be no
need of the Stocks or Houses of Correction; <hi>we
should be sober of course, because we should be all Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars
else;</hi> and he that lov'd his Vice so dearly as
to purchase it with the loss of his Trade or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42796:15"/>
               <hi>would soon grow too poor for his Vice,
and be forced to leave it by his own Necessities;</hi> there
would be no need of Informers, a Vicious
Fellow would be presently Notorious, he would
be the Talk of the Town, every one would
slight and shun him for fear of being thought
like him by being seen in his Company; he
would expose himself, and would be punish'd
as unpitied as a Thief.</p>
            <p>So that in short, the whole Weight of this
Blessed Work of Reformation lies on the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the Gentry; they are the Cause of our
Defection, which being taken away, the Effect
would cease of course, Vice would grow Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous,
and all Mankind would be asham'd of it.</p>
            <p>(2.) The Clergy also ought not to count
themselves exempted in this matter, whose Lives
have been, and in some places still are so Vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and so loose, that 'tis well for <hi>England</hi> we
are not subject to be much <hi>Priest-ridden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis a strange thing how it shou'd be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than it is with us the poor Commonalty,
when the Gentry our Patern, and the Clergy
our Teachers, are as Immoral as we. And
then to consider the Coherence of the thing; the
<hi>Parson preaches a thundering Sermon against Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and the Iustice of Peace sets my poor Neighbour
in the Stocks, and I am like to be much the better for
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42796:16"/>
either, when I know perhaps that this same Parson and
this same Iustice were both Drunk together but the
Night before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be true, for ought we know, that a
Wicked Parson may make a good Sermon; and
the <hi>Spanish</hi> Proverb, may be true of the Soul as
well as the Body, <hi>If the Cure be but wrought let the
Devil be the Doctor;</hi> but this does not take with
the downright ignorant People in the Country;
a poor Man gets Drunk in a Country Ale house,
<hi>Why, are you not asham'd to be such a Beast, says a
good honest Neighbour to him the next day?</hi> Asham'd,
says the Fellow! Why should I be asham'd?
Why, there was Sir <hi>Iohn</hi>—and Sir <hi>Robert</hi>—
and the Parson, and they were all as Drunk as
I. And why a Beast, Pray? I heard Sir <hi>Robert</hi>
—say, That
<q>
                  <l>He that Drinks least,</l>
                  <l>Drinks most like a Beast.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>A Vicious Parson that preaches well, but
lives ill, may be like an unskilful Horseman, who
opens a Gate on the wrong side, and lets other
Folks through, but shuts himself out. This
may be possible, but it seems most reasonable
to think they are a means by that sort of living
to hinder both themselves and others; and
would the Gentry and Clergy of <hi>England</hi> but
look back a little on the Guilt that really lies
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42796:16"/>
on them, as Gentlemen by whose Example so
great a part of Mankind has been led into, and
encouraged in the Progress of Vice, they would
find Matter of very serious reflection.</p>
            <p>This Article of the Clergy may seem to lie
in the power of their Superiors to rectify, and
therefore may be something more feasible than
the other; but the Gentry who are <hi>Sui juris,</hi>
can no way be reduced but by their own vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
practice. We are in <hi>England</hi> exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
govern'd by Modes and Customs. The
Gentry may effectually Suppress Vice, would
they but put it out of Fashion; but to Suppress
it by Force seems impossible.</p>
            <p>The Application of this rough Doctrine is in
short both to the Gentry and Clergy, <hi>Physicians
Heal your selves;</hi> if you will leave off your
Drunkenness and Lewdness first, if we do not
follow you, then set us in the Stocks, and send
us to the House of Correction, and punish us
as you please; if you will leave off Whoring
first, then Brand us in the Foreheads, or Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
or Hang us for Fornication or Adultery,
and you are welcome; but to preach against
Drunkenness immediately after an Evening's
Debauch; to Correct a poor Fellow for Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the very Vice in your Mouths; these
are the unjustest ways in the World, and have
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42796:17"/>
in themselves no manner of tendency towards
the Reformation of Manners, which is the true
Design of the Law.</p>
            <p>'Tis acknowledge'd there are in <hi>England</hi> a great
many Sober, Pious, Religious Persons, both
among the Gentry and Clergy, and 'tis hoped
such cannot think themselves Libell'd or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd
in this Plea; if there were not, Laws
would never have been made against those Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<hi>for no men make Laws to punish themselves;</hi>
'tis design'd to reflect upon none but such as are
Guilty, and on them no farther than to put them
in mind how much the Nation owes its present
Degeneracy to their folly, and how much it is
in their power to Reform it again by their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample;
that the King may not publish Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations,
nor the Parliament make Laws to
no purpose; but that we might live in <hi>England</hi>
once more like Christians, and like Gentlemen,
to the Glory of God, and the Honour of the
present King and Parliament, who so publickly
have attempted the great Work of Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
among us, though hitherto to so little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
