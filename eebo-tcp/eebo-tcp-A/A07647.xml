         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to gheſſe at randon, or ſhoot at Rouers, who would happely haue faſtned it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwhere. But nothing was ſaid, why I ſhould ſhunne the Charge, or diuert the Imputation vpon any. And becauſe the firſt notice that euer I had hereof, being from (though at ſecond hand) your Lordſhip, I could not poſſeſſe my Soule in patience, without giuing your Lordſhip intimation, how vntruly, an aſperſion of ſiding that way, had by him, ſo looſe a Lozell, beene caſt on that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, whereof himſelfe ſometimes had beene, and my ſelfe am yet, through his Majeſties Grace, a member: the rather, becauſe wee haue all vnder his ſacred Maieſtie, eſpecially in Caſes of this condition, a Reference vnto your <hi>Honor,</hi> as our <hi>Viſitor.</hi> May your Lordſhip then be pleaſed, to take notice of his dealing, conformable to the reſt of

<pb facs="tcp:13165:6"/>
could be capable. For in his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and meaning to <hi>heare,</hi> is to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and apprehend. This he did not: this he could not doe. For I preached in Engliſh, vnto an Engliſh Auditorie, though compoſed then of Royall and Noble preſence. Engliſh, hee might heare; but could not vnderſtand, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>carptim</hi> and <hi>ſparſim,</hi> now and then, here and there a word, or halfe a ſentence. And yet I know he Read, for I was preſent: and ſubſcribed (he ſaith ſince, againſt his conſcience, the more Knaue he) to injoy a good Benefice, for I was a witneſſe thereto, the Articles of <hi>1562.</hi> in <hi>Weſt-Ilſly</hi> Church in Bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.

<pb facs="tcp:13165:7"/>
not to ſay, he <hi>heard</hi> me. Which chiefly and thirdly is falſe for the mayne. The wordes, he putteth on me, I profeſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, I ſpake not. I nor did, nor doe hold the purport of them, <hi>Certum &amp; de fide.</hi> The moſt that himſelfe, who muſt now ſay, what they at <hi>Rome</hi> will haue him, is this, and no more, <hi>Perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture,</hi> or, it is <hi>Probable, quòd ſic.</hi> But that which he did <hi>heare</hi> and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand is this, for theſe wordes J ſpake in <hi>Latin,</hi> not in Engliſh, <hi>Sed de Angelo cuſtode, fortaſsis amplian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum.</hi> No moe, nor fewer wordes then ſo, this way. How theſe wordes, ſo ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, ſhould affect him with ſuch content, J cannot tell. I am ſure, and can make good, they are farre enough remooued from abetting or maintayning; that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie courſe of Inuocation or aſsiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Saints and Angels: euen of Angels
<pb facs="tcp:13165:7"/>
Guardians, that continually attend vs, as farre as reſolution is from doubting. But howſoeuer, I reſolued, euen inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon firſt notice of this defamation, to ſay ſomewhat in the <hi>Caſe.</hi> And thereupon, repayring vnto my Papers, ſo ſoone as I could finde any leiſure, out of my briefer Notes, for J wrote not my Sermon <hi>verbatim,</hi> J drew into a forme, the ſubſtance, J am ſure, of all which was then deliuered: and enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it with much acceſſe, of more then I could well deliuer, or did ſpeake within the compaſſe of an houre, eſpecially, or rather wholly in that Eriſtical part and oppoſition which is <hi>inter partes litigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> about Mediation in Jnuocation. Which I thought it my dutie to offer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the view and cenſure of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, in regard of that Reference, which, as a Canon of <hi>VVindſore,</hi> I
<pb facs="tcp:13165:8"/>
haue vnto your Honor, our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iſitor. But much rather in reſpect of priuate obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, in conſideration of my owne par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.

It will Coſt more to Succour, then to Commiſerate. <hi>Agar</hi> for examples ſake, would with all her Heart haue relieued <hi>Iſmael</hi>; being readie to Dye for want of drinke, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.15.

would deſire, according vnto his better <hi>iudgment,</hi> in that which was more auaileable and for his greater good. I put the Caſe: a man of Seruice in Church or Common-wealth is a Suitor to his Prince of whom he well deſerueth, hauing ſpent in his Seruice much time and meanes, for ſome Penſion of one hundred Crownes <hi>per annum:</hi> and vpon ſome Reaſon of Profit, or ground of State, is denied his Suite in that Particular: but ſo, that in lieu thereof he hath an Office of Honour, of a thouſand pound a yeare paſſed ouer to him inſtantly. Or ſay that a Petitioner for a poore Parſonage, miſſing that, as formerly diſpoſed of, were rewarded with a Deanerie of good Corps and value: no man will or can ſay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, but, that both they ſped well, and were heard to purpoſe, according to deſire, though denied in their prime intended Suite, according to the letter. For by their Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>intentione primâ,</hi> their purpoſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect was this, to doe themſelues good, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing meanes and maintenance: to which end, vpon a ſecond intention, they pitched and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued on this or that particular; which in their Opinion, lyable to miſconceit and errour, was a Suite of Conſequence to doe them good; though in Iſſue and Concluſion they miſſed of it: and if they had obtayned it, as they deſired, their Caſe and ſtate had beene much worſe then it fell out to be otherwiſe. <hi>Paul</hi> was not heard <hi>ad volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi> as hee would and wiſhed: becauſe hee wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed

            <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is thus perſwaded of them; therefore they vſe in all exegincies, and times of trouble, in all their addreſſes vnto God for helpe and ſuccour, to vſe the aſſiſtance of holy Saints and Angels: to haue recourſe

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:13165:42"/>
to goe about, when wee may goe the neerer way. Wee are not certaine at the beſt, what they doe or can doe for vs in theſe caſes, that are ſo employed and implored by vs. I will not, I dare not be ſo harſh and rigorous, as to condemne them of Impietie for Calling vnto them. For though more bee done vnto them, then is, fit or conuenient: and more beſtowed on them, at leaſt by Conſequence, then can conſort with the Condition of their Creation: yet nothing is detracted there from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, in giuing them that they are not cape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of.</p>
            <p>It is no generall rule of neceſſarie Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, They take from God, who ouerlauiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giue any thing vnto men. Thus it ſtandeth in Caſe betwixt vs and them, if we take them in the lumpe, at whole ſale in their <hi>Doctrine,</hi> as it were. I cannot ſay it doth ſo, for their Practice, as if that alſo were ſo gently to bee handled.

In their Doctrine of defrauding the People of the Cup in the holy Sacrament of the Altar, they plead it, and conclude it in
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:13165:42"/>
Schooles and Councels, that the Cup muſt not bee giuen vnto the Laitie: the People are to receiue but in one kind. And yet their Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice is now, of what ſtanding I know not, to giue them alſo of the Wine, as I haue beene aſſured by ſome <hi>Roman</hi> Catholikes I can name, my Neighbours, and it hath beene auerred by their Prieſts.</p>
            <p>Mary marke their iuggling, and obſerue them conuicted of foule Forgerie: the Laitie drinke not of the Chalice, though they drinke of the Wine of Conſecration, powred out of the Chalice into a Glaſſe, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture altereth, in their opinion, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of the bloud of Chriſt, and euacuateth the power, and efficacie of the words of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration.

            <p>In their Doctrine of Images they diſclayme Idolatry indeed: and take the imputation with great offence, and as the moſt part of them doe teach in their Bookes the vſe of Images, I ſee no cauſe to ſtile them Idolaters. But ſure the Peoples practice is <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>They ſuggeſt to perſwade it from vſe and Congruitie thus.

it was long ere this Seruile Courſe came into pactice. <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> vpon occaſion was requeſted of an old Souldier of his to affoord him his Preſence at hearing of a Cauſe he had; the Prince replyed, he would depute one for him: which the Souldier, not vſed to ſuch tearmes of putting off, or if you will, of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> anſwered him ſtoutly, But I ſent no Subſtitute, O Emperour, to fight in thy quarrell at <hi>Philippi:</hi> I went my Selfe, and aduentured my life in Perſon, and am I put ouer to a Proxie? which <hi>Auguſtus</hi> acknowledging, with ſome bloud in his face, went himſelfe as he requeſted, and did not aſſigne a Subſtitute to doe it.

Nor doth he forget and by paſſe him, of whom he had beene nouriſhed from his youth vp vntill then, that is God, and deſire a bleſſing for his Nephewes from an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel. But in phraſing it thus, That hath deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red mee out of all aduerſitie, hee plainly ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that hee did not intend any Created Angel, but inſiſted vpon the ground of the Word of God, whom hee coupleth with the Father in praying vnto Him, By whom God deliuereth
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:13165:54"/>
whom he will deliuer, knowing that he was, as ſometime he called, The Angel of the great Counſell of the Father. <hi>Iacob</hi> profeſſeth it was Hee, and no other beſide Him, that had deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Him out of all aduerſitie, and had hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to deliuered Him, and bleſſed Him alſo. Nor was it his meaning, by Prayer to obtaine a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing for Himſelfe at Gods hand, and to put ouer his Nephewes to bee bleſſed by Angels. But he prayeth vnto him to bleſſe his Nephewes, vnto whom Himſelfe had ſometime ſaid, I will not let thee go except thou bleſſe me, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all queſtion this was God, as himſelfe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth and affirmeth plainly, I haue ſeene God face to face. It may ſeeme this Champion of Chriſt vndertooke his Maſters cauſe in this, as hee did in the maine, againſt ſome Angel ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer in thoſe dayes: ſo fully he diſcourſeth vpon the point, at this day denied by <hi>Victorellus</hi> and others, Beu-pleaders for Inuocation and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Saints &amp; Angels ſo frequent with them: For after other diſcourſes hee concludeth thus, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:13165:54"/>
and ſenſe of the Church, Chriſt Ieſus was that Angell that <hi>Iacob</hi> meant: and it is <hi>apertè</hi> falſe, and a forgery, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> auoucheth, <hi>Hic apertè Sanctus Iacob, inuocauit Angelum.</hi> In opinion of Antiquitie, as in Euidence of truth, this Angel was no Created Spirit, but God Himſelfe. Laſtly, at leaſt if He were an Angel, Hee was not any other but his guardian Angel: For the words in the Text doe imploy the office of his Angel guardian; The Angel that hath kept mee from my child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; vnto whom now, being to goe the way of all fleſh, hee might intend to put ouer his two young Nephewes, the Sonnes of <hi>Ioſeph.</hi> Miſtake me not, I ſay not he, meant his Angel guardian; For I am fully reſolued with the old Fathers, Hee meaneth Chriſt: but to ſuppoſe and grant Hee was an Angel, he could then be no other but his Guardian Angel, which will not pleaſure the Perſwaders in their plea at all. For in this preſent queſtion touching Inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Caſe of Angels Guardians is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture different, much and many wayes, from the condition, and employments of them at large.

               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:13165:87"/>Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his fourth Tome. <hi>Lib. de Curâ pro mortuis cap. 13.</hi> diſcourſeth vpon this point at large. <hi>Si rebus viuentium intereſſent animae mortuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum. If the ſoules of the departed were preſent with, or intereſſed in the affaires of the liuing: and if they did really and indeed diſcourſe with vs, then when we behold them in our ſleepe: my moſt deere and louing mother would in no caſe leaue me now, who in her life time followed me vp and downe, by Land and Sea, to the intent ſhee might liue with me continually. For God defend, that ſhee now in bliſſe, ſhould be more auerſe or cruell then when ſhe liued. Beleeue me, were I greeued at any time, or perplexed: it cannot enter into my thoughts otherwiſe, but that ſhee would viſit and comfort her diſtreſſed ſonne; whom ſometime ſhe loued with ſuch tender affection, as ſhee could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to behold him heauy. But queſtionleſſe it is true which the holy Pſalmiſt ſaith, when my father and my mother forſooke me, the Lord tooke me vp. If ſo bee then our Parents forſake vs in death, how can they bee preſent or intereſſed in our cares or affaires, any way? And if our Parents haue then no ſuch intereſt in vs, who are the dead beſide that can tell what wee doe? how, or wherewithall we are diſtreſſed? The Prophet</hi> Eſay <hi>ſaith, For thou art our Father, though</hi> Abraham <hi>know vs not: and though</hi> Iſrael <hi>take no notice of vs. If ſo great and famous Patriarchs, as</hi> Abraham <hi>and</hi> Iacob, <hi>did not vnderſtand, how the world went with their poſterity, the people that came from their loynes, how can it be that men deceaſed ſhould at all take any notice of the ſtate, or intermeddle with aſsiſting men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue

Who yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enforceth the truth of this poſition from the promiſe made by God vnto that good King <hi>Ioſias, viz. That he ſhould be gathered vnto his fathers in peace, and not ſee the deſtruction of</hi> Ieruſalem, <hi>nor the plagues that were to come vpon that people.</hi> Which promiſe had beene to no purpoſe at all, as hee well inferreth, <hi>Si poſt mortem ſentiant, quaecum que in vitâ humanâ calamitates contingunt.
