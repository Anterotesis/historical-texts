         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Now, in regard of his eminency in the world when he was aliue, I am the more eaſily perſwaded, that the very Name of him (by way of this feigned Apparition, and the like anſwerable Title of the Tranſlatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) may beget in many an earneſt deſire of perufing this Booke; and ſo become the more profitable. I hope for taking this method, I cannot be iuſtly bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; for if I haue offended any, it muſt be <hi>Syr Walter</hi> himſelfe. But him I haue not wronged, ſince I do vindicate, &amp; free him from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer blot, as preſuming him to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent of the ſuſpected Crime.

            <head>THE PREFACE of the Authour.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Treatiſe following we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to diſcuſse two questions: The firſt is touching <hi>a diuine po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer;</hi> to wit, whether there be any <hi>diuine power or God,</hi> who with his prouidence ſterneth, and gouerneth mans affaires, and demandeth an account of his actions after this life. The other, concerneth the <hi>Soule of man,</hi> that is, whether it be immortall, or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth &amp; is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vtterly extinguished with the body: Poynts worthy to be diſputed of, moſt claborately &amp; ſuccinctly; ſince of all things whatſoeuer, which become the obiect of our vnderſtanding, theſe are moſt neceſſary to be knowne. And touching the firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuppoſing that there were no <hi>God</hi> (of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this whole <hi>Vniuerſe</hi> and all negotiations of man were to be gouerned) but that all things, either by a certaine force of nature, or caſuall concourſe of
<pb facs="tcp:2520:7"/>
cauſes had their euents; then should we be freed of great feare for the things to come, and might ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely and without all impunity do whatſoeuer were beſt pleaſing to our owne diſpoſitions. For then no man were obliged to yield an account (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of the body) for things done in his life time; no man for his ſinnes should hereafter be punished; neither should any reward attend the faithfull and veriuous. Finally, neither of what comportment, carriage, and conuerſation a man is, should it be (after the diſſolution of the body from the ſoule) either preiudiciall, or beneficiall vnto him. Since ſinne then, should be nothing, but a certaine aery, imaginary, and a falſe conceit, of a law violated, &amp; a <hi>diuine power offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now, once acknowledging that there is <hi>a God</hi> (through whoſe prouidence and preſcience all things are guided and meaſured) then it ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitably followeth, that we ought greatly to feare and reuerence him, and be most cautelous, and wary, that we do not infringe his lawes &amp; ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; Since it is most certaine, that he will exact an account after this life, and will inflict due pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments vpon ſinners. For it is a point princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally iucumbent and belonging to a gouernour, to giue a iuſt retaliation and retribution to men, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſing their enormities and vyces with pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments, and their vertues with honours and rewards. All kinds of Gouerments, aſwell of the

For it is most euident, that all theſe haue euer ſet downe rewards and punishments, grounding themſelues vpon theſe, as vpon certaine foundations, without the which they cannot in any ſort ſubſist or continue Therefore admitting that there ought to be propoſed both rewards and ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>Now then, from this it appeareth, how abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutly neceſsary to man is the indubious and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine confeſſion and acknowledgment of the being of <hi>a God.</hi> And indeed the knowledge of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and nature <hi>of mans ſoule</hi> is not much leſſe to be ſearched after: for if it could be proued that the Soule of man were mortall (as the ſoule in beasts is) the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should we not need to stand in feare of what hereafter might fall vpon vs; but we

                  </hi> being thus prepared to entertaine any religion, ſo farre forth as it forteth to the augmentation &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of their temporal eſtates. Theſe men be commonly called <hi>Polititians,</hi> in that they ſubiect all religion to policy, &amp; conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by how much the more any religion is conducing to the bettering of their political and temporall eſtate; by ſo much it is by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more eſteemed and practiſed. Among theſe men <hi>Nicholas Machiauel</hi> hath gained the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt place, as appeareth out of his books writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Italian tongue, and particulerly of that entituled <hi>de Principe,</hi> which at this day is read by many.</p>
               <p>The chiefe reaſons, whereupon this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion is grounded, are theſe following: If there were any <hi>Diuine power,</hi> by the which the world were gouerned, then would it
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2520:12"/>
follow, that improbity, wickednes, &amp; cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty ſhould not preuaile ſo much, as now it doth: neither ſhould it haue ſo proſperous ſucceſſe and euent, nor ſhould it oppreſſe and betrample with wrong the vertuous &amp; innocent, as we fynd that in all ages it hath done; ſeeing it belongeth, and is peculiarly incumbent to the office of a Gouernour, not to ſuffer the wicked to rule and ſway much, but to chaſtice them with diuers puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts; therby not only to cauſe them to ceaſe from afflicting the vertuous; but alſo by amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their manners, to affect and proſecute a vertuous life. And for example heereof, let vs ſuppoſe any one Citty, the which the worſt &amp; moſt wicked me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do daily gouerne, who without any feare of lawes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyne vpon the goodes of their neighbours, do violate and deſile the beds of others, and without reſtraint do ſatisfy their luſts in all things; who would ſay that this Citty e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Gouernour that is wiſe and prouident? Wherefore ſince in the whole world there is ſuch diſturbance of order that we can hardly conceaue a greater perturbation then it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, to wit, the religious worſhippers of God to be oppreſſed, to endure extreme want and other calamities, to liue in a deſpicable and contemned ſtate of life, and finally moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably to dy; and on the contrary ſyde, the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2520:13"/>
wicked to gouerne &amp; ſway all, to liue afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently &amp; abundantly in all riches, to inſult o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the vertuous, to wallow in ſenſuality, &amp; laſtly to haue a quyet end and death. Now who would here think (ſaith the <hi>Atheist</hi>) that <hi>Prouidence</hi> (by the which all thinges are diſpenſed, and giuen in an euen meaſure) ſhould haue any preſidency, or power in the vnequall diſpoſall of theſe worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires? For from this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and want of order, and from this confuſion of things, the former men did coniecture, that there was no ſupreme gouernour, which had any care in the diſpenſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of temporal buſines. This argument is the chiefeſt for the ſtrengthing of this moſt wicked aſſertion, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed much, not only with ſome of former auncient tymes, but alſo with diuers in our daies.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they obiect, that it is euident euen by experience it ſelfe; that mens nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations &amp; buſines receaue their ſucceſſe (for the moſt part) anſwerable to the induſtry &amp; endeauours employed in them, &amp; not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the right &amp; equity of the mater; he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce (ſay they) it procedeth, that many waging moſt iniuſt wars haue obtained the victory, either becauſe they were more numerous &amp; powerful in ſouldiers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, or in that they were more induſtrious &amp; painful in their deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2520:13"/>
In like ſort ſuch men, as maintaine vnlawful ſuites, do oftentymes by periuryes and falſe witneſſes purchaſe the ſentence of the Iudge. Finally, we find, that mens owne induſtry and laboriouſnes doth much more predominate and rule ouer all their mutuall commercements, then the prouidence or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of any higher cauſe. Al which obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations may ſeeme to intimate, that there is no ſuperiour <hi>Diuyne Power,</hi> gouerning and moderating mens actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; but that euery one is leſt to his owne particuler prouidence, and watchfullnes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we ſee that things conſiſting of nature, do euer proceed after one &amp; the ſame manner, keeping one immoueable courſe &amp; order. Thus the Sunne euer ryſeth &amp; ſetteth &amp; ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neth the ſame circles, occaſioning with his approach, the Spring and Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer; with his departure, the Autume &amp; Winter: in like ſort things natural do grow and after decay or dye, ſtill one thing begetting another without ceſſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or end, to the perpetuating of the ſame <hi>ſpecies</hi> or kind, which is a ſigne that all things are gouerned by the force of Nature, and that there is no other higher power, then <hi>Nature</hi> her ſelfe, by the which all theſe thinges are effected.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we obſerue that man is firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, formed in his mothers wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be, borne,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2520:14"/>
increaſeth, comes to his full groth or vigour, growes old and dyes after the ſame ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, as other more perfect liuing creatures do, and that he conſiſteth of the ſaid members and organs; therfore there is the like end of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s life, as of other creatures; and as they do vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly periſh away after death, ſ alſo doth man.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if there be any ſupreme ſpirit, or diuine nature, it is credible, that it doth not intermedle with mans affaires, nor buſieth it ſelfe with things done among vs. Firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, this ſeemeth vnworthy the maieſty of ſo great a Deity; for as a mighty Monarch doth not trouble himſelfe with the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler actions of his Cittizens, workemen, or bond-ſlaues, litle regarding what they ſay, thinke, or do, as houlding the care of ſuch ſmall matters to be an indignity to his regall ſtate: In lyke ſort, Men ſcorne the labour &amp; buſines of Ants or flees, as not regarding their policy or courſe they hould. But now in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference &amp; compariſon to that <hi>ſupreme power,</hi> we men are far leſſe inferiour then the Ants. Furthermore, ſeing that <hi>Diuinity</hi> is perfectly bleſſed, containing all ſufficiency within it ſelfe, and ſeeking nothing, that is extrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call or externall; why then ſhould it be ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous and carefull of our Actions? Finally the former point ſeemes true, in regard, that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:2520:14"/>
by the meanes of humane things (howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they happen) there is neither any more neere approach or further diſtance from the ſayd Deity. Other Arguments to proue the ſame (then are here alledged) I fynd none; and theſe former arguments are anſwered &amp; ſolued in the fiue laſt Chapters of this firſt booke.</p>

               <p>BVT the contrary ſentence of this poynt is to be acknowledged and ſet downe, as an inexpugnable verity; to wit, that there is <hi>a ſupreme Diuyne Power,</hi> by whoſe proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and wiſdome all things (both humane &amp; others) are gouerned, and this power we cal God.

Of the truth of which poynt this is one manifeſt ſigne, to wit, in that all theſe had their religions, their ceremonies, their temples, and their Prieſts inſtituted for the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:2520:16"/>
worſhipping of a <hi>diuyne Power.</hi> To this <hi>Power</hi> alſo they made their prayers and vowes, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vp their ſacrifices and guifts, and diuers wayes laboured to appeaſe, and pacify the wrath of the ſaid <hi>Deity.</hi> Therfore it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, that they all aſcribed to this Power, Prouidence; aſſuring themſelues, that it tooke notice of their actions, that it was able to defend them, to free them from dangers, to imparte to them thinges which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, and to take reuenge for iniuries: ſince otherwiſe they ſhould pray, &amp; offer vp ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to it in vaine, if it knew not our eſtates nor intermingled it ſelf with our eſtates, nor tooke care for vs. And hence it followeth, that this opinion of a <hi>Deity</hi> is not entertained only by force of Tradition, but is planted in the minds of al, euen by nature her ſelfe.

In things that are diuine, it is all one, the ſame actually to be, and to haue a power to be; as alſo actually not to be, or exist, and to be impoſsible to be.</hi> But how is it credible, that, that which is not only falſe, but alſo altogether impoſſible, ſhould be ſo belieued among all nations, and ſhould be ſo engrafted in the mynds of euery man, as that all men in all places ſhould (without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall helpe of inſtruction therein) enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine &amp; belieue the ſame with a vnanimous and general conſent and approbation?

That it doth not ryſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any naturall inclination of the heauens, is manifeſt; ſince things which are moued by a propenſion of nature, direct their motion vnto ſome one end, the which end once obtained, they ceaſe from further motion, and then do reſt, and are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſerued. Thus al ſublunary bodyes enioy a power and force to moue, that if chance they be taken from their naturall place, they ſtriue by motion to returne therto; and being returned do there reſt, and quietly enioy their owne being.

                  <hi>terminum. Motion is a thing imperfect in it ſelfe, as being but only away or paſſage to an end, or rest.</hi> But there is nothing, which couereth to be euer in its way or iourney (as I may cal it) but all things deſire to haſten to their <hi>termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> or end, and there to repoſe and reſt. Wherfore we may neceſſarily conclude fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the premiſes, that ſeing the motion of the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly Orbs doth not tend, nor is directed to any <hi>terminus,</hi> or end, where it may find reſt and quyet, that therefore this motion floweth not from any inclinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of nature, as the motion of all in animate things do, which we ſee in this world. This poynt is further confirmed from that, that euery na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall inclinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to motion is directed to the good of the ſubiect or body, which is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: to wit, that the body may obtaine therby its perfection and conſeruation, and is not directed to the good or benefit of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bodyes: for euery particuler thing hath therefore a force and propenſion to moue, that by ſuch a mouing, it may obtayne that place, which is moſt agreable to its nature, and ſo may firmely place it ſelfe, and reſt there, and not that by a motion it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit other bodies. But now the motion of the heauenly Orbes bringeth no perfection at all to the Orbes, or to thoſe other hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly bodies (for what doth that continual
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:2520:20"/>
rowling about of the Orbes profit, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage the Sunne, or the other ſtars?) but is only beneficiall to the inferiour bodyes, whiles by this motion it carryeth their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and influences throughout the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of the whole Orbes; and ſo by diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting them, cauſeth all things to receaue vegetation, life, increaſe, perfection, and conſeruation. Therefore it is moſt euident, that this motion of the heauens proceedeth not from any ſecret inclination of nature in them: for thoſe celeſtiall Orbes cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend or conceaue their motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to this inferiour world; that out of ſuch a charitable cogitation and thought (forſooth) they ſhould thus inceſſantly moue and turne about: for ſo to apprehend and reflect vpon the profit of another, is peculiar to a mynd and intelligence endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with reaſon.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2520:21"/>
at another fewer. From which it is eaſily gathered, that theſe ſpots do not inhere in the body of the Sunne, but are little ſtarres, which interpoſe themſelues betweene the Sunne and our ſight, and are moued in <hi>Epicycles</hi> about the body of the Sunne. I my ſelfe haue often obſerued theſe varieties, with wonderfull admiration of the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and power of God; who hath diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the courſe of the ſtarres with that ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious art and skill, as that they are in no ſort ſubiect to the apprehenſion of mans vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding. I here omit the infinite mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Starres, which (being neuer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered to the Aſtronomers vntill this tyme) are by the helpe of the foreſaid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument moſt diſtinctly ſeene in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens.</p>
               <p>To co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, in the eight Sphere (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the fixed Starres are) there is obſerued a triple motion. The firſt from the Faſt to the Weſt, abſoluing its whole courſe in 24. houres. The ſecond from the Weſt to the Eaſt, which is thought to go one degree in a hundred yeares. The third from the South to the North, and contrariwiſe; by force of which motion the beginning of <hi>Aries</hi> &amp; <hi>Libra</hi> of the eight Sphere doth deſcrybe certaine ſmall circles about the beginning of <hi>Aries</hi> and <hi>Libra</hi> of the ninth Sphere;

which courſe is perfected in 7000. yeares.

               <p>IN the whole courſe of the nature of things, there muſt needes be ſome one cauſe, of which all thereſt, in reſpect of their ſubſtance, do depend: and that we call God. That there is ſuch a cauſe is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, in that corporeall and bodily things do proceed either from themſelues, or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually from <hi>fortune,</hi> or from ſome incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall cauſe endued with a mynd, vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and reaſon.

               <p>Now, it is manifeſt, that things haue their beginning neither from themſelues, nor
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:2520:23"/>
from <hi>Chance</hi> or <hi>fortune;</hi> therfore it followeth neceſſarily, that they receaue their produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and being from ſome Mynd or Spirit endued with reaſon.</p>
               <p>That they proceed not from Chance, to wit, from a caſuall concourſe of <hi>Atomies,</hi> or ſmal bodies, as <hi>Democritus, Epicurus, Lucretius</hi> and ſome other did teach, appeareth both from the ſtructure and forme of all things in the world; as alſo from the great order and conſtancy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is diſcouered in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the heauens, and in the function &amp; office of other things: for what man, that is endued with reaſon, will be perſwaded, that thoſe thinges, whoſe making are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the fulnes of all reaſon, &amp; in that reſpect exceedeth the wit of all art and knowledge, ſhould notwithſtanding be produced of a meere caſual concourſe of <hi>Atomies</hi> without reaſon, and without art?

               <p>That the world and the parts thereof cannot receaue their being from themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, is no leſſe euident.

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:2520:24"/>
cannot be of themſelues; for how can thoſe things receaue their being fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> themſelues,<note place="margin">Man and liuing Creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.</note> which need a preparation and concourſe of ſo many cauſes, that they may be borne; and ſo many externall helpes and further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, that they may liue? Or how can that be of it ſelfe, which is extinguiſhed &amp; peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with ſo great a facility? Here perhaps it may be replyed, that thoſe bodies, which be <hi>Indiuidua,</hi> as particuler men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are not of themſelues, but that the humane nature in generall (as being eternall, or for euer) is of it ſelfe: and that the like may be ſaid of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Species,</hi> or kindes of things. But this is ſpoken ignorantly; ſeeing the <hi>Species</hi> of any creature, or body is not a thing ſeparated from the <hi>Indiuidua</hi> (as certaine <hi>Platonickes</hi> dreamed) but doth exiſt in the <hi>Indiuidua;</hi> neither hath it any <hi>eſſe,</hi> or being, in <hi>rerum natura,</hi> but only by reaſon of the <hi>Indiuidua.</hi> Yea for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, <hi>ſpecies humana,</hi> or the whole kynd of men, is nothing els, but the whole multitude of particuler men, which haue beene, are, and may be, as they all beare a liknes of nature among themſelues. Now then if Indiuiduall and particuler Men do depend of another cauſe, then muſt alſo the whole <hi>Species</hi> or kynd (which is not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed <hi>à parte rei</hi> (as the Philoſophers ſpeake) from the <hi>Indiuidua</hi>) depend alſo of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:2520:24"/>
another cauſe. This point is further mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, in that the whole <hi>Species,</hi> or kynd may vtterly be extinguiſhed or periſhd. But what dependeth not of another, but hath it being only of it ſelfe, cannot be extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: for what is of it ſelfe, did neuer begin, but had euer its <hi>exiſtency;</hi> and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ceaſe or deſiſt to be. That it neuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, is proued, in that what once did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, ſometimes was not, and therefore it is produced (as the phraſe is) <hi>à non eſle, ad eſſe,</hi> from the not being of a thing, to the being of the thing it ſelfe. Now, a thing cannot produce or cauſe it ſelfe; and the reaſon is, becauſe that which doth produce, ought to precede or go before, that therby it may draw that, which is to be produced <hi>à non eſle, ad eſſe.</hi> Therefore whatſoeuer begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth once to be, is produced of another, &amp; conſequently receaueth not it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s being of it ſelf; for to haue its being of it ſelfe, is to haue its eſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce without the influxe of any other efficient cauſe. Therefore it is auident that what is of it ſelfe, did neuer begin, &amp; the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore ſhall neuer end; and on the contrary ſyde, what did begin hath not its being from it ſelfe, but is neceſſarily produced of another.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, euery thing compounded<note place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes.</note> of matter and forme, cannot be of it ſelfe,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:2520:25"/>
but neceſſarily is produed of ſome efficient cauſe, which muſt diſpoſe the matter, and produce the forme, and ioyne the forme to the matter; for the matter neither recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth thoſe diſpoſitions, nor the forme from its owne eſſence (ſince they may be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated) therefore this vnion of the matter &amp; the forme is occaſioned by ſome extrinſecal cauſe. The ſame may be ſaid of euery thing conſiſting of parts, for ſeing the parts are not through any neceſſity vnited among themſelues, but may be mutually ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one from another, it muſt needes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that this vnion proceedeth from ſome cauſe, which ioyned the parts togeather.</p>
               <p>From theſe premiſes afore, it appeareth, that alſo the Elements, (as the earth, the water, the ayre, and the fire) are not of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but haue ſome efficient begining: for if thoſe things, which are moſt perfect for their nature (among theſe ſublunary bodyes) haue not their being from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but from ſome other cauſe; then much more thoſe bodies which are moſt imperfect (as the Elements are) muſt for their being depend of another: for to be of it ſelfe, and not to depend of another, is a ſigne of greateſt perfection; ſeing, what is thus in nature, is to it ſelfe the origen and fountaine of all good, and ſtandeth not in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:2520:25"/>
need of any thing externall. Furthermore the Elements are not for themſelues, but for others; I meane as they are parts of the world, and as they afford matter to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded bodyes, therfore they haue not their being from themſelues; for that Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome in Philoſophy is true, to wit: <hi>Quod habet cauſam finalem, ad quam ordinetur, habet etiam efficientem, à qua ordinetur. What hath a final cauſe, to the which it is directed and ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the ſame hath alſo an efficient cauſe, by the which it is ſo ordained;</hi> for nothing is of it ſelfe, to the end that it may ſerue another, but that it may enioy it ſelfe. Therefore euen in this reſpect, that any thing is, <hi>non propter ſe, ſed propter aliud,</hi> not for it owne ſelf, but that it may conduce and be ſeruiceable to ſome other thing; it followeth that the ſame thing is ordained by ſome one, which hath intended the good of another. Beſides, in that the Eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts do enioy this or that mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude or greatnes, this place or that place, in reſpect of the whole ſpace and place in the world, they receaue not this from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues (ſeing their eſſence neceſſarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acteth none of theſe circumſtances) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they take them from ſome extrinſecall cauſe, which appointeth to euery one of the Elements their meaſure or greatnes, &amp; their place or ſituation. To conclude, the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:2520:26"/>
Elements are ſubiect to ſo many mutations and changes, and to ſo great a need of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall cauſes, as that in regard hereof how can it be poſſibly conceaued, that they ſhould be of themſelues, or be at their owne fredome and liberty, and in reſpect of their being not, to depend of another? Theſe former reaſons do conuince, that <hi>Materia pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Materia Prima.</note> (whereof the Philoſophers do teach, that all things were firſt made) hath not its being from it ſelfe, but from ſome other cauſe. For this <hi>Materia prima</hi> either is not diſtinguiſhed from the Elements (as many auncient Philoſophers did ſhould, who taught that the Elements are mere ſimple bodies, without compoſition of matter or forme, and the laſt ſubiect of all former) or els if it be diſtinguiſhed from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> with his followers maintained) then is it far more imperfect then the Elements, as ſeruing but for their matter, whereof they are made. Therefore ſeing this <hi>Materia prima</hi> is moſt imperfect and next to <hi>Nothing,</hi> being ſubiect to all mutations, and (as it were) a ſeruant to all natural cauſes, and being of it owne nature depriued of all forme, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to be inueſted, and borrowing all its perfection from other things, it therefore cannot haue its being of it ſelfe, &amp; indepe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:2520:26"/>Now then from all this heretofore obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, it followeth demonſtratiuely, that no Sublunary body hath its being and eſſence from it ſelfe, but that all things receaue their being from ſome efficient cauſe.</p>
               <p>Now, that this cauſe is incorporeall and intelligent, or enioying Reaſon and Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, appeareth ſeuerall waies: firſt becauſe <hi>Materia prima</hi> could not be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by any corporeall cauſe; ſeing that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery action of a corporeall thing euer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſeth the ſubiect, into the which it is receaued (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> and all Philoſophers do teach,) but before <hi>Materia Prima</hi> was, no ſubiect can be imagined, ſeing it was the firſt, and (as I may tearme it) the deepeſt, and moſt fundamentall ſubiect. Againe, if this Cauſe were corporeall, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doubtleſly the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſhould be this Cauſe, ſince there remaineth no other corporeal Cauſe, to the which it may be aſcribed: But the heauens could not produce this <hi>Materia prima,</hi> both by reaſon that the Heauens worke not, but by the mediation of light &amp; influence of the ſtars, both which qualities require a ſubiect into the which they may be recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; as alſo becauſe before this production, the whole ſpace, in which now the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are, was voyde, as being deſtitute of any corporeall body; and then it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth,

that the heauens ſhould produce this <hi>Materia prima in vacuo,</hi> not hauing any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent ſubiect matter to worke vpon, and therefore ſhould create it of nothing; but this doth tranſcend the power and force of any corporall nature: Therefore in regard of this abſurdity it followeth, that the cauſe of this <hi>Materia prima</hi> muſt be incorporall and moſt powerfull, as being able to giue it an eſſence and being, euen from nothing.</p>
               <p>From which Collection it further follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, that this cauſe ought to be alſo intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, as knowing what it doth or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth; both becauſe euery incorporall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is intelligent (as the Philoſophers teach) as alſo in that it did not produce this <hi>Materia prima,</hi> after a blynd and ignorant manner, but with a certaine finall intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and determination, to wit, that of it all other things ſhould be made, and that it ſhould be the ſubiect of all formes. This poynt is made further euident, in that to a cauſe, which is ſo perfect, high and potent, the moſt perfect manner of working is to be giuen; but the moſt perfect manner is by the vnderſtanding and the will.

I meane when the cauſe is of a different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the effect.

               <p>That the heauenly bodies haue not their<note place="margin">The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Orbes.</note> being from themſelues, appeareth firſt from their motions; for if their motions do depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of ſome other ſuperiour Cauſe (and that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall) as is afore proued, then can it be but acknowledged, that their ſubſtance and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure are produced of the ſame cauſe; for who is ſo voyd of conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as to thinke, that that Supreme cauſe ſhould enter into the world (as into an ample and maiſterles houſe, wherunto it can pretend no right or title) and ſhould challenge to it ſelfe the gouernment thereof?

Or what greater prints, or intimations of Omnipotency can be, then theſe are? If any one of the ſtarres ſhould be carryed about neare vnto the earth with the like ſpeed, preſently all things would be diſſipated &amp; ſhiuered aſunder: the mountaines would be ſhaken and pulled vp, as it were by the roots, and turned with the earth, and the ſea into very duſt.

Now the celerity &amp; ſpeed of the fixed ſtarres about the Equinoctiall is forty tymes greater, then the celerity of the Sunne. Therefore that incorporeal po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and vertue, which doth ſo gouerne &amp; ſterne the celeſtiall Orbes, as that it is able to driue them about with ſuch a facility, with ſuch an incomprehenſible velocity, and ſo long a tyme without any ſlacknes, or wearines, doth ſufficiently diſcouer it ſelfe to be the maker and Lord of the ſaid hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, to whoſe good pleaſure they are ſo ſeruiceable and obedient; and thus it appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>areth that from whence they receaue their moſt wonderfull motion, from the ſame cauſe alſo they take their nature and being. Doubtleſly no man who entreth into a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conſideration hereof, can be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe perſwaded; ſeing there cannot be a greater argument and ſigne, that a body is not of it ſelfe, but dependeth of another, then to ſhew, that it enioyeth not it ſelfe, but is made ſeruiceable and obedient to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
               <p>The ſame poynt is alſo proued from the

conſideration of the diuerſity of the parts, wherof theſe Orbes do conſiſt.

For the making of euery one of theſe ſmall creatures is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their owne kynd ſo perfect, ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, and ſo beautifull, as that if the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedome of all men liuing were contracted in one, and gathered together, it could not find any one part, which might be corrected or amended; and which is more, it were not able in its owne retyred thought and imagination to apprehend the reaſon, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and prouidence, which appeare in the ſtructure in any of al theſe or other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Wherupon we may further infer, that ſuppoſing any one man were ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull and mighty, as that he were able inſtantly to make or produce outwardly, what he did conceaue inwardly in his mynd; yet could he not forme any one flye (bycauſe he could not comprehend the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the outward and inward ſtructure &amp; compoſition of the ſaid flye) much leſſe could he animate it, or giue the vigour of ſenſe and motion, or plant in it phantaſy,

In like ſort in the ſenſitiue ſoule (which animateth all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Creatures) the whole reaſon of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricke or forme of the body lyes hidden &amp; imperceptible by the eye; the ſame is alſo latent in the genitall vertue or power, by the which all theſe things are formed.

               <p>Furthermore, in the ſenſitiue ſoule is not only comprehended the entyre reaſon of the ſtructure of the body, but alſo of all the ſenſes, the imagination, the ſenſitiue appetite, all naturall inſtincts and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, euery one of which, in reſpect of the wonders diſcouered therin, tranſcends ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s apprehenſion.

               <p>But now to ſpeake ſomething of the <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſoule;</hi> it tranſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth in beauty, worke and dignity the former by infinite degrees, in the which not only the reaſon of the ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture or making of the body, and of all the ſenſes, but alſo the faculty of vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, of recordation or remembring, and of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing or reiecting any thing freely (in the which is included true electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; freedome of will) is contained. By the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the ſoule co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceaueth the whole world, and frameth to it ſelfe certaine inuiſible i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages or pictures (as it were) of al things. By the memory, it retaineth al thoſe images
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:2520:37"/>
of things wrought by the vnderſtanding, and when occaſion is miniſtred, it maketh practiſe and vſe of them. Now, how vaſt &amp; ſpacious are thoſe entrances, which are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſo innumerable formes? By the will, the ſoule taketh fruition of all things, &amp; diſpoſeth of them according to its beſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, yea (and which is more) it maketh to it ſelfe election, or choyce of any courſe of life. Neither is the difference here much to be regarded, whether the ſoule perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth al theſe things immediatly by its ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſubſtance, or by diſtinct faculties &amp; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, ſeing the reaſon of all theſe are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in its ſimple eſſence. Therfore it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily followeth, that the reaſonable Soule is of wonderfull pulchritude, ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, and perfection; in ſo much, that if it were to be knowne perfectly, as it is in it ſelfe, it would ſeeme to be a kynd of diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; in the contemplation whereof, the mind would be (as it were) abſorpt and ſwallowed vp with an incredible pleaſure &amp; delight; ſeing the eſſence of it ſurpaſſeth by many degrees all corporeall things; as alſo the vegetatiue and ſenſitiue ſoules of Plants and liuing creatures, in worth and dignity.</p>
               <p>Therefore out of the premiſes we may gather, that there are foure degrees of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:2520:37"/>
of things in this world; The firſt (which is loweſt) is of bodyes, which are <hi>ſeene by the ye;</hi> the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of the <hi>vegetatiue</hi> ſoule; the third of the <hi>ſenſitiue ſoule;</hi> the fourth of the <hi>Rationall, or reaſonable</hi> ſoule. Therefore it is euident, that not only the firſt, but alſo the reſt are formed by ſome moſt prudent and skilful <hi>intelligence or mind.</hi> For if the beauty, which is found in bodyes, be to be aſcribed to ſome ſuch ſpirit or diuine power, for the wonderful proportions appearing in them: then much more the glorious fayreneſſe, which is in the ſeuerall kynds of ſoules, which comprehends in it ſelfe the reaſon and cauſe of the bodyes beauty, and which is much more admirable then it, ought to be refered to the ſame celeſtiall power.</p>
               <p>Furthermore I would here dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, how it can poſſibly happen, that any cauſe not capable of reaſon, wiſedome, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, could forme and make in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, ſo many diuerſities of vegetatiue and ſenſitiue ſoules; ſeing euery one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is ſo a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

To conclude; All the pulchritude and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of an Effect, ought to be contained in
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:2520:38"/>
the cauſe; (for the cauſe cannot giue that to the Effect, which it ſelfe enioyeth not) wherupon it followeth, that all the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of liuing creatures, and all the vigour and naturall working of the ſenſes, ought to be comprehended within that cauſe, by the which they were firſt framed: and this not after the ſame manner, as they are in the creatures, but after a more excellent &amp; eminent ſort, to wit, as the worke is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the mynd, or art of the workeman. This poynt is further confirmed, in that there is no cauſe (excepting a mynd or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence) in the which ſo great a diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of things can reſt; but in a mynd or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence it may well reſide; euen as the forme of a houſe, and all the meaſures and proportions of it are ſaid to be in the phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſy or vnderſtanding of the artificer.</p>
               <p>Ad heereto for the greater acceſſe &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of reaſon herein, that himſelfe who framed the ſoule of man, endewing it with reaſon, vnderſtanding, and frewill, cannot poſſibly want reaſon, vnderſtanding and frewill; but muſt haue them in more perfect and excellent manner.

The Sunne, excelling in fayreneſſe all viſible things, is not for it ſelfe (for it can not apprehend, or reflect vpon its owne beauty) but for the good &amp; benefit of other things, to wit, that it may enlighten the world, and cheriſh al things with its heat; not much vnlike, as the hart is in man, and other liuing creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, which is not for it ſelfe, but for the good of the whole body; for as the heart is in the body endued with life, ſo the Sunne is in the whole body of the world, which wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth life. This then being thus, the Sunne ought to haue a certaine proportionable meaſure of light, and quantity, as alſo a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate place in the world, leaſt that the light being ouer radiant, ſhyning and great,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:2520:39"/>
or it ſelf in place ouer neere, it ſhould burne the earth; or on the contrary ſide the light being too remiſſe &amp; ſmal, or too far of from the earth, ſhould not ſufficiently lighten it, or heat it. Now, this diſpoſition of a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting quantity, light, and place, cannot be aſſigned by any, but only by ſuch a mynd or ſpirit, as is able to conſider the end and the meanes, and of iudgment to ſet downe a ſorting and conuenient proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them.</p>
               <p>But if the Sunne be made not for it ſelfe, but for ſome external end, then much more the ſame may be verifyed of the reſt of the<note place="margin">The ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, the Orbs and all other bodyes created for the vſe of a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſoule.</note> ſtarres, of the heauenly Orbes, and of all other corporeal natural bodyes. This poynt may be further fortifyed by this enſuing reaſon: <hi>That, which is for its owne ſelfe, ought to be of that excellency and perfection, as nothing can be more excellent, for the good whereof this other may be ordained;</hi> This is euident euen in reaſon, ſince otherwiſe it ſhould not be for it ſelf, but for that, for the benefit wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is diſpoſed. Furthermore it ought <hi>to be of ſuch a nature, as that it may conceaue &amp; enioy its owne goodnes;</hi> for if it hath no ſenſe &amp; fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling hereof, it is nothing aduantaged by ſuch its excellency<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For what can the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and gouerment of the whole earth profit a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if he neither can take any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:2520:40"/>
therby, nor knoweth that he hath ſuch a principality, or rule belonging vnto him? Therefore it is an euident ſigne, that, what ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not perceaue its owne good, is not made for it ſelfe, but for ſome other thing, to the which it becomes profitable. But to apply this now; no corporeall nature is ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, but it may be ordained to ſome other thing more excellent &amp; more worthy; for the degree of a reaſonable nature tranſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds and exceeds much in worth the degree of a corporeall Nature, and this to the former for many vſes becomes ſeruiceable. Againe a corporeal nature cannot haue any feeling of its owne good, but reſteth only in being profitable and expedient for ſome other thing: Therefore it followeth, that not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall or bodily nature is made for it ſelfe, but euen of its eſſence &amp; being, is ordained to ſome other thing, to wit, to a reaſonable nature, for whoſe behoofe and good it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſteth. From which it may be gathered, that if there were no reaſonable nature, then all the corporeall nature ſhould exiſt, as in vayne &amp; bootles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as not being able to bring any benefit to it ſelfe, or to any other thing; euen as the fruition of great riches ſhould be altogeather vnprofitable, if the man poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them, ſhould haue neither knowledge, vſe, nor feeling of them.</p>

Therefore the <hi>earth</hi> ought to be vnder the waters, and the waters ſpecially to be po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wred

about it. But we ſee that theſe two Elements are far otherwiſe ſituated: for a huge portion of the earth, to wit, all that which is not couered with the ſea, and all the immenſe weight and heape of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, is far higher, and more remote from the Center, then the water is. For there ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a mighty vaſt channell through the middeſt of the earth of an infinite profundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, deuided into ſeuerall paſſages, which running diuers wayes and in ſome places of greater breadth, in others of leſſer, do make Ilands. Into this channell all the Element of water is receaued (that only excepted, which being extenuated and made thin, turneth into vapours) that ſo the earth as free from being couered with water, might be made ſeruiceable for the habitation of men and other creatures, and for the groth and increaſe of things.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the <hi>Earth</hi> is ſo faſhioned and brought into that forme, that from the ſea towards the mediterranean places, it by<note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Earth.</note> inſenſible degrees lifteth it ſelfe vp, &amp; riſeth higher, vntill it end into mountaines and rockes: in which poynt conſiſteth a moſt admirable art of the <hi>diuyne Prouidence.</hi> For firſt by this ſtructure of the Earth, it is made free from all perillous inundations, which by little and little, and in long proceſſe of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:2520:45"/>
tyme by tne influence of the ſtarres, or force of the wynds might endanger al the Earth. For we ſee by experience, that ſuch borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring parts of the earth, as are neere to the ſea, and do not much exceed the Sea in height, are often vtterly ouerflowed with the deaths of the Inhabitants, and loſſe of all goods. Furthermore if this eaſy aſcent &amp; ryſing of the Earth were not, there could not be any riuers: for if the <hi>ſuperficies</hi> of the earth were equally diſtant from the <hi>Center,</hi> (as in a globe perfectly round) then would there be no fall of riuers; for the water can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not flow, except it fynd places more low and neere to the Center: And if the Earth ſhould ſuddenly be lifted vp into ſteepe heights, then would the fall of riuers be more impetuous and violent, then were requiſite; neither could riuers being ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitious and downfall be commodious to mans vſe; neither could they runne conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually through defect of matter. I here o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the danger of inundations, which often do chance (to the great loſſe and detriment of the inhabitants) when abundance of raine aud melted ſnow being gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, do ſuddenly and precipitantly fall from ſome great height. Therfore the Earth ought to ryſe in height by little and little, and by inſenſible increaſings from the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:2520:46"/>
mouthes of the riuers (where they runne and diſgorge themſelues into the ſea) euen to their ſprings and to other mediterranean places. Now if we inſiſt in the ſpeculation<note place="margin">Mountai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> of <hi>mountaines,</hi> we ſhall fynd; that in nature there is no neceſſity of them, but only for the behoofe and benefit of man. For they firſt ſerue to breake the force of wynds, which might be very domageable to all creatures, if all coaſts were plaine &amp; euen, and no hinderance were interpoſed to ſlac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken their ſtrength. Hence it proceedeth, that wynds are more impetuous and boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous in the open Sea, where all is plaine and eauen without any obſtacle, then in the middle places of the Earth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Mountaynes &amp; high hils ſerue for bounds of regions and kingdomes, for they are (as it were) the limits or cloſures of great kingdomes, by the which the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of men and deſire of further enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their Regality is bridled and reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, leaſt it ſhould inceſſantly exerciſe it ſelfe in vexing and ſubduing their borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring neighbours.

That this reaſon is moſt inſufficient, is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: for how ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bottome or the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vnder the ſea (being couered with ſuch an infinite ſtore of waters, that in ſome places it is 500. or a thouſand cubits deepe) be ſo burnt by the Sunne, as that from them all the whole ſea ſhould contract ſuch a bryny ſaltnes? For the Sunne burneth not but only by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of its light, which light doth not penetrate in the water further then 15. cubits (as diuers Swimmers vnder water affirme) and the light is ſo faynt, that the heat thereof can hardly be felt, but a little vnder the water. Now, that ſaltnes ſhould proceed of aduſtion, it is required, that the aduſtion be ſo great, as that it diſſolueth the matter, &amp; reduceth it to its beginning, as experience ſhoweth. Neither doth adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion and burning properly cauſe ſalt in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, but rather openeth and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth it; And therefore we ſee, that of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall bodyes the ſalt is ſeuerall, and taketh its ſeuerall vertues &amp; operations from the bodyes ſo ſtrayned &amp; refyned, as the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mickes do experimentally proue. In like manner the ſpirit of euery thing (or the oyle which is extracted out of it by fyre) doth aforehand lye hidden in the thing it ſelfe. Furthermore if ſalſity or brynenes proceed

To conclude the increaſe of this ſaltnes in the Sea would be noted at leaſt in ſeuerall ages, but no ſuch augmentation hath hitherto bene obſerued. Of the lyke improbability is that ſentence, of the firſt origin <hi>of mountaynes,</hi> which teacheth, that the firſt proceeded of Earthquakes, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that the ayre, and other ſuch ſpirituall ſubſtance, which being included in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels of the earth, did aduance and lift vp the higher part therof.

               <p>Our body conſiſteth of <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>moiſture;</hi> The heat dayly conſumeth and ſpendeth<note place="margin">How the ſpirits are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed through out the body.</note> the moiſture, vapouring it away into ayre; as the like appeareth by water expoſed to the Sunne, or to fyer, which by little and little vaniſheth away.

The immediate &amp; next nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of the body is blood; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is requiſite, that blood be diſtributed through the body, that all parts of it be nouriſhed therewith. The Liuer is the ſhop (as it were) of bloud. Therefore from the Liuer there are drawne two great veynes, the one going vpwards, the other down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards<note place="margin">The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the bloud.</note> the body; both which do after bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch and diuyde themſelues into ſeuerall leſſer veynes; theſe againe into leſſer and leſſer, till they end in moſt ſmall veynes, and to the eye ſcarce viſible.

them they are terminated and implanted. Seing then that there are aboue ſix hundred muſcles, and that for the moſt part many ſmall veynes do run into euery muſcle, it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe, that beſides thoſe inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible veynes (which for their ſmalnes are called <hi>venae capillares,</hi> as reſembling in qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Now by this meanes it is effected, that there is not the leaſt part of the body, but there is nouriſhment brought to it.

with bloud, for the more eaſy diſtribution of it, which humour after is either diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into ayre through heat, or els is purged away through ſweat. The blood is alſo mingled with a little gall for the more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuating and making it thin, leſt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it ſhould coagulate and thicken.

               </p>
               <p>In bones, muſcles, bowels, ſinewes, veynes, arteryes, membranes, and griſles, there is <hi>vis aſsimulatrix,</hi> an aſſimulating po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer; by the which all theſe parts do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert<note place="margin">The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the vitall ſpirits</note> the nouriſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſent to them into their owne ſubſtance, nature, and kynd.</p>
               <p>As the Liuer doth ſuppeditate and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter blood to all parts of the body, with the which it is nouriſhed, as alſo naturall ſpirits; ſo the <hi>hart</hi> doth giue heat and vitall ſpirits, by the which the natiue heat is che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, ventilated, and cooled: to which end there proceed from the hart two <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> the one going vpward, the other dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neward; both which deuyde themſelues into many branches, and theſe againe into other leſſer, vntill they end in moſt ſmall <hi>fibrae,</hi> iuſt after the manner of the veynes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue

From the head, it (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accompanied with the two foreſaid skins) is extended through the ſpine of the backe; from the <hi>ſpina dorſi,</hi> or ridgbone of the backe, it goeth into the ſinews, which being diſperſed throughout the whole body, are implanted and inſerted into all the muſcles.</p>

Some of thoſe plants (which aſcending high are through their height weake) do either fold themſelues about ſome other thing (as hope, Iuy, and many other ſuch like plants) or els they haue certaine wynding twigs or ſtringes, wherwith (as with hands) they take hold of ſtaues or ſuch things, ſet purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely to ſupport them, that they fall not; as Vynes, Pompions, and ſome others.

                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:2520:65"/>Now from all theſe foreſaid ſpeculations I conclude, that ſeing the parts of liuing cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aures and of Plants haue a double end; the one as they are <hi>parts,</hi> of which the forme &amp; ſtructure of the <hi>whole</hi> dependeth; the other as they are organs and inſtruments ordained for certaine functions neceſſary to the ſafety of the whole; and to both theſe ends they are made ſo apt and proportionable, as that it cannot be conceaued, how more exactly and wonderfully they could be framed; it is therefore euident, that all thoſe parts were made by ſome one <hi>ſupreme</hi> and moſt <hi>wiſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or intelligence,</hi> who firſt conceaued in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe all theſe ends, and conſidered aforeha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the meanes beſt ſorting to the ſaid ends.

               <p>VVE haue proued in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Chapters, that there is a <hi>diuyne Power,</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the nature and diſpoſition of the parts of the world, &amp; from the ſtructure &amp; making of liuing Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures and plants; Now, in this place we will demonſtrate the ſame from this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that all things do worke for ſome one end or other. For there is nothing idle
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:2520:66"/>
in the world, all things tend &amp; direct their operations and working to ſome end, and that to the benefit of the worker, or of ſome other. And they incline and bend to their ends ſo ordinatly, and with ſuch conuenient wayes and paſſages, as that it cannot be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by any art whatſoeuer. Wherfore ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the things themſelues can neither per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the ends, wherunto they are directed, neither the meanes, nor the proportion of the meanes, by the which they are directed; it is therefore moſt certaine, that all things are directed by ſome <hi>ſuperiour Power,</hi> who ſeeth and conſidereth both the meanes and the ends. For it is impoſſible, that a thing ſhould particulerly &amp; ordinatly in its owne operation ayme at one certaine end, except it either knoweth the end, and the meanes conducing to the ſaid end, that ſo by this knowledge it may guyde its operation, or at leaſt be directed by ſome other, which knoweth all theſe things. Thus (for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) a Clocke, whoſe end is the diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing the houres of the day, becauſe it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knoweth this end, nor is of power to diſpoſe it ſelfe to this end, is therfore neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily to be directed by ſome vnderſtanding mynd, which knoweth theſe things, and can make diſtinction of houres.</p>
               <p>That all things tend to ſome one end or

other, firſt it is euident in the <hi>motion</hi> of the Heauens, and in the illumination &amp; influx of the ſtars, and in the fecundity and fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the ſea and earth (as is ſhewed afore.)

euery thing by little and little, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing each part its due figure, meaſure, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion and connexion with other parts: ſo as from the ſeauenth day after the conceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the forme of the whole body and diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all parts euen of the fingers, doth appeare. Now how manifold and various is this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in framing of ſo many bones, veynes, arteryes, ſinewes, and Muſcles, in the apt diſtribution, deduction, or drawing out, &amp; termination or ending of euery part, each of them keeping its due forme, temper, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, place, ioyning together and inciſion?

If an indigeſted &amp; informed heape of ſtones, tyles, lyme and wood ſhould begin to make to it ſelfe a houſe, directing it ſelfe in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, and framing all parts thereof, as the Art of Architecture requyreth, who would not affirme that a certaine Vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, skilful of building, were inuiſibly and latently in the ſaid things, that they could ſo artificially diſpoſe themſelues? Or if a
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:2520:68"/>
penſill being imbued with diuerſe colours, ſhould moue it ſelfe, and firſt ſhould but ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely draw the lineaments of a mans face, &amp; after ſhould perfect euery part therof by fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the eyes, drawing the cheeks, figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the noſe, mouth, eares, and the other parts (ſeruing in them all a due proportion, and fitting colours, as the exact ſcience of painting requireth;) no man would doubt, but that this penſill were directed herein by an intelligent ſpirit. But now, in the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of euery liuing Creature far greater art and wit is deſired, then in any humane worke whatſoeuer; ſince the skill whereof tranſcendeth by many degrees all mans skill and artifice; for it arriueth to that height of perfection, as that the worke cannot in that kynd be poſſibly bettered; neither can the parts of it (whether internall or externall) haue a more pleaſing proportion and conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion. Therefore who is ſo voyd of Reaſon, that can enter into any dubious and vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine conſideration with himſelfe, whether all this molition and labourſome endeauour in framing a liuing Creature be directed by a power indued with reaſon &amp; wiſedome, or no?</p>
               <p>Furthermore, there are three things here to be conſidered, among which there ought to be a great proportion; to wit the <hi>Soule</hi> of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:2520:69"/>
the liuing Creature, the <hi>body,</hi> and the <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>vertue.</hi> And firſt, the Soule ought to be moſt proportionable to the body. For ſuch ought the ſmall body of any little Creature to be, as the <hi>Anima</hi> or ſoule of the ſame doth require to performe its proper functions; wherfore how great the difference is of Soules, ſo great alſo the diſcrepancy is of bodyes, if we inſiſt in the figure, the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature, and the conformation of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans; therefore in the nature of euery ſoule the whole formall reaſon is contained, ſo as that if a man did perfectly know the nature of the ſoule, from it he might eaſily collect, what the habit, figure, and temperature of the body ought to bee. But who is ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the nature thereof, muſt conſequently be ignorant of the other; for in ſome one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular or other he ſhall euer be wanting, and neuer attaine to the due proportion in knowledge thereof. As for example, if the queſtion be touching the ſmall body of a flye, how many feet it ought to haue, how many flexures or bendings in their legs, or thighes, what difference betwene euery flexure, what temperature, proportion &amp; connexion; how many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inews in euery thigh, how many veines, what proportion to its little nayles; of which things many are for their ſmalnes not to bee diſcerned by the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:2520:69"/>
eye: for in the ſmall body of the flye, there may be found ſeuerall thouſands of propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as neceſſary, that its ſoule may rightly ſort to the body; to all which no man can attaine, except the firſt doth penetrate and conſider in his mynd the nature of the ſoule, in the which the reaſon of all theſe (as in the root) doth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y hidden and ſecret. Againe the <hi>Seminal power</hi> ought to haue moſt perfect proportion with the body, that it may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch a body in al reſpects, as that ſoule doth require. Therefore, who firſt cauſed and made this ſeminall power, ought afore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hand to haue the whole ſtructure of the body exactly knowne vnto him, that ſo he might ſute and proportion this ſeminall ſeed to the body. For as in the ſoule (as in the finall cauſe) the whole reaſon of the fabrick of the body lyeth, and therefore the body ought in a perfect proportion to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated, and made fit to the ſoule; In like ſort the reaſon of the making of the ſame i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

clearly demonſtrated, that theſe three, to wit the <hi>Soule</hi> of euery liuing Creature, the ſtructure of the <hi>body,</hi> and the <hi>ſeminall vertue,</hi> haue their ſource from one and the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; which beginning cannot be any nature depriued of reaſon &amp; vnderſtanding: ſeing a beginning voyd of reaſon could not among different things ſet downe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous proportions; much leſſe ſo exact and ſo infinite proportions, as are betweene the body and the ſoule, and the ſeminall vertue and the making or fabricke of the body. For to performe this, requireth a moſt perfect and diſtinct knowledge.

               <p>The reaſon, why this ſeminall vertue might ſeeme to be indued with a mynd or<note place="margin">The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall vertue is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>yne Art.</note> vnderſtanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is, becauſe this vertue is a certaine impreſſion, and (as it were) a foot ſtep of the diuyne art and skil; and therefore it worketh, as if it had a particuler art and knowledge in working. Euen as if a painter could impreſſe in his penſill a permanent power and vertue of his art, and that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the penſill ſhould moue it ſelfe, and draw the images, as if there were an art and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:2520:70"/>
vnderſtanding in the Penſill. Furthermore it may be here preſumed, that this <hi>diuyue ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> or <hi>Intelligence</hi> doth conſerue this impreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with his continuall influxe, and doth coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate with it thus working with his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall concourſe.</p>
               <p>Euen as in liuing creatures theſe three, to wit the Soule, the body, and the ſeminall vertue do meet and conſpire together in a wonderfull proportion; ſo do they a like in euery kind of Plant: for in the <hi>Anima</hi> and ſoule of euery plant the whole reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſtructure of the body of the Plant, as alſo of the leaues, flowers, and fruite is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
               <p>The like may be ſaid of the ſeminall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. For the forme or ſoule of the Plant is a thing ſimple and vncompounded, &amp; ſuch alſo is the ſeminall vertue. For the whole difference, &amp; the whole multitude of figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, colours, ſmels, lynes and proportions, which is diſcerned, either externally in the body of the Plant, or in the leaues, flowers, fruits, rootes, barke, or iuyce and marrow, proceeds from the ſeminall vertue &amp; from the forme or ſoule of the Plant: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all theſe things are internally after a ſimple and inuifible ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner moſt ſtrangely contained in them both. If therefore flowers do appeare externally faire to the eye, and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:2520:71"/>
admirable for their great variety of figures colours, and proportions; then how much more fayre and pleaſing is the <hi>internall forme</hi> (to wit the ſoule) and the <hi>ſeminall vertue,</hi> from which all that viſible beauty floweth, and in the which after a wonderfull parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer and ineffable ſort it is wholy contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?</p>
               <p>Neither do only the ſeeds of things (which worketh after a naturall manner, &amp;<note place="margin">The working of liuing Creatn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res are directed to an end</note> without any reflexe, or knowledge of its owne working) tend to a certaine end in their working; but alſo liuing Creatures do the lyke, when they worke by their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. For all liuing Creatures are moued and inclined to their ſenſe of guſt &amp; feeding, and to the act of generation; and theſe they performe, not thinking at all or conceauing the end, wherunto thoſe functions do tend and are directed. For neither are they ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp to the act of generation through the deſire of hauing young ones, neither do they eate with intention of producing their liues and conſeruing themſelues; but they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the working of theſe two ſenſes after a confuſed maner, vnder the forme of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable thing, and in this apprehenſion they are ſtirred therto. And yet doubtleſly theſe actions haue a further intention and end. For neither eating, nor the act of generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:2520:71"/>
are ordained for pleaſure; ſince this is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate and continew the kynds of liuing creatures, and that to defend and maintaine the particuler life of euery one. Therefore it is needfull, that there be ſome one <hi>ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Mynd</hi> or <hi>vnderstanding,</hi> which knowing and intending theſe ends, doth direct bruit beaſts to the ſaid ends, and which giueth to euery liuing creature (according to its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re) fitting organs and inſtruments, by the which it may come to thoſe ends.</p>
               <p>To conclude, there appeareth in many irrationable creatures a certaine particuler<note place="margin">The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.</note> induſtry, by the which they either take their meat, build their neſts, bring vp and defend their ofspring, and this in ſo indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious and witty a manner, as that (if they were indued with reaſon) they could not performe the ſame actions better, &amp; the end (for which they thus do, and to which all this is finally intended) they apprehend not, but reſt abſolutely ignorant of it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spider</hi> (for example) weaueth her<note place="margin">The ſpyder.</note> web with wonderfull art, &amp; (lyke a hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter) layeth her nets for the catching of flies; the threeds of her web are moſt fynely and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly wrought, and the further they are diſtant from the midle or center of the web, they alwaies by degrees do make greater Circles; and the connexions or inſertions of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:2520:72"/>
one threed with an other (ſtill obſeruing a preciſe diſtance) are moſt ſtrange. She con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueth the aptnes of her web to hold faſt with the fynenes of the threed?

               <p>Now from all theſe obſeruations it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the operations and working of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Creatures (yea when they perfourme the ſame by the interuention and help of their imagination) do moſt ordinately and regularly tend to a certaine end. But if they
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:2520:77"/>
ayme to ſome ſuch deſtinated end, then it neceſſarily followeth, that they are directed thither by ſome cauſe. But the beaſt it ſelfe cannot be this cauſe; in that irrationable Creatures do not know the ends of their owne operations, neither can they apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d or diſcourſe with themſelues; that this thing is profitable and conducing to that end; or that this is to be done for that reſpect, or the like. As for example, the <hi>Spyder</hi> knoweth not to what end his web ſo wouen is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, or with what order he is to proceed in making of it. Neither do the <hi>Bees</hi> know why their honycombs are made in ſuch a forme, or what benefit and good they ſhall reape therby. Neither doth any other ſuch liuing creature know, why he eateth or drinketh, or begetteth little ones, or feedeth and nouriſheth them, or flyeth away from his enemy, or defendeth himſelfe from him: finally he knoweth not the end or reaſon of any thing he doth; and yet he performeth his operations, in ſuch an order, and with ſo great an induſtry and reaſon, as if he were indued with the true vſe of Reaſon. In ſo much that ſome of the ancient Authours maintained, that all liuing Creatures had reaſon, though they were depriued of all ſpeach or la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guage, which might be knowne to vs. And of this very point and ſubiect did

                  <hi>Plutarch</hi> wryte a booke. But this opinion is moſt falſe, and ridiculous.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is neceſſarily to be granted, that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is a certaine <hi>Spirit</hi> or <hi>Intelligence</hi> preſiding and ruling ouer bruite beaſts, and gouerning their actions; which well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what is conuenient to the ſafety and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their liues, and to the propagation of each one of their kynds, and by what meanes they are to attaine vnto the ſame. By which <hi>Intelligence</hi> all the actions of irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable creatures are directed to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ſeuerall, and diſtinct ends. For here is firſt needfull an exact and diſtinct knowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of all theſe ends, which agree to euery one of them according to their <hi>ſpecies</hi> and kynds, as alſo of the meanes conducing to the ſame ends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly it is requiſit to know what proportion ought to be of euery mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne to its end. Laſtly what inſtinct is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſeuerall functions, and to the many <hi>ſeries</hi> or degrees of their functions. Now all this knowledge being preſuppoſed &amp; gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as neceſſary, it was eaſy for that <hi>ſupreme Architect, &amp; Maker of all things</hi> to imprint in ech liuing Creature peculiar and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated inſtincts, to all theſe meanes and Ends.</p>
               <p>Now, that beaſts and al other irrationable Creatures by force of theſe inſtincts do ſo

proceed in their actions, as if they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with an vnderſtanding; the reaſon is, becauſe theſe inſtincts are certaine impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the wiſedome and reaſon of the <hi>diuyne prouidence,</hi> and hereupon thoſe creatures do no otherwiſe direct their operations, then the diuyne Prouidence it ſelfe, if it were planted in them, or would vſe them, as its inſtruments would direct them.

                  <hi>Man,</hi> in that he enioyeth reaſon and a certaine generall Prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce (by the which he gouerneth himſelfe, ſetteth downe his owne end, and diſpoſeth of fitting meanes for the ſame end) hath no need of theſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall inſtincts, which other creatures haue. And although diuers men in regard of their peculiar temperature of body, haue peculiar inſtincts both for the ſtirring vp of ſeuerall motions and paſſions of the mynd, as alſo for inclyning them to certaine artes; yet they are not to gouerne themſelues by theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincts, but by the guyde and force of reaſon, which is granted vnto them. But other Creatures (becauſe they are depriued of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) cannot gouerne themſelues, nor direct their particuler operations to ſutable &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient ends; therefore they ſtand in need of a certaine prudentiall inſtinct, by the which they are to be directed both in the performance of their working, as alſo in the directing and diſpoſing of it to an end. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Man</hi> hath an vniuerſal prudence or wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedome, by the which he leuelleth all his actions to his end; But other Creatures haue (as it were) a certaine ſparke of prudence, or rather a peculiar inſtinct lyke vnto prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, in certaine peculiar workes of their owne. This inſtinct, ſo far forth as it artificially performeth its worke, (as the web in the

Spider, and the hony combe in the Bee) is a certaine participation of diuine art, &amp; this not vniuerſally but particularly; to wit as it is conſidered in this or that worke. In like ſort as it fittingly directeth its working to an end, it beareth the ſhew of diuyne Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence.</p>
               <p>Now this inſtinct in beaſts co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly in the diſpoſition of the phantaſy, by the which it is brought to paſſe, that it appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth after a certaine manner a thing, as conuenient or hurtfull, according to tyme &amp; place, and as occaſion ſerueth.

prouidence extendeth it ſelfe to the leaſt things; and that nothing is made without the ſame, ſeing nothing can haue its being or eſſence without its vertue or inſtinct co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               </p>
               <p>But here it may ſeeme to be replyed, that granting, that Gods prouidence hath colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vertue &amp; power to all things to worke, yet followeth not, that his prouidence ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtretcheth it ſelfe forth to all the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and workings. Euen as he, who tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth a Dog to dance, or a Parret to ſpeake Greeke, doth not (becauſe he ſo taught the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) know all things, which after they may do by reaſon of their teaching. To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, and ſay that here is a great diſparity and difference; for <hi>Man</hi> may be far remoued and diſtant from his worke, and then he knoweth not, what his worke performeth; But God cannot depart from his worke, but alwaies remaineth within the ſame; both becauſe God is euery where, filling all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces whatſoeuer; as alſo in that he is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, ſupport, &amp; ſuſtaine his owne worke; ſince otherwiſe it would inſtantly decay, vaniſhing away like a ſhadow. For though a Wright (for example) building a houſe, and after departing from it, the houſe remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth by it ſelfe to be ſeene; yet neither the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:2520:80"/>
world nor any thing of the world can haue its ſubſiſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; being, after God hath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne himſelfe from it. And the reaſon of the difference here, is diuers; firſt becauſe the Wright maketh his worke in a matter or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which he neither made, nor ought to conſerue, but which God made &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth; the Wright doing nothing therin, but either by way of adding to, or taking<note place="margin">God is euer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to his workes.</note> from, or placing all things in a certaine or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. But now God worketh in that matter, which himſelfe only made, and he only can deſtroy or preſerue it. Secondly, becauſe God made all things of nothing, eleuating &amp; aduancing euery thing to its eſſence and being; and therfore all things may againe reuert &amp; turne to nothing; euen as a heauy body being by force lifted vp from the earth doth of it owne nature declyne towards the earth againe. Wherfore as this body is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to be ſupported, that it doth not precipitate and fall headlong downewards; euen ſo all things being firſt created by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyne power, need to be ſuſtentated by the ſaid power, that they be not reduced againe to nothing. And here I do not vnderſtand by the word <hi>Nothing,</hi> any poſitiue inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (ſuch as the heauens or the earth is) but a defect of power or hability to retaine its owne being; becauſe it hath no power pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:2520:81"/>
it ſelfe but only from God. Thirdly, becauſe all things haue their dependance of God after a perfect manner, as the light of the ayre depends vpon the Sunne, and the intentionall <hi>ſpecies</hi> or formes of Colours vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their obiect, or as the ſhadow vpon the body expoſed to the Sunne (as the ancient Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers do teach and eſpecially the Platoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cks:) for we are not to thinke, that there is leſſer (but rather far greater) dependency of things created, vpon God, being the moſt vniuerſall cauſe, then is of theſe effects vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their particuler cauſes. Therefore all things do need a continual preſeruation and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual influxe; in ſo much that if God ſhould but for a moment withdraw or diuert this ſubſtance-making beame (for ſo doth <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I omit diuers other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which here might be alledged; Only it ſufficeth here to ſhew, that God can in no ſort be abſent from his worke; from which poynt it neceſſarily may be concluded, that nothing can be concealed and hid from his Prouidence, ſeing that himſelfe is moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecally &amp; inwardly preſent to al things.</p>

               <p>THESE two things (I meane the great diuerſity of faces and voyces of Men, and the penury that Man is ordinarily borne vnto (may be no ſmal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements<note place="margin">The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſity of faces.</note> (if they be rightly conſidered) to proue the care of the <hi>diuine Prouidence.</hi> And touching the firſt; The <hi>diuerſity of faces</hi> is ſo multiplicious and almoſt ſo infinit in Man, as it affordeth no final argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t therof; for without this variety neither could iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce be obſerued, neither could any forme of a common wealth conſiſt.

                  </gap>eſted with adulteries, inceſts, frauds, proditions, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and all other wickednes whatſoeuer; ſince ſuch lewd miſcariages might then be perpetrated with all impunity &amp; freedome from puniſhment; for euery one might through a reſemblance of face giue himſelf for whom he would, neither could the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaking be eaſily diſcouered. This poynt is moſt euident to any that ſeriouſly weigheth the ſame, and diuers examples of thoſe men do witnes no leſſe, who cofyding &amp; reſting vpon likenes of face and fauour, haue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to inuade other mens beds, patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, kingdomes; ſometime with good euent, at other tymes in vayne, but euer with great trouble and tumults. Therefore it is euident, that the difference of faces is moſt neceſſary, that the lawes of iuſtice and of the Commonwealth may not be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed, and peace and tranquility obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>
               <p>If it be here replyed that this difference of faces commeth only by chance &amp; caſually, and not from any Prouidence ſo diſpoſing the ſame: I anſwere, that it is abſurd to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that to haue its euent by chance and fortune, which preuayleth ſo much in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting of iniures, &amp; in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſeruing of iuſtice among Men; ſince, otherwiſe it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:2520:82"/>
that all iuſtice and true policy which is found among Men, ſhould be grounded only vpon chance; and that fortune ſhould be the foundation of all Commonwealthes. Furthermore what proceedeth from chance is not perpetuall, but rarely hapneth; and is not found in all, but in few only, (as Ariſtotle and other Philoſophers do teach.) As for example, that a man is borne with fiue fingers, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be ſaid to come by cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but it may be ſo ſaid of him, who is borne with ſix fingers. And anſwerably hereto, we fynd, that difference of countenances &amp; faces is not a thing ſtrange and rare, but very ordinary and common; which almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, and in all places is incident to Men. Therefore it is not a thing to be aſcribed to chance, but to Prouidence, which hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained the ſame, the better to preſerue iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and ciuill life betweene Men, which without this variety of faces could moſt hardly be obſerued. But on the other part, if the nature of Man and the propagation of him were ſo diſpoſed, that Men ſhould bee commonly borne lyke in faces, and that no diſſimilitude ſhould be betweene them, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might this diuerſity of faces well be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to chance, but the contrary we ſee, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out; for diſſimilitude and vnliknes is ordinary, and likenes and reſemblance of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:2520:83"/>
faces but rare; Therefore, that Men are like, is to be imputed to chance; that they are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, to Prouidence. And here I vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by the word, <hi>Chance,</hi> a rare and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary concourſe of cauſes, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is gouerned by the mighty ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of <hi>Gods prouidence:</hi> for in reſpect of his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence (which incompaſſeth all things within the largenes of it owne Orbes) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be ſaid to be caſuall; but only in regard of ſecondary cauſes, whoſe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and power of working is limited.</p>
               <p>In irrationable Creatures there is for the moſt part ſo great a parity and likenes of the <hi>indiuidua</hi> and particulers of one kynd, as that with difficulty any difference can be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: For ſeing it importeth not much, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be like or vnlike, nature follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that which is more eaſy; and therefore maketh them like, ſo as to the eye there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth no markable &amp; notorious differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or vnlikenes: for it is more facile and better ſorting to the courſe of nature, that bodyes which internally are of one and the ſame nature and ſubſtance, ſhould alſo be indued with the ſame externall qualities, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with diuers and different; And when occaſion requires, that among theſe creatures, one ſhould be knowne from another (as in ſheepe, goates, horſes &amp;c. it is an eaſy mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:2520:83"/>
to ſet on them a marke for their better di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing.</p>
               <p>Neither among Men is there only this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of faces (for their better diſcerning of one from another) but alſo of <hi>voyces;</hi> ſo as there is no leſſe difference among them in ſound of <hi>voyce,</hi> then in Countenance. For ſeing a preciſe and diſtinct knowledge ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily conduceth to the preſeruing of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; therefore the <hi>diuyne Prouidence</hi> hath ſo diſpoſed, that there ſhould be a diſparity &amp; vnlikenes not only in <hi>faces,</hi> but alſo in <hi>voyces;</hi> that ſo by a double ſenſe (to wit by ſight &amp; hearing) as by a double witnes, one man ſhould be made knowne from another. For if but one of theſe diſparities were, then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome miſtaking might be; but where both of them do ioyntly concurre and meet, it is almoſt impoſſible, that men heerein ſhould be in both deceaued. Only difference of Countenances were not ſufficient, becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe matters are often menaged in darknes; as alſo ſome mens eye ſights are ſo weake and imperfect, as that they cannot exactly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the lineaments and portrature of the face; beſides among ſome men (though but ſeldome) there is a great reſemblance of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages; ſo as in diſtinguiſhing of them the eye may be deceaued. And therefore this want is heere fully ſupplied with the like diſpari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:2520:84"/>
of mens voyces; to the end that ſuch me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which could not be knowne one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by their faces, might neuertheles be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily diſtinguiſhed by the ſound of their ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues.</p>
               <p>But to proceed further in this generall ſubiect, it is euident, that the conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <note place="margin">Of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty.</note> of <hi>Pouerty</hi> (wherwith the world laboureth) affordeth a ſtrong argument of a <hi>diuyne Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence;</hi> Since <hi>Pouerty</hi> is that, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth all entercourſe among Men, as furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing man withal ornaments and delicacyes of this life; as on the contrary ſide affluence and abundance of riches leadeth man to all diſſolution and tutpitude of life. For ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, that all things, which are in any ſort ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to mans life, were fully and promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly giuen to al men without any labour and induſtry on their parts; then it is cleare, that two mayne inconueniences would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly follow: to wit, an ouerthrow and decay of all artes, and all other ſplendour now appearing in Mans life; and an vtter deprauation and corruption of manners &amp; integrity of conuerſation. For granting the former poſition, no man would learne any mechanicall arts, or learning would pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice them.</p>
               <p>No man would vndertake any labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and painfull taske, nor be ſeruiceable to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:2520:84"/>
any other; ſince no man would performe theſe things, were he not forced therunto through want &amp; penury. And ſo we ſhould want all rich attyre all fayre and ſtately e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difices, all coſtly furniture for houſes, all magnificent temples and Churches, all Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes, Towers, Caſtels, and other ſuch forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications. In like ſort, then would ceaſe all agriculture and tilling, all nauigation, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing, fowling, &amp; all trafficke for mercha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize; againe there would be no nobie and potent men, as being deſtitute of all ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts and followers. Moreouer, all differences of degrees and orders (which are neceſſary in euery common wealth) would be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and conſequently all reuerence and obedience<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Therefore whatſoeuer in the whole courſe of mans life is faire, gorgeous, magnificent, and to be deſired, all the ſame would be wanting, if men were not poore: and nothing would remayne but rudenes, barbariſme, and ſauageneſſe.</p>
               <p>To this former inconuenience may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned another of greater importance, to wit, an extreme corruption of manners and an opening the ſluce to all diſorder &amp; diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of life. For it is obſerued, that ſuch laſciuious courſes do commonly accompany idlenes and abundance of wealth; an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this we may borrow from the men li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:2520:85"/>
before the deluge, (whom laſineſſe, opulency and fulnes of temporalities did o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow) as alſo from the inhabitantes of <hi>Braſile,</hi> who (by reaſon that the country af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded them abundantly without labour, through the natural temperature of the Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, all things neceſſary) are altogeter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come mancipated and ſlaues to Epicuriſme, luſt, and all vicious ſenſuality.</p>
               <p>Two things then there are, which chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly hurt, &amp; depraue all conuerſation of life; to wit idlenes, and affluence of riches. This later miniſtreth matter to all vices; the firſt giueth opportunity and tyme for the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But both theſe are taken away <hi>by pouerty,</hi> the one (to wit abundance) imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly, ſeing want is nothing els then the want and not hauing of riches; the other (I meane idlenes) in that whiles penury affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth and preſſeth men, they are (for the further preuenting thereof) willing to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo any labour and paines.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible miracle, to wit, the producing of ſo huge a worke out of nothing, and ſuch as could be accompliſhed only by that <hi>power</hi> &amp; <hi>wiſedome,</hi> which is moſt infinite and illimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>
               <p>The ſecond may be the <hi>framing and making of ſo many liuing Creatures and Plants,</hi> and the firſt inſtitution of ſo many ſeuerall ſeedes, by the which they are propagated &amp; increaſed; as alſo that great fecundity of the earth and the ſea, by the cooperation whereof, one Creature or ſeede is multiplyed in a ſhort tyme into ſeuerall thouſands.</p>
               <p>The third. The <hi>most ſwift motion of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens,</hi>

and the gouernement and diſpoſall of this inferious world by meanes of this rota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſpeedy turning about of the ſaid ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall bodies.

By this alſo are effected the ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall tymes of the yeare; ſo as all creatures &amp; plants are by this meanes brought forth &amp; after become mature, rype, and perfect in their due tymes. In like manner by this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the heauenly Orbes, the fieldes are beautifyed and enriched with flowers, the paſtures with graſſe, the woods with trees and leaues, and the trees with fruit: finally by the mediation of the foreſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> motion is wrought the flux and reflux of the ſea, the blowing of wynds, the darckneſſe of the clouds, the conueniency of ſhowers, the benefit of ſnow, the firſt riſing of ſprings, the current of riuers, the wholſomnes &amp; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity of the ayre, and the benefit procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from thunder, &amp; diuers other <hi>Meteors.</hi>

To theſe in lyke ſort, are to be adioyned, the ſtaying of the Sune in the midle of its courſe for the ſpace of ten howres; the retrograde or going back of it diuers degrees; the force and burning of the fyre ſuſpended and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned, and the preſeruation of the ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God put into a burning fornace; the fury of Lyons ſuppreſſed that they hurt not the true worſhippers of God, the dead recald &amp; raiſed to life, and the wicked and impious by the peculiar hand of God, wonderfully chaſtiſed.</p>
               <p>From all which it is a moſt cleare and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious truth, that there is a certaine <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall</hi> and <hi>diuyne power,</hi> which ſeeth all things, gouerneth all things, and weigheth all things in an euen ballance of iuſtice and

Reaſon; &amp; which ſeuerly puniſheth the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrators and workers of iniquity, &amp; vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh a particuler charge and defence of the vertuous, often effecting for their good and ſafety many things, aboue the ordinary and ſetled courſe of nature.</p>
               <p>Neither in theſe miracles can there be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued the leaſt ſuſpition of any impoſture or deceit; <hi>first,</hi> becauſe the authour, which wrot all theſe (ſome few excepted) was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with extraordinary wiſedome, and grauity, and was accounted the greateſt Prophet that euer liued in any age among thoſe, who either floriſhed for ſanctity of life, or praiſe of wiſedome. <hi>Secondly,</hi> becauſe there were many predictions ſet downe by him in his works, as in <hi>Geneſis</hi> 12. &amp; 49. the <hi>Numbers</hi> 24. <hi>Deutron.</hi> 32. and 33. all which ſeing we fynd by the euent to be moſt true, we may reſt aſſured, that he was moſt fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thfull in his relation of other things <hi>Thirdly,</hi> in that euery one of the things recyted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, are ſo particularized with all their circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtances of tymes, places, perſons, names occaſions, effects, with ſuch an order and ſo ſorting to the nature of things, with ſuch a conſequence of matters, and ſo agreeably to piety and probity of Manners, as that euen an eye witnes of the ſame paſſages &amp; occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents could not deliuer them with greater
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:2520:88"/>
exactnes. Now who forgetn things, auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth (for the moſt part) many circumſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces; or if he addeth them, then is the fiction ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily diſcouered by them: for what he wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, is either not agreable to the tyme, place, nature of things themſelues, or other more certaine and approued hiſtoryes, or els ſome contradiction is found in the matter it ſelfe, as falleth out in the fabulous hiſtoryes of <hi>Homer, Nonnus, Virgil, Ouid, Amadu,</hi> &amp; many other ſuch like. <hi>Fourthly</hi> in moſt of the things aboue related, the authour (to wit <hi>Moyſes</hi>) was not only preſent at the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of them; but was the chiefe man in the action, performing the ſame, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of the holy Ghoſt, and therefore had beſt reaſon to know them moſt preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>Fiftly,</hi> if he had written differently from the truth (eſpecially touching the plagues of <hi>Aegipt,</hi> the deuyding of the Sea, and the actions performed in the wildernes) he might eaſily haue bene conuinced of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood by many hundred thouſands of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, who were alſo then preſent with him. For all theſe things were red openly before the whole multitude, &amp; were alſo to be read ouer againe euery ſeuenth yeare in the preſence of the people, as appeareth out of the 31. chapter of <hi>Deuteronomy. Sixtly,</hi> all the former things, as then being beſt

knowne throughout all the Eaſt, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in Hebrew verſe by <hi>Dauid,</hi> who was a King and a Prophet, and who was later in tyme then <hi>Moyſes,</hi> more then 450. yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res; which verſes euen from that tyme to this very day, are continually ſung in the publicke prayers, almoſt throughout the whole world by the Iewes, where they enioy the vſe of their religion, and by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians for the ſpace of 1600. yeares. Yea af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the dayes of <hi>Moyſes</hi> there did almoſt in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery age riſe vp among the people of Iſraell certaine Prophets and venerable Men who being guyded by the aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt, did gouerne, teach, and reduce the erring people to the law of <hi>Moyſes;</hi> which men, did euer worſhip Moyſes, as a diuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Prophet and worſhipper of the higheſt God.</p>
               <p>All which, as beinge worthy and pious Men, and in what credit &amp; eſtimation they were had, may appeare from the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both of their actions and writings. For their actions were ſuch, as exceeded al hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane forces, and neceſſarily required the ayde of the Almighty: ſuch were thoſe acts performed by <hi>Ioſua, Debora, Gedeon, Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pſon, Samuel, Dauid, Nathan, Salomon, Ahias</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonites, <hi>Elias, Elizaus, Eſay, Ieremy, Daniel, Ionas, Iudith, Esther, the Machabees,</hi> and by
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:2520:89"/>
diuers others. And their writings were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with diuers predictions and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſyes of things to come, which through long ſucceſſion of many ages, had their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable accompliſhments and fulfillings: a poynt ſo worthy of obſeruation, as that the lyke cannot be found in any hiſtory or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of other nations. <hi>Seauenthly</hi> euen du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the law of the Iewes from the tymes of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> there was euery yeare an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the effecting of theſe former wonders celebrated by diuers ceremonyes, feſtiuall dayes, ſacrifices, and other rytes, leaſt the memory of them ſhould in tract of tyme periſh and be aboliſhed: for the feaſt of the <hi>Paſſouer,</hi> and the Sacrifice or the <hi>Paſcall Lambe</hi> was performed in thankeſgiuing for the peoples deliuery out of <hi>Aegipt,</hi> and for the preſeruation of thoſe Iewes who during their ſtay in Aegipt, were ſaued from the ſlaughter, which was made vpon the firſt borne of the Iewes. And for the ſame cauſe was offered vnto God all the firſt borne of things. The feaſt of <hi>Pentecost</hi> was in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the law giuen vpon the fiftith day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their deliuery. The feaſt of the <hi>Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> was celebrated, in recordation that the people liued forty yeares in the deſart in Tabernacles. Furthermore the <hi>Arke of the Couenant</hi> was kept and preſerued, the which
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:2520:89"/>
Moyſes by the commandement and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God made, and in the which the <hi>Rod of Aaron</hi> which bloſſomed, and the <hi>veſſell of the Manna,</hi> and the Law written in two ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of ſtone by the hand of God, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by <hi>Moyſes,</hi> were ſafely laid vp; all which benefits of God and his wonderfull workes were celebrated with the ſinging of diuers Canticles and ſongs. To conclude the very bookes themſelues of the teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t were with great diligence and publick au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in a holy, publick, and moſt ſecure place (as diuyne Oracles) preſerued, leaſt otherwiſe they might by any deceit be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and depraued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eightly,</hi> for the greater acceſſion of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to the former, it may be added, that thoſe wrytings of the old teſtament are full of wiſedome, piety, and grauity; in which are found no vanity or improfitable curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; For all things there are ſet downe moſt ſeriouſly and moſt aptly for the informing and rectifying the mynd with vertue and piety, for deterring it from all wickednes, and for it voluntary imbracing of godlines, iuſtice, benignity, manſuetude, patience &amp; temperance; and all this with wonderfull documents and examples of moſt excellent men alledged to this end: a courſe far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that, which is taken in the wrytings
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:2520:90"/>
of Philoſophers, in the which many vayne curious and improfitable paſſages are found, as alſo ſometymes many wicked, prophane and impure inſtructions are to be read. For they in their bookes, by reaſon of the then commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vſe, do permit the worſhip of Idols, though they were perſwaded that there was but one <hi>ſupreme diuyne Power.</hi> In like manner they permit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ullination, repyning and ſecret hate againſt ones Enemy; as alſo fornications, filthy luſts, a vayne deſire of glory, and other internall vicious affections of the mynd. And though ſometymes in their wrytings they commend vertue &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend vyce, yet do they not bring any mouing and forcing reaſon, therby to deter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men from vyce, and perſwade and moue them to the practice of a vertuous lyfe. For the ſplendour and inward beauty of vertue, as alſo the turpitude and vglines of vice (which two ſole points are vſually aledged by Philoſophers) are but weake incyteme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to the mynd; therefore that Man may haue an abſolute dominion ouer himſelfe and his paſſions there is need of more veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions. And hence it is obſerued, that very few men haue bettered their mynds (ſo far forth I meane as concernes piety) by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of their labours, though many by that meanes haue arriued to a great pryde and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:2520:90"/>
of ſpirit; but it is certaine, that from the wrytings and doctrine of <hi>Moyſes</hi> &amp; from the other ſacred bookes of Scripture innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable men haue come to wonderfull ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, and haue enioyed great familiarity with God himſelfe; ſo as they were moſt il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious and celebrious for the admirable workes performed by them.</p>
               <p>To conclude this poynt, if any one will ſeriouſly contemplate and confer together the myſteries of the Iudaicall and Chriſtian religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he ſhall clearly ſee, that ſuch things as were done by the Iewes, did ſerue but to adumbrate and ſhadow the myſteries of our Chriſtian fayth, according to the words of the Apoſtle 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10 <hi>

From all which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes it is moſt cleare, that credit and fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is to be giuen to the bookes of <hi>Moyſes</hi> (&amp; not in that degree only, as is exhibited to the Commentaryes of <hi>Ceſar,</hi> the Hiſtory of <hi>Liuy,</hi> or any other prophane authours) but as to certaine moſt vndoubted Oracles, writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the ſpeciall concurrency and aſſiſtance of

the holy Ghoſt. The like may be auerred of other holy bookes of Scripture (whether they be hiſtoricall or propheticall) ſeing the ſame reaſons and arguments, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for the writings of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> are alſo preuailing for them.</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Philoſophers, againſt the edicts, comminations, and threatnings of Princes, with a reſolute neglect of all commodities or diſcommodities of this life, of honour or contumely, of wordly allurements or tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, how great ſoeuer? And yet Chriſt performed all theſe great affayres by his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, being but poore and ignoble men, reducing by their meanes the whole power &amp; wiſedome of the world vnder his yoake and gouerment. Now the Apoſtles were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt rude, fearfull, puſillanimous, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of heauenly miſteryes, ignorant of the tongues, and indeed altogeather vnapt, for ſo high an enterpriſe.

               <p>Now nothing can be anſwerable hereto to take away the authority of theſe miracles, but that they were not true, but only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged;<note place="margin">That the former Miracles cannot be ſaid to be forged.</note> or if true, performed by the helpe of the deuill.

with greater inueſtigation &amp; ſearch of truth then are the miracles aboue recyted, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince the Church hath bene euer moſt ſollicitous and carefull, that falſe miracles ſhould not be ventilated, and giuen out for true; for here we ſpeake only of thoſe mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which the Church acknowledgeth for certaine &amp; euident. <hi>Thirdly</hi> who condemne all theſe miracles for fictions, do charge all Chriſtian Princes, magiſtrates, and all the Chriſtian world of madnes, and extreme ſimplicity, in ſuffering innumerable fictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; lyes to be obtruded vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for ſo many truthes; they not hauing ſo much perſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and clearnes of iudgment, as to be able to diſcouer the deceit.

                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> diuers of theſe miracles are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, by ſo graue authours indued with learning and ſanctity, and with ſo many particuler circumſtances, as that all poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of fraud is taken away.

Or with what hope or reward ſhould they vndergo the aſperſion of ſo foule a ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh? No man doth any thing, but there is ſome reaſon which induceth him ſo to do.

               <p>Now to come to the ſecond branch of the former anſwere. If it be ſaid, that they are performed by the worke of the deuils, then in thus anſwering, it followeth, that there are ſpirits, or incorporeall ſubſtances, which are more excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, then theſe viſible things; and conſequently it is to be granted, that there is one <hi>ſuprem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

reſt in power and wiſedome, &amp; this we call God, as hereafter ſhall be proued. But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed further againſt this ſecond part of this Anſweare, I ſay; that theſe ſtupendious workes cannot with any ſhew or protext of reaſon, be referred to the power of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils; for to reſtore ſight to the blynd, going to the lame, to cure the paralitcks only with their word, and to raiſe the dead to life, do far tranſcend and exceed the power of the<note place="margin">As S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine l. 3. de Trinit. c. 8. tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth.</note> deuils, who cure diſeaſes only by the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of naturall cauſes; to wit, by applying the vertue of hearbs and other medicinable things, as philoſophers &amp; deuynes do teach. Furthermore thoſe holy men, by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe miracles are performed, were euer in moſt deadly hatred with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, and they were ſo far from vſing them as a meanes, as that they proclaimed open war againſt the Deuils; for they ordinarily diſpoſſeſſed mens bodyes of them, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw their worſhip, diſcouered their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceites, confuted their doctrines, ſcorned &amp; contemned all their preſtigious artes, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally deſtroyed their kingdome and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Such were in the beginning all the Apoſtles, and their ſucceſſours, and infinit others. For againſt theſe and ſuch others no power of Deuils, no Arts magicke, no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations, and endeauours of wicked ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:2520:95"/>
nor any preſtigyes, or ſleights could preuayle. Beſides how can we with any probability thinke, that ſo many learned Doctours, ſo many Prelates, ſo many Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, finally ſo many wiſe and prudent men were become ſo ſtupid and blockiſh, as not to be able to diſcerne true miracles from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterate and forged wonders, and the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the deuill from the hand and worke of God? Belyke only the Phariſyes, the heathen perſecutours, &amp; prophane Atheiſts haue this guift of diſtinguiſhing miracles from the preſtigyes and deceites of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill; and all other men are blynd, fooliſh, and in this poynt depryued of all ſound and perfect iudgment.</p>
               <p>This indeed was long ſince the calumny of the Phariſies againſt our Lord, &amp; of the Heathens againſt Martyrs; who when they were clearely conuinced with ſupernatural ſignes and miracles (as plainly ſeeing them daily wrought) and being then conſcious of their owne inward wickednes, did burſt forth into horrible blaſphemyes; attributing thoſe things to the deuill and art magick, which were effected only by the mighty<note place="margin">Luke 21.</note> hand of God. Now the Reaſon, why God vouchſafeth to worke miracles in diuers places is manifold. Firſt, he doth this, that hereby he may manifeſt his preſence &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:2520:96"/>
to al men. For if during the ſpace of many ages whatſoeuer was wrought, was encompaſſed within the limits of Nature, then might men (perhaps) be induced to thinke, that there were no diuine Power, who had a care of humane affaires, &amp; vpon whome the charge of them were property incumbent; but that all things had their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent by a ſecret impulſe and force of nature. For although this is euidently diſproued by many reaſons, as from the motion of the ſtarres, from the fabricke and making of bodyes, from the innate direction of euery particuler thing to its certain end (as is ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed aboue) yet many do not ſufficiently &amp; ſeriouſly penetrate theſe matters, but are (as it were) blynded here in through the daily and continuall ſeeing of them; for how ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable a thing is it, that from ſome few graines of corne ſo great an increaſe ſhould riſe? From a formeles ſeed, ſo fayre and ſo ſeuerall kynds of bodyes both of liuing Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures and of Plants ſhould be framed? From a ſmall roote ſo huge trees ſhould grow? And yet few there are, who do admyre theſe things; and few who do acknowledge Gods wonderfull power and prouidence in them. Therefore it was neceſſary, that ſome workes might be effected, which ſhould tranſgreſſe the bounds of nature, leaſt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:2520:96"/>
men might thinke, that there were no power aboue the nature and condition of corporall things: for by reaſon of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitancy and the vnaccuſtomednes of ſuch ſtupendious euents, men are often ſtirred vp to thinke of the Authour of them, and to proſecute him with true religion, reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and honour. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Miracles are effected to the end, that men may be confirmed in other poynts of religion, giuing a full aſſent therto without any heſitation or doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and making vſe of them with all due reuerence. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that the doctrine and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues of thoſe who worke miracles, may he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby be fully warranted, and ſo with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter certainty of truth may be commended to vs. For miracles are certaine diuyne teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monyes both of the infallibility of doctryne, and of ſanctity of life; eſpecially where the life is conformable to the doctrine. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> that by this meanes the ſeruants of God may be honoured: for there is nothing, which maketh holy men more celebrious and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous throughout the whole world, and which more incyteth the mynds of others to loue, worſhip, and imitate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then the exhibiting of miracles. For as God wil haue himſelfe belieued of Men aboue all things, and our neighbours not aboue al things, but euery one in his degree: ſo doth he expect
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:2520:97"/>
himſelfe to be worſhiped aboue all things; to wit as the firſt efficient, &amp; laſt final cauſe of all things; and his ſeruants not to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured after this ſupreme manner, but in their peculiar degree, and in that reſpect, which they beare towards God; that is, as they are his adoptiue ſonnes, partakers of his kingdome, and his moſt deare friends. Thus from hence it appeareth, that there is no feare of Idolatry in honouring here Gods Saints; for where there is Idolatry commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, there is ſupreme honour giuen, by the which a Creature is worſhipped, as the Creatour and firſt beginning, but no wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is aſcribed to the Saints in this ſort.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fiftly,</hi> Miracles are wrought, that men through occaſion of corporall benefits obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therby, may the ſooner be ſtirred vp to repentance &amp; amendment of life: for where miracles are wrought, there is to that place (for the moſt part) a great confluence and concourſe of many thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of grieuous ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, who being afore contaminated with al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kynds of vices, and hauing conceaued a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe of their former licentious lyues, do vndertake an amendment &amp; change of their former courſes; and thus by this meanes it hapneth, that the ſoules of many thouſands are ſaued, which otherwiſe had periſhed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſtingly. <hi>To conclude</hi> this poynt, by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles

all men are ſtirred vp to reuerence &amp; praiſe of God to the giuing of thankes, &amp; ſpirituall ioy and exultation, and the minds of all are raiſed vp to a confident &amp; erected hope, as conceauing the expectation of the like help in their future calamityes and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</p>

Now in ſhewing and interpreting of this dreame, the power, wiſedome and prouidence of God ſo clearly ſhyned, that the proud King proſtrated himſelfe vpon his face before <hi>Daniel</hi> his ſeruant, and worſhipped him, and openly confeſſed the maieſty &amp; power of God.</p>
               <p>The foreſaid foure Monarchyes (which were to ſucceed in order) and the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſtates, and proprieties of euery one of them were fore ſhewed to <hi>Daniel</hi> by another wonderful viſion in the ſeauenth Chapter, vnder the forme and ſhew of foure beaſts; &amp; then after was ſignifyed to him the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Saints, which (after all the kingdomes of the world were extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed) ſhould continue and floriſh eternally.

               <p>Now out of all theſe things, which are here ſaid, we may gather three poynts, as moſt true and infallible. Firſt, that there is a <hi>diuyne Power,</hi> who is priuy to all future euents, and to the ſecreteſt things that are,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:2520:112"/>
and by whome all humane matters are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned; and that he reuealeth to diuers of ſuch, which truly ſerue and worſhip him, thoſe future euents, whereof there are no determinate cauſes. Secondly, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the true and only <hi>Sauiour of the world;</hi> ſince all his actions and doings were foretold by his Prophets ſo many ages before, and ſince himſelfe was ſo eminent and admirable for his birth, works, predictions, doctrine, life, end, and reſurrection Thirdly, that the faith of Chriſt is neceſſary to ſaluation; for no man can with any ſhew of reaſon call theſe three poynts into queſtion, who hath with iudgment and maturity of diſcourſe expended and waighed the forerehearſed predictions, and Propheſyes.</p>

One, that ſuch as are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, do ſpeake ſtrange tongs, which the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues neither vnderſtand, nor euer did le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arne. The other, that they diſcouer things ſecret, or do relate things done in great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of place, as if they ſaw them openly. Both theſe two things afford an euident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of a certaine ſuperiour inuiſible nature, by the power wherof they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. To conclude this point of the bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſpirits, is euicted from the many ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions of ſpirits, which are affirmed to haue beene from the teſtimony of diuers moſt probable hiſtories.</p>
               <p>From all theſe proofs then it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that there are in the world ſpirits, and that in a wonderfull great number. Since in all places, and from all antiqui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty they haue moſt ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> manifeſted themſelues. In ſo much as there is no kingdome, no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince, no citty, no village, but there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth ſome memory of their apparitions. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was of opinion (as <hi>Laertius</hi> wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth) that all the ayre was full of ſpirits or
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:2520:114"/>
ſoules; And this alſo was the iudgement of many of other ancients, who taught, that euery one had his <hi>genius,</hi> or ſpirit aſſigned by God. Thus did <hi>Heſiode, Homer, Menander, Triſmegistus, Plato,</hi> and the <hi>Stoickes</hi> affirme. Now i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> there be many ſpirits, then it ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitably may be concluded, that there is one ſupreme ſpirit, to the which all the reſt are ſubiect, and at whoſe command they are gouerned: for euery multitude of things (except there be a dependency and ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to one moſt high) begetteth diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and confuſion. And hence it is, that euen among bodies, there is a ſuperiority and predomina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy of one aboue all the reſt, at whoſe command all the others do moue or reſt quyet. Now then by force of this reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there ought much more to be the like order among ſpirits, ſo as all are (in regard of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraignty ouer them) to be reduced to one ſupreme ſpirit: for by how much any thing is more excellent, by ſo much it ought to enioy a more perfect order in the world: but ſpirits are far more worthy in nature, then corporall things; therefore among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there ought to be the perfecteſt order, to wit, of ſubiection and domination. For it were moſt abſurd to grant an <gap reason="foreign">

degree of things, to be ſo orderly diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and diſtributed.</p>
               <p>This poynt is further confirmed from the moſt dangerous and imminent inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences accompanying the contrary doctrine; for if among ſpirits there were no order, &amp; that the reſt ſhould not be ſubiect vnto one, at the command wherof the power of them were to be reſtrained; then might euery one of them trouble and afflict the world at its owne pleaſure, might take away mens goods, burne and deſtroy all things, might infeſt mens bodyes with griefes, diſeaſes &amp; death, to be briefe might deſtroy and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all mankynd; neither could any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe be found to the contrary, ſeing there were no ſupreme ſpirit, to the which this other did ſtand ſubiect, and ſo the world could not in any ſort long conſiſt.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that mens bodyes ſhould be ſacrificed vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; ſtill making choyce of that, which was moſt deare to the ſacrificer, as his ſonne, his daughter, or one who was in great eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:2520:115"/>
in the Common wealth; finally fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the warres and tumults, to the which the Diuels vnder the ſhew of diuyne and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall powers, haue ſtirred men. Now if they are thus cruell and merciles towards men, God but giuing them in ſome ſort the bridle for the offences of men, what would they not do, &amp; with what calamities would they not afflict men, and what honours &amp; worſhips would they not extort at our hands, if they were at their owne power and liberty, receauing from no ſuperiour ſpirit any reſtraint or inhibition? Yea amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g themſelues, warres, emulations &amp; diſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s would grow, if there were not one, that could impoſe a command ouer them. For as among Princes, who acknowledge no ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times wars are ſtirred vp (with the which the world is miſerably afflicted) becauſe there is none, to whoſe ſouerainty they ſtand ſubiect, and who is of power to compoſe the riſing controuerſies among them; Euen ſo among ſpirits there would grow repinings, contentions &amp; wars, (with the which the world would be vtterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed) if they ſtood not in ſubiection to ſome one ſupreme power: for euery one of them would ſeeke to aduance himſelfe, and labour to draw all things to his owne pleaſure and deſire: wherfore <hi>Homer</hi> moſt

               </p>
               <p>To conclude, ſeeing there are many ſpirits (as is ſhewed aboue) I would here demand, from whence this multitude had its begining? Or who brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into the world? They proceed not from bodies, in that they are of a more excellent and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent nature, then bodyes are; as alſo in that bodyes do bring forth only bodies. Neither is one of them ingendred of another (as we ſee liuing creatures are propagated) ſeeing this kind of generation is peculiar to things, which are ſubiect to corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to wit, that by this meanes, the <hi>ſpecies</hi> &amp; kinds of things may be perpetuated, whiles the nature, being extinct in the parent, is conſerued in the iſſue. Neither can it be ſaid, that euery one of theſe ſpirits haue their being from themſelues, ſo as they depend of no other cauſe, granting, that any thing receaueth its exiſtence and being from it ſelfe, it is far more probable, that this ſo taking it exiſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:2520:116"/>
ſhould be but one, not many. For it is much more fitting, that there ſhould be one certaine <hi>Nature</hi> independent of any, in the which the whole fulnes of beeing reſteth <hi>eminenter,</hi> and vnitedly; &amp; from which one nature, the beeing of all things is deriued, according to the degree of euery ſuch thing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to maintaine, that there are many <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> which depend not of one ſupreme <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> For where there is a multitude of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall <hi>ſpecies,</hi> or <hi>Indiuidua,</hi> and particuler things, there is alſo a limitation and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; ſeeing thoſe many things are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither diſtinct and ſeuerall; neither do one comprehend the perfection and vertue of another. And hence it ryſeth, that none of thoſe is for it ſelfe, but for another, and all together conſpyre and meet in one, and are (as it were) parts of one entyre <hi>whole,</hi> which riſeth out of them. Thus do many bodies make the world, many men a Common wealth, many ſpirits one kingdome or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth of ſpirits; but what is of it ſelf, ought to be altogether perfect, and ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to it ſelfe, needing not the ſupport &amp; help of any other thing. And what may be the reaſon thereof? Euen this, that what is of it ſelfe, is alſo for it ſelfe, according to that: <hi>Quod caret principio effectiué, caret etiam fine. What wanteth an efficient cauſe, wanteth alſo a</hi>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:2520:116"/>
                  <hi>finall cauſe;</hi> and therefore it ſelfe becomes the end to it ſelfe, not ſeeking out of it ſelfe any ayde, light, truth, ioy or beatitude; but hauing all theſe things in it ſelfe, and from it ſelfe. Therefore that, which is of it ſelfe, and independent of another, muſt needes be but one, not many; to wit a primordiall or illimitable eſſence, ſufficient by it ſelfe, being the fountaine of euery thing, and of each limitable nature. We may ad hereto, that to grant a being of many ſpirits inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of any, is to introduce a <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>For a perſwaſion, that there is a God, &amp; a loue &amp; feare of him produceth all theſe effects, and by how much this perſwaſion and feare is greater and more vehement, by ſo much it worketh more eminent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable effects of vertue and goodnes in the ſoules of men, and in a politicall ſtate.

               <p>Thirdly, it followeth, that the chiefeſt and moſt true Wiſedome extinguiſheth all<note place="margin">If there be no God, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh all vertue &amp; Errour increaſe vertue.</note> vertue, and maketh men moſt vicious: &amp; that on the contrary part, the chiefeſt Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour ſtirreth them to vertue, and cauſeth them to become holy men.

And if it be ſo, how then can the world continue, eſpecially ſeing it conſiſteth of ſo different, contrary and repugnant things? For as a ſhip without a directour is violently toſſed to and fro, till it fall vpon ſome Rock, or ſands, or be ouerwhelmed with flouds; or as a Commonwealth wanting a magiſtrate and ruler, waſteth it ſelfe away with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine, ſeditious, murthers, and other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities; ſo muſt the world be moſt exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitantly and inordinatly menaged, and in the end be diſſolued through a colluctation and fight of contraries, if there be no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, which is to ſterne the ſame, and to procure a ſimpathy and accord amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g thoſe contraries.</p>
               <p>Eightly it followeth, that all this <hi>vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe,</hi>

and diſpoſition, and framing of the parts thereof exiſteth thus by <hi>chance.</hi> For if there be no <hi>diuyne power,</hi> which framed the parts of it, digeſting them into this forme, which now we ſee, then is it neceſſarily to be acknowledged, that it hath its being by <hi>chance,</hi> according to the opinion of <hi>Democri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> who maintained, that all things were firſt framed of a caſual force &amp; concourſe of <hi>Atomi,</hi> or ſmal indiuiſible bodyes. But what is this, but mere doting madnes, and want of reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? for how can it be, that that, whoſe frame and making exiſteth with ſo great reaſon, prouidence and iudgement, ſhould haue its being by <hi>chance?</hi> One ſeeth a moſt ſumptuous building, framed withall art &amp; skill; all Architects admire the ſtructure of it; queſtion being asked, who made this curious edifice? It is anſweared, that it is made by no body; but that there was long ſince a mountaine in the ſame place, ſtored with trees, &amp; that it falling a ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der through an Earth quake, the parts of this mountaine being thus ſhiuered, did through meanes of this colliſion and fall, caſt and frame the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues caſually into this curious forme of a pallace. Now who is ſo ſimple, that would belieue this? And yet ſuch is the like caſe in the ſtupe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dious fabrick of the whole world, maintayned not to be made by the hand of

any diuine Power.</p>
               <p>Theſe, and many other like abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, incongruences and impoſſibilities do riſe and reſult from the foreſaid deniall of a <hi>Deity, &amp; a Prouidence;</hi> all which how ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe they are to all ſhew of truth, how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the very light of reaſon; &amp; how fearefull and dreadfull to be but ſpoken in words, who ſeeth not? Wherefore it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, that that principle, which is the fountaine of ſuch pudled aud ſtinking wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, muſt of neceſſity be moſt far diſtant &amp; eſtranged from all truth.

               <p>Wherefore when the Heathens either abſtained from euill, or did good through feare of offending their Gods, or deſire of pleaſing them, they were moued thereto, not through any perſwaſion, as it was falſe in reſpect of ſuch a God, but as it was true in generall.

               <p>IF it be ſo ordayned, that the <hi>reaſonable ſoule</hi> ſhall not be extinguiſhed with the body, but after the death of the body it ſhall liue and be immortall; then there can be no reaſon pretented for the denying of a <hi>diuine power, &amp; a Prouidence:</hi> for if the loweſt ſpirit be incorporeall, intelligent, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, why ſhould not then there be a ſupreme ſpirit, endued with the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietyes? Since, where there are ſeuerall degrees of natures, it is as neceſſary, that there be found one ſupreme degree, as well as the loweſt and midle degrees. Now it is ſhewed aboue, that there are certaine degrees of ſpirits far more excellent then mans ſoule, but vnder the ſoule of man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

there is no lower degree, for it ſelfe is the loweſt; ſeing that it is manifeſt, that the ſoules of beaſts do dye with their bodies. Furthermore, if mans ſoule be immortall, then can we not doubt, but there muſt be after this life a retribution of deeds &amp; acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; to wit, reward for vertue and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for vyce: for it is moſt abſurd to affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, that thoſe Soules, which while they were here inueſted with their bodies, did liue wickedly in al affluence and abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of riches and pleaſures, and in committing of wrongs, and which (before their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from hence) made no recompence for the ſame, ſhould after this life be equall in ſtate to thoſe, who wrongfully haue ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred many tribulations, and yet liued very vertuouſly; and that there is to be had no account for things committed here; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it followeth, that there ought to be a <hi>Prouidence,</hi> which is to giue a retributio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to euery ones deſerts. And hence it is, that all Philoſophers and all religions (who maintayned the ſoule to liue after the body) did withall maintaine, that there were future rewards and puniſhments, and did confeſſe a Prouidence of a <hi>ſupreme ſpirit,</hi> by the which theſe rewards &amp; puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are iuſtly diſpenſed. S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in his fourth ſermon <hi>de Prouidentia,</hi> handleth this

point elegantly in theſe wordes. <hi>If nothing be to follow after this life, then is there no God; for granting that there is a God, that God muſt needs be iuſt, and if he be iuſt, then doth he recompence euery one according to his deſeruings; And if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be after this life, then where shall euery one be rewarded according to his deſerts?

If therefore nothing be to follow hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the iuſt shall finally depart, remaining ſtill wronged, and the vniust with vndeſerued felicity. If then this should be ſo, where is iuſtice? For if Man do not receaue retaliation for ſuch things, as he hath done, then is God not iust; and if not iuſt, then he is not God &amp;c. But that there is a God, all Creatures do preach it; therefore it followeth that that God is iust: and if he be iust, then diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth he iuſtice to euery one. And if he giueth what is iust to euery man, then followeth it, that there muſt be a tyme after this life, in the which al shal receaue, anſwerably to their liues and actions.</hi> Thus far this Father.

no Prouidence of any diuyne power may ſeeme to be in mens affaires, the wicked doing all things according to their ſenſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and the vertuous being miſerably op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and afflicted; Notwithſtanding, if <hi>Man</hi> will take into his conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of all tymes, he ſhall ſee, that <hi>Gods prouidence</hi> is not ſo quyet, ſtill, and ſilent, but for the moſt part after ſome tyme paſſed (the meaſure of the ſins being once com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete and filled vp in any one Country) it diſcouereth &amp; bewrayeth it ſelfe by taking reuenge of the ſaid cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try with ſome heauy and notable puniſhment; of which point there are many examples extant both in the ſacred Scripture, as alſo in prophane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours; the ſtore whereof being ſo great, we will inſiſt in ſome of the moſt remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of them.</p>
               <p>The firſt then may be the <hi>generall deluge,</hi> in the which al mankind (except eight per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons) was vtterly extinguiſhed for their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normous liues.

it to <hi>Noe</hi> a hundred and twenty yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it came to paſſe. Secondly, in that God for a new increaſe of the world, cauſed an <hi>Arke</hi> to be made in that preſcribed forme &amp; meaſure, which might contayne the kinds of all liuing Creatures both vpon earth, &amp; ſuch as did fly, and might reſerue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from deſtruction; to wit, it being 300. cubits in length, fifty in breadth, &amp; thirty in height: which meaſure and largenes, that it was ſufficient for the receite not only of all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Creatures, but alſo for meat for them for one yeare, may eaſily be demonſtrated, and hath already bene made euident by le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arned men: ſo as it is cleare that this propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or quantity was appointed not by ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s aduiſe, but through the ſpeciall direction of the diuine Wiſedome.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe it proceeded from the foreſaid Prouidence of God, that at the beginning of the deluge euery kind of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Creature ſhould reſort to the Arke, &amp; take its fitting manſion. Fourthly, in that the globe of the water with the increaſe of the raine, which fell continually for the ſpace of forty daies and forty nights, was ſo great, as that it exceeded in height the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gheſt hils fifteene cubits.

obtayned mercy and pardon for the ſame: As the like is accuſtomed to fal out in da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers of ſhipwrack, where many moſt wicked men flie to God with great ſhew of piety; who conceauing a deepe remorſe of their former iniquities, and promiſing an ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, do purchaſe their ſoules ſaluation, by the loſſe of their bodyes.

the flouds, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this hapned, by the which they were made leſſe excuſable; who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the late and freſh memory of ſo great a chaſtiſment, would ingurgitate themſelues into all kind of wickednes, &amp; chiefly into moſt filthy and beaſtly luſts, which was indeed the chiefeſt cauſe of the foreſaid inundation. Certainly both the mercy &amp; iuſtice of God did ſhine moſt wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully in this worke; His mercy in that God (at the praiers of <hi>Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi>) ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe moſt ready to ſpare <hi>Sodome,</hi> if therein could be found, but ten iuſt perſons. Now what greater benignity and fauour can be conceaued, then to ſpare ten thouſands wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cked perſons for the ſakes often holy men liuing among them? So preciable and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable is the life of vertuous men in the eye of God. His iuſtice in like ſort appeared, ſeeing that ſo vnexpectedly, as not fearing any ſuch matter, and in ſo ſhort a tyme of repentance, God oppreſſed them with ſo cruell and dreadfull a torment: for what is more terrible, then an impetuous precipatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and falling downe from heauen of burning ſulphur or brimſtone in ſo great abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The waters all round about became ſo bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hereby that no liuing thing remained in them; yea the neighbour places alſo by reaſon of the filthy ſtench thereof were
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:2520:126"/>
made ſterill and barren; ſo as euen to this day, they bring forth nothing, but certaine aples full of a ſtinking duſt, ſeruing only as ſignes and remembrance of Gods ire &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation. For God was willing by this example to manifeſt vnto ſinners, what they were to expect after this life, to wit, ſulphureous fyer, and eternall vaſtity, or deſtruction.</p>
               <p>The third example may be that mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold<note place="margin">Exod. 7. c. 9.</note> caſtigation of <hi>Pharao,</hi> and the <hi>Egiptians</hi> for not diſmiſſing and ſetting at liberty the people of God. <hi>Moyſes</hi> deſcribeth this moſt euidently, who was not only preſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, but alſo an arbitratour or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour, whome God vſed as his inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t both in inflicting, continuing, and ceaſing thoſe puniſhments. Firſt, God conuerted all the waters in <hi>Egipt</hi> (whether riuers, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, or welſprings) into bloud, &amp; this thus continued for the ſpace of ſeauen dayes.

               <p>4.

now thither vntill they were all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed and waſted away.

Whereupon it followed, that although in the fortith yeare (when the land of Promiſe was to be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by them) all the murmurers were dead, yet in regard of the many thouſands proceeding from their children, and thoſe of the tribe of <hi>Leui</hi> (which amounted to 23. thouſand) there were then more to enter into the land of Promiſe, then were in the firſt yeare.</p>
               <p>9. <hi>Core, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiron</hi> being the chiefeſt men among the Iſraelites (ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by two hundred &amp; fifty of the nobleſt among them) rayſed a ſedition againſt <hi>Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron;</hi> and thus the mindes of the people were auerted from performing their<note place="margin">Num. 16. &amp; 28.</note> obedience, as if <hi>Moyſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> had ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly ſought the Principality and Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficality, and did not vndertake it at the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Therefore for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity of the matter, <hi>Moyſes</hi> appealed to the iudgment of God heerein, who decy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the cauſe by inflicting a moſt horrible chaſtiſement vpon them, in the eye of all the reſt; for <hi>Moyſes</hi> had fearce made an end of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>minations and threats, but the earth

And then gaping with a vaſt opennes, &amp; mighty fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and noyſe, it did abſorpe and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low downe <hi>Core, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiron,</hi> with all their tabernacles and goodes, and after cloſed it ſelfe togeather, not leauing any print or ſhew of its former opening; and as touching the other two hundred and fifty, being their aſſociates in rebelling, a huge fire from heauen ruſhed vpon them, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed them, ſo as no parcels of their bodies remayned.

               <p>Fiftly, thoſe things are to be conſidered, which chanced to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when they were gouerned by <hi>Iudges,</hi> and after they entred into the land of Promiſe; for as ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as (after the cuſtome of other countries) they fell to the worſhip of Idols, they were moſt grieuouſly afflicted by God, as being brought vnder the yoke and ſeruitude of their enemyes, but when ſoeuer they grew truly penitent of ſuch their Idolatry, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto God with a contrite and ſincere mind, then God (being at hand ready to commiſerate the diſtreſſed) raiſed vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Captaine or leader, which did vindicate and free them from their thraldome and oppreſſion, and did reduce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer liberty.

               <p>5. <hi>Ieroboam</hi> aduanced from a meane eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate to the Kingdome, was mainly bent to fortify &amp; ſettle himſelfe by al meanes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer; he fearing then, that if the People went yearely to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> to ſacrifice in the Temple of the Lord, that his Kingdome might be loſt, the people turning the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to <hi>Roboam</hi> King of <hi>Iuda;</hi> therefore for the better preuention hereof, he cauſed two golden calues to be erected vp as Gods, and

diuulged an Edict, whereby the people were commanded not to go to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> but to ſacrifice to thoſe two Idols. This proceeding might (perhaps) ſeeme much conducing to the preſeruation of his poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke ſtate; and yet in a mature conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the matter, nothing could be inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more ſorting &amp; fitting to the vtter ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion thereof; for it is ſaid in the third of the Kings cap. 13. <hi>For this cauſe the houſe of Ieroboam is ouerthrowne, and blotted out of the roundnes of the earth.</hi> He raigned 22. yeares, not without great troubles and moleſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; who being dead, his ſonne <hi>Nadab</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded; but he ſcarce gouerned two yeares, being depriued both of his life and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome by his ſeruant <hi>Baaſa,</hi> who inſtantly ſo extinguiſhed the race and family of <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,</hi> as that there was not left one thereof. And this very thing was threatned to him by the Prophet. But ſuch (for the moſt part) are the Counſels and proiects of polititians (of whome this <hi>Ieroboam</hi> may ſerue for an example) who make religion to be ſubiect and ſeruiceable to policy, &amp; who imbrace that profeſſion of faith, which beſt ſorteth eyther to the obtayning, or keeping, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing of their States, and other ſuch hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane reſpects: for although their ſubtle ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations and plots ſeeme at the firſt to be

Al which miſeries God by his Prophets did foretell to fall vnto them, by reaſon of their idolatry, and their other ſinnes.</p>
               <p>8. At the length, ſeeing the Kings of Iſrael, and the people would neuer ceaſe from ſinning, and particulerly from wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of Idols (notwithſtanding ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny comminations and threats, ſo many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions and increpations, and ſo many chaſtiſements inflicted by God for this their offence) they were in the end depriued of their Kingdome, Citties, houſes, grounds, poſſeſſions, and liberty, themſelues being carryed away into <hi>Aſſyria</hi> to liue in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall bondage and ſlauery. Iuſt after this manner, the prouidence of God carryed it<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe towardes the Kinges of <hi>Iuda,</hi> and that people; for as often as they yielded to the committing of Idolatry, they were worne out with diuers warres and calamities, till they became penite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of their former ſinnes; but when they worſhipped God truly and religiouſly, then they enioyed great proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity,

and were honoured with many vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoryes, as alſo flowed in all opulency and wealth, as it falled out in <hi>Abia, Aſa, Ioſaphaet,</hi> and <hi>Ezechias.</hi> For againſt <hi>Abia</hi> (<note n="25" place="margin">2.

But <hi>Aſa</hi> (<note n="26" place="margin">2. Paralip. c. 14.</note>) had a farre more famous victory; for <hi>Zara</hi> the Ethiopian, with a huge army conſiſting often hundred thouſand armed men, made warre vpon <hi>Aſa,</hi> who though farre inferiour in force, yet putting his truſt in our Lord, met him in the field, and vpon his humble prayers made to him, the Ethiopians were ſuddenly affrighted and diſmayed, and thereupon began to fly, but <hi>Aſa</hi> following them, killed moſt of the army, and returned enriched with in finite ſpoiles of the enemy.</p>
               <p>Neither was leſſe wonderfull that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory of (<note n="27" place="margin">Ibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem. 20.</note>) <hi>Ioſaphat,</hi> who only with his prayers, vertue, and aſſured hope of Gods aſſiſtance, without any weapons at all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercame a mighty army, which was gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of three very populous nations, to wit,

the <hi>Ammonites, Moabites,</hi> and the <hi>Idumeans.</hi> For his ſmall forces being drawne out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the enemy, he commanded his Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſters, who did ſing diuine ſeruice &amp; lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, to go before his ſouldiers, ſinging; at which ſight the Enemies were by Gods ſpeciall prouidence poſſeſſed with ſuch a fury, as that they killed one another, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a great valew of ſpoyles to the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes.</p>
               <p>To the former may worthily be adioined the victory of (<note n="28" place="margin">4. Reg. 19. &amp; 2.

with ſtripes for ſuch his ſacrilegious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; and his ſouldiers, which he brought with him to that end, were poſſeſſed with a great feare and diſmayednes. For there appeared vnto him a horſeman of a terrible aſpect, and rich in apparell, whoſe horſe comming violently vpon <hi>Heliodorus</hi> with his former feet, did greatly hurt him; &amp; then there were ſeene two yong men of excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſtrength and beauty, who on each ſide in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uading <hi>Heliodorus,</hi> did ſo whip him, as that he diſpayred of his life.

And thus much of theſe examples<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which are taken out of the holy Scriptures: for if we ſhould inſiſt in all other examples of this ſubiect, which do occurre in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Hiſtories, and other Eccleſiaſticall wryters, we ſhould find almoſt infinite of them: for there is no Nation, no Prouince, no citty, no village, where blaſphemyes, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledges and periuries haue not very often beene moſt dreadfully puniſhed by Gods owne hand; In ſo much that the very ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and feare of his chaſtiſements heere in hath beene ſufficient to deterre many men from the perpetrating of ſo heinous ſinnes.

<pb n="273" facs="tcp:2520:146"/>
there was after nothing to be found ſafe, but the ſiluer, which he had taken afore. Theſe things are related out of ancient wryters by <hi>Lactantius</hi> lib. 2. cap. 8. and diuers other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued authours make mention of the like euents in this kind. For anſwere hereto, it is to be ſaid, that theſe puniſhments do not proceed from the true God; but from the Diuells, who are emulous of diuinity; who that they may be accounted Gods, and that they may the more eaſily extort diuine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, endeauour to imitate the cuſtome &amp; proceeding of the true God. And from hence it riſeth, that there are ſo many viſions, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions, and Oracles; ſo many falſe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterate miracles perfourmed by them; ſo many benefits ſeeming to be beſtowed by them vpon their worſhippers; and ſo many puniſhments inflicted vpon ſuch, as ſeeme more negligent in their honours: for by their preſtigious ſleights and endeauours it was brought to paſſe, that a <hi>ſtatua</hi> or Image of <hi>Iuno Veienſis</hi> ſpoke to a ſouldier, that it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to go to Rome; that the Goddeſſe <hi>Fortune</hi> was accuſtomed to denounce perill &amp; danger in a Womans forme or ſhow; that a ſhip (drawne with a ſtring) did follow the hand of <hi>Claudia;</hi> that Rome ſhould be freed of the plague, if a ſerpent were ſent from <hi>Epidaurus;</hi> that <hi>Ceres Theb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>God ſuffered theſe euents both for the ſinnes of thoſe men, who deſerued to liue vnder the tiranny of the Diuells; as alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Heathens in committing indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties againſt their falſe Gods, did either ſinne againſt their conſcience, which perſwaded them, that there was a kind of diuinity in them; or otherwiſe committed theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces with contempt, not only of falſe Gods but alſo of all diuine and ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall power whatſoeuer. For ſeeing, they were ignorant of the true God, the creatour of all things, and with all did know by the light of reaſon, that thoſe vulgar powers, which were worſhipped of the common ſort were no Gods, they might more eaſily be induced to thinke, that there was no <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine power</hi> at all, by the which the world is gouerned; but that all things had their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and euent by a fatall neceſſity, or by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temerity and raſhnes of fortune. And from this ground it is, that among the <hi>Iaponians</hi> &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>China,</hi> ſuch as are ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, are ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:2520:147"/>
Atheiſts, and open contemners of all diuinity; or at leaſt, do greatly fluctuate &amp; ſtagger in their iudgments therein.</p>
               <p>Therfore when the Heathens (as in the examples aboue related) do commit any ſacrilegious act againſt their falſe Gods, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſinne againſt their conſcience, in the which they belieue, that there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine diuinity in thoſe Gods; or els they ſinne through a generall contempt of all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine power; wherfore (whatſoeuer the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is) it is not ſtrange, if the Heathens ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer puniſhments for ſuch their actions. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it any preiudice to what is deliuered in this Chapter, that among blaſphemous, ſacrilegious, and periured men, there is a far greater number of thoſe, who are not puniſhed in this life; then of thoſe who are puniſhed; Seing this is no ſigne or argument of any defect or want of Prouidence, but only of the delaying of the puniſhment. For it doth not neceſſarily belong to the nature of prouidence, to puniſh all ſinnes in this world; but to ſuffer actions and things for the tyme to be carryed according (for the moſt part) to the forces of the worker; the chiefeſt puniſhment being reſerued for the tyme to come; Since otherwiſe, mankind would ſhortly be extinguiſhed, and the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices or operations of vertue would rather
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:2520:148"/>
ſeeme to be ſeruilely coacted and enforced, then free, or proceeding from any ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or generous lyking of vertue.

               </head>
               <p>THE firſt argument againſt a diuine Prouidence may be this: Yf the world be gouerned by the Prouidence of ſome ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural power, then would not impiety &amp; wickednes ſo much preuaile and predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, nor haue ſuch proſperous euents againſt vertue and innocency: for it may ſeeme chiefly to belong to the prouidence of a gouernour, not to giue the bridle of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing looſely to the wicked, but to curbe them, and force them to better courſes; and on the other ſide to defend and cheriſh the pious, and to aduance them to honours
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:2520:148"/>
and riches. Yf in any great Citty the moſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious and prophane perſons ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually gouerne and ſterne all matters, wronging with all impunity others; and the vertuous ſhould euer reſt thus afflicted; who would ſay, that this Citty were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by a prouident &amp; iuſt Ruler? Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing in the world we may obſerue ſuch a perturbation of Order, as that a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter can hardly be conceaued; to wit, the wicked ruling and doing euery thing to their owne ſenſuality, and the vertuous miſerably afflicted &amp; oppreſſed; all which may ſeeme to impugne, that the world is gouerned by <hi>one ſupreme Prouidence,</hi> which iuſtly diſpoſeth and meaſureth all things.</p>
               <p>I anſwere hereto, and ſay, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Athiſts do chiefly ground themſelues vpon this argument; as alſo that the faithful are ſometimes troubled and diſtracted ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, as the Prophet Dauid in his Pſalme 72. inſinuateth himſelfe to haue bene mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued herein. But the anſwere hereto, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious, facile, and eaſy. For as there is a double end; the one belonging to this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral life, to wit, the tranquillity and peace of the common wealth; the other to the life to come, and this is the eternal glory in heauen: euen ſo we are to conſider a double Prouidence, wherof the one diſpoſeth the
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:2520:149"/>
meanes for the obtaining of the temporal end; the other of the eternal end. The firſt is humane and political, as reſting vpon mans wiſdome, and tending to a political and temporal good; this other is diuyne, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grounded vpon diuyne wiſdome, and directed to an eternal good or benefit.</p>
               <p>Therfore where it is ſaid, that it belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to <hi>Prouidence</hi> to bridle the wicked, not to ſuffer them to afflict the vertuous with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controule, and the like; this is true, if we ſpeake of politicall prouidence, and of temporall coercion and conſtraint; for ſeing this Prouidence is ordained to obtaine tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall peace and reſt, the function of it is to hinder (what in it lyeth) all wickednes and ſinnes, wherby the temporall peace may be diſturbed. Wherfore it may be truly gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that in what Commonwealth ſoeuer outrages are committed without any feare of puniſhment; the ſame either wanteth a gouernour, or at leaſt the magiſtrate thereof is vniuſt, partiall, and tyrannous.</p>
               <p>But if we ſpeake of that <hi>Supreme Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> (afore mentioned) then is it falſe to affirme, that it belongeth to its functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not to ſuffer the impious to gouerne and rule temporally; ſince indeed the contrary ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appertaineth to it, to wit, to ſuffer all things (as they are heere furniſhed with
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:2520:149"/>
their owne faculties and abilities) for the tyme to take and enioy their proceedings and deſires; and this for many cauſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> that we may ſpontaneouſly and voluntarily be carryed to the exerciſe of<note place="margin">VVhy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth the courſes of the wicked in this VVorld.</note> vertue, &amp; not be compelled thereto through any neceſſity: for vertue coacted and forced, is not vertue, but rather a bondage of the mind; ſince true vertue exerciſeth it ſelfe not through any ſeruile feare of puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but through loue of honeſty: therfore to the end, that true vertue and perfect deſert may haue their due place, it was neceſſary, that the <hi>Diuine Prouidence</hi> ſhould not conſtraine men thereto, but ſhould leaue euery man to his free choice and liberty herein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> becauſe the dignity and worth of eternall reward is ſo great, that if it be duely conſidered, it is abundantly ſufficient to inflame our deſires to the loue of it, and to excite vs to all vertue and ſanctity; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſhould much impugne the excellency of ſo ineſtimable a felicity, if men through compulſion were driuen to the ſeeking of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> if eternall puniſhments be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely expended and conſidered, they are fully preuailing to deterre men from all fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitious and impious attempts. Wherupon if God ſhould not chaſtice men in this world,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:2520:150"/>
yet were they not deſtitute of his Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; for it is ſufficient, that he promiſeth rewards, &amp; threatneth puniſhments for the tyme to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> if by Gods diſpoſall &amp; his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, wickednes ſhould euer receaue its retaliation and recompence in this world (as we ſee, politicall Prouidence inflicteth the ſame) then would the world be in a ſhort tyme extinguiſhed and ended; wheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it would follow, that there ſhould be few imbracers of vertue, and the meanes for the wicked to their ſaluation ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded and ſhut vp.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fiftly,</hi> the malignity of the wicked is not in vaine permitted by God, ſeeing by reaſon therof the vertue of the iuſt is often more ſtirred vp and exerciſed, and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth more worthily; as alſo there is giuen them thereby an occaſion of a greater me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and a more glorious crowne. For take away the ſeuerity of tyrants, and then there ſhalbe no glory of Martyrs; take away the wrongs proferred by euill men, and there ſhall not appeare the patience or longani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the iuſt and vertuous; briefly, the world would be depriued of an infinite ſeed of goodnes, if God ſhould euer reſtraine and curbe the wicked in this world. The ſame malignity ſerueth to puniſh as wel
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:2520:150"/>
the ſinnes of the iuſt, as of the impious (as is euident out of the holy Scripture.) So God diuers tymes vſed the malice and ambition of the <hi>Aſsyrians, Chaldeans, Perſians, Egiptians,</hi> &amp; <hi>Romanes,</hi> as a meanes, wherwith to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> &amp; other nations; ſuffering them according to a limited proportion of tymes, places, perſons, calamities, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, to afflict and moleſt the people of God, and otheer countries; and this order God hath obſerued in all ages, and will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue it till the conſummation of the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixtly,</hi> we are furthermore inſtructed from this Prouidence, that temporall bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits are not much to be eſteemed; ſince both the vertuous, and the vicious do promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly participate of them; and in the which the wicked do commonly more increaſe, then the pious and the iuſt. Which point be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, then how great are thoſe benefits, which God hath promiſed and prepared for his ſeruants? For if he doth not giue theſe temporall commodities (ſo much prized) to ſuch as daily diſhonour him with their bad liues, then what, and how great are thoſe rewards, which he hath reſerued only for ſuch, as do truly feare and ſerue him? To be briefe, this temperature of Gods prruidence doth greatly commend and magnify the wonderfull benignity &amp; clemency of God,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:2520:151"/>
which while it ſlowly proceedeth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, it daily expecteth the conuerſion of ſinners. And yet it proceedeth in ſuch ſort, as that it is not altogeather voyde of iuſtice &amp; ſeuerity; becauſe often by vnaccuſtomed meanes euen in this life, it puniſheth ſinnes, to ſhow that God doth not ſleepe, but that he will in due tyme exact an account of all men. From all which, it appeareth, that this Prouidence, which ſuffereth ſo great a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation in humane and temporall things, is perfect and grounded vpon moſt forcible reaſon; ſince the wrong of the vertuous is temporall &amp; momentary, and is to be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged hereafter for eternall reſt and beatitude. He that diligently weigheth this point, wil not only, not be ſcandalized at the vneuen diſpenſation of theſe humane things; but will greatly admire &amp; prayſe the Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, who vpon ſo iuſt motiues permitteth the ſame.</p>

               </head>
               <p>EXPERIENCE inſtructeth vs, that mens negotiations and buſines haue (for the moſt part) euents and
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:2520:151"/>
ſucceſſe, anſwerable to the induſtry &amp; care vſed by them therein, and not according to the right or equity of the cauſe; wherupon it often falleth out, that who maintaineth the moſt in iuſt cauſes, doth preuaile in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; which conſideration may ſeeme to inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, that each man is to be left to his owne Prouidence, without diſquiſition or ſearch of any other Prouidence. Accordingly he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reto it is to be remembred, that a great Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall or Leader in the warres (who had gotten diuers worthy victoryes, and had taken a Prince priſoner) diſcourſing with him of the <hi>Prouidence of God,</hi> in matters of warres, &amp; laying his hand vpon his ſword, ſaid, That (&amp; no other) was the Prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, wherupon he was to reſt and depend.</p>
               <p>I anſwere, that the ſolution of this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument much relyeth vpon the former; for Mens affayres for the moſt part do ſucceed according to their labour, care and ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude vſed therein, in that <hi>the diuine</hi> and <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Prouidence</hi> hath decreed to ſuffer, that matters (during the ſeaſon and tyme of this world) ſhalbe carryed according to their owne peculiar motions and forces, the reynes of working thus, or not thus, being freely granted to mans nature. Therefore where greater induſtry or power is found (though leſſe iuſtice or equity) there it is
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:2520:152"/>
commonly acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panyed with more happy and fortunate euents. The reaſons of Gods permiſſion here in are aboue ſet downe and vnfoulded. Ad hereto, that though the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauours of the wicked may (for the tyme) be ouer preuailing, yet there is no perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity or continuance thereof; for this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity is for the moſt part tempered, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ouer ballanced with many aduerſities and afflictions. Seing many there are, who either in their firſt beginnings, or in their progreſſe (at what tyme they hould them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues moſt free from all ſudden conuulſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of miſery and infelicity) are vtterly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne. This appeareth firſt in the moſt celebrious &amp; famous Monarchies that euer haue flouriſhed: for we read, that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy of the <hi>Aſsyrians</hi> was ouerthrowne by the <hi>Chaldeans;</hi> that of the Chaldeans by the <hi>Perſians</hi> and the <hi>Medes;</hi> this of the <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> by the <hi>Grecians;</hi> &amp; the monarchy of the <hi>Grecians</hi> by the <hi>Romans,</hi> which is at this preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t much obſcured of its former honour, and brought to great ſtraits. Againe the ſame point is alſo made cleare in the perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Monarchs themſelues, if we but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the calamityes and miſeryes, which the moſt powerfull and moſt formidable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them haue ſuſtained. For <hi>Nabuchodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nozor</hi> being placed vpon the higheſt pinacle

of proſperity, and after the ouerthrow of ſo many Countries and nations, was ſudde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly ſtroken with a ſentence from heauen, and compelled to liue in deſart places after the manner of beaſts. <hi>Baltaſar</hi> (nephew to the former) being deuoted and giuen to epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſme and ſenſuality, was flame in that very night, when his Citty was taken. <hi>Cyrus,</hi> when he had obtained the honour of ſo many victories, was (with the loſle of his army) pittifully maſſacred by the <hi>Scithians.

               <p>VVE ſee, that all naturall things do euer proceed after one and the ſame manner, and do retayne one courſe and order. As the Sunne (for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple) we obſerue to ryſe, to ſet, to runne, or renew his circles, and
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:2520:153"/>
to make with his approach and departure the accuſtomed ſeaſons of the yeare. In like ſort all ſublunary bodyes to grow &amp; decay and one to be procreated and generated of another (without end) to the perpetuity or continuance of it <hi>ſpecies</hi> or kind. Now all this procedure and carriage of things riſeth from the force of nature, which is accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to hold ſo perfect &amp; conſtant an order. And therefore (ſaith the Atheiſt) no other Prouidence or Deity (beſides nature) is to be ſought after, neither any rewards or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments are to be expected. I anſwere; &amp; firſt ſay, that the Atheiſts of theſe dayes do chiefly ſupport themſelues with this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as <hi>S. Peter</hi> prophecyed in his ſecond epiſtle c. 7. <hi>Venient in nouiſſimis diebus &amp;c.</hi>

Againe all that procraſtination and delay proceedeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the benignity of God by the which he expecteth each mans ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Furthermore, they erre, who affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me

the world euer to continue in one, &amp; the ſame ſtate; for long ſince it was ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed with water, and hereafter it ſhalbe conſumed with fyar, &amp; then there ſhalbe created new heauens and a new earth. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, all ſuch things, as may ſeeme to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by force of nature, are indeed the workes of an intelligent mynd and of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence; for theſe two do not impugne the one the other; for the motion of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, the ſituation of the ſtars, the diſpoſal of the earth, mountaines, riuers, and ſeas, the formes of liuing Creatures and plants, as alſo their beginnings, increaſe, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation are the works of <hi>Prouidence</hi> (as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue we haue fully demonſtrated.)

increaſing, waxing old, and dying (which is indifferenly common to men with beaſts) as alſo from the conformity of corporeall members in them both.

               <p>IF there be a <hi>Diuine Power,</hi> it is credible, that it doth not intermeddle with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane affaires; but being happy and bleſſed
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:2520:155"/>
in it ſelfe, is content to enioy its owne <hi>Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and to be freed from the cares of men. This may be probably coniectured, both becauſe it may ſeeme vnworthy of ſuch a maieſty to deſcend to ſo baſe and vile mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; as alſo in that he being bleſſed in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſeeth nothing out of it ſelfe; and laſtly becauſe the vndertaking the charge of any ſuch matters cannot be aduantageous or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall vnto him.</p>
               <p>I anſwere, that in this ſort, <hi>Epicurus, Lucretius, Pliny,</hi> and ſome others of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients did diſpute, who meaſured God by the narrow ſtraits of their owne vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. And certainly, if the <hi>Supreme Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,</hi> or <hi>God</hi> were a limited and bounded nature, and had not an infinit power of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, this former teaſon might ſeeme probable. For then it would follow, that it were better for God not to attend to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane affaires; both becauſe he could not without moleſtation and diſtraction per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the charge, <hi>tam multiplicis &amp; triſtis mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery,</hi> (as Pliny ſaith) <hi>of ſo multiplicious, and vngratefull a ministery, or function;</hi> as alſo in that this labour would call him from better and more pleaſing buſines: but this conceite of God is ouer groſſe and dull; and vnworthy of him: for as the <hi>Diuine Eſsence</hi> is infinite, in whome euery thing is contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:2520:155"/>
                  <hi>eminenter,</hi> after an eminent and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar manner; ſo his vnderſtanding is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, extending it ſelfe to euery intelligible thing, and this without labour, or paine, but only by the neceſſity of his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Neither doth the multiplicity of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes hinder his attention to particulars; for he as perfectly conſidereth euery particular thing, as if it only were propoſed vnto him; ſeing to euery ſuch particular he ſendeth forth an infinite beame or light of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. The holy Scripture inſinuateth this point moſt excellently in many places, and eſpecially in the 23. of <hi>Eccleſiasticus</hi> in theſe words: <hi>Oculi domini decies millies &amp;c. The eyes of the Lord are</hi> 10000. <hi>tymes brighter, then the Sunne, behoulding all the wayes of men, and conſidering the most ſecret parts.</hi> That is, all things whatſoeuer which lye hid &amp; latent in the moſt ſecret corners of the Heart.</p>
               <p>Therefore this conſideration or care of ſmall things is not vnworthy the <hi>Diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty,</hi> but very worthy, or rather it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; ſince otherwiſe it would follow, that God ſhould be ignorant of many things. And though ſuch things, and diuers of mans actions be but baſe, ſordid, and vyle, yet the vnderſtanding and iudgment of them is not baſe and vyle, neither is the reaſon or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Iuſtice vile, by the which a fitting
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:2520:156"/>
retribution or reward is allotted vnto them.</p>
               <p>Neither is it preiudiciall, that God is in himſelfe moſt fully bleſſed; ſince this only proueth, that he taketh not the care of things to the end, that he might become more bleſſed or happy thereby, or that he might reape ſome benefit by ſuch his doing; but it proueth not abſolutly, that he endeauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth nothing out of himſelfe. For becauſe he is <hi>Summum bonum,</hi> and the fulnes of all goodnes, as containing in himſelfe <hi>eminenter</hi> all goodnes whatſoeuer; it was moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, that he ſhould not keepe this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of goodnes ſhut vp within himſelfe; but ſhould ſuffer it to flow into his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, according to the ſeuerall degrees &amp; kinds of things, and the meaſure of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of euery one, by creating, framing, conſeruing, and directing ech thing to its peculiar end. For that ſaying is moſt true: <hi>Bonum eſt ſui diffuſiuum. Goodnes is of a ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and dilating nature.</hi> Therefore no want, nor expectation of any priuate benefit, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uited God to create and preſerue things, but only Gods owne ſupereminent goodnes: to wit, that his goodnes might be diffuſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to things created, according to the nature of euery one of them, and might be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with them. To conclude this point, it is fully and copiouſly proued aboue, that,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:2520:156"/>
God hath a knowledge and care of the leaſt creatures that are, as of mice, gnats, wormes and the like; then with how much more reaſon is he to ſhroud man vnder the wings of his Prouidence, who in regard of his Soule beareth a great conformity &amp; reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance with God?</p>
               <p>It may be heere replyed, That God knoweth (indeed) what men do, thinke, or ſay, but yet he taketh no care of theſe things; Like vnto potent and mighty Princes, who in regard of the ſecurity of their ſtate, little reſpect, what the Communalty ſpeake of them. But in anſwere hereof, I ſay, this is moſt abſurdly ſpoken: for ſeeing man is the worke of God, in whoſe ſoule he hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted the lawes of Iuſtice, and of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, it is a charge (euen in reaſon) peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incumbent and belonging to him, to ſee, that man liueth according to thoſe lawes; for the workeman ought euer to be moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous and carefull, that his worke be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; the Law giuer, that the lawes preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed may be obſerued by his ſubiects; And finally, the Parents, how the children do beare and carry themſelues.

                  </gap>ynd ſmall firmnes therin; ſeing that reaſon, wherupon it chiefly grounds it ſelfe is moſt weake. This reaſon is taken from the ſimilitude of bodyes, which is found
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:2520:160"/>
betwene Man and Beaſt. For we ſee (ſay the Patrons of this heatheniſh opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) that men and beaſts are conceaued, formed, borne, nouriſhed, do alſo increaſe, grow old, and dye after one and the ſame ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner. In like ſort they conſiſt of the like parts of the body, both internall and externall, which like parts haue the like vſes in them both; Therefore (conclude they) that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a beaſt dyeth and breatheth out his laſt, the Soule vaniſheth &amp; euapourateth it ſelfe into nothing, nor any thing of it remaineth after life; ſo alſo it may ſeeme to be ſaid, that man dying, his ſoule alſo dyeth, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth into nothing.</p>
               <p>But this reaſon is moſt feeble, and of no force, for though there be a great affinity betwene the ſoule of Man (as it is endued with reaſon, &amp; is called <hi>Mens</hi>) &amp; the ſoule of beaſts, the difference is infinite; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the which great diſparity, we may deſeruedly gather, that the Soule of man, as being of a high and diuine order or nature, dyeth not; though that of beaſts is abſolutly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed euen with the body. For beaſts do not perceaue in any ſort thoſe things, which belong to men; neither is there any communication or commerce of buſines or deliberation betwene man and them. As for example, dogs, and horſes know not

Againe they ſee the Sunne, the Moone, trees, houſes, cittyes and villages, but they know not, nor thinke what they are; to what end they are directed, or from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; how they proceed. All their knowledge is reſtrayned to few things; to wit, to thoſe things, as are pleaſing, or diſpleaſing to their nature. Of theſe only they iudge, and this after a confuſed and brutiſh manner, conceauing them vnder the ſhew and title of being profitable or diſprofitable, conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyent or inconuenyent; for they loue not their maiſter for any other reſpect, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by the help of their phantaſy they apprehend him vnder the ſhew of profit, in that he giueth them meat, or the like. In like ſort on the contrary part the ſheep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Therfore ſeing beaſts haue a knowledge ſo imperfect and limited, and apprehend

nothing, but what appertaineth to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of their bodyes and lyues, nor are delighted, or grieue at any thing, but in reſpect as that thing affecteth their body well or euill; it hereupon manifeſtly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that the Soule of beaſts doth periſh together with their body.</p>
               <p>For if the ſoule of a beaſt cannot eleuate it ſelfe (in knowing and apprehending) to ſome thing, which is aboue the body and which properly belongeth to a ſpirituall nature; it is euident, that that ſoule is not ſpirituall, nor eleuated aboue its body, but altogether immerſed and drowned in a corporeall and bodily nature. For the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of any thing is knowne from it, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and the operation from the obiect, about which it is conuerſant, or buſied. Therefore ſeeing this Obiect, and its <hi>ratio formalis,</hi> or the true &amp; natiue reaſon (which is the profit or hurt comming to the body) doth only reſpect the body; it muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be granted, that the ſubſtance of the ſoule in beaſts is tyed and reſtrayned to the body.

               <p>SO great is the capacity and largneſſe of the ſoule or mind, as that no riches, no dignities, no Kingdomes, not the Empire of the whole world, no pleaſures, briefly no finite and limitable good can quench her <hi>inſatiable thirſt and deſire;</hi> but to this end it is needfull, that ſhe enioy ſome one immenſe, infinite, and boundleſſe good, and ſuch as containeth in it ſelfe by way of eminency or prehemine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy the fulnes of all good what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer.

                  <hi>I shalbe ſatisfyed and filled, when thy glory shall appeare,</hi> as if he would ſay, no other thing can giue me full contentment, except the manifeſtation of thy glory, which is an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and illimitable good.

Thou hast made vs like vnto thee, and our hart is vnquyet, till it reſt in thee.</hi> Now if the Soule were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to the narrownes of the body, it ſhould not be capable of an infinite good, neither ſhould her deſire be extended to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing but what were conducing and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to a corporall life; as it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in other liuing creatures For the Body and the matter doth reſtraine the appetite, deſire, and capacity of the forme. From whence it proceedeth, that by how much the forme of any body is more materiall, by ſo much it is more narrow and leſſe capable; but the more ſpirituall and more eleuated the forme is, the more ample and the more enlarged it is, and extendeth it ſelfe to more things, thereby the better to perfect it ſelfe. For bodyes wanting life (as ſtones and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals) as alſo their formes, becauſe they are materiall and groſſe in the higheſt degree, do deſire nothing out of themſelues, neither do they endeauour any thing to further their perfection, but reſt in themſelnes quiet and dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But Plants (becauſe their forme is
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:2520:165"/>
more pure and perfect) do couet (after their manner) nouriſhment, and do attract it from without, as alſo they change it, diſtributing it through the whole body, and conuerting it into their owne ſubſtance: Beſides they ſend forth flowers, fruits, and ſeedes; &amp; ſo they continue dayly working to the aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, conſeruation, perfection, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of themſelues; but becauſe they haue no ſenſe or feeling of their nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they therfore receaue neither pleaſure nor griefe thereby.</p>
               <p>Liuing Creatures (in that their forme is in a higher degree) do not only performe all thoſe operations, which plants do; but with all they haue knowledge and ſenſe of their nouriſhment; yea they mooue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they ſeeke it, from the vſe of it they take pleaſure, and from the want of it they receaue griefe and moleſtation. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all their knowledge, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or liking, is limited within certaine narrow bounds; for it only extendeth it ſelfe to the profit or hurt of their bodyes; ſo as they apprehend no other thing, they co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet and fly no other thing, they are deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and grieue at no other thing; which is a manifeſt demonſtration, that their Soule depends only of their body: for their ſoule therfore perceaues and deſires nothing, but
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:2520:166"/>
what conduceth to the reſt &amp; good of their corporall life, becauſe their ſoule dependeth of the felicity of their body. Aboue all other liuing Creatures, is man indued with a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſoule or mind, whoſe knowledge &amp; affection is not limited to things belonging to the body, but is altogeather illimitable, extending it ſelfe to euery truth &amp; to euery kind of good, (as is aboue ſaid) both which beare no reference or reſpect to the body; And from hence it followeth, that the Souls capacity or ability either in knowing, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, or in taking delight is infinite; no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then the ability of ſpirits or celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Intelligences, which is an vnanſwerable argument that the ſoule of man is not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depending of the body, and neceſſarily tyed to the ſame.</p>
               <p>This point is further thus confirmed: <hi>Subſtantiae ſeparatae</hi> (as they are called) that is incorporeall ſubſtances, do therfore enioy the force of vnderſtanding, and do extend themſelues <hi>ad totum ens,</hi> to euery thing; and <hi>ad totum verum &amp; bonum,</hi> to euery verity &amp; goodnes, becauſe they are ſimple formes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuated aboue all matter, &amp; not depending of the ſame, as Philoſophy teacheth. And<note place="margin">Aristotle 12. Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſ. c. 9.</note> hence it is, that there is no ſpirituall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but euen in that reſpect it is intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and vnderſtanding. Therfore ſeing the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:2520:166"/>
Soule of man is endued with the faculty of vnderſtanding, and is in her ſelfe of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion and largnes, as that ſhe ſtretcheth her ſelfe to the whole latitude of <hi>Ens</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall; that is, to euery truth, and euery thing that is good (by vnderſtanding what is true, and affecting and louing what is good) no otherwiſe then ſpirituall and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated ſubſtances do; it followeth, that the ſoule doth not depend vpon any matter or bodily ſubſtance. For where there is <hi>effectus adaequatus,</hi> there is alſo <hi>cauſa adaquata;</hi> that is, where there is a proper and peculiar effect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there alſo is to be found a proper and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar cauſe, from whence the effect riſeth. But in the Soule of Man the effect is found, to wit, the force of vnderſtanding, and the capacity of euery truth and euery good; therefore the cauſe alſo is to be found, that is, a ſpirituall nature independent of matter or of a body.</p>

               <p>THere are in the nature of things ſome liuing formes, which are ſeparated from all matter both in their eſſence and manner of exiſtence, with the Philoſophers
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:2520:167"/>
do cal <hi>Intelligences,</hi> or <hi>ſubſtantias ſeparatas,</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated ſubſtances, and Chriſtians tearme them <hi>Spirits,</hi> or <hi>Angels.</hi> There are alſo ſome others, which both in their Eſſence and exiſtence are altogether tyed and immerſed in the matter, wherin they are, and ſuch are the Soules of beaſts. Therfore there oughtto be ſome other formes betwene the former two; which in regard of their Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, may not depend of their body, that ſo they may be like vnto ſpirits or Angels; yet for their exiſtence (that is, that they may exiſt after a conuenient maner) they are to haue a body, that therin they may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the ſoules of beaſts, and theſe are the ſoules of men. This argument is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from analogy and proportion; in that this degree of things ſeemeth to be beſt fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, leaſt otherwiſe we ſhould paſſe from one extreme to another without a meane; to wit, from a nature abſolutly mortal &amp; drowned in a body, to a nature abſolutly immortal and ſeparated from a body; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore betwene theſe two, there is to be a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, partly mortal, and partly immortal: mortall according to the body, and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal according to the Soule: And the very Soule it ſelfe according to its Eſſence is to be immortal, and to be ranged with ſpirits; though according to the manner of its exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:2520:167"/>
and as informing a mortal body, it is to be like the ſoules of beaſts. For the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Soule of man with the body, as alſo the informing and the viuific<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And thus it falleth out, that man containeth in himſelfe the powers and faculties of both the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes, I meane of ſpirits and beaſts; being for the body and ſenſe, like vnto beaſtes; for the ſoule, to ſpirits or intelligences. Vpon which occaſion the Platonicks do cal man the <hi>Horizon</hi> of the whole <hi>Vniuerſe</hi> of things created. For ſeing the vniuerſe of things doth conſiſt (as it were) of two <hi>Hemiſpheres,</hi> to wit of a ſpiritual nature, and a corporal nature; Man partaking of both theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes, doth ioyne the ſpiritual nature (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the higher <hi>Hemiſphere</hi>) with the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral nature, the lower <hi>Hemiſphere.</hi> For this very ſame reaſon alſo, Man is called <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>FOR the more acceſſion of reaſons in this point, it may be alledged, that there is a greater aſſociation and affinity in nature betwene the Soule of man and ſpirits, or Angels, then betwene man and beaſts: For as ſpirits or Angels haue their knowledge and deſire circumſcribed, or encompaſled with no limits, and are delighted with the beauty of truth and vertue; in like ſort is the ſoule or mynd of man; In ſo much that in this reſpect there is no diſparity betwene a ſoule and a ſpirit, though there be a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the perfection of the operations, proceeding from the vnderſtanding and the will in them both. Now the ſenſe, knowledge, and affection or deſire of beaſts is reſtrained to their feeding, and to venery. Furthermore the Soule of man hath ſociety and familiarity with ſpirits, conuerſeth with them, intreateth help and ayde from them, diſcourſeth, diſputeth, and iudgeth of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſtates, and wiſheth her ſelfe to be like in dignity to them: But no like affinity is diſcerned betweene man and beaſts; for beaſts can neither apprehend nor deſire the
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:2520:168"/>
ſtate of man, neither is there any communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Counſell or aduiſe betweene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Therefore ſo farre forth, as belongeth to the condition of Mortality and immortality, it is not to be wondred, if mans Soule doth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther follow the condition and nature of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits (betweene whome there is ſo great a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude and reſemblance) then of beaſts from whome the Soule doth ſo infinitely differ.</p>

               <p>IF the Soule could not conſiſt without the body, then ſhould the ſoules chiefeſt felicity be placed in a corporall life &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the body, and her greateſt miſery in the affliction and death of the body; vpon the force of which inference the Sect of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures</hi> and others (who did hold the ſoule to be vtterly extinguiſhed with the body) taught the chiefeſt good to reſt in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the body.

               <p>A NATVRE which is intelligent, and indued with an vnderſtanding is the worthieſt nature of all others, which are in the world; this is proued, in that, ſuch a nature is capable of all natures; for it comprehendeth them all, it vſeth them al, and applyeth them to its owne benefit; for it taketh profit not only from terrene and earthly things, but alſo fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> celeſtial things, as from the light, darkenes, day, night, wynds, ſhowers, heates, coldes, and from the foure Elements themſelues.

               <p>VVE ſee, that things are brought to that perfection, whereof they are capable; for example, Plants and all other kinds of liuing Creatures do by little and little increaſe, and are ſtrengthened ſo farre forth, as belong both to their body, and to all the facultyes of the vegetatiue or ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue ſoule, that ſo at the length they may come to that height of perfection, whereof each kind of them is capable. Therfore it muſt needes be expected, that mans Soule ſhould in like ſort arriue and aſcend to the higheſt top of its owne perfection: for ſeing theſe inferiour and moſt vyle creatures do obtaine the perfection of their owne nature, why ſhould not then that, which is moſt pretious and moſt worthy among them all, in the end gaine the ſame? But this the Soule of man cannot poſſibly performe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it continueth after this life, immortall. Now the perfection of Mans Soule conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in wiſdome &amp; vertue, with the which her chiefeſt powers are beautifyed &amp; ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and by meanes of which, thoſe powers obtayne their ends &amp; chiefe perfection: But
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:2520:173"/>
few there are, who in this life giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the obtaining of wiſdome, and therefore the greateſt part of men make ſmall or no progreſſe therein; and thoſe who ſpend their tyme in the ſearch or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing of it, do ſcarcely get the hundreth part of that abundance of wiſdome, wherof the mynd of man is capable: for though a man ſhould liue a thouſand yeares, yet might he daily profit and increaſe therein, &amp; yet not obtaine it in its higheſt meaſure. Therfore it is neceſſary, that the Soule of Man doth liue after the death of the body, that in the next life (ſeing in this it cannot) it may come &amp; arryue to its perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; ſince otherwiſe in vaine ſhould that capacity and extenſion of the Soule be giuen her; in vaine ſhould that vnquenchbale deſire of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge be engrafted in her; for that capacity and deſire is in vayne, which cannot be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and ſatisfyed. Beſides, it is moſt abſurd to ſay, that Nature, which in the ſmalleſt &amp; moſt deſpicable things neuer doth any thing without a due purpoſe &amp; end, ſhould in the moſt noble creature of all, worke and labour ſo much in vaine, and to no deſigned drift, or proiect.</p>

               <p>IT is certaine, that the Soule of man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know it ſelfe in this life, except it be very obſcurely and confuſedly; (euen as he which ſeeth a thing farre of through a cloud perceaueth it imperfectly, as not being able to diſcerne the colours or lineaments of it.) Now this want of the Soules perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it ſelfe, was the cauſe of ſo many different opinions of the Philoſophers, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching its owne ſubſtance, ſome of them tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching it to be of a fiery ſubſtance; others an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yery; and ſome others, that it was a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance taken from the ayre &amp; from the ſoule of the world (as their phraſe was.) The Soule then knoweth not, either what it ſelfe is, or of what quality, whether a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or pure ſpirit, or conſiſting of a moſt thin body; whether it hath diſtinct facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and powers in it ſelfe, or that it perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth all her operations immediatly by it ſelfe; what is the power and nature of thoſe faculties; how they performe their functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; how the obiects do meet and aſſociate themſelues with their faculties; how the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans and inſtruments of the ſenſes do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:2520:174"/>
and cooperate with the animal ſpirits. In theſe and almoſt all other things belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to her ſelfe, the Soule is ſtrangely blind, and diuineth, and coniectureth of them, as it were in a dreame. Therfore if the Soule doth periſh togeather with the body, ſhe neuer knoweth her ſelfe, but remaines ignorant thereof, both when ſhe is firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred, whyle ſhe liueth, and after her death. But now it is moſt fitting both in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and reaſon, that ſometimes ſhe might be able to contemplate her ſelfe, to ſee and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to apprehend her owne beauty, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ornaments: for as nothing more clearly belongeth to the Soule, then her owne Nature, and ſuch things as are intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecall and inward to her; ſo no knowledge is more neceſſary to her, then the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of her ſelfe, and things appertaining to her; for ſhe is moſt neere and de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>re to her ſelfe. Therefore it muſt neceſſarily be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that ſhe is not extinguiſhed after this life, but that, after ſhe is once freed of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and of all corporall obiects (which afore ſhe apprehended by helpe of the externall ſenſes) and that by meanes thereof, ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyeth her owne ſimplicity, then ſhall ſhe ſee her ſelfe diſtinctly and clearly; and ſhall daily eſteeme thoſe her goods &amp; ornaments, which in this life ſhe ſo ſmally prized. For
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:2520:175"/>
one kind of vnderſtanding agrees to her, whiles ſhe is tyed to this mortall body; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, when by meanes of the bodyes death, ſhe ſhal be ſet at liberty, &amp; ſhal nakedly exiſt by her ſelfe. For while ſhe remaynes in the body, ſhe can know nothing perfectly, but what is corporall, and vnder a corporall ſhew; wherupon it followeth, that ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee, or know her ſelfe; but after ſhe is once diuorced from the body, ſhe ſhall then take the forme and manner of vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding anſwerable to ſpirits, and then ſhall diſcerne ſpirituall things, as now ſhe appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth by her eyes corporall things. For the manner of knowing doth euer anſwere to the manner of exiſtence, and agreeth to the ſtate of the thing which knoweth; ſince euery thing worketh according to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of its owne nature.</p>

               <p>THIS corporeall World, as alſo all things contained therein, were made for man (as is aboue ſhewed;) for all things are diſpoſed in that ſort, as they may beſt ſerue to the benefit and profit of man. Thus the world ſeemeth nothing els, then a vaſt
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:2520:175"/>
houſe furniſhed withall things neceſſary, whoſe inhabitant, poſſeſſour, or <hi>Fructuarius</hi> is man. So that ſuppoſing man were not, then were there no vſe of the world, but it ſhould be, as a deſart ſeruing only for a denne of wild beaſts, and for a wood of thornes. Therfore ſeeing all things are firſt inſtituted for man, it followeth, that man is a moſt excellent thing, and created for a far greater and higher end, then it can attaine in this life; for ſeing ſo many different ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices of things, and ſo wonderfull riches are prepared for man, for his better and more eaſy leading of this ſhort and mortall life; how can it be thought, that no good or hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pynes expecteth him after his death, but that his Soule vtterly decayeth with his body? Doubtleſly, this is a great argument, that he is ordained to enioy (after his emigration &amp; paſſing out of this life) a moſt noble, honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and admirable felicity &amp; happines.</p>
               <p>This point is further confirmed. If the Soule doth periſh with the body, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that the world, and al its admirable furniture was only framed by nature, that man for a ſhort ſeaſon and tyme might liue, eate, drinke, ſleepe, in gender, and then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently for euer decay. Thus this ſhould be all the good, the end, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſo worthy and admirable a worke. But it is
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:2520:176"/>
not likely, that to ſo meane &amp; ſmall an end the heauens ſhould be inceſſantly caryed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, with ſuch a daily motion: That the Sunne, Moone, and Starrs ſhould ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue their courſes; that the change of day and night, and the viciſſitude or continuall circles of tymes and ſeaſons, as ſpring, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, autumne, and winter ſhould be ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Againe, that winds ſhould blow, the clouds ſhould be gathered togeather, the ſhowers ſhould be powred downe; that the earth ſhould cauſe ſo many kinds of flowers and fruits, &amp; ſhould containe within its bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſuch ineſtimable treaſure; that the Sea ſhould bring forth ſuch ſeuerall ſorts of fiſh, the ayre ſhould abound with ſo great ſtore of byrds, &amp; Nature her ſelfe ſhould ſo pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully labour in the producing of all things; And all this to no other end, but that man (being a mortall creature) ſhould for a ſmall tyme liue in great miſery, great ignorance &amp; prauity of mynd, &amp; then inſtantly ſhould returne to nothing. If there be no other end nor fruite of ſo wonderfull a worke, as the world is, then in vaine is it, &amp; all there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in created; and in vayne doth Nature labour in all her actions. For what good doth man reape by liuing a ſhort tyme in ſo many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of mynd and body? ſince this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall life in it ſelfe is not good, nor to be
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:2520:176"/>
wiſhed for, both in regard, that it is mixed with ſo many calamities, as alſo in that no corporall good or benefit is for it ſelfe alone to be deſired. For as the body is made for the ſoule; ſo the corporall goods are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, and finally directed to the good of the Soule. Neither is this temporall life to be wiſhed, as being a meanes to a greater good, becauſe it is preſumed by theſe men, who deny the immortality of the Soule, that no ſuch future good remaineth after this life. <hi>Salomon</hi> had a feeling vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this point, who, after he had abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly taſted al the pleaſures of this world, did burſt out into this ſentence: <hi>Vanitas va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitum, &amp; omnia vanitas.</hi> And then after: <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>di cuncta &amp;c. I ſaw all things, which are vnder the Sunne; and behold all is vanity, and affliction of ſpirit.</hi> Salomon alſo in that his booke of <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtes,</hi> proſecuteth many other points of this nature, but in the end he (as it were) preacheth to al men, that al the goods of this life, delights, riches, honours, and pleaſures are to be eſteemed as of no worth or price; to wit, as they are conſidered in themſelues alone, and as they conduce no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the life to come.</p>
               <p>I ad further, that this temporall life hath not only in it no true good, for the which it ſhould be deſired, but it is alſo intricated
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:2520:177"/>
and intangled with ſo many euils, that it were far better, &amp; more conuenient for ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neuer to haue bene, then to receaue a ſoule lyable and ſubiect vnto death. For (beſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des that man is waſted away with infinite cares, diſeaſes, and miſeries) he doth litle or no good; or rather in lieu thereof, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth much euill, ſpending his life (for the moſt part) in all turpitude and baſenes of manners and conuerſation, Now let the euill, which he perpetrateth, be ballanced with the good he doth, and we ſhall find, that his wickednes by infinite degrees doth preponderate and weigh downe his vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous actions. If ſo, how then can it be truly conceaued, that that creature which is the authour of ſo great euill, and worker of ſo ſmall good, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whome no future good can be expected, ſhould be accounted as profitable and neceſſary to the whole vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe? Yea rather (as being a thing moſt pernicious and deſtructiue) why ſhould he not be inſtantly exterminated and baniſhed from thence? If in a kingdome or Commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth there be found any ony Family, whoſe endeauours in no ſort tend to the common good, but only reſt in the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and breaking of the lawes of the ſaid ſtate; it is thought neceſſary, that the ſaid family ſhould be vtterly extirpated &amp; roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:2520:177"/>
out, as threatning (if it ſhould continue) no ſmal danger and ruine to that kingdome or commonwealth: why then (by the ſame reaſon) ſhould not all mankind (which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trampleth the law of God and nature vnder its feet, be exiled from al this moſt ample &amp; large Commonwealth of the whole Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe, as a profeſſed enemy to iuſtice and vertue? From theſe premiſes we may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conclude, that man and the world it ſelfe were not only made in vayne (ſince from thence proceedeth ſo ſmall good) but alſo that Nature much erred in bringing forth mankind. For as he deſerueth euil at that ſtate, who bringeth in an improfitable nation, contemning the inſtitutions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees therof; Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo ſhould nature be much blamed for her producing of mankind. All which things how far diſſonant and eſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged they are from reaſon, who ſeeth not? Therefore for the auoyding of theſe (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe) ineuitable abſurdities, we muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that the Soule of man remayneth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this life immortall, and that then ſhe ſhalbe partaker of moſt high and ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rewards, or els of inſupportable tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, according to her different carriage in this world.</p>
               <p>Thou maiſt heere reply, that granting the former reaſon for good and ſufficient,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:2520:178"/>
it followeth, that all wicked men ſhould be now borne in vaine, or rather that in reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ought not be borne; ſince their being in the world conferreth no good or benefit therto, but only diſhonoureth and wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the ſame, abuſing nature her ſelfe, &amp; all the guifts of God to their owne impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity and impiety.<note place="margin">Whether wicked Men are made in vayne to liue in the world.</note>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwere hereto, &amp; grant that al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the world, who before their deaths ſhal not be conuerted, but ſhall leaue this world in a finall impenitency, may (in a certaine manner) be ſaid to be borne in vaine; ſince they declyne and ſwarue from that princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall end, whereunto they were created: &amp; far better it had bene for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, neuer to haue bene borne, then ſo to liue and dye. Yet from this acknowledgment, it followeth not, that all Mankind &amp; the whole world it ſelf ſhould be created to no purpoſe. Firſt, becauſe many men do here liue vertuouſly, and ſhall hereafter be partaker of infinite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muneration and reward. Now theſe men alone are worthy, that the world ſhould be created to their vſe, and ſerue them for the better gayning of ſo great a good, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Apoſtle ſaith: <hi>Omnia propter electos &amp;c. All things are for the elect, that they may obtaine ſaluation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though the number of the reprobate
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:2520:178"/>
be imcomparably greater then of the Elect; yet this is not either ſo few, nor of ſo ſmall importance, as that God ſhould repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of creating the world and mankynd: for as he, who huſbandeth an Orchard, &amp; planteth in it many trees of a ſtrange kind, of which the greater part proue dead and fruitles, the reſt do bring forth good fruyt, and ſufficient for the maintaining of his houſehold, cannot be iuſtly ſaid to haue ſpent his labour in vaine, but rather ſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth himſelfe at the thought of his owne paines, ſince the excellency of the fruite recompenceth the ſmall number; eſpecially ſeing the ſtore is able to nouriſh his family. The like (by way of proportion and ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy) may be conceaued and ſuppoſed of God, who is the workeman of the world and men, who are (as it were) his engrafted plants or ſeedes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, vpon the former confeſſion, it followeth not, that the world is made in vayne; becauſe wicked men are not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in this world to no purpoſe. For they ſerue to ſharpen and ſtir vp the vertue of the iuſt. For while they afflict the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous by ſeueral meanes, they miniſter vnto the other abundant matter of patience and humility, &amp; giue them plentifull occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ore full exerciſe of their vertues. Since
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:2520:179"/>
by this meanes the iuſt do learne to conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne all earthly things, to follow and ſeeke after heauenly matters, to flie to God, to repoſe al their confidence and hope in him, to giue almes deeds, and finally to practiſe all kinds of good works and vertues. This is euident euen by daily examples, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> well ſaid, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Pſalme. 54. Ne putetis &amp;c. <hi>Do not thinke, that the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cked are in vaine in this world, and that God worketh not good from them: for euery bad man therefore liueth, that he may either repent, or that by him the godly and vertuous may be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed.</hi> Thus in this ſenſe God is ſaid to vſe and apply the wicked to the benefit and health of the vertuous. Againe the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Gods goodnes and mercy touching the wicked in this life, mightily ſhineth ſince he beſtoweth on them ſo many bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and gifts, and inuiteth them with ſuch a wonderfull longanimity &amp; patience, that they may be only partakers of heauenly fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity. To conclude, the ſeuerity of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine iuſtice appeareth in them after this life by taking a moſt iuſt reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of their ſinnes; and withall from hence we may gather, how great the malignity of ſinne is, which deſerueth ſo dreadfull a caſtigation and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and laſtly there is miniſtred he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby to the Elect a iuſt occaſion of praiſing

and thanking Gods holy name, that they are deliuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe puniſhments. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, although the wicked do not arriue to the principall end of their creation (in which reſpect they may be ſaid to be borne in vayne) yet this cannot be abſolutly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced ſo of them, becauſe they attaine the ſecond end, whereunto they were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained vnder condition (as it were) to wit, if through their vicious lyues they made themſelues vnworthy and incapable of the firſt and chiefeſt end. Now if the Soule of man ſhould periſh with his body, none of theſe conueniences or profits could haue any place, but in lieu thereof it would cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly follow (as it ſhewed aboue) that both man and the whole world ſhould be crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to no auailable purpoſe or end.</p>

For if it be not ſeene by any, it is houlden alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as vnprofitable: for to what condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth fayrenes, &amp; due proportion in pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trature, remaining only in darkenes? For as ſmels, ſapours, and pleaſing ſounds are but ſuperfluous and needles, if there be no ſenſes of ſmelling, taſting, and hearing; Euen ſo al beauty and ſplendour of things, all ſubtility and perfection of art is but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundant and in vayne, if there be no eye either of body or mynd, which canſee, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, and obſerue it.

Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more light cannot occaſion darkenes; But truth is light, and the ſquare of what is right; and vice is darkenes, a lye, and a deuiation or declining away from the path &amp; rule of truth.

ſubuert and ouerthrow the foundation of al probity and vertue, and giueth the raynes to all licentiouſnes and ſenſuality. For who would walke in the cragged way of vertue refraine his deſires, tame his luſts, abſtayne from doing wrong, and worſhip a diuine power, if he did expect no reward for ſuch his deportment and carriage, nor fruite of this his labour? Wherefore we find euen by experience; that ſuch as maintaine the Souls mortality, are of a moſt licentious and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane life &amp; conuerſation; for as in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth it cannot be brought to paſſe, that externall iuſtice and politicall honeſty be obſerued, and violence and iniury be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, except rewards and puniſhments be ordayned by force of eſtabliſhed lawes; Euen ſo vertue in mankind cannot be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctized, &amp; vice prohibited, where there is no expectation of reward and commination of chaſtiſement ſet downe by the decree and ordinance of God: The which remunerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and recompenſations, ſeeing they are not euer payed in this life, it followeth, that they are to be reſerued for the life to come; ſince otherwiſe it might be ſaid (which were a heynous offence to auerre) that a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Againe, that ſentence, which is the ſource and welſpring of all iuſtice, piety &amp; vertue, cannot be falſe; for as light cannot proceed out of darkenes; ſo the ſhining ſple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But this article, which teacheth the ſoules immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and that after this life it is to be rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or puniſhed, is the ground-worke of all iuſtice and probity; ſince through this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation

                  <hi>virtus ſibi iuſtum eſt praemium: Vertue is a ſufficient reward to it ſelfe,</hi> is moſt falſe: for nothing worketh only to the end, that it may worke; and that it may reſt, and be contented in the worth of its own operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but it euer intendeth ſomthing further, which it may obtaine by ſuch its action, as is euident both in thoſe things, which are wrought and performed by nature; as alſo by Art: for the Heauens (for example) are not moued, as taking delight in ſuch their motion, but for the conueniency of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour world, and the benefit of man.</p>
               <p>In like ſort, the ſeminall vertue, which is in ſeads, plants, and liuing creatures, worketh not to the end, that it may pleaſe it ſelfe with ſuch its operation; but that therby things may be formed, borne, grow, nouriſhed, and bring forth fruyte: neither do liuing Creatures worke for the worke it ſelfe, but that therby they may procure &amp; get ſuch things, as be profitable to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and auoyd, what is dangerous &amp; hurtfull.
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:2520:185"/>
After the ſame manner Artificers do ayme at ſome things beyond the practiſe of their arte, for the which they worke. The like may be ſaid of the operations of vertues which are no performed by reaſon of that good and beauty, which is in them; but are finally directed to ſome one thing, which is moſt good, and which is chiefly to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired. And although ſeuerall vertues do not extend themſelues in their actions beyond the peculiar and formall reaſon of what is good, which is ſet downe to euery one of them; yet the mynd, which poſſeſſeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and vſeth them, as it inſtruments, is not ſatisfied with that good, but expecteth ſome further end thereby; whether it be honour and glory, or the ioy of future felicity, which is to be giuen by God after this life. And hence it proceedeth, that thoſe, who are either ignorant, or do not thinke of the reward of the future life, haue in all their famous and moſt celebrious actions bene moued with the deſire of glory.

                  <hi>glory; of which it we should be depriued, to what purpoſe should we vndergoe ſo great paines, and labours in this ſo short a courſe if mans life?</hi> This was Tullies opinion, becauſe he was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of greater rewards. So the ancient Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, who were wont to make a ſpecious and fayre ſhew of vertue in their actions, were for the moſt part led therto through the deſire of praiſe, as <hi>S. Augustine</hi> (<note n="3" place="margin">l. 5. de Ciuit dei c. 12.</note>) ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth. So euident it is, that mans nature in performing the works of vertue, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and expect ſomewhat more, then the beauty, &amp; goodnes, which is in theſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And this which is further expected ought to be ſuch, as that it may more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfully draw and impel mans wil to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous operations, then the pulchritude and inward fayrenes of it is able to do. Which point is made more euident by this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration following.</p>
               <p>God (the authour of nature) hath mixed thoſe functions, which belong either to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend life, or to propagate and continue the kind of any Creature (to wit taking of meat and procreation of ofſpring) with great pleaſures; leaſt otherwiſe (perhaps) liuing Creatures, as being weary of the labours &amp; troubles accompayning the ſame, ſhould neglect thoſe functions; or at leaſt ſhould not performe them ſo diligently, as were
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:2520:186"/>
neceſſary for the conſeruation of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular or continuance of the <hi>ſpecies</hi> and kind. But with the moſt operations of vertue, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther no pleaſure or very ſmall is adioyned, but for the moſt part great labours, ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and trouble. For the way of vertue is hard, and is not paſſed ouer without toyle or moleſtation.</p>
               <p>It is hard for men to bridle the paſſions, to curbe the affections of the mynd, to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate deſires, to extinguiſh malice &amp; enuy, and to encompaſſe all motions within the circle of reaſon. It is a labourſome thing to ſuffer iniuryes, to reſtraine hate and anger, to relieue the needy with their goods, and duly to pay debts. Therefore ſeing in the exerciſe of vertue, there is either none or very ſmall allurements; but on the other ſide, many aſperities diuerting the mind fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence, it was requiſite that (beſides the force of vertue) there ſhould be ſome other cauſes, which muſt forcibly impell the mind therto, and deter it from vice, to wit rewards &amp; puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts without the which no man would enter into the thorny path of vertue, or being entred would go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward therein, or would contemne the inuitements of ſenſuality: for if the <hi>Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God</hi> hath much ſweetned theſe lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt functions, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſting in the preſeruing

                  </gap>t otherwiſe they might be pretermited and neglected; who then can be perſwaded, that the chiefeſt operations of the ſoule of Man (by the which we are made like to God) ſhould be ſo little reſpected by the ſaid Prouidence, as that we ſhould want al incytements for our greater encourageme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t therein? Certainly this care of Prouidence were moſt prepoſterous. For although vertue be ſharpe and aduerſe to the fleſh, &amp; vyces gratefull and pleaſing; notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the reward, which is adioyned to vertue (wherin is contained an eternall and ineſtimable pleaſure) doth ſo temper and gentle the bitternes thereof, as that it maketh it to ſeeme ſweet and to be deſired; and on the contrary part, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ſerious reflexion and meditation of the moſt ſeuere puniſhments prepared hereafter for vyce and wickednes, cauſeth the pleaſure of it to ſeeme bitter and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>
               <p>Now, what is hertofore ſpoken of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of vertue (to wit, that it ſelfe ſhould not be a ſufficient remuneration for it ſelfe) is to be vnderſtood of thoſe actions of vertue, which can be performed in this life. For we do not deny, but after this life there is an action of vertue, which is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:2520:187"/>
of it ſelfe, and of all other precedent operations of vertue. And this is the cleare <hi>viſion of God,</hi> and the loue and ioy flowing from thence: for theſe functions or actions of vertue are chiefly to be deſired for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, ſo as no other further commodity is to be expected therein; ſeing in this viſion our ſupreme felicity, <hi>formalis beatitudo</hi> (as the Schoolemen ſpeake) conſiſteth. Now that theſe operations make vs happy, this riſeth not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence, that they are the operations or functions of any vertues, but in that they conioyne and vnyte the Soule with God, who is <hi>ſummum verum, ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mum pulchrum, &amp; ſummum bonum:</hi> our chiefeſt truth, chiefeſt beauty, and good. Wherefore from hence we may obſerue, that we do not place in theſe actions our happines, as the Stoicks did in vertue: for they repoſed their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme happines in vertue it ſelfe, and in a reſolution of the mynd ſubiect to reaſon, &amp; not in the Obiect, to the which vertue tyeth our mynd; thus they made vertue it ſelfe to be both the <hi>formall &amp; obiectiue</hi> beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; that is, the ſubiect from whence this beatitude riſeth, and the formal cauſe, why in theſe functions of vertue conſiſteth ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s beatitude. But we place not this our felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty principally in theſe operations of vertue but in the Obiect, to the which theſe ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:2520:188"/>
do vnyte our ſoule and mind; ſo as theſe operations cannot be called our feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, but with reference, as they are a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine perfect vnion and vitall coniunction with our <hi>ſummum bonum,</hi> or ſupreme happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Beſides the Stoicks taught, the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of vertue to be in our power, flowing (at our owne pleaſure) from the freedome of our will; wheras we maintayne that bleſſed function not to be in our owne po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer; but to be a celeſtiall, conſtant, immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and ſempiternall guift, diuinely infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p>But it may be heere obiected, that <hi>glory</hi> and <hi>praiſe</hi> is a ſufficient incytement to the ſtudy of vertue, and conſequently, that there is no need of rewards or paynes after this life. And of this opinion <hi>Tully</hi> may ſeeme to be, who wonderfully magnifyeth this reward in theſe words following. <hi>Nulla merces à virtute &amp;c. No other reward is to be expected for vertue, then this of honour &amp; glory.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Of all the rewards of vertue, glory is the most ample and large: which comforteth the shortnes of life with the memory of poſterity: which maketh that being abſent, we are preſent, and being dead we do liue; by which degrees of honour, men may be thought to aſcend to heauen.</hi> In like ſort in another place he thus wryteth; <hi>Non vita ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>&amp;c. This is not to be tearmed life, which conſiſteth of the body and the ſoule or mind; but that, euen that is truly life, which flourisheth in the memory of all ages, which posterity nourisheth, and which eternity it ſelfe euer beho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>I anſwere hereto and ſay, that glory &amp; humane praiſe is no ſufficient reward for vertue, and this for diuerſe reaſons. Firſt, becauſe the deſire of glory corrupteth the good &amp; perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of vertue, leauing therof only an outward ſhew, and a mere repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation: for <hi>vertue</hi> (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> and al Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers<note place="margin">2. Ethic. c. 4.</note> defyne it) <hi>is a loue of that, which is good, or honeſt, only in that reſpect, that it is good;</hi> Therefore if one do a vertuous worke, not through any loue of vertue, but through the hope either of profit, pleaſure, or praiſe, it is not the worke of true vertue, but only an external pretext thereof; for the inward life, and (as it were) the ſoule of vertue is abſent heere; for as a liuing creature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth of ſoule &amp; body, ſo a perfect worke of vertue is grounded vpon an inward li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of what is good, &amp; an outward worke. And as when the ſoule leaueth the body there remaineth only a dead Carcas; euen ſo the deſire and affection of what is good and vertuous being extinguiſhed, nothing is left, but only an empty ſhew or image of vertue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="358" facs="tcp:2520:189"/>So far ſhort then is glory and praiſe from being a ſufficient and efficacious incyteme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of vertue, as that true vertue is euen cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and depraued therby; no otherwiſe, then certaine hoat poiſons do ſo ſtir vp &amp; awaken the ſleeping ſpirits of a man, as that they do vtterly diſſolue, diſſipate, and extinguiſh them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Glory is not ſufficient hereto, becauſe the ſcope and End of glory is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing only in certaine few externall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are performed vpon the open ſtage of the world; for (as it is aboue ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed) it doth not excite and perſwade a man to the inward affection and loue of vertue, but only to the outward action; &amp; this not to euery action, but to ſuch as may be moſt conſpicuous and markable in the eyes of many. For the humour of glory &amp; praiſe is fully ſatisfyed, if a man ſeeme ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally vertuous, honeſt and valorous, though in the ſecret cloſet of his ſoule he is found to be wicked, and cowardly. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this deſire of praiſe (which is but an idle diuerberation or empty ſound of ayre) rather engendreth Hypocrites, then true followers of vertue.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe the reward of vertue ought to be a certaine ſolid and intrinſecal good, which may affect the ſoule it ſelfe,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:2520:189"/>
&amp; which is more noble then vertue; ſince the End ought euer to be more excellent then the meanes. But humane glory is a thing merely extrinſecall, reſting only in<note place="margin">Why are men ſo deſirous of prayſe</note> the perſwaſion and iudgement of men; but bringing no perfection or worth to the mynd. For what can the opinion of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of poore mortall men aduantage me? Or what can their ſpeaches and words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile me? Thou maiſt heere reply, from whence then procedeth it, that almoſt all<note place="margin">Valerius Max c. 8.</note> men are ouerruled with the deſire of praiſe and glory? For as one ſaith. <hi>There is no ſuch humility of mynd, which cannot be mollifyed with the ſweetnes of glory.</hi> Which ſaying is ſo true, as that this affection of <hi>Philotimy,</hi> and loue of honour &amp; reputation hath ſuddenly crept into the mynds of moſt holy and deuoute men.</p>
               <p>I anſwere, that there are three cauſes hereof. Firſt, becauſe there is in all men an innate appetite and deſire of excellency, which mightily ruleth and ſwayeth in the mynd: for there is nothing more to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired in that, which is good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (whether it be vertue, power or nobility) then to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell others in the ſame good. Now honour is the teſtimony of this excellency; glory a knowledge and opinion of the ſame excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and praiſe a diuulging and dilating
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:2520:190"/>
of the ſame. Whereupon when theſe are aſcribed and giuen to any one, there riſeth in him an apprehenſion of his owne excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, with the which he is wonderfully delighted. Euen as (on the contrary) by conuicious ſpeaches and reproach there is ſtirred vp a cogitation of ones vility and baſenes, which is diſpleaſing and diſtaſting to euery one. Therefore all men loue praiſe and glory, becauſe theſe are ſignes of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency; and hate, contumely &amp; diſgrace, as markes and badges of abiection and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthines of mynd.</p>
               <p>Secondly, all men couet honour; becauſe as the mynd greatly deſireth to be eminent and excelling; ſo it deſireth to be ſo reputed in the iudgements of others; for the ſoule or mynd of man deemeth this to belong to it, as a certaine new eſſence, or as a new <hi>intelligible life</hi> (as I may call it) vnder the glorious ſhew and forme whereof, it being knowne, it ſeemeth to liue in the mynds of men. For as the Philoſophers do ſay <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligere, eſt quoddam rei intelligibilis eſſe:</hi> to vnderſtand and know a thing, giueth a certaine eſſence and being to the thing ſo knowne.</p>
               <p>This point Tully may be wel thought to inſinuate in the words aboue recyted: <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>the memory of all ages which poſterity nourisheth, and through the which we being abſent, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and being dead, do liue.</hi> Therefore this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, this eſtimation, &amp; eternizing of ones fame is a certaine life of the ſoule, and her endowments; which is not diſcerned by the eye, but vnderſtood by the mynd; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth not by nature, but by the iudgments and cenſures of mynds; doth not intrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally in here to the ſoule, but is extrinſecal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſſed; by which meanes the ſoule may be ſaid to liue in the mynds of men, &amp; to haue ſo many liues, as there are men, in whoſe hearts it is highly magnified and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lewed. This life is ſo much eſteemed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the ſoule, as that it is content of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes to contemne corporall life for the preſeruing of it, and to expoſe the body to moſt certaine death, before it will ſuffer the leaſt blemiſh &amp; loſſe of reputation &amp; name, ſo holding it more worthy to liue by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory in the mynds of others, then in his owne perſon and body by nature. Which is an euident argument, that glory (although it be but an imaginary and empty thing) is more worthy and preciable then riches or pleaſures. For ſuch is the excellency of the mynd, as that it preferreth the leaſt goods properly belonging to it, before the greateſt corporall goods.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="362" facs="tcp:2520:191"/>Thirdly, All do ſeeke after glory, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe glory is conducing and profitable to many things; for it retayneth and keepeth man in his duty, withdrawing him from all turpitude, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Furthermore, Glory ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, that men may with pleaſure, grace, &amp; credit negotiate with others in publicke &amp; in the eye of the world, where baſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous perſons dare not appeare. Againe it procureth, that men are aduanced to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy and publike gouerment; ſince the gates of honours and dignityes are ſhut to the infamous, and ſuch as are abiect. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it cauſeth, that we conuerſe among men with fruite; for whether it be in a courſe of doctrine and learning, or in the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of iuſtice, neither of them can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed without the reputation of a good<note place="margin">Prouer b. 22.

               <p>AGAINE, if the Soule dyeth with the body, then (beſydes all the former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences aboue alleadged) theſe two do follow. Firſt, that <hi>iniuries</hi> and wrongs ſhould remayne <hi>vnreuenged,</hi> and that any wickednes whatſoeuer in mankind ſhould be committed with all impunity, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſuffering on the delinquents ſide. Secondly, that there ſhould be no <hi>reward al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted</hi> for <hi>vertue</hi> &amp; piety, nor no fruite there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. That in this life oftentimes there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge or compenſation taken for wrongs, is manifeſt: for we ſee daily many moſt wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and impious men, and oppreſſours of the innocent to flouriſh greatly in this life, and to abound with all kinds of temporall goods, as riches, honours, and delights; but the iuſt and vertuous to be ſtill entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with diuers calamities, and to paſſe their whole time in affliction; as if Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſhould be the reward of Impiety, and calamity of iuſtice and piety. Therefore of there be no retribution of theſe matters af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this life, then in this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. or pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of order it is moſt euident; to wit that
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:2520:192"/>
all heynous offences and crimes ſhould be vnpuniſhed, vertue vnrewarded, Iuſtice troden vnder foote through contempt, and iniquity erected. For wrongs and flagitious ſinnes are ſuppoſed to continue, and to pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute this Common wealth of the whole <hi>Vniuerſe,</hi> till they be reuenged, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come expiated by due puniſhments, as is euident from the common iudgment of all men.</p>
               <p>It alſo further might be inferred, that if there be no chaſtiſement of vice, nor remu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration for vertue, there were no <hi>diuine power or prouidence,</hi> vndertaking the care of mens affaires; but that all things are carryed with temerity &amp; raſhnes, &amp; that euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s will &amp; power becomes a law to himſelfe: for nothing can be more aduerſe &amp; repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the nature of Prouidence, then this kind of licence &amp; impunity. For as we may truly ſay, that, that Kingdome or State (if any ſuch were) eyther wanted a gouernour, or that the gouernour were iniuſt, &amp; a defender of wicked men; if therein there were decreed no reuenge for notorious &amp; publicke tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſours; Euen ſo if in this Kingdome (as it were) of all mankind, all actions ſhould proceed freely without any expectation ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of rewards, or feare of puniſhments, we might well collect, that there were no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:2520:192"/>
nor any ſupreme moderatour, by whome humane affaires are gouerned, or if there were any, yet that he is vniuſt. This is confirmed, in that the firſt office of a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour is, that Lawes may be obſerued with due diſtribution of rewards and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, according to mens different co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment and carriage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for thus all actions are brought to the ballance of iuſtice, then the which nothing is more deſired in this world.</p>
               <p>Now where this is wanting, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that prouidence and true gouerment is alſo wanting. The ſame point is alſo fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made euident, becauſe it chiefly belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to Prouidence, to giue to euery one, what is his owne; this being the inuiolable law of iuſtice, which in gouerment &amp; true adminiſtration of things is moſt religiouſly to be obſerued: whereupon <hi>Diuine Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> obſerueth this moſt preciſely in all things created (according to their different capacities) giuing to euery one what is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable to their nature and condition. Now if this order be kept in the loweſt and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt creatures, then with much more reaſon ought it to be obſerued in the worthyeſt thing of the world, which is mans Soule, which only is capable of Iuſtice and iniury, right and due. Certainly, it is abſurd that all
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:2520:193"/>
things agreable to their natures ſhould exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly be meaſured and giuen by the <hi>Prouidence of God</hi> to myce, gnats, wormes, and the like (who are not capable of iuſtice or wrong) &amp; yet thoſe things ſhould not be giuen to the ſoule of man, which are due, and beſt ſort to it; and which the ſoule it ſelfe through her good or bad actions deſerueth. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but thinke, that the care of diuine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is about ſmall matters very prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, if it be wanting in the greateſt things. For from this then would fall out not much vnlike, as if a Prince ſhould carefully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide of al things neceſſary for horſes, mules, and dogs, and yet ſhould abſolutely neglect his owne family, without ſetting downe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny recompenſations to his moſt truſty ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, or chaſtiſement to malefactours. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the which proceeding what can be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned more exorbitant, or leſſe agreable with reaſon? For by how much any thing is more worthy and more neere to God, by ſo much it requyreth a greater care of Prouidence, that it may attend its end. <hi>A reaſonable nature is the ſole family and houſehold of God;</hi> ſince this nature only acknowledgeth God, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuteth him with honour and reuerence. This alſo alone contemneth and offendeth him; and therfore it alone deſerueth reward and puniſhment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="367" facs="tcp:2520:193"/>Now from theſe premiſes it is manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conuinced, that there is no diuine power, nor any Prouidence, if the ſoule be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed with the body: for if it be extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, then is there no retribution nor any iuſtice; but iniuryes and wrongs remayne vnſatisfyed, vertue becomes diſhonoured; and finally there is found in the worthyeſt creature of the world, the greateſt pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and inuerſion of order, that can be imagined. All which inferences being gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, do euidently prooue the world to be deſtitute of a Rectour or Gouernour. And hence it is, that this conſideration chiefly hath in al ages perplexed the minds of men, and hath impelled them to deny diuine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, and to ſatisfy their owne affections &amp; deſires. And the greateſt motiue to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw men from this falſe opinion, was to conſider good or euill was prepared for man after this life, as the Prophet moſt excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly explicateth in the 72. Pſalme. Only the mature ponderation of this, appeaſeth the mynd, and cauſeth it to tread a vertuous &amp; reſolued courſe in all aduerſities.</p>
               <p>But it may be heere anſwered, that the ſoules of the wicked are ſufficiently puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed for all their wrongs, iniuſtice, &amp; other their tranſgreſſions, in that they are extinct with the death of their bodyes: but againſt
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:2520:194"/>
this I ſay, that this periſhing and death of the ſoule (if any ſuch were) is ordained not as a puniſhment, but as a condition of nature; which no leſſe the vertuous and iuſt do vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe, then the wicked. Like as in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, if there were no other other puniſhments to be inflicted vpon delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, then the naturall death of body, which according to the courſe of meaſure is to fall to euery one; it might be truly ſaid, that no paine or chaſtiſement at all were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutly ſet downe for malefactours; but that all liberty and impunity preuailed therein; for puniſhment ought to be inflicted for the fault, as a iuſt recompenſation of the ſame. So as if there be no fault, then is there not any place for puniſhment.

               <p>THE world was created by God, to the end that the perfection of his Diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty might ſhine, and appeare in it, as in his moſt beautifull and admirable worke: for
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:2520:194"/>
this manifeſtation is the laſt end of God, or of the firſt age<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the framing of the world. For nothing is more worthy then God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who worketh for his owne ſake, and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth laſtly his owne good, which good is not intrinſecall to God (for this kind of good is euer preſent vnto him, neither can it be increaſed or diminiſhed) but only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall, which is nothing els, then an open declaration of his perfections in his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and by his creatures, in the which his extrinſecall glory conſiſteth. And in this ſenſe the Philoſophers are accuſtomed to ſay, <hi>Idem eſt primus agens, &amp; vltimus finis. One &amp; the ſame thing is the first agent, and the last end.</hi> The reaſon hereof being, becauſe the firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent doth not neceſſarily intend in the laſt place his owne good. Which point is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted out of the holy Scripture, <hi>Omnia prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>

                  <hi>ſemetipſum operatus &amp;c. The Lord made all things for his owne ſake; yea euen the wicked for the day of euill.</hi> God worketh all things, not only by a poſitiue action in doing, but alſo by a negatiue action, in ſuffering and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, for the word, <hi>to worke,</hi> is heere taken in a large ſignification: God worketh <hi>propter ſemetipſum,</hi> that is, for his owne glory, that thereby the perfections of his excellency may be manifeſted and knowne: <hi>Impium quoque, yea euen the wicked &amp;c.</hi> becauſe he
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:2520:195"/>
ſuffereth a man to be wicked, and being wicked he ordaineth him to damnation and eternall puniſhment, &amp; all this, which God doth, tendeth to his glory. But if the ſoule be mortall, the diuine perfections in God are ſo farre off from ſhining in the fabricke &amp; diſpoſition of the world, as that they may rather ſeeme to be obſcured: for it is no ſigne of the power of the Creatour, but rather of his weaknes, that he could not make the Soule of man (which is the Lord of things) immortall, ſeeing that condition is beſt ſorting to the dignity of the ſoule. It is not a point of wiſdome to make ſuch things eternall, as are ſeruiceable, and (as it were) ſlaues to man, as the world (which is his houſe) and the like; and yet to ſhut or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyne the Lord of all within a narrow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of tyme, and that being once ended, himſelfe for euer to be extinguiſhed and to reſolue to nothing. It is not the office of goodneſſe to bring all other things to that perfection, which is agreable to ech of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; and yet ſo to neglect the Soule of man, as that he can neuer attaine vnto the hundreth part of that good, of which it is capable. It is no Prouidence to leaue the ſoule to its own appetites and deſires, without ſetting of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rewards, which may allure it to vertue, or puniſhments, which may deterre it from
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:2520:195"/>
vice; to leaue ſinne vnpuniſhed, and iuſtice violated, &amp; to permit in the world ſo great a diſorder and confuſion; the impious ruling and tyrannizing, and the iuſt and vertuous remaining oppreſſed, and this without any future hope of bettering of things, or of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing them in any more conuenient or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>What ſhould I heere ſpeake of <hi>Mercy</hi> &amp; <hi>Iuſtice?</hi> For what mercy is it, that man ſhould liue ſo ſhort a tyme, and lead his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall life afflicted with ſo many miſeries, without any expectation of happines for the time to come? Or what pleaſure can this life afford, which is mixed with ſuch ſtore of worme wood, as that to a prudent man it ſeemeth moſt bitter, except the ſweetnes of a future expectancy doth te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>per it? Or what equity &amp; iuſtice is it, that good men ſhould be oppreſſed, afflicted, &amp; murthered by the wicked without any reuenge or recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of ſo great and inſufferable wrongs: that there ſhould be no rewards propoſed for piety, iuſtice &amp; vertue; nor puniſhments for wickedneſſe and in iuſtice? that the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould abound withal the goods of this life (as riches, honours, pleaſures, and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or rule) &amp; the godly &amp; pious ſhould liue plunged into all afflictions and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? Who conſidering theſe things, will not
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:2520:196"/>
repute them rather ſignes of cruelty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice, then of mercy and iuſtice? And that the <hi>diuine power</hi> is a fauourer of the wicked, and an enemy to the vertuous, if there be not after this life a iuſt compenſation &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliation made to both theſe kinds of men? And hence it is, that the Heathens, who thought litle of any retribution after this life, did often accuſe the Gods of cruelty &amp; iniuſtice. Of which point many examples are extant in <hi>Homer, Euripides, Athan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>us,</hi> and others. Yea ſuch a cogitation will enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the minds of ſome Chriſtians, whiles they do not caſt their eye of things to come after this life. And certainly if nothing were to chance to the ſoule after its ſeparation fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the body, it were not an eaſy matter to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate and free God from the aſperſion and note of cruelty &amp; iniuſtice, as aboue is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of <hi>Chryſostome.</hi> For who would eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeme that King to be iuſt &amp; benigne, who ſhould ſuffer in his Kingdome ſo great a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, as that no reward ſhould be propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for vertue, nor puniſhment for moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinorous crimes; but that the wicked ſhould perpetrate any miſchiefes (though neuer ſo heinous) without any feare of law, or fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of any due puniſhment or caſtigation! But now acknowledging the ſoules immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, all the former inconueniences do
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:2520:196"/>
ceaſe, and all ſecret murmuring and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints againſt God are ſilent. For this fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid confuſion laſteth only for a ſmall time; which (being once paſſed) ſhall heereafter be corrected in an eternall order, for to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one after this life ſhalbe allotted his place ſtate, and degree; and there ſhalbe a iuſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution for all actions whatſoeuer; there no euil ſhall remaine vnreuenged, nor good irremunerated and vnrewarded. For as a skilful painter is not ignorant in what place he is to put each particular colour (as black, white, &amp; the reſt:) ſo God knoweth where to range euery one in this whole <hi>Vniuerſe,</hi> be he vertuous or wicked.</p>
               <p>And as from that fitting diſtribution of colours riſeth the beauty of the picture, euen ſo from this diſpoſall of Soules, the ſplendour of the <hi>Vniuerſe</hi> proceedeth; which <hi>Vniuerſe</hi> is (as it were) a certaine portrature of Gods diuinity, wonderfully exhibiting to vs his power, wiſdome, goodneſſe, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, mercy and iuſtice. Therefore there is no true reaſon, why the iuſt ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of the Prouidence of God for their ſuffering of calamities in this life; ſince the preſſures and afflictions heere are but ſhort, and but ſmall in a generous mind; but the the fruite there of moſt great, magnificent, &amp; eternall.

                  <hi>weight of glory.</hi> Now that ought not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted grieuous, which is recompenſed with ſo great &amp; ineſtimable a reward. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Tribulations are of force to fyle away the ruſt of the ſoule, and to cauſe an abſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and waſhing away of its dayly ſpots; for no man in this world is ſo pure, but ſome ſmall blemiſhes are dayly contracted in his ſoule, which by meanes of affliction are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliterated &amp; remooued.</p>
               <p>In like ſort, there is no cauſe, why the vertuous ſhould ſtomacke the proſperity of the wicked, ſince this is ſhort, momentary and mixed with much bitternes; &amp; is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to be attended with euerlaſting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint and lamentation.

               <p>IT is ſo prouided by nature, that who haue committed grieuous ſinnes, do ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a ſecret ſting, and <hi>touch of Conſcience,</hi> with the which they are ſometimes ſo tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as that they depriue themſelues of their owne liues.

From hence it proceedeth, that theſe men (that they may the more diuert their myndes from theſe thoughts, and free themſelues of all ſuch trouble) giue themſelues ouer to all ſports, recreations, bankettings, and to other exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſocietyes; thus auoyding their inward accuſer and torturer, for nothing is more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to them, then to be ſolitary and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and to enter into any ſecret diſcourſe

with their owne ſoules. Now this horrour of mynd &amp; pricke of conſcience is a preſage of a future iudgment and reuenge, which expecteth the ſoules of the wicked after this life. Their ſinnes &amp; offences are (as it were) ſeedes of eminent puniſhments; &amp; therefore this their trouble of mynd ryſeth euen by an inſtinct of nature from the remembrance of their owne ſinnes.

               <p>In like ſort a conſcience priuy to it ſelfe of its wel doing, bringeth great ſolace to the mynd, and therefore Tully ſaith: <hi>Magna est vis conſcientiae &amp;c.

               <p>THE Immortality of the Soule is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther euicted from the <hi>returne backe of Soules</hi> after this life. For it is euident euen by infinite examples, that the dead haue been raiſed vp, and that the Soules of the dead haue returned from the places, wherein they were, and haue appeared to the liuing. We read in the firſt booke of the <hi>Kings</hi> cap. 28. and in <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> cap. 49. that the Soule of <hi>Samuel</hi> (then dead) appeared to the Enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe <hi>Pithoniſſa,</hi> and to <hi>Saul,</hi> and did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy vnto him his deſtruction.

do continue immortall, and haue their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of glory of puniſhment, according to their actions performed in this life.</p>

                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> (our Lord and Sauiour) beſides others raiſed, to life <hi>Lazarus</hi> (being dead foure dayes afore) and this was perfourmed in the eye of all <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> as <hi>S.

Finally to auoyde all prolixity, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers were reſtored to life by the Apoſtles, and other moſt holy men, as appeareth from Eccleſiaſticall hiſtoryes, and other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued authours. Now the <hi>reſurrection and riſing of the dead,</hi> is an euident ſigne, that the ſoules are not vtterly extinct; but that they remayne ſeparated after death, till through a conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the body, they be reunited to it. For ſo ſoone, as the whole

diſpoſition of the body (which is neceſſary to this vnion) ſhalbe perfected, and that the ſoule ſhall there exhibit it ſelfe in war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly preſent, then doth this vnion imedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly and freely follow: partly like as fire touching chips, or any other ſuch combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible matter, doth through a mutuall attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, naturally cleaue thereunto. For the body being made apt, and rightly diſpoſed doth couet through a naturall propenſion, to be vnited with the ſoule; as in like ſort the ſoule deſireth to be conioyned to the body, which propenſion or inclination is reduced into Act, when the Soule and the body (after the laſt diſpoſition once fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed) are mutually and inwardly preſent together.</p>

               <p>TO conclude this point touching the Soules immortality; it may be further alledged, that the Soules <hi>Immortality</hi> is the foundation of all religion, Iuſtice, <hi>Probity, Innocency, &amp; ſanctity.</hi> Now if this ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke be falſe, then is the whole ſacred Scripture falſe and a meere fiction; then are the Oracles of the Prophets falſe; falſe alſo
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:2520:201"/>
is the doctrine and preaching of Chriſt; falſe his miracles. Finally, falſe are all thoſe things, which are deliuered by the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts touching the reſurrection of Chriſt, his conuerſing with the Apoſtles fourty dayes after his reſurrection, his aſcenſion, and the deſcending of the Holy Ghoſt vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apoſtles, and other the faithfull. And thus are all deceaued, who haue embraced the religion of Chriſt; And therefore in vaine haue ſo many thouſands Saints ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and brought vnder their fleſh, practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed iuſtice, innocency, temperance, &amp; all other vertues, with indefatigable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant paynes. In vayne are all the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Church, all the inſtitutions &amp; diuine laudes and praiſes, all Eccleſiaſticall Orders, all ſacred aſſemblies, all labours of prelates and Paſtours, all doctrine of the ancient Fathers, and all manner of liuing among Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>For all theſe things are bootleſſe, and of no fruite or benefit, (as being grounded vpon a falſe foundation) if the Soule be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed with the body. Finally all thoſe men, haue bene extremely deceaued, who at any tyme haue bene excellent for ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctity of life, guift of prophecy, glory of miracles, or heauenly wiſdome; &amp; on the contrary part, the truth of this poynt hath bene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:2520:201"/>
only to prophane, wicked and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall Epicures, all which things are moſt repugnant euen to the light of Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Thus far now (to draw towards an end) haue we alledged reaſons and arguments, by the which, the <hi>Immortality of the ſoule</hi> is eſtabliſhed &amp; confirmed, which if they be ſeriouſly weighed, do ſo conuince the iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement, as that they take away al ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and doubt of this point. Now to theſe we will adioyne a teſtimony or two of a heathen. Therefore <hi>Seneca</hi> in his 102. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle thus wryteth. <hi>Magna &amp; generoſares eſt humanus animus &amp;c. The Soule of man is a great and generous thing; It ſuffereth it ſelfe to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited with no bounds, but ſuch as are common with God. Seneca</hi> here meaneth, becauſe the Soule exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth it ſelfe to all place &amp; tyme. Now this authour further explicateth this point in theſe words: <hi>Primùm, humilem non accipit patriam &amp;c. Firſt the Soule admitteth not to it ſelfe any obſcure or meane Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be Epheſus or Alexandria, or any other one place, though more populous, &amp; better furnished with buildings and edifices: but its Country is all that, which is contained within the compaſse of this vniuerſe; yea all this conuexity, within the which the Ayre, which diuideth all celestiall things from humane and earthly, is comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded; within which ſo many</hi> Numina <hi>or powers (ſtill</hi>
                  <pb n="384" facs="tcp:2520:202"/>
                  <hi>ready to performe their operations) are included.</hi> Now here the word <hi>Numina, Seneca</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth the ſtarres, and perhaps alſo the Intelligences or ſpirits. And thus far of the place or Country of the Soule. Next tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the age or tyme of it, he thus writeth, <hi>Deinde arctam aetatem &amp;c. Furthermore the Soule ſuffereth not any ſmall tyme to be allotted to it, for it thus ſaith. All yeares are myne: No age is excluded from high VVits, and each time lyes open to my contemplation. When that shall come, which shall diſſolue this mixture of what is diuine, and what humane, then will I leaue the body, where I did find it; and I will restore my ſelfe to the Gods. Neither now am I altogether eſtranged from them, though I be heere detained with a heauy and earthly matter. By meanes of theſe delayes of this mortall age, preparation is made for a better, and longer life. Euen as our mothers wombe, containeth vs nine monthes, and prepareth vs, not for it ſelfe, but for that place, whither it ſendeth vs; that ſo we may be fit to breath, and to liue here in ſight: So by the helpe of this tyme (which indureth from our infancy to old age) we are made ripe and ready for another birth. Another beginning expecteth vs, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtate of things. As yet we cannot enioy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, but (as it were) a far off; therefore behold that appointed day without feare or diſmayednes; ſince it is not the laſt to the Soule, but to the body.</hi>
                  <pb n="385" facs="tcp:2520:202"/>
                  <hi>VVhat thing ſoeuer doth here co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſe vs, all is to be esteemed, but as an vnprofitable cariage or burde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in an Inne; for we are to depart. Nature leauing this world, is depriued of all things, as well as entring into it. It is not lawfull for thee to carry more out of the world, then thou didſt bring in. Yea a great part of that, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>duced to our life, is to be left off. The skin, wherwith thou art coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as with thy next garment, shalbe taken away, the flesh and blood shalbe taken away, the bones &amp; ſinews (which are the ſtrong things of the weaker parts) shalbe taken away. That day, which thou feareſt as the last, is the birth day of Eternity. Caſt of thy burden. Why delayest thou, as if thou hadst not afore come out of that body, wherein thou dideſtlye? Thou now pawſest &amp; ſtrugleſt againſt it, and yet euen at the firſt thou was brought out, with the like paines, and labour of thy mother. Thou cryest and bewaylest, and yet to cry is moſt peculiar to a body newly borne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> And the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Seneca</hi> thus further enlargeth himſelfe. <hi>Quid ista ſic diligis &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Why dost thou ſo loue theſe terrene and earthly things, as if they were thine owne? Thou art couered &amp; ouerwhelmed with theſe. The day will come, which shall reueale or lay thee open, &amp; which shall free thee from the company of a filthy &amp; ſmelling belly. The ſecrets and miſteries of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture shalbe once made euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto thee, this dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes shalbe diſpelled, and thou shalt be encompaſsed</hi>

                  <hi>on each ſide with a shining light. Imagine, how great that fulgour shalbe, when ſo many ſtarres do mingle their lights together. No shadow shal hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this brightnes. Euery part of heauen shall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually shine. The day and night are but alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and enterchanges of the loweſt part of the ayre. Then shall thou ſay, that afore thou liuedſt in darkenes, I meane, when thou shalt at once behold all the brightnes and ſplendour together, which thou now darkly ſeeſt by the narrow helpe of thy eyes; and yet doſt admire it being ſo farre of from thee: what shall that diuine light ſeeme to thee, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou shalt ſe it in its owne natiue place? This cogitation admitteth no baſe, vile, or inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane thing in the mind. But in lieu thereof it ſaith, that the Gods are witneſſes of all things; it commandeth vs, that we ſeeke to be approued &amp; accepted by the Gods; and teacheth vs, that they prouide and prepare Eternity for vs.</hi> Thus farre <hi>Seneca</hi> of this point: in which diſcourſe he hath deliuered many excellent things as concerning the Soule of man. Firſt, that the Soule is like vnto God; ſince it exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it ſelfe to all places, and to Eternity. Secondly, that when it leaueth the body, it is ranged amongſt <hi>Gods</hi> &amp; <hi>ſpirits.</hi> Thirdly, that we heere ſtay vpon the earth, as but in the way of our iourney; heauen it ſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Country. And that al things in this world, which are externall or independe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:2520:203"/>
of the ſoule, are to be reputed in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as burdens or prouiſions are, which ſerue only the more conueniently to finiſh our iourneys. Fourthly, that as an Infant is prepared in nyne months for to liue in this world; ſo ought we (during all the tyme we liue here) to learne to diſpoſe our ſelues for the entertaining of the immortal life of the world to come. Fiftly, that the laſt day of our mortall life is the beginning of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Sixtly, that the Soule being departed from the body, is then clearly to ſee the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of nature, and a diuine light and ſplendour. Seauenthly and laſtly, that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity is euer to be ſet before eyes; as that we may make our ſelues apt to enioy it, &amp; that we ought to lead our life in ſuch ſort as it may be approued of God, who is the beholder of al things. The like matter here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we may find in <hi>Plato, Plotinus, Cicero, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pictetus,</hi> and other heathen wryters. But now it next followeth in Methode, that we produce ſuch arguments (and after diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue and anſwere them) as may ſeeme to impugne the former verity of the Soules Immortality.</p>

               <head>THE ARGVMENTS, OBIECTED<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> againſt the Immortality of the Soule; and their Solutions, or Anſweres. <hi>CAAP. XXIV.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE firſt may be this. That Soule,<note place="margin">The 1. Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</note> all whoſe operation and function de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends vpon a corporal <hi>Organ,</hi> or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, cannot conſiſt ſeparated from the body; But the reaſonable Soule of man is ſuch: Therefore the reaſonable ſoule can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſiſt ſeparated from the body. And thus is this firſt argument contracted. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, and diſtinguiſh of the <hi>Maior,</hi> or firſt <hi>Propoſition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two wayes then may the operation of the Soule depend of a corporall or bodily <hi>organ</hi> or inſtrument. Firſt by it ſelfe &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly. Secondly accidentally and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly. Yf the operation and working of the Soule depend of the body in the firſt manner, then is it euident, that ſuch an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration cannot be performed without the helpe and aſſiſtance of the body; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, that, that Soule (whoſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king dependeth after this ſort) cannot exiſt ſeparated from the body. And ſuch is the ſoule of beaſts. And ſo in this ſenſe the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior</hi>
                  <pb n="389" facs="tcp:2520:204"/>
                  <hi>Propoſition is true.</hi> But if the operation of the ſoule depend of a corporall inſtrument after the ſecond ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, then is the foreſaid Propoſition falſe. And the reaſon hereof is, becauſe what agreeth to another thing <hi>per accidens</hi> (as the phraze is) <hi>&amp; per aliud,</hi> that is accidentally, caſually, and in regard only of a third thing, may be taken away. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſeing the function of the <hi>vnderstanding</hi> (which is an eſſentiall faculty of the reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſoule) doth not depend of the body, by it ſelfe, neceſſarily and immediatly, but only accidentally &amp; mediatly; there is no hinderance, but that it may be performed without the body. Now that the function or operation of the <hi>vnderſtanding</hi> doth not depend of the body by it ſelfe and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly, may be proued by many reaſons. And firſt, the function of the <hi>vnderstanding</hi> chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſiſteth in iudging; but to iudge of a thing the <hi>phantaſy</hi> (which is a corporeall internall ſenſe) or any <hi>Idea,</hi> or image fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med therein, is not in any ſort furthering or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ducing, but rather an impedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t therto; as giuing an occaſion oftentimes of erring. For the <hi>vnderstanding</hi> ought not to follow the imagination and conceit of the <hi>phantaſy,</hi> neither ought it in iudging to be guided thereby; but rather it is to correct the <hi>phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſy,</hi> that it ſelfe may by this meanes arryue
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:2520:205"/>
vnto the truth. Now if the force of the <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding</hi> be ſo great, that it is able to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the errours and miſtakings of the <hi>phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſy,</hi> and to attaine vnto the cleare truth of things (which tranſgreſſeth the nature or working of the <hi>phantaſy</hi>) then may we fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence conclude, that the working of the <hi>vnderstanding</hi> doth not immediatly, or in its owne nature depend of the <hi>phantaſy.</hi> Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly, the former point is further proued, becauſe we chiefly couet to know things ſpirituall; of which things the <hi>phantaſy</hi> is in no ſort capable.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe the knowledge of truth is not reckoned among the goods of the body, but of the mind only; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is to be deſired for the perfection only of the mind. Fourthly, becauſe deuout and holy men are ſomtimes eleuated in an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſis</hi> to that ſpirituall contemplation, which cannot be expreſſed in words; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not to be repreſented by the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or <hi>phantaſy;</hi> as may be gathered out of the Apoſtle in his ſecond Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> c. 12. But becauſe I ſtryue to be ſhort, therefore, I omit heere to iterate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers things aboue ſet downe, touching the force of vnderſtanding and deſiring.</p>
               <p>But ſome here may demaund: How the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cometh it to paſſe, that we cannot vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:2520:205"/>
any thing, except we forge a certaine image of it in the <hi>phantaſy?</hi> And fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce procedeth this neceſſity? To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that this procedeth from the preſent ſtate of the ſoule; to wit, becauſe the ſoule is the forme of the body, actually infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and giuing life to it. For as during al that tyme, that the ſoule remaineth in the body, it (after a certaine manner) putteth vpon the ſtate and nature of the body, and becometh in a ſort groſſe and dull, that thereby it may better acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modatate it ſelfe to the body. So all things, which then it conceaueth, it conceaueth &amp; apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth vnder a certaine corporal ſhew and forme. For it is an <hi>axiome</hi> in Philoſophy, <hi>that the manner of working followeth the manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence.</hi> But when the ſoule ſhalbe ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the body, and ſhalbe gathered (as it were) into it ſelfe and ſubſiſt by it ſelfe; then ſhall it enioy another degree or kind of vnderſtanding; neither ſhall it haue any neceſſity of framing the <hi>Idea's</hi> &amp; images of things in the <hi>phantaſy;</hi> no otherwiſe then the Intelligences haue, which wee call Angels. To conclude, as long as the Soule is in the body, it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not rightly exerciſe the <hi>vnderstanding</hi> and reaſon, except it haue the externall ſenſes looſe, and it liberty; as is euident euen from thoſe dreames, which
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:2520:206"/>
we haue in ſleepe. Now the cauſe hereof is not, that the function of the ſenſes do ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage the function of the <hi>vnderstanding,</hi> or that this doth depend of that other; but becauſe the faculty of the <hi>vnderſtanding,</hi> is the ſupreme and moſt excellent faculty of the ſoule. Wherupon it riſeth, that for the perfect exerciſe of the <hi>vnderſtanding,</hi> it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, that the ſoule be altogether free &amp; vnbounded; that ſo it may bend &amp; beſtow all the force and power of its eſſence vpon ſuch an operation. And of this point a ſigne is, that when we vehemently apply our mind to vnderſtand, and apprehend any thing, we ſcarcely obſerue and note ſuch things, as do occurre our ſenſe; the force of the ſoule buſiyng it ſelfe in its moſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme and moſt noble action of all. Ad he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reto, that there is ſuch a connexio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſympathy of the powers of the ſoule in the body, as that the ſoule cannot exerciſe the higheſt &amp; moſt worthy of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if at the ſame preſent it doth alienate and eſtrange it ſelfe from the loweſt. Here I meane of the reciprocall affinity of theſe powers only, which belong to knowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge.</p>
               <p>The ſecond argument. Yf the ſoule, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<note place="margin">The 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</note> it is diſueſted of the body, be immortall, then ſhall it eyther continually remayne ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:2520:206"/>
from the body, or els ſometime be reſtored to it. But it ſeemeth, that neither of theſe can be warranted with reaſon. Not the firſt, becauſe it ſo ſhould continue in a ſtate, which is violent and aduerſe to nature; for ſeing the ſoule of man is the loweſt &amp; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of all ſpirituall ſubſtances; it requyreth to be in the body, as the forme of it; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it hath a naturall propenſion to be vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the body; therefore to be ſeparated from the body, and to exiſt and continue ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratly, is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to its naturall inclination, and in ſome ſort violent. But <hi>Violence &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity are incompatible.</hi> Not the later (I meane that ſometime after its ſeparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſoule is to be reſtored and reunited with the body) becauſe from hence it would follow, that the reſurrection of the body ſhould be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and due to the naturall courſe of things, which point is not to be granted; both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a high miſtery of Chriſtian fayth, as alſo in that all ancient Heathen Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers were vtterly ignorant of this doctrine of the reſurrection of bodyes.</p>
               <p>I anſwere: firſt that <hi>Origen</hi> and the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonicks</hi> vtterly denyed the reaſonable ſoule to be the forme of the body, who placed the ſame in the body, not as a forme in its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſubiect for the commodity, and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the ſubiect; but as one, that is guilty,
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:2520:207"/>
and detained in priſon for a reuenge of its former errours. Whereupon they taught, that one ſubſtance (to wit Man) was not properly compounded of the ſoule and the body; but they auerred, that only the ſoule was man, and the body the priſon; &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſaid, that euery body was to be auoyded. But for confutation of this errou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it is manifeſt, that it is repugnant to reaſon. For if the ſoule be with-houlde in the body as in a priſon, why then doth it ſo much feare and auoid death? Or why is it ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous to the ſoule to be diſioyned and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the body? Why is it not painful to the ſoule to ſtay in a body ſo ſtored with filth and impurity? As we ſee it is moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to a man of worth, &amp; accuſtomed to places of note and regard, to be kept in a ſordid and obſcure dungeon. Why doth it ſo much affect the commodities and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the body, and is ſo greatly deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therewith? Why at the hurt and loſſe of the body, is it ſo infinitly afflicted and moleſted, ſince otherwiſe it hath iuſt reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to reioyce at theſe corporal endomages, no otherwiſe, then captiues and impriſoned perſons, who are glad to ſee their chaines fall aſunder, &amp; their priſon laid leuell with the ground? Therefore ſeing the reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie ſoule is no leſſe ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſible of ioy or griefe,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:2520:207"/>
touching the pleaſures or aduerſities of the body, then the ſoules of beaſts are; it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the reaſonable ſoule is the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall forme of mans body, and that it doth affect and couet to be vnited with it. Yet becauſe it is not ſo immerſed in the body as that it ought to be extinguiſhed with it, but is able (through the benefit of its owne ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>This opinion then being reiected, we affirme that the ſoule is not to continue ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, but ſometimes to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eunited to the body; becauſe it was not firſt ordained to be an entyre and complete ſubſtance (as an Angell is) but to be only a part of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, to wit the forme, and conſequently an imperfect and incomplete ſubſtance. Whereupon it is needfull, that we admit the reſurrection of bodies. And yet we cannot tearme this to be naturall, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the forming of the body, and the vnion of the ſoule with the body be a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall thing, and due to the naturall ſtate &amp;
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:2520:208"/>
perfection of the ſoule; yet this cannot be accompliſhed by naturall cauſes, but only by diuine power; and therefore it is to be called <hi>ſupernaturalis;</hi> euen as giuing ſight to the blynd is ſo reputed, or reſtoring of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed and feeble parts of the body, and the curing of incurable diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>Neither ought it to ſeeme ſtrange, that the ſoule of man cannot obtaine for euer its naturall perfection, without the power of God, and his extraordinary aſſiſtance; the reaſon here of being in that it is capable of a double, &amp; (as it were) of a contrary nature; to wit ſpirituall and corporall, mortall and immortall. Therefore the Soule requireth the body (once loſt) to be reſtored to it; but to be reſtored ſo firmely &amp; ſtrongly, as that it is neuer more to be loſt, is ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, ſince otherwiſe there ought to be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite tymes a reſurrection of bodyes.</p>
               <p>The Philoſophers were ignorant of this reſurrection, either becauſe they thought the ſoule not to be the naturall forme of the body, but a complete ſubſtance, or els, in that they thought it leſſe inconuenyent to teach, that the ſoule remained after death perpetually ſeparated, then to introduce &amp; bring in (as a new doctrine) the reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the body. For though it be naturall to the ſoule to be in the body, yet in that reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:2520:208"/>
only, as it is ſeparated from it, it fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth no griefe, but rather it is freed therby from all the inconueniences and diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of this life, &amp; obtaineth a more high and more worthy degree, and becomes more neere to diuine &amp; celeſtial ſubſtances. Wherefore I do not thinke, that the ſoule (being ſeparated) doth of it ſelfe much co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet to be reunited with the body; though by the force and weight of nature, it hath a propenſion therto; And the reaſon her of is, becauſe thoſe goods and priuiledges it poſſeſſeth, as it is ſeparated, are more to be eſteemed, then thoſe are, which it enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the body.</p>
               <p>Neither is it true, that this ſeparation is violent to the ſoule; for although the want of this vnion be in ſome ſort violent to it, to wit by way of negation; as it is a priuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that, to which the very eſſence of the ſoule doth efficaciouſly propend and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clyne, yet that liberty, which it then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyeth, and that vigour of the Soule &amp; ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of vnderſtanding is not in any ſort vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, but moſt agreable to its nature, as it is in ſtate of ſeparation.</p>
               <p>The third Argument. The ſtructure of<note place="margin">The 3. Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</note> the body may ſeeme to intimate &amp; imply the mortality of the ſoule; for it is almoſt wholy framed for the temporal vſes of this
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:2520:209"/>
mortall life; to wit that the body may be maintained and preſerued, and nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated and continued.</p>
               <p>Thus the teeth and ſtomacke are ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to chew and concoct meate; the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines and bowels to auoyd the ſuperfluous and excrementall matter; the liuer to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect bloud; the gall to receaue the ſharper &amp; more bitter parts of the nutriment; the ſplen or milt to containe the more groſſe bloud; the reynes to part and diuyde the <hi>ſeraſus,</hi> &amp; wheiſh matter of the nouriſhment from the bloud; the bladder to receaue and ſend out this wheiſh matter; the inſtruments of the ſexe to procreatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But after this life, there ſhalbe no need either of the vſe of meates or of procreation: therfore there ought not to be theſe members, which are ordayned to thoſe ends; and conſequently there ought not to be the ſoule, which requireth ſuch members, and a body ſo framed and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. For thoſe members are to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in vayne &amp; ſuperfluous, of which there neuer ſhalbe any vſe.</p>
               <p>I anſwere; This argument directly &amp; immediatly oppugneth the reſurrection, &amp; ſecundarily and by way of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequence, the immortality of the ſoule. For the compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſtructure of mans body prooueth, that in it ſelfe, and by its owne nature, it is
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:2520:209"/>
mortall; but it doth not prooue the ſoule to be in like ſort mortall. But although the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy be diſolued and do periſh, yet it is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill &amp; eaſy matter for God to frame it againe in its due tyme, &amp; to reinfuſe the ſoule into it, and ſo to cauſe, that the body ſhall neuer after be diſſolued: for as <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Timaeo,</hi> teacheth; <hi>Quod natura ſua ſolubile est &amp;c. VVhat in its owne nature stands ſubiect to diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and obnoxious vnto death, the ſame by the commandement and will of God may be made im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, ſo as it shall neuer dye.</hi> Certainly thoſe functions of the members, which belong to nouriſhment of the body, and to generation ſhall ceaſe, notwithſtanding it followeth not, that thoſe members ſhalbe ſuperfluous; becauſe they ſhall ſerue to the naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the body, as parts neceſſary to its perfection and beauty: for this is their chiefe and principall vſe, to wit, to conduce to the making of a perfect and complete body, and ſuch, as is fitting to the condition &amp; ſtate of the ſoule.</p>
               <p>Now theſe functions are only a ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary end, becauſe they are ordained only for the tyme, and ſerue only to repayre the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines of mortall body, the naturall heat fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon, and conſuming the ſubſtance of the fleſh: whereupon it followeth, that as the augmentation or increaſe of the bodyes

greatneſſe ceaſeth, when it once hath attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned its iuſt ſtature; Euen ſo ſhall nutrition or nouriſhment of the body ceaſe, and the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions belonging thereto, when the body by a diuine hand and power ſhall become immortall. For ſeeing theſe functions are o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the loweſt degree, as agreeing to the ſoule according to its meaneſt faculty and parte, wherein it participateth with plants, and is heerein attended with much droſſe, filth, &amp; rottennes, it was not conuenient, that they ſhould be perpetuall, but that in due tyme they ſhould be taken away, God reducing the body into a better forme; Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the function of the ſenſes, becauſe they are made after a ſpirituall manner without corruption, they ſhalbe perpetuall: In like ſort the function of the voyce and ſpeach ſhalbe perpetuall, to the which thoſe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſhall after their manner either neerely or remotely be ſeruiceable; and therefore in this reſpect alſo they ſhall not be in vaine &amp; ſuperfluous.</p>
               <p>The fourth argument may be taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe words, which <hi>Pliny</hi> in his ſeauenth<note place="margin">The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of Pliny.</note> booke of his hiſtory, c. 55. ſetteth downe, though they be of ſmall force and validity. Firſt then he to this purpoſe ſaith, <hi>Omnibus a ſuprema die &amp;c. The ſame happeneth to all things after th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ir last day, which was at their beginning.</hi>
                  <pb n="401" facs="tcp:2520:210"/>
                  <hi>Neither after death is there more ſenſe to the body or ſoule, then there was before its birth.</hi> I anſwere and ſay, that that is heere aſſumed, which is firſt to be prooued, and therefore it is deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſame facility, wherwith it was affirmed. And that this ſaying of his is falſe, it is prooued from the whole ſchoole of the <hi>Platonicks,</hi> and the <hi>Pithagoreans.</hi> For there is no neceſſity, why that, which once begun, ſhould ſometimes ceaſe, eſpecialle if it be a ſimple and vncompounded ſubſtance, as the ſoule and euery ſpirituall nature is. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is otherwiſe of corporall things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of the Elements, of whome only that ſentence is verifyed; <hi>Omne genitum poteſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumpi: Euery thing that is made, may be corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi> Certainly <hi>materia prima</hi> (becauſe it is ſimple and vncompounded) though it had a beginning, yet can it not be corrupted. The ſame alſo (according to the doctrine of the <hi>Platonicks</hi>) is to be ſaid of the celeſtiall Orbs. Therefore although there was no ſenſe of the ſoule before its creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth it not, that therefore after death it ſhall haue no ſenſe. And the reaſon hereof is, becauſe though the birth (as it were) of the ſoule be ioined with the birth of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and thereupon the ſoule did exiſt before the birth of the body; notwithſtanding the deſtruction of the ſoule doth not follow the
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:2520:211"/>
deſtruction of the body, for death is not a deſtruction or extinguiſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of them both, but only a ſeparation of the body from the ſoule.</p>
               <p>In the next place <hi>Pliny</hi> demandeth, <hi>Cur corpus &amp;c. why the body followeth and coueteth the ſoule?</hi> I anſwere, that no body followeth the ſoule departing from hence, becauſe the ſoule (as being a naked and ſimple ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) can conſiſt without the body. Then ſaith he, <hi>Vbi cogitatio illi? From whence hath the ſoule ſeparated its cogitation or diſcourſe?</hi> The ſoule being in ſtate of ſeparation, hath no need of a braine or a body, that it may thinke, imagine, and diſcourſe, (euen as we grant that God &amp; ſpirituall ſubſtances haue not thoſe <hi>Organs</hi>) becauſe the force of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, by how much it is more remote &amp; diſtant from the body, by ſo much it is more excellent. Next asketh Pliny; <hi>Quomodo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus &amp; auditus? From whence hath the ſoule ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated ſeeing and hearing?</hi> Whereto it is replyed, that the ſoule needeth not the function and operation of the outward ſenſes ſeing, that it perceaueth all things in its mynd. For the the mynd then doth not only ſerue to cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, or thinke, or to know things abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiuely; but alſo to behold and apprehend all things, which in this life we apprehend with our externall ſenſes; euen as Pliny
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:2520:211"/>
himſelfe ſpeaketh of God; <hi>Quiſquis eſt Deus &amp;c. VVhoſoeuer God is, he is all ſenſe, all ſight, all hearing, all ſoule, all vnderſtanding, all him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In like ſort we ſay of the ſoule being ſeparated, that it is all ſenſe, all ſight, all hearing, all vnderſtanding, all vigour and life. Againe he queſtioneth; <hi>Quid agit? qui vſus eius? What doth the ſoule ſeparated? Or what vſe is there of it?</hi> Of whom by retortio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I demand, <hi>what do other ſpirits and incorporeall ſubſtances?</hi> As if it were nothing to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate, praiſe, and loue God, and to enioy the fellowſhip of celeſtiall ſpirits. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the cecity and blindneſſe of this man is wonderfull, who may be thought not to haue acknowledged the being of any ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. Therefore how much more wiſely &amp; deliberatly did the <hi>Platonicks,</hi> and the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateticks</hi> teach, who placed ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s chiefe feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city in conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plating of the firſt beginning and cauſe of all things? Pliny proceedeth yet further: <hi>Quid ſine ſenſibus bonum? VVhat can be good, which is not to be apprehended by the ſenſes?</hi> I ſay to acknowledge no good of the ſoule without the ſenſes is incident to ſwyne and beaſts, not to Philoſophers: next, <hi>Quae deinde ſedes? VVhat ſeate or manſion for the ſoules ſeperated?</hi> The anſwere is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite and ready; to wit the manſion for the
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:2520:212"/>
pious and vertuous ſoules in heauen, for the wicked Hell. And this opinion all Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity euer did hold. Next he asketh: <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta multitud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> &amp;c. how great a multitude is there of ſoules, as of shadowes for ſo many ages?</hi> To which is to be anſwered, that the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſoules is as great, as there is number of men, which haue liued from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world vnto this day. For ſeeing the world tooke a beginning, the number of the ſoules is not infinite, but it is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended within a certaine number, and that not exceedingly great: for it were not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry difficult to ſhew, that this number ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth not two or three Myriades of mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions. Now the ſoules are ignorantly called by Pliny <hi>Vmbrae, Shadowes,</hi> ſeing that they are like vnto light, and the body is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled rather to a ſhadow, as the Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks were accuſtomed to ſay. After this Pliny thus expoſtulateth: <hi>Quae dementia &amp;c. VVhat folly is it to maintaine, that life is iterated, and begun againe by meanes of death?</hi> But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (as in all the reſt) he is deceaued; for the life of the ſoule is not iterated after the death of the body; but the body dying, it continueth and perſeuereth. After he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enquireth: <hi>Quae genitis quies &amp;c. VVhat reſt can euer be, if the ſenſe &amp; vigour of the ſoule remaineth aloofe of in ſo high a place?</hi> To which
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:2520:212"/>
is to be anſwered that not only reſt, quyet and fredome from the troubles and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of this life belongeth to the ſoules ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, but alſo wonderfull pleaſures and ioy, if they haue here liued well; but mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, if they haue ſpent their tyme in wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckednes without finall repentance. And this the Platonicks alſo acknowledge. In the next place he thus further diſcourſeth, ſaying, that, <hi>the feare of what is to ſucceed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this life, doth leſſen the pleaſures of this life.</hi> Thus we heere ſee, that this is the chiefe reaſon, why wicked men are loth to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue the immortality of the ſoule, to wit, becauſe this their beliefe confoundeth all their pleaſures, &amp; woundeth their mynds with a continuall feare of what is after to come. For being conſcious and guilty to themſelues of their owne impiety, and of what they iuſtly do deſerne, therefore they wiſh that their ſoule might dy with their body, ſince they cannot expect with reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a greater benefit. For ſo they ſhould be free from miſery and torments, which hang o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their heads. And becauſe they earneſtly deſire this, they are eaſily induced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue it to come to paſſe. Now the extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing of the ſoule is not the chiefe good of nature, (as <hi>Pliny</hi> thinketh) but the chiefe euill rather of nature, ſince euery thing
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:2520:213"/>
chieffly auoydeth its owne deſtruction, as loſing al it goodnes in Nature thereby. For how can that be accounted the chiefe good of nature, by the which all iuſtice is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, all reward and remuneration is taken away from vertue, and all chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from vyce? For though it were for the good of the wicked, that the ſoule were mortall, yet it were moſt iniurious to the vertuous, and hurtfull to the publick good of the <hi>vniuerſe,</hi> no otherwiſe then it would be inconuenient to the good of a temporal commonwealth, if no rewards ſhould be propounded for vertue, nor reuenge for exorbitancy and tranſgreſſion of the lawes. Certainly the cogitation of death, &amp; the ſoules immortality increaſeth the anxiety and griefe of the wicked; ſince they do not only complaine for the death of the body (which depriueth them of all pleaſure of this life) but alſo (and this with far greater vehemency) for the puniſhments, which after the death of the body, they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded (through a ſecret feeling of nature) their ſoules are to ſuffer. But now on the contrary part, the former cogitation doth increaſe the ioy and comfort of the vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; ſeing they not only reioyce at the death of the body (by meanes whereof they are diſcharged of al the afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the world)
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:2520:213"/>
but alſo (and this in far greater meaſure) at the certaine expectation of that felicity and happines, wherwith after their death they ſhalbe repleniſhed.</p>
               <p>Now from all this heretofore deliuered &amp; ſet downe it is euident, that the obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and reaſons of <hi>Pliny</hi> are moſt weake &amp; friuolous; as proceding rather from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueterated hate and auerſion of the contrary doctrine, then from any force and ground of reaſon.</p>
               <p>But here one perhaps may reply &amp; ſay; Be it ſo, that the ſoule is immortall, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding it may ſo be, that after this life it ſhall ſuffer no euill, but enioy great li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, buſiyng it ſelfe in the contemplatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of things. Or if it ſhall ſuffer any puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, yet this ſufferance ſhall not be perpetuall, but longer or ſhorter, according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion &amp; nature of its offences committed in this world: and that greater ſinnes ſhalbe expiated with a more long puniſhment, or at leaſt with a more grieuous; and leſſer with a ſhorter or more gentle chaſtiſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Indeed I grant the iudgement of the <hi>Stoick</hi> to haue bene, that the ſoule after this life ſuffered no euill, but that inſtantly after death, it returned to ſome one appointed ſtarre or other; and there remayned either vntill the generall exuſtion and burning
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:2520:214"/>
of the world, if it were vertuous &amp; wiſe;<note place="margin">The vayne iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Stoicks touching the Soule.</note> or els only for a ſhort tyme, if it were wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cked and fooliſh; which period being once ended the ſoule was to be turned into the Element, from whence it was taken. But theſe aſſertions are friuolous, and not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted with any reaſon; for granting that ſoules do liue after this life, what then is more eaſy to be belieued, then that they receaue either rewards or paynes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their different comporttments in this world? Since otherwiſe where ſhould the Prouidance of God be? Or where Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice? But of this point we haue abundan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly diſcourſed aboue. Furthermore, if Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les for a certayne tyme can ſubſiſt without a body, why can they not for euer continue ſo? For ſeing they are ſimple and vncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded ſubſtances, they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not in proceſſe of tyme grow old, or looſe their ſtrength and vigour (as bodyes compounded of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do.) Now if they can (but for one inſtant) exiſt and liue without a body, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can they for all eternity perſeuer in that ſtate, as being not ſubiect to any extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhment or deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as the whole ſchoole of the <hi>Peripatetiks,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelfe do teach. For there is nothing, which can deſtroy or corrupt a ſimple ſubſtance, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting by it ſelfe. And therefore it is houl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:2520:214"/>
that <hi>Materia</hi> (as being a ſimple ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and inhering in no other thing, as in a ſubiect) is incorruptible, and inexter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable.</p>
               <p>Now touching that, which is ſpoken of the burning of ſoules, in that ſenſe, as if they could be diſſolued and vaniſh away into ayre, by meanes of fyer (as bodyes) is no leſſe abſurd. For the ſoule is not a body, or an oyle-ſubſtance, which can be ſet on fire; but it is a ſpirit more thin, pure, and light, then either ayre or fyer. But what is diſſolued with fyer, ought to be corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall, and more groſſe and corpulent then the fyre it ſelfe, or that, into the which it is diſſolued. It may be further added hereto that the foundation of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> wherupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they grounded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, that ſoules were to ſuffer no euill after this life (notwithſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their great ſinnes and enormities here<note place="margin">

<pb n="410" facs="tcp:2520:215"/>
bonds and chaynes, were to returne to that principle, from whence they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryued; meaning to that <hi>vniuerſall ſoule</hi> of the world, with the which they finally cloſe themſelues. All which aſſertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are in their owne nature ſo abſurd, as that they need not any painfull refutatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For if the ſoules be parcels of God, how can they be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with fyre? Or finally how ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they be depraued with ſo many facinorous crymes and impieties? Yea it would from hence follow, that <hi>Diuinity</hi> it ſelfe ſhould conſiſt (as bodyes do) of parts, and ſhould be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to all euils and inconueniences whatſoeuer.

               <p>
                  <hi>Origen</hi> did indeed confeſſe, that ſoules were immortall, and that they were neuer to loſe their owne proper kind and nature; notwithſtanding he taught, that the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of them were not ſempiternall, but were to take an end after certaine ages. The ſame he in like ſort affirmed of the paynes &amp; torments of the Diuels. But this errour of <hi>Origen</hi> (which he borrowed of the <hi>Platonicks</hi>) was further acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with many other errours.</p>

<pb n="411" facs="tcp:2520:215"/>
were of the ſame nature, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that ſoules were as free from all corporall commere, as Angels were.</p>
               <p>2. That Soules, before they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned to the body did ſinne, and for guilt of ſuch their ſinnes, were tyed to bodyes, and incloſed in them as in priſons.</p>
               <p>3. That ſoules were coupled with bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes in a certayne preſcribed order; As firſt with more ſubtill bodyes; then if they continued ſinning, with groſſer bodyes; &amp; laſtly with terrene and earthly bodyes: &amp; further <hi>Origen</hi> taught that theſe ſeueral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of theſe ſoules deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding into bodyes were repreſented by the ladder, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to <hi>Iacob</hi> in his ſleepe <hi>Geneſis</hi> 24.</p>
               <p>4. That all ſoules, as alſo the Diuels, ſhould after certaine ages be ſet at liberty, and reſtored to an Angelicall light &amp; ſple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour; to wit, when they had fully expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their ſinnes with condigne puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts.</p>
               <p>5. That this viciſſitude and entercha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of felicity &amp; miſery ſhould be ſempiternal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; for euer in reaſonable creatures: ſo as the ſame ſoules ſhould infinite tymes be both bleſſed and miſerable; for after they had continued in heauen for many ages bleſſed and happy, then (as being againe ſatiated and cloyed with the fruition of diuyne things) they ſhould contaminate &amp; defyle

themſelues with ſinne; for the which they were againe to be detruded into bodyes, in the which if they liued wickedly, they were to be caſt into the paines of hel, which being for a tyme ſuffered, they were to be reſtored vnto Heauen.

comportment of each man in this world; Notwithſtanding what this reward ſhalbe (whether it be conferred vpon the good or the bad) and of what continuance, neither can mans reaſon nor the diſquiſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and ſearch of the beſt Philoſophers giue any ſatisfying anſwere hereto. The cauſe of which inexplicable difficulty is, partly in that it dependeth of the meere free decree of God; and partly becauſe the nature of ſinne (and conſequently the puuiſhment due to it) is not made ſufficiently euident and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous by naturall reaſon. Therefore to the end we may haue ſome infallible cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty herein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we are to recurre to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Oracles of Gods written word, in the which we are able to ſee what the holy Ghoſt by his Prophets &amp; other pious men, haue pronounced of this point; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the paines of the wicked, whereof we now intreate.</p>
               <p>1. The firſt teſtimony then may be taken out of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> c. 23. in that moſt admirable and propheticall Canticle or ſong of Moyſes. <hi>Ignis ſuccenſus est &amp;c. Fire is kindled in my wrath, and shall burne vnto the bottome of hell, and shall conſume the earth with her encreaſe, and ſet on fire the foundation of the mountaines.</hi> In which words fiue things are to be conſidered. Firſt, that the fire (with
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:2520:217"/>
the which ſinners ſhalbe puniſhed) is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy kindled; both becauſe the fire of hell is prepared from the beginning, as our Lord inſinuateth in Matth. 25. and the like is in Eſay 30. as alſo in that though that fire with the which the world ſhalbe conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med be not already enkindled, yet it now exiſteth in Gods moſt certaine preſcience and preordinance. For what is certaine to come by the force of Gods decree, is ſaid after a propheticall manner now to exiſt, or to be done. Of this fire Dauid the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaketh <hi>Pſalm. 50. Ignis in conſpectu &amp;c. A fire shall deuoure before him, and a mighty tempest shalbe moued round about him: as alſo Pſalme 97. Ignis ante ipſum &amp;c. there shall go a fire before him, and burne vp his enemies round about.</hi> Both which places are interpreted of the fire of the laſt iudgment. Secondly in the foreſaid words of <hi>Moyſes</hi> we are to note, that this fire is kindled in the wrath of God that is, his will and firme reſolution of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the wicked: and this not after an accuſtomed faſhion, but after a horrible &amp; vnheard manner, and ſuch as fury is wont to ſuggeſt and inuent. For the anger and wrath of God are not paſſions in him, (as they are in vs) but a peaceable and quyet will in him gouerned with reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it is moſt ſeuere, efficacious, and
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:2520:218"/>
moſt powerfull inflicting eternall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Seing then that the effect of God herein doth equall, and indeed tranſcend all fury, it may therefore moſt deſeruedly be called <hi>fury, wrath,</hi> and <hi>indignation.</hi> Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly, that this fire is to burne vnto the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of hell; meaning hereby, that that fire ſhall not only heere on earth burne the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cked, when God ſhall iudge the world, but alſo in hell, and this for all Eternity. Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thly, that this fire ſhall conſume the earth (that is the whole ſuperficies of the earth) &amp; what proceedeth from the earth, as trees wood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hearbs, and all works of man now extant, as Houſes, Cittyes, the proud Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Princes, Towers, Munitions, &amp; all riches contained in them. All theſe things ſhalbe conſumed with that fire, and turned into aſhes, as <hi>S. Peter</hi> (whoſe teſtimony he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reafter we will ſet downe) plainly witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.</p>
               <p>Fiftly and laſtly, that the foreſaid fire (being the miniſter of Gods indignation &amp; reuenge) ſhall not only waſt the vpper and exteriour parts of the earth, &amp; what it ſhall find thereupon; but alſo ſhall penetrate vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bowels of the earth; ſo as it ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the very bottome of the higheſt mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines. Whereupon it followeth that all mettals, pretious ſtones, and all other ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:2520:218"/>
of the earth (with the pryde whereof the world now vaunteth and inſulteth ſo much) ſhalbe deſtroyed by the ſame fire; Since all theſe for the moſt partlye in the loweſt part of the mountaines, and in the bowels of the earth. Thus nothing ſhalbe found of that ſolidity, as to be able to reſiſt the rage and fury of this fire. Yea all ſuch bodyes (compounded of Elements) which by a generall name are called by the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers <hi>Mixta,</hi> ſhall in a ſhort tyme be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued with the force of the ſaid fire, and ſhalbe reduced to their firſt principles. This is inſinuated in the 97. Pſalm. which intreateth of the Iudgement to come, though in a propheticall manner, it ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of things, as though they were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy performed; for thus the Prophet there ſaith: <hi>Montes ſicut cera &amp;c. The mountaines melted like waxe, at the preſence of the Lord of the whole earth.</hi> And in <hi>Iudith</hi> likewiſe c. 16. we thus read. <hi>Montes à fundamentis &amp;c. The mountaines leape vp from their foundations &amp;c.

<pb n="418" facs="tcp:2520:219"/>
puniſhment of the wicked.</p>
               <p>2. The ſecond teſtimony is taken out of <hi>Iudith 16. Dabit ignem &amp;c. The Lord shal ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d fire &amp; wormes vpon their flesh, that they may feele, and be burnt for euer.</hi> In which words we fynd expreſly, that the puniſhments of the wicked ſhalbe for Eternity. The like place hereto is that of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus c. 7. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento irae &amp;c. Remember that vengeance wil not ſlacke. Humble thy mind greatly; for the venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the wicked is fire and wormes.</hi> But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the former text of <hi>Iudith, The Lord shall ſend fire vpon their flesh.</hi> This is ſaid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the very bodyes of the wicked ſhall inſtantly after the reſurrection be puniſhed with fire, and ſhall ſo burne like wood, as that they ſhall not need any externall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to nouriſh the ſame although this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſhall not be wanting; both which two things ſhall hereafter be explicated out of other paſſages of Scripture. But to proceed to the words following of the foreſaid text <hi>And wormes &amp;c.</hi> I do not thinke that theſe wormes ſhalbe corporall, ſo as they ſhall hurt the fleſh of the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned with their teeth (though ſome graue Authors may ſeeme to hold the contrary) for to what end ſhall it be needfull to make ſuch baſe and vile creatures immortall by force of a new mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, and to liue in a moſt raging fire, for
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:2520:219"/>
the puniſhing of men, ſeeing the bytings of any beaſt whatſoeuer in compariſon of the paines of that fire, are to be eſtemed, but as ſports and of no moment? I here omit, that the damned by reaſon of their fury and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiency ſhall wound with their teeth both themſelues, and their fellowes. Therefore by the name of <hi>wormes</hi> in this place may be vnderſtood thoſe very ſmall ſparkes and flames of fyre, which in a thouſand places breake out of the fleſh of the damned like vnto little wormes; or els the <hi>worme of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> may be ſignifyed thereby, whoſe moſt bitter byting &amp; gnawing doth in hel afflict euen the body. And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction<note place="margin">The worme of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</note> may the rather be admitted, it is to be knowne, that two ſeuerall cogitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s do daily preſent themſelues to the minds of the damned; to wit, not only that through their ſinnes they are depriued of eternall glory, the which they might with ſmall labour and paines haue purchaſed; but alſo that they are mancipated and bound to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting torments, which eaſily (whiles they liued) they might haue auoyded. Now from hence is engendred a double griefe, which with extreme bitternes gnaweth &amp; byteth (like a worme) the heart of thoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable ſoules.</p>
               <p>And theſe former cogitations &amp; afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:2520:220"/>
of ſpirit are moſt ſtinging wormes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whoſe bytings are the chiefeſt torments of the damned. For the apprehenſion of ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible a good loſt, and ſo infinite and inſufferable a puniſhment to be endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red (and both theſe for all eternity) more afflicteth the wicked, then the only paine of hell fire doth.</p>
               <p>This point may be confirmed in that out Lord in the Ghoſpell, &amp; the Prophet Eſay<note place="margin">Mark. 9. Eſay. 66.</note> in his booke, do expreſſe the torments of the wicked by fire, &amp; by the word <hi>worme.</hi> If then the foreſaid double cogitation, and the double griefe proceeding from thence be not vnderſtood, thereby, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the chiefe torment of the damned may ſeeme to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and not ſpoken of by eyther of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>

to wit, by falling into the greateſt euil that is, through an inordinate and intemperate loue of himſelfe.</p>

               <p>16. Now we will deſcend to the new teſtament. And the 16. authority may be taken from the teſtimony of <hi>S. Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> who in Matthew 3. in one ſhort admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth thrice inſinuate the paynes of the life to come. And firſt, when he ſpeaketh to the Phariſies: <hi>Genimina viperarum &amp;c. O generation of vipers, who hath ſorewarned you to fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

Secondly, where he ſaith: <hi>Omnis ergo arbor &amp;c. Therfore euery tree, which bringeth not forth good fruite, is hewe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> downe, &amp; caſt into the fire.</hi> Thirdly, in theſe words: <hi>Cuius ventilabrum &amp;c. Who hath his fanne in his hand, and will make cleane his flowre, &amp; gather his wheate into his garner; but will burne vp the chaffe with vnquenchable fire.</hi> For as the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with his fanne ſeuereth the chaffe from the corne; ſo Chriſt by his iudging po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer ſhall ſeparate the good from the euill, aſſigning to them their fitting place, lot, or portion.</p>
               <p>17. The 17. is in Marke c. 9. <hi>Si ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz auerit &amp;c. If thy hand cauſe thee to offend, cut it off; It is better for thee to enter into life may med, then hauing two hands, to goe into Hel, into the fire that neuer shalbe quenched; where the worme dyeth not, &amp; the fire neuer goet hou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="433" facs="tcp:2520:226"/>
The like he ſaith, touching the wanting of a foote and an eye. In which words he inſtructeth vs, that all things which giue occaſion of ſinning, (though they be as profitable to vs, as the hand, the foot, and the eye are) are to be forſaken; ſince it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arre more ſecure to want temporall bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and ſolaces, then to be caſt into eternall fire. And heare we are to obſerue, that this ſentence is three tymes repeated by our Lord, &amp; Sauiour, therby to inſinuate both the certainty of it; as alſo that by the often iteration of it, it might be firmly imprinted in the minds of al Chriſtians. Heere alſo we are to note, that it was not ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for Chriſt to ſay, <hi>To go into hell into fire that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer shalbe quenched,</hi> but ingeminating and doubling the ſame, he addeth: <hi>VVhere the worme dyeth not, and the fire neuer goeth out;</hi> thus ſuggeſting to vs twice in one ſentence the eternity of this fire. He further addeth in the end: <hi>Euery man shalbe ſalted with fire, and euery ſacrifice shalbe ſalted with ſalt:</hi> in which words he inſinuateth the reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, why ſinners are to be burned with fire: for as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ſacrifice, which according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript law was offered to God, was accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to be ſpinkled with ſalt, (according to that ſaying of <hi>Leuiticus 2. All thy oblations thou shalt ſeaſon with ſalt</hi>) ſo all ſinners, ſeing
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:2520:227"/>
hereafter they are to become as certaine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blations to be ſacrificed to the Iuſtice of God, are to be ſeaſoned (as it were) with fire, as with ſalt; for here ſinners are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a ſacrifice, and fire to ſalt. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we fynd, that the holy Scripture in many places calleth the puniſhment of the wicked a ſacrifice or oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; as in <hi>Eſay</hi> 34. <hi>Victima domini &amp;c. The Lord hath a great ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in Boſra, and a great ſlaughter in the land of Edom.</hi> And <hi>Ieremy</hi> 46. <hi>The Lord God of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes hath a ſacrifice in the North country by the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Euphrates.</hi> And finally in <hi>Ezechiel</hi> 39. <hi>Aſſemble your ſelues, and come, gather your ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues on euery ſide to my ſacrifice, for I do ſacrifice a great ſacrifice for you vpon the mountaines of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſraell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For as beaſts were killed in honour of God to expiate ſinnes, and to appeaſe the wrath of God ſo the whole multitude of the wicked ſhalbe ſlaine in the laſt night, &amp; (after a ſort) ſhalbe ſacrificed vnto God, that their puniſhment may in ſome ſort ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy for the ſinnes, and ſo Gods indignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as being appeaſed therewith) may ceaſe. Furthermore <hi>fire</hi> is rightly compared to <hi>ſalt</hi> for as ſalt burneth and conſerueth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, wherupon it is ſprinkled; ſo fire bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the bodyes of the damned; yet in that ſort, as it neuer conſumeth them, but euer
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:2520:227"/>
keepeth them entyre and whole for further torments.</p>
               <p>18. The 18. in <hi>Matthew</hi> 10. <hi>Nolite timere &amp;c. Feare you not them, which kill the body, but are not able to kill the ſoule; but rather feare him, who is able to deſtroy both ſoule and body in hell.</hi> And likewiſe in <hi>Luke</hi> 12. <hi>Dico autem vobis &amp;c. I ſay vnto you (my friends) Be not afraid of them, that kill the body, &amp; after that, are not able to do any more. But I will forewarne you, whome you shall feare: feare him, who after he hath killed, hath power to caſt into hell, yea I ſay vnto you, him feare.</hi> Here <hi>S. Matthew</hi> ſheweth that only God is to be feared, and that all Euils of this life are not of any moment or importance, if they be compared with the euils of the life to come, which God can afflict.</p>
               <p>19. The 19. <hi>Matthew</hi> 13. where he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth the paines of <hi>Hell</hi> in two parables.

As the tares are gathered and burned in the fire, ſo shall it be in the end of the world. The ſonne of man shall ſend forth his Angels, &amp; they shall gather out of his kingdome al things, that do offend, and them which do iniquity; &amp; shall caſt them into a furnace of fire.

                  <pb n="436" facs="tcp:2520:228"/>
Heere by the words, <hi>All that do offend;</hi> are vnderſtood all thoſe, that either in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerment, doctrine, counſell or example do prouoke others to ſinne; ſuch are tyrants, hereticks, wicked counſellers, and publick offenders. But thoſe other words: <hi>

               <p>The ſecond Parable is of the Fiſhers. Net in theſe words: <hi>Sic erit in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſummatione ſaeculi: exibunt Angeli &amp;c. So, shall it be in the end of the world. The Angels shall goe forth, and ſeuer the bad from among the Iust.

Secondly from the parable of the Lord of the family going from home, and diſtributing to his ſeruáts his talents, wherewith they were to nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate. Thirdly, from the ſmilitude of the ſheepheard, ſeuering the ſheepe from the

               </p>

From whence that ſtupendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous force in ſeedes, by the which the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes of all things, &amp; of all ſmalleſt parcels of thoſe bodyes are diſpoſed, framed, and made apt &amp; ſorting to their ends? Nothing of theſe ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be made by it ſelf, ſince nothing of theſe is for it ſelfe. No one of theſe is an end to it ſelfe, and therefore no one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is a beginning to it ſelfe. Neither can they receaue their being from <hi>fortune,</hi> or <hi>chance,</hi> for nothing that is firme, conſtant, regular, and conſiſting of moſt due and preciſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions proceed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe; all their effects being (indeed) changeable, vncertaine, &amp;

full of diſorder, and confuſion.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is moſt neceſſary, that all theſe things do take their beginning from ſome <hi>mind</hi> which through its <hi>wiſedome</hi> was able to excogitate and inuent ſo many wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful &amp; infinite things, through its <hi>power,</hi> to performe them, &amp; through its <hi>Prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,</hi> to gouerne them. And this <hi>mind</hi> or <hi>intellige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce</hi> we call Thee, being our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>God.</hi> Therefore thou art the Origin and ſourſe of all things, the efficient cauſe of all, the forme of all, the end of all, the ſupporter, foundation and conſeruation of all. In thee all things do pre-exiſt, and this not confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly, but moſt ordinately; yet after a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and abſtracted manner, and in a moſt pure eſſence or being; like as the worke of the artificer lyeth inwardly hid in his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and reſteth knowne to him alone, before it becometh an externall and ſenſible worke. All things are <hi>in thee, from thee, by thee, for thee, and thou art aboue all things.</hi> For thou art more diffuſed &amp; large, then any magnitude; more ancyent, then all eternity; more ſtrong then all power; more radiant &amp; ſhining then all light; more faire then all beauty; more ſweet then all pleaſure; more worthy and eleuated then all honour; more intrinſicall and inward then any ſecret; more high, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al height;

and more low, then any depth. Thou art moſt ſupreme, and yet beſt; moſt ſtable, &amp; yet incomprehenſible, moſt powerfull, &amp; yet moſt benigne; moſt mercifull, and yet moſt iuſt; moſt ſecret, and yet moſt preſent and inward; moſt faire and yet moſt ſtrong. Thou art immutable, and yet changeſt all things; neuer new, neuer old; thou rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt all things, &amp; yet bringeſt the proud man to decrepit old age. Thou art euer working, and yet euer quyet, creating, nouriſhing, and perfecting all things; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting, filling and protecting all things.

Thou art not poore, and yet thou reioyceſt at gaines; not couetous, yet expecteſt vſury; thou repayeſt debts, owing nothing; thou forgiueſt debts, looſing nothing.
