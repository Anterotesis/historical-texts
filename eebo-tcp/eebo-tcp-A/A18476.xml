            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>N Friday, being the ninth of March, <hi>Stilo veteri,</hi> about eight of the clocke in the eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the <hi>Prince,</hi> and the <hi>Lord Marquesse of Buckingham,</hi> being all alone with the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillion (as they had rid post together, three daies before) arriued at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and conueighed themselues with such secrecie into the house of the <hi>Earle of Bristoll,</hi> his Maiesties Embassador ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary to the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> that for that night, they were hardly knowne by any, but they could not be long concealed. For early vpon the next day being Saturday, there grew a whispering amongst many, as if
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:8185:3"/>
the <hi>Marquesse</hi> were come, but not a word of the Prince. The same mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Conde de Gondomar,</hi> was aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised priuatly of the arriuall, not onely of the Lord <hi>Marquesse,</hi> but of the <hi>Prince</hi> also, and so hee went instantly to the Earle of <hi>Bristowes</hi> house. After hee had done reuerence to his <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> and had passed an houre in his presence, and in discourse with his <hi>Highnesse,</hi> and those <hi>Lords,</hi> it was desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that hee would giue the <hi>King</hi> his Mastor notice of the arriual of the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesse;</hi> but that he should say nothing of the <hi>Prince</hi> at that time: at least not in any such sort, as that they might take knowledge of his being there. The <hi>Conde de Gondomar</hi> vndertooke it, and carried the newes thereof to the <hi>Conde de Oliua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> who is that Kings great Fauorite: and indeed a Person, who for his noble conditions and choise parts, doth well deserue the large portion which the King his Master affordeth him of his
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:8185:3"/>
estimation and affection: Hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueighed what he knew to his Maiesty, and then withall sent to the <hi>Marquesse,</hi> desiring earnestly that hee would giue him leaue to goe instantly and visit him. But the <hi>Marquesse</hi> excused him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, &amp; did expressely refuse it through his desire of concealing the Prince; and so they resolued vpon another meeting place for the afternoone, which fell out to bee the Parke. The <hi>Conde</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sent a Coach to the Lord <hi>Marquesse,</hi> and his Lordship tooke with him the <hi>Conde de Gondomar,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Bristoll,</hi> and Sir <hi>Walter Aston,</hi> his Maiesties ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Ambassador in that Court. The <hi>Conde de Oliuares</hi> was already expecting the Lord <hi>Marquesse,</hi> and at length they met, and spent more then an houre to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in great expressions of content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ioy. After this, the <hi>Conde</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted the Lord <hi>Marquesse,</hi> and all that Company into the Court, and so vp to the King by a priuate way. At which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:8185:4"/>
time, the Lord <hi>Marquesse</hi> deliuered the <hi>King</hi> our <hi>Soueraignes</hi> Letters to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and so much passed betweene them, as serued to disclose that the Prince was come, and at the Earle of <hi>Bristowes</hi> house, wherewith the <hi>King</hi> was extremely taken, and much trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with ioy. His <hi>Maiesty</hi> sent a hearty salutation to the <hi>Prince</hi> by the Lord <hi>Marquesse,</hi> wherewith his Lordship returned to his <hi>Highnesse,</hi> being extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily satisfied, both with that Kings Princely courtesie, and his many noble parts otherwise. The <hi>Conde de Oliuares</hi> conducted the Lord <hi>Marquesse</hi> home, &amp; pressing euen beyond his Commission (for he was not yet to take knowledge of the <hi>Princes</hi> arriuall) to kisse his <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> hand, hee saw him, and spake with him. The <hi>Prince</hi> receiued him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and like the Prince he is, and was very earnest with him, to put on his hat; but the <hi>Conde</hi> would by no meanes doe it; although hee bee a <hi>Graunde</hi> of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:8185:4"/>
               <hi>Spaine,</hi> and may therefore bee couered before his owne King.</p>
            <p>During this visit, the <hi>Marquesse</hi> desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the <hi>Conde,</hi> that he would oblige the <hi>Prince</hi> by getting him a speedy sight of the <hi>Infanta</hi> his Mistresse; wherein hee promised to doe his best endeuor, though it were in <hi>Lent,</hi> which hee said was a time of extraordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection and reseruation, and so they parted for the present, being all in great contentment one with another.</p>
            <p>In conformity to the <hi>Princes</hi> desire, his Maiesty (being that night acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it by the <hi>Conde)</hi> laid aside the consideration of the time, and instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resolued to giue his <hi>Highnesse</hi> all sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. And so he went abroad the next day, at the houre appointed, which was about three a clocke in the afternoone, and to the <hi>Prado</hi> being the certaine place agreed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:8185:5"/>
betweene them, his Maiesty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting with him his <hi>Queene,</hi> his Sister the <hi>Infanta,</hi> the <hi>Infantes Don Carlos,</hi> &amp; the Cardinall <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> his brethren; the <hi>Conde de Oliuares,</hi> and the <hi>Conde de Gondomar,</hi> following him with much of the Nobility of that Court, both of Ladies and Lords. The <hi>Prince</hi> on the other side went disguised in the Duke of <hi>Cea's</hi> Coach, and was attended in the same Coach by the Lord <hi>Marquesse,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Bristoll,</hi> the <hi>Conde de Gondo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi> and Sir <hi>Walter Aston.</hi> And so both the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Prince</hi> made diuers turnes and returnes in their seuerall Coaches, and in seuerall parts of the Towne and <hi>Prado</hi> (which is a place of recreation) where the Nobility is often wont to take the aire; and euery one of them saw each other in a cleare light, not being able to abstaine from salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting mutually with the hat as they passed by, though they had agreed to take no
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:8185:5"/>
kind of notice of one another; and this was all they did for that time. The <hi>King</hi> and all that royall Company retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by night by a world of Torch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, which made a most glorious shew.</p>
            <p>Immediatly after this, his Maiesty not being content with those single sights of the <hi>Prince,</hi> sent the <hi>Conde de Oliuares,</hi> to pray him that they might meet, and embrace, and speake together before they slept. The Prince accepted of the occasion, but there rose a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them about the manner. For the <hi>King</hi> did much presse the <hi>Prince</hi> that he would accept of a visit fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> himselfe in the Earle of <hi>Bristolls</hi> house, and really his Highnes had much adoe to refuse it, but yet he would by no meanes admit therof. On the other side, the <hi>Prince</hi> did offer to goe visit his Maiesty in his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, but the <hi>King</hi> considering that that must needs be to the <hi>Princes</hi> disaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:8185:6"/>
because he had no Equipage, his Maiesty refused expressely, &amp; it grew to be agreed betweene them, that it should be in the aforesaid <hi>Prado,</hi> and in the euening of the same Sunday when it might be darke. Whereupon the <hi>Conde de Oliuares</hi> said pleasantly, that he would by no meanes consent that his Master should meet him, and especially by night, but vpon euen termes; that the <hi>Prince</hi> was a great man at armes, and that euen in the ciuill way hee was strong in Ambassadors and Secretaries, whereas the <hi>King</hi> was in effect alone, that therefore he desired that the <hi>Prince</hi> would lend him the <hi>Marquesse,</hi> and that he might carry him to the Court, and so he might come to that meeting with the King and him, as a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and not the Princes seruant for that time. The <hi>Prince</hi> gaue leaue, with much content, that he should goe, and so he went, and the King brought him and the <hi>Conde de</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:8185:6"/>
               <hi>Oliuares</hi> to the <hi>Prado.</hi> Now the King being first arriued, sent a priuate mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to the <hi>Prince,</hi> to let him know that he expected his <hi>Highnesse.</hi> Thereupon the <hi>Prince</hi> made much haste, being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the <hi>Conde de Gondomar,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Bristoll,</hi> Sir <hi>Walter Aston,</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Cottington</hi> his <hi>Highnesse</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary.</p>
            <p>When they were vpon the point of meeting, they all alighted out of their Coaches, and the <hi>King</hi> embraced the <hi>Prince,</hi> and made incomparable professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his loue and affection, and of the streight obligation which the <hi>King</hi> our Soueraigne and his <hi>Highnesse</hi> had cast vpon him, by that maine act of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and fauour.</p>
            <p>Then his <hi>Maiestie</hi> tooke the <hi>Prince</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Coach, and made him perforce goe in first, and sit vpon his right hand, and so they continued some good time in great sweetnesse of conuersation,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:8185:7"/>
the Earle of <hi>Bristoll</hi> interpreting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them. At the parting, the <hi>King</hi> lighted out of his Coach, with the <hi>Prince;</hi> and vsed much endeuour to haue conducted the <hi>Prince</hi> to his Coach; but the <hi>Prince</hi> would by no meanes suffer it, and so they parted in the mid-way.</p>
            <p>On Munday the tenth of March, his <hi>Highnesse</hi> was made acquainted, by the <hi>Conde de Oliuares,</hi> and the <hi>Conde de Gondo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi> whom the <hi>King</hi> had sent to visit him, that the <hi>King</hi> was that morning going in deuotion to a Monastery cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Merçed;</hi> and that he would passe the streets on horsebacke. When his <hi>Highnesse</hi> shewed some willingnesse to be a spectator thereof, the <hi>Conde de Oliuares</hi> carried him to a conuenient place, where he had a full view of all. That euening, his <hi>Highnesse</hi> went into the fields by the Riuer side, to take the aire. And the <hi>Conde de Oliuares,</hi> and the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:8185:7"/>
               <hi>Conde de Monterey,</hi> went againe to visit him from the <hi>King,</hi> and they two wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on him in discourse, aboue an houre.</p>
            <p>On Tuesday his <hi>Maiesty</hi> sent againe to see how his <hi>Highnesse</hi> did; and withall to let him know, that he could not but acknowledge the good seruice, which the <hi>Conde de Gondomar</hi> had done him, in printing such a Character of his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere affection, in the heart of the <hi>King</hi> of great <hi>Britaine,</hi> and of his <hi>Highnesse;</hi> as that they should thinke fit to put such a pretious treasure into his hands, as his <hi>Highnesse</hi> was. And that therefore he could not suffer any subiect of his to be vnaduanced, whom he found so well accepted by the King of Great <hi>Britame,</hi> and his <hi>Highnesse.</hi> For which cause he was resolued to make him of his Counsell of State, though hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted him indeed as an English man. Nay rather that for that respect
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:8185:8"/>
he would admit him, to the end that both the <hi>King</hi> of Great <hi>Britaine,</hi> and his <hi>Highnesse,</hi> might be more confident of his proceedings; and made priuy to the most inward passages. But the <hi>King</hi> withall, sent his <hi>Highnes</hi> word, that he desired him to giue the first notice of it to the <hi>Conde,</hi> and receiue his thankes. The <hi>Prince</hi> sent him the newes thereof by Master <hi>Secretary Cottington;</hi> the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de</hi> came to cast himselfe at the <hi>Princes</hi> feet, for so high an honour and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and so being addressed by his <hi>Highnesse</hi> to the Court, was instantly sworne.</p>
            <p>In the afternoone of that day, the <hi>Prince</hi> hauing intimated a desire to see the <hi>King,</hi> was conducted and attended by the <hi>Conde de Oliuares,</hi> towards the Palace, through a backe way. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could arriue there, hee was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the <hi>King.</hi> Who being atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the <hi>Marquesse</hi> of <hi>Carpio</hi> alone,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:8185:8"/>
went downe in priuate manner, thorow a Garden to meet his <hi>Highnesse.</hi> Where after they had sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted one another with a manner of curtesie, which indeed was <hi>Princely,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> by the force of his fauour, put him still first into his Coach, and seated him on the right hand, and then entred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and sate by him; the <hi>Lord Marquesse,</hi> and the <hi>Conde de Oliuares,</hi> sitting at the other end of the Coach, and the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Bristow</hi> in one of the sides, and the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesse</hi> of <hi>Carpio</hi> in the other. Thus they went towards a house of pleasure, belonging to the King, neere <hi>Madrid,</hi> called the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa del Campo.</hi> Where after they had spent about an houre, the <hi>King</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king extraordinary great professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his affection to the <hi>King</hi> our Soueraigne, and the <hi>Prince:</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:8185:9"/>
it was found before they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, that his Maiesty had brought his <hi>Highnesse</hi> a mile and a halfe on his way homewards; and indeed almost to the Earle of <hi>Bristolls</hi> house. The <hi>Prince</hi> would faine haue attended the <hi>King</hi> backe towards the Palace, but he would not suffer him.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Highnesse</hi> did then make a little turne another way, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee could get to the Earle of <hi>Bristolls,</hi> the <hi>Conde de Oliuares</hi> (hauing already left the King) was ready there to attend his <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi> Shortly after, the Duke of <hi>Infantado, Mayordomo Mayor</hi> to the King, did by speciall command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from his Maiestie (for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out order from the King, none as yet did visit the <hi>Prince)</hi> repaire vnto his <hi>Highnesse,</hi> to kisse his hands, and offered him his vttermost ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
<pb facs="tcp:8185:9"/>
with great reuerence, in whatsoeuer hee should bee pleased to command.</p>
            <p>On the two next daies being Wednesday and Thursday, there was not much done, of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and externall note. The mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings were spent by his <hi>Highnesse</hi> in giuing order for his owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate affaires; and the afternoones, for the most part, in recreating himselfe abroad in the fields; the Earle of <hi>Bristoll</hi> waiting on him with his hawkes.</p>
            <p>Onely vpon the Thursday night after supper, there were sent to his <hi>Highnesse</hi> to entertaine the time, choice persons both of men and women, selected out of foure companies of <hi>Comedians,</hi> who dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced seuerall kindes of dances before him, and spent about two houres therein, the <hi>Condes</hi> of <hi>Monterey</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:8185:10"/>
               <hi>Gondomar,</hi> being present.</p>
            <p>On Friday being the foureteenth, his <hi>Highnesse</hi> stirred not abroad all the morning; but first sent Master Secretary <hi>Cottington,</hi> and afterward the Earle of <hi>Bristoll,</hi> to the <hi>Conde de Oliuares:</hi> and it should seeme to haue beene not onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout matter of complement, but for some particular businesse. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dinner the <hi>Condes de Monterey</hi> and <hi>Gondomar,</hi> went to his <hi>Highnesse,</hi> and conducted him againe to the <hi>Casa del Campo,</hi> where hee found the King, and with his <hi>Maiesty</hi> the <hi>Infantes Don Carlos,</hi> and <hi>Don Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando</hi> the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> his brothers; whom his <hi>Highnesse</hi> had not seene before that time. They saluted, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, and striued mutually to kisse the hands of each other; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which they all tooke horse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and entertained themselues
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:8185:10"/>
a good while in beholding sundry men, which were disposed there on foot, of purpose to shoot at such kindes of game, as they found in the place. And so there were Hares started, Partridges sprung, and other fowle put vp to wing: they killed of all sorts as they went, either running or flying by them. Vpon the end of which pastime, the King (notwithstanding all the resistance which was in the <hi>Princes</hi> power to make) brought him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine on his way homeward, to the same place whither hee had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him on the Tuesday night before; The <hi>Condes de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terey,</hi> and <hi>Gondomar,</hi> attending his <hi>Highnesse</hi> to the Earle of <hi>Bristolls</hi> house.</p>
            <p>Vpon this Friday, (for a further expression of the great ioy which that King had conceiued at the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:8185:11"/>
of his <hi>Highnesse,</hi> and for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence in that place) his Maiesty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, that a generall pardon of all offences should instantly be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed and published, and that all the Prisoners who were restrained within the whole Kingdome or continent of <hi>Spaine,</hi> should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased; reseruing onely the rights and interests of third persons, as in the case of <hi>Debts</hi> and <hi>Appeales</hi> for murder and the like. By vertue of which pardon and Proclamation some hundreds of Prisoners in <hi>Madrid,</hi> were then freed, and all the Prisons emptied; diuers offenders who had taken <hi>Sanctuary</hi> in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and retired to the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors houses (which are highly pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledged in that Court) hauing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice thereof before, did by way of anticipation dispose of themselues into the hands of Iustice; and so
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:8185:11"/>
made a purchase of their liberty by their imprisonment.</p>
            <p>Instant order was also giuen, that all the English which were surui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in the Gallies, and who had beene condemned to that seruitude, during life, for committing of <hi>Piracy,</hi> and many other mortall crimes, should bee released with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay. And this Grace which his Maiesty manifested in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the <hi>Prince,</hi> hath strangely encreased the generall applause wherewith he is receiued and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in that Court by all.</p>
            <p>Saturday being the fifteenth, was spent at home by his <hi>Highnesse</hi> in priuate manner, in regard of the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne entry hee was to make the next day, which was designed by the <hi>King,</hi> to be performed with the same magnificence and splendour, as is vsed at the Coronation of the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:8185:12"/>
               <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Spaine.</hi> Onely a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dinner, the <hi>Conde de Monterey</hi> went to the <hi>Prince,</hi> and told his <hi>Highnesse</hi> that the King had sent two horses thither, and desired him to make choise, vpon which he would be pleased to ride the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for that the King would ride vpon the horse which hee should leaue. Whereupon his <hi>Highnesse</hi> passed out into a Garden, not farre from the Earle of <hi>Bristols</hi> house, where, like himselfe, hee tooke paines and pleasure to try them both; to the end that if there were a difference, hee might take the lesse excellent to himselfe, and returne the other to the King.</p>
            <p>On Sunday, being the sixteenth, when it was already well towards noone, there went foure Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of State, <hi>Don Augustine Mexia,</hi> the Marquesse <hi>De Montes Claros, Don</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:8185:12"/>
               <hi>Fernando Giron,</hi> and the <hi>Conde de Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domar,</hi> to waite vpon the <hi>Prince</hi> at the Earle of <hi>Bristols</hi> house, and to attend his <hi>Highnesse</hi> to a famous Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery, called Saint <hi>Ieronimo,</hi> neere <hi>Madrid;</hi> from whence the Kings of <hi>Spaine</hi> are wont to goe when they make their solemne entry into that towne; and where the King hath a Quarter reserued for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and entertainment of his owne royall Person. There was his <hi>Highnesse</hi> feasted priuatly at din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by his Maiesties appointment, but yet as by the <hi>Conde de Gondomar,</hi> who hath the keeping of that Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the said Monastery. The af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoone till foure of the clocke, was spent by his <hi>Highnesse,</hi> in giuing audience to the <hi>Inquisidor Generall,</hi> and to the seuerall <hi>Bodies of Counsels,</hi> which doe all reside in that Court, and did all present themselues to the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:8185:13"/>
               <hi>Prince,</hi> excepting onely the Councell of <hi>State,</hi> which neuer maketh any visit in Corps, but all the rest did performe that duty of obseruance, namely the Councell Royall of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilia,</hi> the Councell Royall of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> the Councell of <hi>Portugall,</hi> the Councell of <hi>Italy,</hi> the Councell of <hi>Military Orders,</hi> the Councell of the <hi>Indies,</hi> the Councell of the <hi>Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and the Councell of the <hi>Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Corregidor,</hi> and the <hi>Regidores</hi> of <hi>Madrid,</hi> which are the persons who haue the gouernment of that Towne, did also desire audience of the <hi>Prince;</hi> for they all had beene commanded by the King to present themselues humbly before his <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi> And here it is to be obserued once for all, that all the <hi>Subiects</hi> of that Kingdome, who had occasion to wait vpon the <hi>Prince,</hi> did striue
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:8185:13"/>
with as much earnestnesse as good manners would permit, to haue actually kissed his <hi>Highnesse</hi> hands. But the <hi>Prince</hi> was resolute in not accepting that humble token of their loue, as conceiuing it to be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter betweene the naturall subiects and their Soueraigne.</p>
            <p>But about foure in the afternoone of that Sunday, the King went to see the Prince, whom his <hi>Highnesse</hi> receiued at the gate below. They made no very long stay there when once the complements were ended, but all things being put in order for his <hi>Highnesse</hi> entry, they disposed themselues to be going. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the King with his Nobility came in Coaches thither, the whole Court did then mount on horsebacke, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the example of his Maiesty and the Prince. The King did still put the Prince into a necessity of taking
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:8185:14"/>
the right hand, and so they passed towards the Palace.</p>
            <p>But as soone as they entred vpon the liberties of <hi>Madrid,</hi> they were expected and attended by foure and twenty <hi>Regidores</hi> of the towne, who had there a large Canopie of rich Tissue, and it belonged to them by office to carry it ouer the King. They were all apparelled in rich cloth of Tissue, lined with crimson cloth of gold. The King tooke the Prince vnder the Canopie, and kept him still on his right hand. Before them went the Courts and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Iustice, then the <hi>Grandes</hi> and all the other principall Nobles of that Court in colours and great bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery, and they were attended by their followers in seuerall Liueries, which were very rich. Next after the King and Prince went the Lord <hi>Marquesse</hi> of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and the <hi>Conde</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:8185:14"/>
               <hi>de Oliuares,</hi> executing the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Masters of the Horse to them both, the <hi>Conde</hi> giuing the right hand to the Lord <hi>Marquesse;</hi> and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them had a Horse of State, as the ensigne of the place he held.</p>
            <p>The Canopy which was to be the fee of the <hi>Conde de Oliuares,</hi> as Master of the Horse to the King, was presented afterward by the Towne to the Lord <hi>Marquesse,</hi> with all other fees belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that office, because he serued that day as Master of the Horse to the <hi>Prince,</hi> in whose honor the action was performed. Then proceeded the Earle of <hi>Bristoll</hi> betweene the eldest Councellour of State, and one of the Gentlemen of the <hi>Kings</hi> Chamber; and Sir <hi>Walter Aston</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, accompanied in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; the rest both of the Counsaile of State, and of the Gentlemen of the <hi>Kings</hi> Chamber following them.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:8185:15"/>
After whom went that goodly Guard which is called <hi>de los Archeros,</hi> who were brauely clad and arraied.</p>
            <p>In the ways as the triumph passed, all the streets were adorned, in some places with rich hangings, in others with curious pictures, and heere and there certaine scaffolds were sprinckled, whereupon the bodies of those Councells sat to see, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had beene with the <hi>Prince</hi> to doe him reuerence. And in other streets of the same passage diuers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations were made of the best Comedians dancers, and men of musicke, to giue contentment to that <hi>Royall Paire,</hi> as they passed by.</p>
            <p>As soone as the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Prince</hi> were arriued and had lighted at the Palace, there was great pressing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them two for the hindmost place; but in fine they went hand in hand, or rather indeed imbracing
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:8185:15"/>
mutually their bodies with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers armes, all the while as they were going vp towards the <hi>Queenes</hi> side, to whom the <hi>King</hi> was already conducting the <hi>Prince.</hi> The <hi>Queene</hi> though shee were in a very large roome, would by no meanes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the <hi>Prince</hi> vnder her <hi>State;</hi> but went downe to within two paces of the very doore to meet his <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;</hi> and then conducted him to her cloth of <hi>State;</hi> where there were set three equall chaires, the <hi>Queenes</hi> in the middle, with the <hi>Prince</hi> on her right hand, and the <hi>King</hi> on the left. The roome was as richly furnished as may well bee imagined: but the chiefe riches thereof consisted in that liuing Tapistry of Ladies and Noblemens Children, called <hi>Menines,</hi> which stood and garnished all the roome round about close by the walles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:8185:16"/>
The <hi>King</hi> from hence conueigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Prince</hi> to the quarter assigned him, and the <hi>Queene</hi> would needs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him to the doore of the same great roome, bowing very low vnto him at the parting, in such manner as well expressed the value her <hi>Maiestie</hi> set vpon his person, and the honour shee desired to doe him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> in the meane time, was vpon his way to the <hi>Princes</hi> Quarter; which was all very sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously furnished, and at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance thereof stood the <hi>Infantes Dou Carlos,</hi> and the <hi>Cardinall Don Ferdinando</hi> his brothers; so they all three con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted the <hi>Prince</hi> into his bedcham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where the King tooke his leaue for that time. Onely there, his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie</hi> was content to take the hand of the <hi>Prince,</hi> because his <hi>Highnesse,</hi> was now as in his owne proper home.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:8185:16"/>
And although the <hi>Prince</hi> was euen importunatly bent to attend the <hi>King</hi> backe to his owne Quarter, yet the <hi>King</hi> would by no meanes suffer that he should returne any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to make one only step out of his owne lodgings.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> had not beene there an houre before the <hi>Queene</hi> sent the <hi>Conde de Benauente,</hi> who is her <hi>Mayor domo Mayor,</hi> with sumptuous and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Presents to his <hi>Highnesse;</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a faire great Basen of massie gold, borne by two men, and a curious imbrodered Night-gowne laid dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in it. Besides, her <hi>Maiesty</hi> sent him 2. great Truncks bound with bands of pure gold, and thick strucke with nailes of gold, &amp; locks and keyes of the same. The couerings and linings whereof are of Amber leather, &amp; the Trunks full of seuerall delicacies of curious Linnen and Perfumes. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:8185:17"/>
these Trunks, shee sent him a faire rich Deske, euery drawer wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was full of rarities. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesse of <hi>Oliuares</hi> sent also a noble pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the Lord <hi>Marquesse</hi> of <hi>Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fireworkes were made, and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches set in all the Windowes of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid</hi> for three nights together, hauing been so commanded by Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And it is strange to heare with what acclamations and benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the voice of the people doth at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the <hi>Prince,</hi> whensoeuer hee is discerned to be abroad, crying, <hi>Viua el Principe de Galles, Viua el Principe de Galles.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> hath also comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that his <hi>Highnesse</hi> bee attended by all Officers and serued in all points as himselfe is. All they who wait vpon the <hi>Princes</hi> person, are in the rancke or qualitie of Lords. The <hi>King</hi> hath sent him halfe his
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:8185:17"/>
owne <hi>Guard.</hi> Hee hath assigned to his <hi>Highnesse</hi> for the <hi>Mayor domo May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or,</hi> or high <hi>Steward</hi> of his House, the <hi>Conde de Monterey,</hi> who is brother in law to the <hi>Conde de Oliuares,</hi> President of <hi>Italy,</hi> of the Councell of <hi>State,</hi> and a <hi>Graunde</hi> of <hi>Spaine.</hi> Hee hath giuen him besides two other <hi>Mayor Domos</hi> to serue him, namely, the <hi>Conde de Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domar,</hi> and the <hi>Conde de la Puebla.</hi> And as for the <hi>Conde de Monterey,</hi> his <hi>Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty</hi> hauing obserued the diligent affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which he daily carried to the <hi>Princes</hi> seruice, did bestow a gilt Key vpon him in contemplation thereof, whereby hee was <hi>ipso facto</hi> made a Gentleman of tho <hi>Kings</hi> Chamber, and it was done the rather, for that so hee should bee the better able to comply with his new place of <hi>Mayor domo Mayor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King did also send two gilt Keyes to his <hi>Highnesse,</hi> desiring him
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:8185:18"/>
to bestow them vpon what English he would, to the end that his Palace might be all open vnto them: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon his <hi>Highnesse</hi> gaue one of them to the Lord <hi>Marquesse</hi> of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and the other to the Earle of <hi>Bristoll.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His <hi>Maiesty</hi> hath moreouer impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vpon diuers Councellors of State, that some one of them shall daily attend in the <hi>Princes</hi> Quarter by turnes, to vnderstand his pleasure from time to time, and that foure <hi>Grandes,</hi> namely, the Admirall of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Cea,</hi> the Marquesse of <hi>Velada,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Yjar</hi> be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer at hand, to court, accompany and attend the <hi>Prince</hi> whithersoeuer his <hi>Highnesse</hi> shall be pleased to goe.</p>
            <p>The next day after the <hi>Prince</hi> was conducted to the Palace, all the Counsailes came to wait vpon his <hi>Highnesse,</hi> and to let him know that they had receiued expresse order
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:8185:18"/>
from the <hi>King</hi> their Master, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme and obey all consultaes and commands, which should come from his <hi>Highnesse,</hi> were it for the disposing of any offices, <hi>Encomienda's,</hi> or any other prouisions of Grace, which should happen to fall, during the residence of his <hi>Highnesse</hi> in that Court, and that as exactly, as if the <hi>King</hi> himselfe should command any such thing vnder his hand.</p>
            <p>There are also said to bee other great Triumphs in preparation, and Letters Mandatory sent to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Nobility of <hi>Aragon,</hi> that they come and giue attendance at the Court, vpon the <hi>Princes</hi> pleasure; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they haue the reputation to be excellent men at Armes. And that the Court may appeare in greater lustre and glory, the <hi>King</hi> hath sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended for so long as his <hi>Highnesse</hi> shall be there, the Edict which his
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:8185:19"/>
               <hi>Maiestie</hi> lately had caused to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, for the restraint of all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse in point of apparell.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Maiestie</hi> hath also beene plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to take particular care that the Lord <hi>Marquesse</hi> of <hi>Buckingham</hi> be well lodged in the Palace, in a Quarter of his owne, neere adioyning to the <hi>Prince,</hi> and hath commanded him to be serued with a full and plentifull Diet, and to be also nobly attended; besides many other such demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of grace and fauour from that <hi>King,</hi> with so particular and great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects from the <hi>Grandes</hi> and all the Nobles of that Court, as the like perhaps hath not beene seene impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to any stranger, meerely a subiect.</p>
            <p>This is the substance of that which passed at <hi>Madrid</hi> concerning the reception of the <hi>Prince,</hi> from the seuenth of March (which was the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:8185:19"/>
day of his arriuall in that Court) till the eighteenth of the same Moneth. But that which may put a good full point to this Relation; and withall, fill the hearts of all the <hi>King</hi> our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraignes obedient and loyall Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, with much comfort, is, to know that the last messenger which came from his <hi>Highnesse,</hi> left him in as prosperous and perfect health, as euer hee had beene knowne to enioy; and whereas vertue when it is soundly practised at home, shewes faire abroad; the Comport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his <hi>Highnesse</hi> in the place where now hee is, hath made such a prospect vpon his Noble and Princely parts, in all respects, as may well giue vs cause to reioyce and to render humble thankes vnto Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God for the same.</p>
