            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Philosophers,</hi> who have affected at the
same time to embrace <hi>Christianity,</hi> and
to profound by Humane Reason the more
sublime Mysteries of the Kingdom of
Heaven, and to discourse the same ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their own carnal sense and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension;
have been the persons that
laid the Foundation of external Pomp,
and of those many Heresies which have
molested, and do still molest the Church of
God: Add hereunto that proportionably
to the encrease of Ignorance and Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rism
through the inundation of <hi>Goths</hi>
and <hi>Vandals,</hi> and I know not what other
Barbarous Nations, who quite destroyed
all good Literature; and the constitution
of that savage People wholly consisting ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>Pagans</hi> or <hi>Arrians,</hi> there ensued
hereupon a horrid Medley in Religion:
But which is yet matter of greater won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
during the time that those <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
made havock of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire
and sack'd it in the West, the Bishop of
<pb facs="tcp:41182:8"/>
               <hi>Rome,</hi> to the end that he might prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte
and bring over to himself the former,
to wit, the <hi>Pagans,</hi> permitted them to
intermingle many of their own Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
with Christianity, content that they
should only change the names of their false
<hi>Deities</hi> into those of the blessed <hi>Apostles,</hi>
or those of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> or <hi>Confessors</hi> of
the Truth; it being ever proper to Error
readily to entertain what-ever hath any
resemblance or affinity with it self: and
forasmuch as that <hi>Pagan</hi> People had an
extream Veneration for their Prelates;
this Bishop, who had already attain'd
to a great sway, partly, because of
the dignity of the City wherein he had
his residence,<note place="margin">The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Rome,</hi> together with those of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople, Alexandrina, Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> did at the same time assume the title of <hi>Archbishop,</hi> by concession from <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> when he translated the seat of his Empire to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> they being in those days Dependants upon the Emperours.</note> as being esteemed the Head
of the Empire; and partly, in regard
of the Title of <hi>ARCH-BISHOP,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in the time of <hi>Constantine</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:41182:8"/>
Great; that he might more firmly keep
the hold that he had got, assumed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
not only the proud-swelling Title of
<hi>Pope;</hi> but likewise, that nothing might
be wanting to the accomplishment of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick
Predictions; his Habits of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and Scarlet, and Ornaments of Gold
and Pearl, by the relation of Cardinal
<hi>Baronius</hi> himself. <hi>Clouis</hi> the first Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
King, sent a Crown of Gold to Pope
<hi>Hormisda,</hi> an. 514. and ever from that
time forwards their Ambition became il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited;
the conjuncture of Times, the
impotency and weakness of the Western
Emperours, and their own particular
Civil Interests, having greatly contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the erection of Papal Authority:
And for this reason did that Parracide
<hi>Phocas,</hi> who murdered the Emperour
<hi>Mauritius,</hi> whereupon he usurped the
Empire, so frankly conferre upon <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
III.</hi> the title of <hi>Oecumenick</hi> or
<hi>Universal Bishop,</hi> to the end that he
might maintain his Authority in <hi>Italy</hi> by
<pb facs="tcp:41182:9"/>
recommendation of this same Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Power, which was held with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
by reason of their gross Ignorance and
Superstition, in marvellous esteem: This
Pope hereby declaring that he made but
slight account of the saying of <hi>Gregory</hi>
the Great, his Predecessor, mentioned in
this Treatise,<note place="margin">Epist. 34 ib. 4.</note> namely, That <hi>He who
should assume to himself the title of
Universal Bishop, should be the Fore-runner
of Antichrist;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epist. 32. lib. 4.</note> that <hi>that name
of Blasphemy,</hi> saith he elsewhere, <hi>ought
to be far from the heart of Christians,
which robs those who possesse the
Priesthood, of the honour of the same,
when another doth vainly affect to
challenge it to himself, that if we be
accessary to the maintaining hereof, we
by so doing, corrupt the Faith of the
whole Church;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ep. 24. lib. 6.</note> 
               <hi>because,</hi> (as he adds)
<hi>if there be one only Bishop called Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal,
the whole Church must needs
be ruined, in the ruine of that one
Universal.</hi> But the Popes were never
<pb facs="tcp:41182:9"/>
tardy in closing with offered advantages;
nor in engrossing of them upon such fair
emergent opportunities; their Interests
being, as hath been observed, interwoven
and twisted with those of Secular Princes:
Such was the liberality of <hi>Pepin,</hi> and of
the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, who
upon other considerations bestowed upon
them the Lieutenancy of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> and
the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they were in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of time by them effectually promoted
to Temporal Monarchies and Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</p>
            <p>In this so horrible a confusion the title
of <hi>Archbishop,</hi> which was given to none
but those of <hi>Rome, Constantinople, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,
Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as
will appear hereafter, was assumed by the
Bishops of the <hi>Metropolitan</hi> Cities, as
succeeding therein to the <hi>Pagan Arch-Priests,</hi>
like-as Inferiour <hi>Bishops,</hi> to
to their <hi>Priests;</hi> aswell in this, that they
wore, after their example, a white Mitre
enriched with Gold and Pearl, as in that
<pb facs="tcp:41182:10"/>
they conform'd to them in the exercise of
an exorbitant Power: for we blame not
herein a lawful and well regulated Title,
nor yet an external Badge of dignity in
the Heads of Order, so it be free from
worldly pomp and vanity, and onely
used as matter of Order and Decency, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to which the Apostle exhorts that
<hi>all things be done</hi> in the Church.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 40.</note> But
contrariwise so far were they from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of themselves there, that nothing
might be wanting to a total depravation,
their shaven and unmarried Priests have
affected to imitate those of the Goddess
<hi>Cybelleo,</hi>

the <hi>Vestal Virgins;</hi> their holy <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
to the <hi>Lustral:</hi> and it is not improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that their <hi>Purgatory,</hi> according to the
description which those of the <hi>Romish</hi>
Church give us of it, hath been likewise
devised according to the model of that
described by <hi>Virgil</hi> in the 6th Book of his
<hi>Aeneides;</hi>
               <note place="margin">See the Book of <hi>Baruch,</hi> chap. 6.</note> and to the great disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:41182:10"/>
of the Christian Religion, which we
cannot mention without extream condo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
have the <hi>Images of Saints</hi> been sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
in the room of <hi>Pagan Idols;</hi> which
in imitation of them, they array with sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous
apparel, crown with garlands, kiss,
offer incense to; present with Tapers, and
burning Lamps; and after the same ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
carry about upon their shoulders:
Insomuch that in stead of demolishing of
the <hi>Pantheon,</hi> they have repaired it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
another name<note n="†" place="margin">Sancta Maria Rotunda</note>; and so far are they
from <hi>christianizing</hi> of <hi>Pagans,</hi> that they
have <hi>paganized Christians.</hi> It were an
easie matter, might we here expatiate to
make those things more fully and exactly
to appear; as likewise how that many,
even great and learned persons in the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> do unanimously accord
in the case; and having lost all shame, do
glory in this same Mymmick and Apish
substitution: but what hath been said may
suffice as it were by the way, plainly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to discover them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:41182:11"/>
Like-as <hi>Pagan</hi> Idolatry and Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hath been the cause of such a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
extravagancy, we might likewise with
no small probability assert, that the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
of <hi>Marcion, Arrius, Nestorius,
Eutiches</hi> and other Hereticks, who
marr'd or destroyed the Orthodox Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
concerning the Humanity of Jesus
Christ, were the Authors or Abettors of
<hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> and those that made
way for the entrance of that gross opinion,
which is a <hi>stone of stumbling</hi> both to
<hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Mahometans,</hi> and the main
obstacle that forestalls their closure with
the Truth of the Gospel; witness on that
behalf the famous <hi>Averrhoes,</hi> who said,
<hi>He never found any Religion more
absurd, than that of those who pretend
to</hi> make <hi>their own God, and then to</hi>
eat <hi>him.</hi> This is the reason why thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
taking up a resolution, he cryes out,
<hi>I would sooner chuse to die, and that
my soul might be with the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
than to have any communion
<pb facs="tcp:41182:11"/>
with the Christian Communion.</hi>
Whereunto may well be added, what is
reported by <hi>Seiur de Boulaye le Goux,</hi>
in his Travels, namely that himself and
his companions, all <hi>Christians,</hi> being by
the <hi>Turks</hi> immur'd in some certain Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in <hi>Natolia,</hi> suffered many affronts and
injuries from them, who unto the rest su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
added this as the severest of all, that
they were the Disciples and Worshippers
of (<hi>Mange Dieu</hi>) the <hi>Breaden God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These many tumultuary Revolutions
and fearful Disturbances that befel the
Church, which shall be noted hereafter,
should not, notwithstanding, scandalize
the Faithful, this being no other than what
was foretold; and we know what that
dreadful Comination of our Lord is touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Rev. 2. 5.</note>
the <hi>removing of the Candlestick
out of his place,</hi> in those Churches which

<hi>Romans,</hi> whom considering as proselyted
from <hi>Gentilisme;</hi> and upon that account
<pb facs="tcp:41182:12"/>
calling them the <hi>Branches of a wild

of the <hi>Jews</hi> according to the flesh, in
whom all the Promises were made to the
Fathers; He declares unto them, that in

and ambition, magnifie and over-advance
themselves above the <hi>native branches,</hi>
who for their sakes were broken off, they
might justly expect the like entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and non-indulgence.</p>
            <p>But that which is yet more considerable
is, the grand Apostacy and defection which
the Spirit of God has advertised us should
happen under the manifestation of the <hi>Man
of Sin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. Rev. 17. 1 Tim. 4. 1.</note> having been pleased in divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to notifie to us, both the time of his
Rise, and the place of his Residence; the
colour of his Apparel, the number of his
Name, the nature of his Doctrine, even
to the very least Circumstances which may
any wise tend to a particular designa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:41182:12"/>
of him; to the end that he might be
discerned when exhibited, and fellowship
with him shunned, as being of all things
in the world the most pestilential.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> informs us,<note place="margin">2 Thess. 2, 7, &amp;c</note> that in his time
<hi>the Mystery of Iniquity</hi> should begin to
work, and that that which should hinder
his manifestation should be the then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
Power in the Earth, upon whose
ruines the Kingdom of <hi>Antichrist</hi> should
be erected: And it is very probable that
this was the main Reason why the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<hi>Christians</hi> ever were so importunate
in their prayers to God for the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, as wisely
foreseeing that the destruction and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
thereof would produce a lamentable

               <hi>Chrysostome</hi> gives the

as the dread of that great Empire shall

            </p>
            <p>Furthermore; That is well worthy of
our consideration which the beloved Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of our Lord teacheth us in his first
general Epistle,<note place="margin">1 John 2. 18.</note> namely, that <hi>in the last
time</hi> (for thus he describes the <hi>Gospel-Oeconomy,</hi>
since we ought not to expect
any other) in which they had learn't, that
Antich, should appear, there were already
<hi>many Antichrists;</hi> and such in effect were
<hi>Ebion</hi> and <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> who taught that
<pb facs="tcp:41182:14"/>
Jesus Christ was not the Son of God, nor
co-essential with the Father; those would
have destroyed his <hi>Divinity:</hi> and he who
should by way of eminency, bear the name
of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> being, as the same Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
teacheth, guided by the very self-same
spirit of impiety and error, should endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
what in him lies, the ruine of the
truth of his <hi>Humanity,</hi> the glory of his
<hi>Royalty,</hi> the dignity of his <hi>Priesthood,</hi>
and the excellency of his <hi>Prophecy;</hi> and
indeed what less can be said of him who is
represented to us as the person that should
<hi>oppose himself to all that is called
God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Thess. 2. 4.</note> 
               <hi>or is worshipped?</hi> and that even
to the being seated in the <hi>Temple of

Christ;</hi> which may give us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
according to the dialect of Holy
Scripture, that he shall therein preside,
and exercise a Soveraign and Absolute
Dominion, demeaning himself as if he
were God. But let us see how the great
<pb facs="tcp:41182:14"/>
and famous Lights of Antiquity have
expressed themselves in reference hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:
behold how S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> speaks,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Chrys.</hi> in 2 Thess. 2. hom. 3.</note>—<hi>in

more particularly, <hi>The Apostle calls

have called the Temple of God, the
Temple of a Devil: and therfore some
conceive Antichrist to be a Prince with
a great company of attendants, and
judge that it were more proper to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce

What will this be other then to expel
our Lord Jesus Christ his Chair? and to
deny that he is come in the flesh to be King
and Head of the Church? to vilify his
Priesthood? and to deride his sacred
Doctrine with a no less then Diabolical
Impudency.</p>
            <p>This moreover should be a sign of his
coming,<note place="margin">Rev. 17.</note> namely, that ten Kings shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to reign at the same time, having all
one and the same Counsel, and shall give
their Power and Authority to the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyptick
Beast,</hi> which is represented to
us <hi>drunk with the blood of the Saints,
and with the blood of the Martyrs of

without some special import that the Holy
Ghost doth so plainly distinguish the <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses</hi>
of the Truth into <hi>two Bands,</hi> but
that we are to understand by the one, those
whose blood was shed under the <hi>Pagan</hi>

and of such an enchanting quality

or, <hi>lo there is Christ,</hi> but that we should

ostentation of their <hi>extraordinary gifts,

               <hi>Now the Spirit speaketh
expresly, that in the latter times some

themselves up to seducing Spirits and
doctrines of Devils, speaking lies in
hypocrisie, having their consciences

commanding to abstain from meats,
which God hath created for them

Henceforth a Believer should be greatly

vouchsafed to congregate already into the
Sheep-fold of the Lord Jesus; ratifie the
truth and purity of that Doctrine which
ye profess, with holiness and integrity of
life, that those who obey not the Word,
may be won without the Word, by your

appear to them that ye are no enemies to
<hi>good works,</hi> which ye are wrongfully

are the products of the Holy Ghost; by
those God is glorified; by those our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours

marks and testimonies of our Election,
and the way leading to the Kingdome of
Heaven. If we thus fruitfully trade
the Talent received from the bounteous
liberality of God our Soveraign Master,
he will superadd many more, and crown in
us the first fruits of our new graces, and

own and remunerate them with all his

we descend to subsequent Ages, we may
perceive therein a plain palpable declen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and degeneracy, until at last we arrive
at an Age of Iron, and stuff quite different

that this charity beginning by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
to wax cold; the Doctors exclaim'd
and severely inveighed against the rich, in
that, though themselves brought nothing
with them, yet they were not ashamed to
eat their share of what was contributed
by the poorer sort. Now the gifts thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
by the <hi>People</hi> were called <hi>Offerings:</hi>
From thence it came to pass also, that the

or an <hi>Oblation;</hi> not <hi>expiatory,</hi> but <hi>gratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory</hi>

Amongst the other Innovations of

<hi>the mixture of Water with Wine</hi> in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist,
a practice which was never autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized

reckoned amongst things <hi>necessary.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iren apud Euseb. lib. 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 23. <hi>&amp;</hi> 26.</note> There
was another custome foisted in at the same
time, for they judged it advisable to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the <hi>Eucharist</hi> to such as were not present
in the Assembly; more especially to the
<hi>sick;</hi> likewise in case any Bishop, or any
other Person of Quality being a stranger,
had arrived at their Cities, they presented
them with some of the <hi>Sacramental Bread</hi>
and <hi>Wine,</hi> congratulating them by that
<hi>symbol of Fraternal communion.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iustin. martyr. defens. ad Antonin. Tertullian lib. de o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratione.</note> It was also
an usual thing with them, when publick
Prayers were ended, to <hi>kiss one another</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchangeably
with a <hi>holy kiss,</hi> in token of
peace and brotherhood: After that they
proceeded to levy <hi>censures</hi> against those

               <p>It was the custome of most Churches at

they gave themselves to fasting upon
those days; this they did not that they
believed fasting to be essential to holiness,
for they rejected the Fast of the <hi>Sabbath-Day,</hi>
which yet was the prime day of their

Fast, which they celebrated before

the Feast of <hi>Easter,</hi> whence the <hi>Quadrage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timal

to know what the intent of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Church was herein: Some alledge
that, that observance tended to an imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>miraculous Fast</hi> of the Son of
God; but it is evident from Evangelical
History, that the time of our Saviours Fast
was previous to the <hi>Passover</hi> by the space of
six Moneths; proof sufficient, that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
had some other end and aim in the
celebration of this Fast, else doubtless
they would have pitched upon a time co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incident
with that wherein our Saviour
fasted;<note place="margin">Euseb. lib. 1. cap. 24. ex Iren.</note> behold then the true account.
There was an Order at that time establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
in the Church, that the Feast of <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
approaching, those who were obliged
to do publick pennance should present
themselves to be re-ingratiated and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
into peace with her. At the same
time the <hi>Catechumenes</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Such as werenew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the principles of the Christian Religion, but not as yet bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed; or if baptized, not as yet admitted to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Supper.</note> were baptized, for
those Days were particulary appropriated
to that work; and for as much as those
were things of great moment, the Church
proceeded therein with fasting and prayer;
besides that, at the same time they behoved
to prepare themselves for the Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Death and Resurrection of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41182:30"/>
Jesus Christ, and for the solemn Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
upon the <hi>Easter</hi>-Day ensuing. But
to shew that this observance did depend
upon the <hi>Liberty of the Church,</hi> and not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any <hi>peremptory imposed Law,</hi> we must
remark the diversification which attended
that Custome;<note place="margin">Theophil. Euseb. ex Iren.</note> for in some Churches this

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41182:30"/>
with execrations; for the rage and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of their Enemies not satisfied with

their very Bones; and that they might
deprive Christians of the hope of a future<note place="margin">Epist. Martyrum Galliae a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seb. lib. 5.</note>
                  <hi>resurrection</hi> (one of the main Arguments
of their constancy) they frequently expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
their dead bodies to the hunger-bitten
rage of ravenous Beasts, placing guards
and sentinels day and night, to hinder any
that might attempt to give them burial;
all that remained of them was burnt, and
the Ashes thrown into Rivers, or scattered
in the Air: The Church, then that they
might enkindle zeal in the People, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spose
them for the glory of Martyrdome,
presented them with new Incentives for
excitation and encouragement. The <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>
did yearly celebrate the memorial of
their <hi>Heroes,</hi> and such illustrious Persons
as had died valiantly in defence of their
Country; and this solemnity was perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
about their Tombes,<note place="margin">Euseb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> de praeparat. Evang. Cyril. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Jul.</note> to the end that

<hi>Christians</hi> judging this to be
a very proper means to perswade many
Persons to suffer death for the Gospel, and
to confirm others in such a magnanimous
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41182:31"/>
resolution, did imitate their example:
Their main care then in the first place was
to bury their Martyrs, and where they
could not recover the whole body, they
endeavoured carefully to gather up the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
least fragments, in case the fury of their
Persecutors had left any remainder; now
those Reliques were honourably interr'd
without any such custome as afterwards
came to pass;<note place="margin">Epist. Smyrn. Epist. martyrum Galliae.</note> For although Martyrdome
was reputed a most glorious thing, and
those blessed souls were very precious with
the Church, yet so it was that all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
that they afforded their bodies, was
an honourable Interment, nothing differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
from the common: After this the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
was introduced of an <hi>anniversary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration</hi>
of the combats and constancy
of Martyrs,<note place="margin">Euseb. lib. 5. cap. 9. &amp; 15.</note> upon the same days whereon
they had suffered death (called by
them the <hi>Days of their Nativity,</hi> in regard
that upon them, they were installed in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
life) and in the same place where
they were buried; from thence it came to
pass that <hi>Cemeteries</hi> became the Ordinary
places of their <hi>Assemblies,</hi> for those anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
days returned very frequently, by
reason of the great number of Martyrs, by
whose death most days of the year were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41182:31"/>
Upon those days then the whole
Church assembled together in the same
place where the Sepulchres of their vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
Champions were, as if she meant to
warm her Zeal at their Ashes, and to spirit
her self thereby for a more prompt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration
of their Martyrdome: Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Prayers, and the Exposition of the
Scriptures being finished, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed
in order the Names of those
who had been upon that Day put to death
for the Truth; they likewise related the
several conflicts by them sustained, whose
fierceness inhaunc'd their constancy; their
courage also was displayed in tearms full
of applause and admiration; their glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Trophees, and the rich Garlands pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
as the prize of their Victory, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
the <hi>Panegyrick,</hi> which consisted in
<hi>thanksgiving to God</hi> for <hi>giving them the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory;</hi>
the whole action was concluded with
the Celebration of the Eucharist. Now
the intent of those Solemnities was in the
<hi>first</hi> place to shew that such as were dead in
Christ, are still alive, both in <hi>God,</hi> and in
the <hi>memory of the Church;</hi> and in the <hi>next</hi>
place to animate and encourage the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

design of the primitive Christians, for thus

do they explain themselves.<note place="margin">Epist. Smyrn.</note>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41182:34"/>
many other Ceremonies which we pass
with silence. Let us then take a view of
such as serve for modern pretence, and
the respective sources whence they are
sprung.</p>
               <p>It was a <hi>Pagan</hi> Custome, that those who
came out of Baths (the use whereof was
very frequent) did anoint themselves with
Oyle; Wrestlers also, and such as were to
run a career, that they might become the
more supple and active, were accustomed
to oyle, and anoint their Bodies: <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
possibly in imitation hereof <hi>anointed</hi>
those whom they Baptized in an <hi>Athleti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k</hi>
(or Champion-like) capacity, who were
singled out to combat the World; which
Ceremony they authorized by the Old
Testament, alledging that it was derived
from <hi>Judaisme:</hi> This <hi>Vnction</hi> however can
make nothing for the pretended <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Confirmation,</hi> nor was it ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to <hi>dying</hi> Persons, as is practised at
this day.</p>
               <p>We have seen how that they carried
their <hi>Offerings</hi> into the Church; now for
as much as they held their Assemblies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Days solemnized for the Martyrs,
the <hi>Offerings</hi> presented by them upon those
Days,<note place="margin">Tertul: Cypr:</note> were entitled <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> or <hi>Oblations
offered in memory of the Saints,</hi> the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41182:34"/>
of the Day occasioning that title;
for nothing passed in that action, relating
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o the Saints, other than simple <hi>Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;</hi>
and those <hi>Offerings</hi> were not the
Body of Jesus Christ, but <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi>
only, or the very <hi>first fruits</hi> themselves, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
unto several ends and uses.</p>
               <p>It is further remarkable,<note place="margin">Hieron. in Iren. lib. 2 cap. 11. <hi>&amp;</hi> in <hi>Ezech.</hi> cap. 18.</note> that to induce
every one to contribute something, the
<hi>Names</hi> of those who offered, and the <hi>offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
it self, were with a loud voice Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd
in the Church; which yet was by
many disallowed of, even a long time
after.</p>
               <p>At the same time <hi>offerings for the dead</hi>
had their rise,<note place="margin">Cypr. lib. 3. Ep. 15. &amp; 16.</note> whereof we must know the
Institution; for though they might be
reckoned amongst the Customes ushe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>'d in
by <hi>Pagans,</hi> nevertheless the intent of them
was quite another thing than what they
were afterwards applyed to. Any one
then having departed this life,<note place="margin">Aug epist. 64. Origen. lib. 3. in Job Tertul. de Moneg. <hi>Cypr.</hi> lib. 8 Epist. 6.</note> the year
fully exspired, they commemorated in
the Assembly the <hi>Name</hi> of the defunct up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that day; declaring how happy he was
having <hi>dyed in faith;</hi> and all that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
besought God that he would grant
them the like exit; which done, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
or Friends of the Deceased, that they
might render his memory honourable,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41182:35"/>
presented the Church, or the Poor, present
at the action, with a certain quantity of
<hi>Bread,</hi> or other <hi>Alimentals;</hi> many of them
also at the same time, took Order that
their Names might after their Death
through such <hi>acts of charity</hi> continue in a
<hi>sweet savour</hi> in the Church, bequeathing
to that effect certain <hi>testamentary Legacies</hi>
to be yearly paid to the Legatees upon the
day of their decease; upon which Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
the <hi>Anniversaries</hi> were grounded:
Now those <hi>Offerings</hi> were only <hi>Memorials</hi>
of the devotion of the dead, not <hi>expiatory
Sacrifices;</hi> for the very Women, who were
never permitted to sacrifice, did yet offer
in Memory of their Deceased Husbands:
besides, many presented such Offerings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their <hi>birth-day,</hi> this being an <hi>act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognition</hi>
only, and a piece of homage paid
to God, who gave them life upon that
Day.</p>
               <p>Then also began <hi>praying for the dead,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tertul.</hi> de Corona militis.</note>
which the Christians of that Age confess
to be founded upon <hi>Custome,</hi> and not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Scripture,</hi> ranking it amongst many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
observances, which are at this Day
disallowed of by the Church of <hi>Rome<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi>
Now we must carefully remark in what
sense Antiquity <hi>prayed for the dead,</hi> for she
never believed that they were shut up in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41182:35"/>
                  <hi>place of torment;</hi>

but she held that the departed Souls of the

Judgment,</hi> and that they were reserved in
some certain <hi>subterraneous place,</hi> till the

                     <hi>Tertul.</hi> de moneg.</note> and with
what intent they then prayed for the dead:
In the mean time, let us take a view of
some other Ceremonies then also broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Pagans</hi> observed an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of superstitions in their very ordinary
converse. Christians were intermingled
and promiscuously conversant with them,
not only in the same City, but in the same
House, at the same Table, and in the same
Bed, so that there were frequently differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Religions in one and the same Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.<note place="margin">

This promiscuous converse notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
they resolved to be known and
acknowledged for <hi>Christians,</hi> and for a
proof of their <hi>Faith</hi> in the <hi>Crucified One,</hi>
they introduc'd the use of the <hi>Sign of the

judg'd reproachfull and ignominious, they
form'd that signal upon their <hi>fore-head,</hi> in
witness that <hi>they were not ashamed of the
Cross</hi> of Christ; at their entering into, or
coming out of their Houses, or Baths;
sitting down at, or rising up from their
Table; lying down in their Beds at Night,
or rising in the Morning, they always mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
their fore heads with the sign of the
Cross; which was afterwards received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Baptisme:</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Now we must note, that for as much as
<hi>Martyrdome</hi> was very honourable amongst
<hi>Christians,</hi> and those who were <hi>Prisoners for
the Faith,</hi> did by a frequent intercourse of
Letters maintain a Correspondence with
the Church, who also highly esteem'd of
those blessed Witnesses of and for the
Truth, affording them what Consolation
they could; the <hi>Penitents</hi> desirous of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
under that more rigid part of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
addressed themselves to those <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,</hi>
soliciting them to intercede with the
Church on their behalf, as well knowing
what credit they had with her, and of what
influence their Recommendation was:
the <hi>Martyrs</hi> hereupon made enquiry into
the life and repentance of those Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents,
and in case they found them sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
and upright, they imployed their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Intrest in interceding with the <hi>Church</hi>
by Letter from Prison, to this effect, that
she would please in favour of them, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of such and such Persons into her
Communion, which they readily obtain'd
of her: and it is not to be forgotten, how
that those <hi>Penitents</hi> having frequently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused
the facile nature of the Martyrs,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41182:38"/>
either through their mis-information, or
through over-importunate solicitations,
whereby they extorted from them that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession,
the Church complained of that
abuse; which occasioned a breach of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline:
Now this is the only <hi>Intercession
of Saints,</hi> which was acknowledged in those

which was introduced afterwards, is easie

them, that after their death,
they should be mindful of the <hi>living;</hi>
yea, Christians did even mutually indent

ever should first exchange this life for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
should remember the surviving,
and implore God in the behalf of them
after their own decease: Which, howbeit
it was but the particular zeal of some

the way to the <hi>Intercession of Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then also began the use of <hi>Confession</hi> to

what it was formerly: <hi>Penitents</hi> were

of the offence, should consider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were convenient to declare the
same in publick, or only to mention it in
general, without specification of the crime
it self: There were many also who out of
shame shun'd <hi>publick confession.</hi> It came to
pass likewise about the Year 260. that when
as such as had abandoned themselves to
the Apostacy, which fell out under the
Persecution stir'd up by <hi>Decius,</hi> required
to be re-admitted into the Church, there
were many who withstood their reception,
alledging that they were not longer ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41182:39"/>
of re-admission into Her; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that pretence many did separate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
which made way to the Schisme of
the <hi>Novatians.</hi> It was therefore found
expedient, for avoiding of <hi>scandal</hi> accrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to many from <hi>publick confessions,</hi> to
change the same into <hi>private</hi> ones; and to
that purpose it was decreed, that out of
their many Pastors, they should choose
one of a good Conversation,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sozom.</hi> trip. histor. lib. 9. cap. 35.</note> a prudent
Person, and capable of a secret to whom
that charge should be committed; from
thence came the <hi>Penitentiaries:</hi> Howbeit
this change happened only at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in the <hi>Greek</hi> Church; for the <hi>Western</hi>
Church retained the Custome of <hi>publick
confession,</hi> until the time of <hi>Leo</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> about the Year 450. Finally, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<hi>publick confession</hi> was only of more noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and enormous Crimes, the same be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
once changed into <hi>particular,</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to recommend it to practice, exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the People to confess their very least
escapes and defects, (from the <hi>beam</hi> to
the <hi>mote:</hi>) and that more frequently then
they were well able to do. Now this <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi>
was not of <hi>Divine Right,</hi> nor did An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
ever believe it to be such; for
afterwards, to wit, about the Year 396.
upon occasion of a scandal arising from it,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41182:39"/>
it was abolished by <hi>Nectorius</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Constantinople;</hi> that which he would never
have attempted, had they believed that it
was of <hi>Divine Institution:</hi> Neither did it
consist in a scrupulous enumeration of all
<hi>thoughts, words,</hi> and <hi>actions,</hi> which might
be accounted faulty; for in the Church
of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> which was one of the most
populous amongst them, there was of the
whole <hi>Clergy</hi> but one only Person, whose
charge it was to receive <hi>Confessions,</hi> which
had not been sufficient for so great a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
had every one been obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
to confession, and to render a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
account of all his actions: It was
not therefore judged <hi>needful</hi> for obtaining
of <hi>remission of sin,</hi> but <hi>useful</hi> for instruction
of the ignorant, for consolation to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
for reforming of sinners, for resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of such difficulties as might ripen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a case of Conscience, and (lastly) for
counsel to the perplexed.</p>
               <p>Authors of the same Age make mention
also of certain <hi>Virgins,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cypr. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. Ep. 9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11.</note> who consecrated
themselves to God; whereof this is the
original: The then reigning Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
obliged <hi>Christians</hi> to involve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
as little as might be, in the affairs of
the World. Now for as much as the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of that Profession is frequently fetter'd
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41182:40"/>
and infringed with the incumbrances
which attend a <hi>married state,</hi> there were
many <hi>Virgins,</hi> who with the concurrent
advice and consent of their Parents,
resolved to live in <hi>perpetual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency,</hi>
and to joyn themselves with
greater strictness then ordinary to Jesus
Christ: They presented themselves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who with So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Prayer recommended them to
God, and the care of the Poor to them,
whom they were to succour in their sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and relieve in their necessities; for it
was unto such deeds of charity that they
devoted themselves. But as touching the
Vow of <hi>Celibacy,</hi> it was in their own liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to relinquish that condition, when ever
it seemed good to them; and in case they
conceived that they could serve God with
greater integrity in a state of <hi>Marriage,</hi>
than in that of <hi>Virginity;</hi> the Vows of
<hi>Continency</hi> also were not as yet esteem'd
<hi>irrevocable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have said that they carried the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist</hi>
to the <hi>Sick,</hi> and that they admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
the same afterwards even to little
<hi>Children;</hi> but for as much as those, either
through infirmity of Body, or through
tenderness of years, could not conveniently
receive the <hi>Cup,</hi> they therefore sometimes
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41182:40"/>
dipped the <hi>Bread in the Wine,</hi> that so they
might receive the <hi>whole Sacrament entire;</hi>
for the People, both Men and Women,
did promiscuously communicate under
<hi>both Signes:</hi> Now albeit this expedient of
<hi>soaking,</hi> or <hi>dipping</hi> the <hi>Bread in the Wine,</hi> was
never practised but in such extraordinary
cases; yet notwithstanding many affected
to make it a <hi>general custome,</hi> introducing it
into the <hi>ordinary communion</hi> of the Church;
of which usage some Tracts were continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in after time, as we shall shew in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

               <p>ABout the Year 300. and afterwards,
there were many <hi>Ceremonies</hi> intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced;
<hi>Persecution</hi> continued even til<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then.
Now, behold <hi>Emperours,</hi> who submit their
Scepters to Christ's Sheep-hook, and
throw their Crowns at the Foot of his
Cross: The Church sprung out of the
Ashes of her own Children, as yet of a
sanguine complexion, is received into sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
with the great <hi>Constantine,</hi> and hence
forth reposing her self under the shade of
his Lawrel, doth (as it were) <hi>renew her
youth:</hi> she is removed from the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
into Cities, from Caves into Palaces,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41182:41"/>
from Deserts into Churches, and from
poverty into plenty and pompous abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
               <p>This prosperous change produced di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
effects; People repaired to the Church
in crowdes: But yet the simplicity of
<hi>Christianity</hi> did dis-relish many, who had
still before their Eyes the pomp and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence
of <hi>Paganisme:</hi> they therefore
judg'd it necessary to re-attire <hi>Religion</hi>
with the more splendid and ornamental
<hi>Ceremonies,</hi> to the end that through the
splendour of her Ornaments she might
become the more august and acceptable;
and like as they had done formerly, in
compliance with <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> whose

               </p>
               <p>Now, one of the first occupations
that Christians, under their respite from
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41182:41"/>
persecution, busied themselves in, was
this: The Bodies of many of their <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi>
were buried in the wide open Fields,
or else exposed to the High-ways, and their
Graves covered with filth and nastiness;
they began therefore to drag their Bodies
out of the places where they were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and to transport them into Cities, in
order to a more honourable Sepulture;
which transportation was performed with
some solemnity, the whole Church assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereat, with <hi>Singing of Psalms,</hi> the
Coffin covered with a rich Cloath; after
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat, they inter'd the Body under the

                     <hi>Ambros.</hi> lib. 10 E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. 85.</note> (for the custome of
<hi>laying them upon the Altar</hi> was not as yet
practised;) This zeal flamed yet further,
even to a research after the <hi>Bones of the

               </p>
               <p>The building &amp; beautifying of <hi>Churches</hi>
was another product of this peace, which
with <hi>solemn Prayer,</hi> they devoutly <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
to God;</hi> whereunto <hi>Superstition</hi> did
in after times add the <hi>Ceremonies of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now we must know, that the <hi>Infidels</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
what they could to abolish the
memory of Christ's <hi>Sepulchre,</hi> which was
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41182:42"/>
in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> heaping dust and dung up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it; and built in the same place the
Temple of <hi>Venus,</hi> wherein they sacrificed:
The devotion of this Emperor <hi>Constantine,</hi>
was such, as that he demolished those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable
Monuments; and instead of them,
caused a sumptuous Temple to be built in
the very same place where the Sepulchre
of Christ was; He built another upon the

               <p>At that time <hi>Palestina,</hi> being purged from

was suppressed by the most eminent Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
of this Age.</p>
               <p>It was in this Journey that <hi>Helena</hi> the
Mother of <hi>Constantine</hi> found (as they say)
the true <hi>Cross,</hi> and the very <hi>Nailes</hi> with
which our Lord was fastened thereunto:
and however the History be suspected, yet
is it therein attested that <hi>Constantine</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
one of those same <hi>Nailes</hi> to be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41182:42"/>
the Bit of his Horses Bridle; thus fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Relique for his Horse's Mouth, he
shewed that he meant nothing less than to
<hi>iss</hi> it with his own; Nor did <hi>Helena</hi> her
self (the supposed Inventress) ever <hi>adore</hi>
the wood of the Cross,<note place="margin">Ambros.</note> as one of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the same Age hath observed.</p>
               <p>We must here remember, that the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Christians had no other <hi>Cross</hi> than
the bare <hi>Sign</hi> of it, which they formed in
the Air: Now they report, that <hi>Constantine,</hi>
whilst as yet interpendent and wavering
between <hi>Paganisme,</hi> and the <hi>Christian</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
saw one day in the Firmament, a
<hi>Cross,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In hoc signo vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> with these words: <hi>In this Sign thou
shalt overcome:</hi> The import of which
device may best appear from the practice
and procedure of <hi>Constantine</hi> himself, who
in memory of that Vision, caused the form
of the Cross to be made in his own Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard,
having above upon the top of it the
two first Letters<note n="*" place="margin">XP.</note> of Christs Name, as is
to be seen in ancient <hi>Meddals</hi> at this day:
The Sign then by which he overcame, was
the <hi>Name,</hi> not the naked <hi>Cross</hi> of Jesus
Christ: He caused also his own Statue to
be erected with his Sign, which he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
ordered to be formed upon his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys,
and painted upon his Ensigns, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41182:43"/>
the Armour of his Shouldiers: But we must
note, that for a long time after, there was
not any <hi>Cross</hi> received into <hi>Churches.</hi>

whence we read that <hi>Constantine</hi> continued
the <hi>sacred Vigils,</hi> even till broad Day-light,
and caused big Tapers and Torches
to be lighted up throughout the whole Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
for their more commodious intercourse
in going &amp; coming in the Night; as Lamps
also in their Meeting-places, to give light
to all there present; the Office of lighting
of which belonged to the <hi>Acolytes:</hi> One of
the principal <hi>Vigils</hi> or <hi>Eves</hi> of the Year,
was that of the Night immediatly prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<hi>Easter,</hi> observed in Memory of the
<hi>Resurrection</hi> of Christ; for they passed the
whole Night without sleep, as watching
for that Morning-hour wherein our Lord
rose again from the Dead: Those <hi>Vigils</hi>
and <hi>Tapers</hi> were hitherto used without
any Superstition.</p>
               <p>Behold here another sequel of what was
practised in the times of <hi>persecution.</hi> Many
Christians, that they might shun that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest,
retired unto Deserts, and hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41182:43"/>
in solitary places; whence it came
to pass that Persecution ceasing, that soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
being with several become habitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and customary, they confined
themselves thereunto, and spent the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of their Days therein; whether
because of the inveteracy of such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of life, or for that the plainness here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
did better suit with them, than the din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
noise of Cities; or lastly, because they
suspected a return of the old <hi>storm:</hi> But
others there were acted with such a desire
of imitating and following of them, that
there were many, who even in the midst of
the great calm and quiet of the Church,
began to affect a solitary life. Thus did
that become <hi>voluntary,</hi> and matter of choice,
which by reason of the Persecution was
before that <hi>compulsory,</hi> and matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint:
Hence the original of a <hi>Monastick</hi>
life,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sozom.</hi> lib. 1. cap. 13.</note> whose first foundation was about

afterwards, it was extended to <hi>Syria,</hi> by

of <hi>Sebastia;</hi> to <hi>Greece,</hi> by S. <hi>Basile;</hi> and to
<hi>Italy,</hi> by S. <hi>Ambrose:</hi> Now though it be too

did accompany this piece of Innovation,

                     <hi>Epipha.</hi> lib 3. haeres. 80.</note>
yet was this <hi>Monastick</hi> profession quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
thing, than what it is at present;
for such as in those Days devoted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
thereunto, were not tyed to it by
<hi>vow,</hi> observed no nice distinction of <hi>meats</hi>
or <hi>habits,</hi> hunted not after <hi>merit,</hi> nor once
believed thereby to attain unto that <hi>perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
which is attributed to it at this day:
and it is further remarkable, that the first
<hi>Monks</hi> were <hi>Lay-men,</hi> not capable of any
<hi>Ecclesiastical Function;</hi> that they maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themselves upon their own hand-labor,
and not in a <hi>mendicant</hi> or <hi>precarious</hi> way:
and finally, that they <hi>married,</hi> many of them
having Wives and Children; for <hi>marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age</hi>
was in them accounted lawful,<note place="margin">

               <p>TOgether with a <hi>Monastick</hi> Life, the
<hi>Rules of Abstinency</hi> entered, which
were soon after received into the Church;
till which time <hi>Fasts</hi> were free and <hi>arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi>
the <hi>Montanists</hi> being the only Persons
who affected to enact Laws, and prescribe

About this time, in regard the profession of
<hi>Monks</hi> ought to consist in a more strict

               <p>LEt us in the mean time consider what
passed in the grand Council of <hi>Nice,</hi>
which afforded many Constitutions sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient
to the sequel of this History. That
they might the better preserve a due uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
amongst the many Churches dispersed
into so many several places, they found it
expedient to reduce them all under cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
General <hi>Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cincts;</hi> to which purpose
they setled <hi>Metropolitans</hi> in the more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Cities; each of whom ought to super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
the Churches within his own respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Jurisdiction: Thus the Bishop of
<hi>Alexandria</hi> was entrusted with those of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,
Lybia,</hi> and generally of all <hi>Affrique:</hi>
the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> with the neighbouring
Churches, and afterwards with all those of
the <hi>West:</hi> those of <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
with the adjoyning Provinces: This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminency
was conferr'd upon them, by
reason of the dignity of those Cities
wherein they exercised their several Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacies;
Insomuch that <hi>Rome</hi> being the
capital City of the Empire, the Bishop
thereof did hereupon challenge <hi>precedency</hi>
to all the rest, notwithstanding he held his
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41182:46"/>
own Diocess and Jurisdiction apart by
himself. The institution of those <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs</hi>

they ordained that that Order should be
continued, consulting therein the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of that dignity to the <hi>Metropolitan,</hi>
which they had acquired by Custome:
To those four, a fifth was added afterwards,
namely he of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> for as much as
that City was the Imperial Seat; and the
Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> held about the year
450.<note place="margin">Concil. Chalced. <hi>Can.</hi> 28.</note> decreed that he should hold the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi>
place, as being Bishop of <hi>New-Rome;</hi>
that the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> should have the
<hi>precedency,</hi> that being the Capital City;
but that the Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> should
enjoy the same (respective) <hi>primacy,</hi> and
equal Prerogatives, for as much as that
City had the same Senate, the same Badg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of honnourary, and equal Rites and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges
with <hi>old Rome,</hi> which we here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
by way of anticipation, since it will
be needfull that we mention it hereafter:
In the mean time we must note, that in this
and succeeding Ages many general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
were held, wherein the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>
was never President; proof sufficient that
the other <hi>Metropolitans</hi> did not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41182:46"/>
him for their <hi>Superiour:</hi> that the
name of <hi>Pope</hi> was common to all <hi>Bishops,</hi>
as appeares by divers writings of those
times; whence it is, that amongst <hi>Grecians</hi>
and <hi>Germains</hi> to this day, <hi>Priests</hi> are called
<hi>Popes;</hi> that is to say, <hi>Fathers,</hi> according to
the ancient signification of the name: that
all the <hi>Patriarchal</hi> Churches, as having
been dignified with the Residence of the
<hi>Apostles</hi> themselves, were named <hi>Apostolical,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sozom:</hi> lib. 1. cap. 16.</note>
which Title that of <hi>Rome</hi> hath ever since
retained, though common to her with the
rest; for we must know, that the Chair of
<hi>Antioch,</hi> in that St. <hi>Peter</hi> resided there,
and that of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> possessed by S. <hi>James,</hi>
were entitled <hi>Apostolick Seats,</hi> as well as
that of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Council of <hi>Nice</hi> determined the

and Decreed, that all the Churches should
Celebrate the same, upon one and the same
Day, namely the <hi>Sabbath-Day</hi> after the full
Moon (or middle) of <hi>March.</hi> Now for as
much as the use of <hi>Ephemerides</hi> was not so
common, as it is at this day, and <hi>Astrology</hi>
was best known in <hi>Egypt,</hi> they therefore
gave it in charge to the Bishop of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi>
that he should yearly publish to the
other Churches, the time of <hi>Easter-Feast,</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:41182:47"/>

                     </gap>elibacy,</hi> or the
unmarried state of <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Persons,
which many affected to introduce: Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it is, that till then, <hi>marriage</hi> was ever
reckoned allowable in persons of that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,
only some few there were, who
soon after the death of the Apostles, began
to reject the same; which yet was no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
by them attempted, than suppressed:
But about the year 308. in some <hi>Provincial</hi>
Councils, the first <hi>Laws</hi> touching <hi>Celibacy</hi>
were enacted, whereof this was the Form:
They demanded of such as desired to be
prefer'd to any <hi>Ecclesiastick charge, whether
they would refrain from marriage or not;</hi> if
they answered <hi>yes,</hi> they were never after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
permitted to marry; but in case
they replyed <hi>no,</hi> they allowed, that after
their Election, they might marry; but
then the Election, was for some time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd,
to the end, that if possible, they might
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41182:47"/>
find out some or other who could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
himself to live unmarried: Now this
they did, not that they thought <hi>marriage</hi>
was inconsistent with the <hi>Clergy,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the <hi>poverty</hi> of the Churches, as not
having means sufficient for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of the Families of their Pastours:
and thus they passed to a peremptory <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition</hi>
of the same, to the end, that
Church goods might not be distributed
amongst their Wives and Children, or
else lest natural affection to their own
flesh and blood, might happily hinder or
interfere with the functions of their
charge: This is the only account, by
their own confession, which their Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
could ever give hereof, which yet
hath hitherto been judg'd impertinent,<note place="margin">Leo. <hi>Novel.</hi> 2.</note>
since that by the same reason it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that all who have Parents or Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
&amp;c. should thereupon be incapable
of any Ecclesiastick charge or office: Now
those prejudications were transfer'd from

<hi>Nice;</hi> wherein it was debated <hi>whether it
were convenient to oblige Church-men to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinency
from marriage;</hi> most votes carried
it in the affirmative; but <hi>Paphnutius,</hi> a

Thus about the Year 370. in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration

to use <hi>Prosopopeias</hi> and <hi>Apostrophees:</hi> one of

the Auditory:</hi> The same Author, in the

believed to be in Hell. There is then a

and the <hi>Invocation of Saints;</hi>
a <hi>Figure of Rhetorick,</hi> and an <hi>act of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;</hi>
and yet was this strain of Oratory
a prelude to a gross ensuing abuse; for

In those times many Persons, what
through curiosity, what through zeal, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorted
to the places where the more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<hi>Martyrs</hi> were inter'd; for we have
seen how carefull the Church was in col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
of their Bones, yea in transport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them from remote places, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
of them to magnificent Sepulchres:
It was a meer natural affection that prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
every one with a curious desire to see
those <hi>Bodies</hi> which were sometime the
<hi>Temples of the holy Ghost;</hi> this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> said;<note place="margin">

the marks of the Lord Jesus, and that mouth
by which Christ himself spoke? I covet to see
the Sepulchre wherein is inclosed that armour
of righteousness, that armour of light, those
members which still live, and were dead whilst
living. I covet to see those Chains, those
bonds, &amp;c.</hi> The intent then of those vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sits,
was, that they might be confirmed in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41182:50"/>
the same Faith for which those <hi>Martyrs</hi>
suffered, that so they might have part in
the same Resurrection, and this they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought
God for by Prayer, poured out o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their Sepulchres. Now those places
became the more famous, by reason of a
rumour spread, that <hi>miracles</hi> were wrought
by their means; for <hi>Arrianisme</hi> being then
become very general, it is possible that
God might at that time have confirmed by
<hi>miracles,</hi> the Orthodox Faith: Howbeit
so it was, that this perswasion drew the
People to those Sepulchres, but Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at the same time followed thereupon;
for then began the belief,<note place="margin">Basil <hi>in</hi> 40. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr. Basil.</hi> August. Ambros.</note> that there was
a kinde of <hi>Divine vertue</hi> subjected in those
<hi>Reliques,</hi> prevalent against the maladies
of the Soul, as well as those of the Body:
It was generally believed that the Bodies
of the Saints were as so many <hi>tutel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Guardians</hi> and Fortresses to the Cities
wherein they were kept, in so much that
every one coveted to have some of them;
and for this very reason they began to
transport them from one place to another;
The common People spent the <hi>Vigils</hi> (or
<hi>Wakes</hi>) in the <hi>cemeteries</hi> of the <hi>Martyrs;</hi>
thither they carried Victuals, that they
might be thereby sanctified; yea, they
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41182:51"/>
lighted up Tapers in broad Day light, in
token (said they) of joy and triumph:
But we must likewise note, that all those
were the procedures of private Persons
only, and no wise approved of by the
Church; true it is, the Bishops were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
by the prevailing multitude, to
connive at those abuses, whereof yet they
acknowledged the enormity:<note place="margin">

was at length received into the Church,
and in after time continued therein.<note place="margin">

Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> being dead, all the

made in a sense quite other than at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
for all the Fathers of the first ages,
were of an opinion, which is at this day
rejected by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> namely,
that the Souls of the righteous are reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in a <hi>common Receptacle</hi> until the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection:<note place="margin">

and upon this supposition
they ground their <hi>praying for the dead:</hi>
Now for these reasons did the Church
pray for them, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. To the end, God
might please to glorify them in due time,
hastening their Resurrection. 2. To the
end, the Judge might upon the last day
be propitious to them, and not deal with
them in rigour. 3. It is remarkable, that
they prayed even for the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> for
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41182:52"/>
the <hi>Prophets,</hi> for the <hi>Evangelists,</hi> for the
<hi>Apostles,</hi> for the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> yea, and for the
Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> whom yet they believed not
to be in <hi>Purgatory;</hi> but their end herein
was, that it might please God to increase
their glory; whence we must note by the
way, how far they were from <hi>praying to
the Saints,</hi> since that they <hi>prayed for them;</hi>
and the truth is, antiquity informeth us,
that one of the main reasons why they
prayed <hi>for</hi> them,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epipha.</hi> haeres 75.</note> was, that they might by

                     <hi>Chrysost.</hi> Serm. 3. ad Phil. hom. 69.</note>
they went so far as to pray for the very

for them (said they) some <hi>allay and miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of their pain;</hi> for, in as much as mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided
zeal is no where bounded, they
affected to extend their charity, even as

the sending of the Sacrament
to new married couples, to be by them
joyntly received at home in their own
Houses; the thrusting of the same into
the mouth of the dead, a most prophane
abuse! We shall likewise forbear to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all those innovations, which having
been commenced before, were continued
in after time; and shall only note the
progress of the same, and the rise of such
as followed thereupon, each according
to the order of time, wherein they began
to appear.</p>
               <p>As therfore we have already seen in what
respect Primitive Antiquity prayed for
the dead, in like manner we must know
what was the intent of the <hi>Vigils,</hi> which
ensued upon that usage. It was an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
custome, that as soon as any one had
given up the Ghost, they called some Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastick
Persons, who spent the whole
night with the friends of the dead, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
them with some serious and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
discourses, grounded upon the
<hi>Word of God,</hi> for their instruction and
comfort: To this purpose they sung also
<hi>Psalms,</hi> disposed by way of <hi>Antiphonies,</hi> or
<hi>Versicles,</hi> interchangeably answering one
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41182:55"/>
another; and recommended the departed
Soul to God, to the end, that pardoning
its sins, he would vouchsafe to preserve it
from Hell, and eternal Death; Judge it
in mercy upon the last day, and give to
its Body a glorious Resurrection; but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to the end that he might deliver it out
of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> though that be the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
drawn from thence at this day;
and indeed the <hi>Greek</hi> Church <hi>Prayeth for
the Dead,</hi> which yet never believed a <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To those Funeral acts another Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
was added; It was a <hi>Pagan</hi> custome,
that their Champions who had won the
prize in wrastling, were conducted to their
Houses with Songs of Triumph, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Torches, in token of honour and
congratulation; this our Christians ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to their dead, as those, who after
that they had fought the good fight, had
finished their course, and obtained the
Crown of Glory: They then inter'd them
with singing of <hi>Psalms,</hi> by way of thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
to God, and consolation to the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving;
as also with lighted Tapers, in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the burial of the deceased; for
the reason of that Ceremony is thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
by S. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> who lived in the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41182:55"/>
beginning of this Age. <hi>Tell me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chrysost.</hi> Serm. 4. ad Heb.</note> 
                  <hi>what
mean the Lamps lighted up at Funerals?
Is it not because we accompany the dead, as so
many magnanimous Champions. What mean
the Hymns? Is it not because we glorify
God, and render thanks to him, for that he
hath already crowned the defunct, delivering
him from all his toile and dolour? Is it not
for this very end, that we sing Psalms and
Hymns? And why callest thou upon the Priests
and Singing-men? Is it not for comfort to thy
self, and for honour to the deceased?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The formalities observed by the Church,
in the reception of <hi>Penitents,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Concil. Araus. Concil. Agath. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 37.</note> were likewise
multiplied; which in those Days were
thus practised: When any one, who had
incur'd <hi>excommunication,</hi> petitioned that
he might be released from that censure,
making protestation of repentance; the
Bishop, who had excommunicated him,
and twelve Priests with him, repaired to
the Church-door, where the <hi>Penitent</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
himself cloathed with Sack-cloath,
bare-footed, with a dejected countenance,
his head covered with ashes, weeping and
sighing, implored forgiveness, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
amendment of life for the future;
Then the Bishop taking him by the hand,
gave him entrance into the Church, and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41182:56"/>
admission to the Communion: But in case
he did again relapse into any crime, he
was no more capable of admission to
Penance, but dealt with as one relapsed,
so as that they never gave him the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
save only at the very point
of death. Then also were <hi>Crosses</hi> receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into Churches, whereas formerly they
were only represented upon Money and
Military Banners; but held only for meer
<hi>memorials of Christs death,</hi> and not for <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of adoration:</hi>

                     <hi>Cyril.</hi> contra Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian. lib. 6.</note> for so do the Christians
of those times explain themselves therein:
It is further remarkable, that theirs was
only the simple form and figure of the
<hi>Cross,</hi> and that the Image of the <hi>Crucifix</hi>
was not received into the Church, till a
long time after.</p>
               <p>Authors of the same age make mention
of a custome,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> de Civit. Dei lib. 10. cap. 12. Chrysost.</note> which was afterwards turned
into Superstition: As long as the <hi>gift of
miracles</hi> are subjected in the Church, she
was endowed with an especial vertue of
dispossessing and chasing away Devils; but
this gift being once antiquated and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seded,
they found no better expedient in
the case, than to conduct the possessed into
the place of publick Assemblies, to the end
that the Church might pray for and over
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41182:56"/>
them; and those Prayers frequently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
deliverance for those poor <hi>Demoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acks:</hi>
But they afterwards constituted
<hi>Exorcists,</hi> under the notion of an <hi>Office,</hi>
to whom they attributed <hi>Jurisdiction over
Devils,</hi> empowering them to torment, and
chase away the same, by vertue of their
conjurations.</p>
               <p>Now many had hitherto disputed about
the state of <hi>Souls after death:</hi>

made way or entrance to the belief of

to imitate his <hi>Fast of forty days;</hi> that <hi>Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
is the last and lowest of vertues; that
true <hi>Fasting</hi> consists in abstinency from sin;
that <hi>Fasting</hi> indeed is commanded in the

days of Fasting, nor Christ, nor his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
did ever enact any Ordinance; that
it is <hi>matter of freedom and indifferency</hi> to
fast upon some certain Days; that the
choice and distinction of meats is not
matter of Religion, &amp;c. We have likewise
seen how that <hi>Fasts</hi> were diversly obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
both as to their <hi>time</hi> and <hi>manner,</hi> and
that they abstained not only from <hi>flesh,</hi>
but from <hi>Wine</hi> also; and we may yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
observe, how much the Fasts of the
first differed from those of modern ages<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
in that the <hi>Lent</hi> of the ancients did ever
begin upon the Sabbath, which followed

through the Laws of new Councils,<note place="margin">Ambros. <hi>serm.</hi> 34:</note> and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:41182:58"/>
multiplicity of Fasts at length suppressed:
For <hi>Leo</hi> I. Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> did about the
year 460. ordain the observance of four
Solemn anniversary Fasts; namely, <hi>Lent,
Whitsuntide,</hi> the <hi>seventh,</hi> and <hi>tenth</hi> Months;
not denying, but that the two last were in
imitation of <hi>Judaisme.</hi> There be some
Authors, who speaking of the Fast of the
<hi>four times</hi> (or four Weeks of <hi>Ember</hi> or
<hi>Imber-days</hi>) and of the Institution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
give this reason for the same: Pope
<hi>Gelasius</hi> had decreed,<note place="margin">Serm 4. de Iejun. septini mensis.</note> that the Ordination
of Priests and Deacons should be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
upon those Days; now for as much
as that action was after the example of the
Primitive Church, (<hi>Acts</hi> 13. &amp; 14.) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
with Fasting and publick Prayer,
the Fast of the <hi>four times</hi> was hereupon
introduced; and notwithstanding those
Ordinations were not performed any
more at that time, yet was the custome of
of Fasting afterwards continued: In like
manner, as touching the <hi>Vigils</hi> of Saints,
the name indeed was retained, but the use
of them quite changed; for the <hi>Wakes</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Night preceding the solemnity of
any Saint, were turned into <hi>Fasts,</hi> howbeit
the name of <hi>Vigil</hi> remained. The Fast of

<hi>Mamert</hi> Bishop of <hi>Vienne</hi> in <hi>Daulphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noise,</hi>
to ordain, that upon some certain
Days every year, there should be publick

               <p>WEe have seen some seeds and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
of the <hi>Invocation of Saints,</hi>
towards the end of the preceding age;
It was not used in the Church, but only
amongst some private Persons, and that as
yet with some hesitation. They began
then to conceive new opinions touching
the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> to rely upon their <hi>Intercession,</hi>
and to attribute vertue to their <hi>Sepulchres.</hi>
St. <hi>Augustine</hi> tells us, that the stronger and
better Christians had no such custome,
but the weaker sort only, and those too
by way of <hi>Indulgence.</hi> This abuse pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
so much, as that the transportation
of Reliques, the resorts of People, the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:41182:59"/>
honours conferred upon Saints, which
at the beginning were tollerable,
were now advanced to an excess: The
Body of <hi>Chrysostome</hi> being transported to
<hi>Constantinople,</hi>

                     <hi>Niceph.</hi> lib. 14. cap. 43.</note> the Emperour <hi>Theodosius</hi>
kneeled down before it, praying it to
forgive his Parents, who had persecuted
it whil'st living: But against this Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition,
the Fathers of this age, like as their
Predecessours before them, remonstrate
after this manner:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> lib. de cura pro mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuis, cap. 13. &amp; contra Parmen. lib. 2. cap. 8. &amp; de Civit. lib. 8. cap 27. <hi>Cyril.</hi> contra Jul. lib. 6. <hi>Chrysost.</hi> Hom. 5. in Matth. <hi>Theodor.</hi> in 2 Epist. ad Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth.</note> 
                  <hi>The Souls of the dead
intermedle not with the affairs of the living:
The Saints are not our Mediatours: We ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud
the Martyrs, as those who have fought
in the defence of the truth, and maintained
the purity of the Faith; we worship them not,
build them no Churches, offer them no Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice:
But to what purpose then are those so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities?
To the end, that we may thereby
glorifie God, because of their victory, and
encourage our selves to follow their example,
that we may share in their Crown and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:
But that we may attain thereunto,
must the Saints be invoked? In no wise; but
we will only implore aid from the true God
himself, who made them both Men and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs.</hi>
This then was the Language of the
Church; and we must remember, that
for as much as in the Assembly, before
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41182:60"/>
the Communion, they celebrated the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial
of the Saints; St. <hi>Augustine</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of that <hi>Commemoration,</hi> informs us,
that the names of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> were then
rehearsed in rank and order, as the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of God, who had overcome the
World, through the Confession of their
Faith, but that they were not <hi>invoked;</hi>
which is at this day verified by the more
ancient <hi>Liturgies,</hi>

               <p>In this age were likewise introduced
(as we have said) <hi>Letanies</hi> or <hi>Rogations</hi>
first in the Eastern Church, and afterwards
in the Western; the Pestilence at <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi>
and the Earth-quakes at <hi>Lyons</hi> and
adjacent places, administring the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41182:60"/>
hereof. From thence they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
upon the like occurrences, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole, both East and West; now
behold the Form of the same; They di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
into certain Articles the publick
calamities and necessities, praying for the
peace from on high, and the salvation of
Souls, for the prosperity of Gods holy
Churches, for both Clergy and People,
for higher Powers, and the peace of the
whole World, for that Province and City,
for the fruitfulness of the Earth, for health,
for such as were engaged in a journey or
voyage, for the sick, for the imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
&amp;c. every one of those Articles being
pronounced with a loud voice by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stour,
the People answered to each thereof,
<hi>Kyrie Eleison, Lord have mercy upon us.</hi>
They afterwards added other clauses, but
the <hi>Invocation of Saints</hi> had no place in
those <hi>Letanies:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Niceph.</hi> lib. 15. cap. 18.</note> One <hi>Peter Gnapheus,</hi> or
<hi>Foulon</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> was the first
that foisted the same into the Prayers of
the Church, about the year 470. And we
must note, that this Person was corrupted
with the <hi>Eutychian</hi> Heresie, for which he
was condemn'd by the <hi>fifth</hi> General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil;
thus did Superstition, which at first
was only private, become publick at last;
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41182:61"/>
and the <hi>Commemoration</hi> of Saints, was
changed into <hi>Invocation;</hi> insomuch, that
in stead of addressing their discourse to
the living, in order to their imitating of
the Saints, they now direct it to the Saints
in the behalf of the living; howbeit this
same <hi>Invocation of Saints</hi> was at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
used only by the <hi>Greeks;</hi> for the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>

               <p>LEt us conclude this fifth Century with
an observation which offered it self
about the same time. It hath been said,
that many had at the celebration of the
<hi>Eucharist,</hi> introduced the custome of <hi>soaked</hi>
or <hi>dipt Bread,</hi> for the benefit of such as
could not use the Cup. This usage was
condemned by <hi>Julius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the year 340. Howbeit in the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Priest doth still dip a moiety
of the Hoste in the Wine of the Chalice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
adding at the same time, that, this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersion
conduceth to eternal life in the
receivers: This expedient so generally
used, carries in it a demonstrative evidence
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:41182:61"/>
that Antiquity gave the Communion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the two species, chusing much rather
in an exigence wherein they could no
better order it, to give soak'd or steep'd
Bread, then to administer the Sacrament
under that only species. Now about the
year 440. the <hi>Manichees</hi> who held Wine
in abomination, as the <hi>Turks</hi> do at this
day, attempted to introduce the <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
under one only species:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Leo.</hi> Serm. quad. 4.</note> And whereas
there were many in the Church tainted
with that heresie, they were discerned by
this token, that they made some hesitation
about receiving of the Chalice. This su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition
was suppressed towards the year
490.<note place="margin">Distinct. 2. Canon. Comperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</note> by Pope <hi>Gelasius,</hi> who ordained, that
they should either receive the Sacrament,
whole and entire, or else wholly abstain
from and forbear it, conformably to what
was decreed by <hi>Leo,</hi> his Predecessour, who
impeached of Sacriledge all those who
repulse the Cup of redeeming blood; an
Ordinance which condemns the <hi>mutilation</hi>
of the Sacrament introduced in after-time
by the <hi>Romish</hi> Church.</p>

The <hi>Historical</hi> use of <hi>Images</hi> was
received into Churches, which was the
only use that Christians applyed them to
for above an hundred years after their

began to degenerate into abuse herein,

to suppress this <hi>Idolatry,</hi> caused them
to be broken into pieces within their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

prevailing over their zeal, this same abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
inforced by custome, was in fine
authorized by those, whose part it was to
reform it; but a long time after, as we
shall shew in its proper place: Let us take
a view of some innovations, which came to
pass at the same time.</p>

               <p>AMongst the many other Miracles pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
in the Church, in the time of
the Apostles, the <hi>anointing of the sick</hi> was
one, by vertue whereof they recovered
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:41182:62"/>
bodily health: Now, howbeit the <hi>gift of
Healing</hi> was, together with other Miracles,
become antiquated, yet did some Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
affect to retain the use of this same
<hi>Vnction,</hi> though now vacated of its pristine
efficacy, addressing it to another end; for,
about the year 180.<note place="margin">

their sick with Oile, when ever they
perceived them to be under the approach
of death, adding thereunto certain Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
pretending that the same did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to soul-salvation: This superstition
found no entertainment, save amongst
some certain <hi>Hereticks,</hi> the Church ever
having it in detestation: But about the
year 528. <hi>Felix</hi> IV. Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
<hi>extream Vnction,</hi> which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

               <p>COrruption was now become universal,
and nothing is henceforth to be seen
but horrour; we shall only run over the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:41182:63"/>
more principal. The most notable change
that befell Religion, came to pass towards
the year 600. This time was very dark;
the Sun of Truth over-clouded, and the
brightest Stars fell from Heaven: Then
was <hi>Gregory</hi> I. Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who not
only approved of former Innovations,
but super-added new ones: They substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
<hi>Saints</hi> in the room of <hi>Gods,</hi> to whom
they dedicated <hi>Churches, Festivals,</hi> and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing
<hi>Priests;</hi> Private superstitions
were advanced even to an invoking of
them; which <hi>Invocation</hi> was now become
publick in the <hi>Latine</hi> Church; for, <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
entered the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> into the <hi>Leta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi>
and in process of time they acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the same <hi>honour to all the Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas formerly there were only plain
<hi>Pictures</hi> in Churches, they now erected
<hi>Statues</hi> therein; not those of Saints only,
but likewise those of <hi>Emperours,</hi> howbeit
they did not as yet allot thereunto any
kind of <hi>worship.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The opinion of <hi>Purgatory</hi> heretofore
conceived by a few, began now to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
howbeit their belief was as yet
far different from the modern, in the
thing; for they held, that (departed)
Souls did divers ways expiate their own
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:41182:64"/>
sins, by Baths, Ice, Sinks, Hanging in the
Air, &amp;c. so doubtfull hitherto was both
the <hi>place</hi> and <hi>pain</hi> of <hi>Purgatory:</hi> nor had
this Doctrine any other foundation, than
the prejudices of <hi>Pagans,</hi> the pretended
apparitions of Spirits, and vulgar cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity.</p>
               <p>Those perswasions nevertheless travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with friendship to antiquated Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
whose scope was the solacing of
the dead; They believed also, that the
<hi>Eucharist</hi> might be beneficial to them,
and therefore made it subservient to this
Superstition; turning a <hi>Sacrament for the
living,</hi> into a <hi>Sacrifice for the dead:</hi> Thus
also, whereas the <hi>Offerings</hi> for the dead,
were no other than <hi>Almes</hi> bestowed in
memory of their piety, they now
receive the tearm of <hi>Oblation</hi> into the
very Sacrament it self, and that in expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of their sins.</p>
               <p>Now proportionably to the Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of new <hi>Doctrines,</hi> or new <hi>Ceremonies,</hi>
was the form of <hi>Divine Worship</hi> always
chop'd and chang'd, as well in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist,
as in publick Prayers: <hi>Liturgies</hi>
were always different, not only in several
Provinces, but even frequently in one
and the same; witness amongst the <hi>Greeks</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:41182:64"/>
those which are ascribed to St. <hi>Dionysius,
Basile, Chrysostome;</hi> and amongst the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi>
those attributed to St. <hi>Ambrose,
Augustine</hi> and <hi>Isidore;</hi> yet notwithstanding,
as they were conformable to one another
in substance, so likewise they had many
things common in point of <hi>Form:</hi> Now,
<hi>Gregory</hi> undertaking to redress and new-model
all Church-Forms, altered and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
many passages; and out of this same
medley, composed the <hi>Office of the Mass,</hi>
after the same Form well-nigh, wherein it
is to be seen at this day; borrowing the
same from <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Clauses, as
<hi>Kyrie eleison</hi> from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Halle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujah</hi>
from the Church of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We must note moreover, that the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Church receiving the Offerings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
by the People, besought God, that
those fruits of charity might become ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to him; to which purpose, they
pronounced these Orisons, <hi>We pray thee
to accept of, and bless these gifts, these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents,
these holy Sacrifices, &amp;c. Vouchsafe
to regard them with a serene and propitious
aspect, and to accept of them, as thou did<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
of the offering of thy righteous Child</hi> Abel, <hi>&amp;c.
Command that they be conveyed to thine holy
Altar, by the hands of thine Angel.</hi> Those
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41182:65"/>
Orisons were retained in the Canon of
the Mass, but alienated to quite another
intent; for, whereas they were formerly
rehearsed over the Eleemosynary presents
of the Faithfull, they are now pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
over the Body of Jesus Christ, by an
absurdity full of Sacriledge; inasmuch as
they do in express tearms pray for Jesus
Christ, paralleling Him with the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
offered by the Patriarchs of old.</p>
               <p>Then was the <hi>Gregorian Hymn</hi> received
into the Canon of the Mass; till the year
368. there was not yet any <hi>singing</hi> used in
the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. <hi>Damasus</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> about the same time wrote to St.
<hi>Jerome,</hi> that he would send him the <hi>Greek</hi>
Psalter, <hi>Because</hi> (said he) <hi>we are so studious
of simplicity, that upon the very Sabbath-day
there is only read one of the Epistles of the
Apostle, and one of the Chapters of the Gospel,
and the beauty of Psalms doth not appear in
our mouths.</hi> Now the <hi>Psalms</hi> were wont at
first to be sung whole and entire by all
the People, in one uniform and continued
Song, but afterwards by way of <hi>Diapsalm</hi>
or pawse and intermission: Finally, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the year, 418. <hi>Celestine</hi> I. appointed
them to be sung by way of <hi>Antiphony</hi> (or

dispersed throughout the Empire;
new tongues offering, the <hi>Latine</hi> became
estranged: Yet notwithstanding, they still
retain'd the use thereof in Churches,
though the People had already lost the

               <p>THen also were <hi>Private Masses</hi> obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
wherein the Priest communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
all alone: This corruption sprung
from the luke-warmness of the People;
heretofore, when as zeal was as yet vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
the <hi>whole Assembly</hi> did communicate,
and that <hi>every day</hi> of the Week; but this
devotion waxing cold, the <hi>Communion</hi> was
restricted to the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and the more

communicated every day; but in fine,
the <hi>Clergy</hi> likewise neglecting the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
there was none but the Priest
alone that did communicate: From hence
it came to pass, that instead of <hi>one great
Bread,</hi> which they were accustomed to
break for the use of the whole multitude,
they now consecrated only one small one
of the bigness of a <hi>penny,</hi> as being suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for one individual Person: Likewise,
instead of the great Vessels used for the
Sacramental Wine, they used Viols in
their Mass-Service: But forasmuch as the

did withall decline the present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of any more Offerings; that they

them, provided they would continue the
assistance of their customary Offerings;
and instead of the Communion, they gave
them Bread, over which they prayed,
called <hi>hallowed Bread:</hi> Thus were <hi>private
Masses</hi> substituted in the room of the <hi>holy
Supper:</hi> and yet nevertheless the Priest,
when he communicates all alone by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
doth still use the same tearms, which
he was wont to pronounce, when there
were many Communicants; for he prays
that the Sacrament might tend to the
Salvation of <hi>all</hi> the receivers; even then
I say, when as himself is the sole and only
partaker.</p>
               <p>Moreover, from the relinquishing of
the Eucharist, another change proceeded;
for, when that this exercise was more than
ordinarily frequented, the whole was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
with a loud voice, save that in
the first antiquity, after an Exhortation
made by the Pastour, every one present
prayed with a submissive voice, to the end
that God might vouchsafe to bless the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:41182:69"/>
work; but the remaining part thereof,
especially the institution of the Supper,
was pronounced very loud, so as that the
whole Assembly might hear; afterwards
there being but a small appearance of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
that offered themselves to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
the Priest began to speak with a
more low voice; and finally, there being
none present, but the Priest himself only,
who communicated, he did at length ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the words of Consecration so low, as
that none but himself could understand
them: This is called the <hi>secret of the Mass,</hi>

a <hi>Pagan</hi> both by Nation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
a Woman of many notorious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormities,
assembled a Council at <hi>Nice,</hi>
excluding from it the best Doctors, and

moulded and model'd according to

in behalf of the Images; concluded upon

<hi>Before that the bread be sanctified, we
name it bread; but it being once by Divine
grace sanctified, it is certainly freed from the
appellation of bread, and is dignified with the
name of the Lords body, howheit the true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

these words, worthy of consideration:</hi>
The Heavenly Sacrament, wherein the flesh
of Christ is truly represented, is called the
body of Christ, but improperly, for it is so
called after a manner congruous and peculiar
to it self, howbeit, not according to the real
truth of the thing but by way of a significant
mystery; so that the sense runneth thus:
It is called the body of Christ, that is to say,
this is thereby signified. <hi>Judge then sober

               <p>AT this time, under <hi>Victor</hi> II. the
<hi>Redemption of Penances</hi> was introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced:
For it was enacted that they might be

nature, as <hi>pecuniary Mulcts</hi> under the
notion of Almes, <hi>Donatives</hi> bestowed in
favour of the Church, <hi>Pilgrimages,</hi> and
other things equivalent, proportionably
to the years of penance allotted them;
and that such as had not wherewithall to
accommodate themselves herein, might
redeem their years of penance, with the
number of Psalmes sung by them, with
Fastings in the strength of Bread and
Water, with scourging and scarifying of
themselves, and other kinds of <hi>voluntary
mortification;</hi> whence the custome of whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
proceeded, and from the same source,

the ancient Discipline was utterly
subverted: We have seen that the <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences</hi>
were no other than certain relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

But the vertue of those <hi>Indulgences</hi> was
afterwards extended beyond this World,
for shortening of the years of their abode
in <hi>Purgatory;</hi> a thing which the Primitive
Christians never once dreamed of: We
have likewise observed, that the <hi>Penitents,</hi>
who ordinarily were very numerous, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
themselves to the Church, having
their faces covered with ashes, in token of
humility; from whence it was, that the

                  <hi>BErenger</hi> Archdeacon of <hi>Angiers,</hi> did
profoundly confute the <hi>real pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,</hi>
and other abuses ushered into the
Doctrine of the Lord's Supper. True it
is, that in the year 1059, having made
his appearance before the <hi>Lateran</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:41182:86"/>
whither he was cited, out of fear of
some cruel usage, he signed a Confession
contrary to his judgment, mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
in its proper place: but after his
return into <hi>France</hi> he retracted the same,
and confirmed his Proselytes, which
were so numerous, that <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
in his 3d Book of the History of
<hi>England,</hi> doth attest, that all <hi>France</hi> was
full of his Doctrine; which is confirmed
by <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Westminster,</hi> who adds,
that not only the <hi>French,</hi> but also great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
part of the <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>English</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
the same; It was exactly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to that of <hi>Bertram</hi> and <hi>John
Erigine,</hi> by the relation of his Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
amongst whom <hi>Lanfranck</hi> then Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot
and afterwards Archbishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
writing against him in his Book of
the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> represents it to us thus:
<hi>The Sacrifice of the Church,</hi> saith <hi>Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
is compounded of two things, the one
visible, the other invisible; of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the thing signified in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
which thing signified, that is to say,
the Body of Christ, if it were presented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our eyes, were visible; but being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
to Heaven, and sitting on the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
of the Father, until the restitution of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:41182:86"/>
all things, as the Apostle</hi> Peter <hi>speaks, it
cannot be brought back from Heaven, where
in the person of Christ it consists of God and
Man: Now the Sacraments of the Lords
Table, to wit, the consecrated Bread and
Wine, are not in the least changed or alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but remain in their proper substances,
having a resemblance of the things whereof
they are Sacraments, &amp;c.</hi> This he taught
till the year 1091, wherein he died with
so great reputation, that <hi>Hildebert,</hi> who
was afterwards Bishop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> in an
Epitaph which he made upon him, called
him <hi>The Pillar of the Church, the Glory
and Hope of the Clergy:</hi> The Doctrine
which he opposed, being at that time so
little rooted, that Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> VII,
who came to the Popedome in the year,
1073, did, by the report of Cardinal
<hi>Benno</hi> and <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> appoint a Fast
to three Cardinals, to the end that God
might please to reveal whether of the
two opinions was Truth, that of <hi>Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi>
or that of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and,
upon what account soever it was, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it is that be threw the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
into the fire in the presence of the
Cardinals, as appears by the relation of
Cardinal <hi>Benno</hi> himself, who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:41182:87"/>
with this Pope; so that it is
more than probable that he believed not
the same to be the real Body of Christ.</p>

for his knowledge in the Liberal Sciences
the very wonder of his Age, who in many
excellent Treatises by him composed, doth
mightily inveigh against the Errours of the

the very face of Antichrist, in the Papacy

and the order of Monks: That Divines
have wickedly confounded Philosophicall
Dreams with sacred Scripture; that in the
Sacrifice, so denominated from the Altar,
the Priest offered nought to God; and that
the Masses did nothing avail either the
quick or the dead; that Papal Constitutions
were no other than humane Traditions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
only the doctrines of humane works:</hi>
and he proved by the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> and
many other Authorities, <hi>that Antichrist
should in the height of Tyranny persecute
the Faithful.</hi> For which Opinions he was
by the <hi>Jacobins</hi> of <hi>Tarascon</hi> judged a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick;

persons of great Learning, and

cultivate and improve the

Now forasmuch as the whole Kingdome
of <hi>Bohemia</hi> was through means of their
Preaching and Doctrine, reduced
from obedience to the Pope, and the
Ceremonies of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church; the
Council of <hi>Constance</hi> required King <hi>Wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceslaus</hi>
to send the said <hi>Huss</hi> thither, to
whom the Emperour <hi>Sigismond</hi> gave ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

as he challengeth over the Church, and
that Indulgences are null; That the Bread
and the Wine remain untransubstantiated in
the Supper; and that the Communion should
be equally distributed to all under both
kinds: That there is no such thing as
Purgatory: That Saints departed ought not
to be invoked, nor Images worshipped; and
that all those things, with their like appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants,

ever purchase hatred from the Wicked, as

this was the cause of that cruel usage
which he met withall from his Enemies;
which he endured with a truly Christian-Constancy,
rehearsing as he was going to
the place of Execution, or rather of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
diverse verses of the <hi>Psalms,</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
of the 31st and 51st, and oftentimes
these words, taken partly out of the 31st,
<hi>I recommend my spirit into thy hands, for
thou hast redeemed me, Lord Jesus, thou

setting fire to the Faggots, he said three
times with a strong and loud voice, <hi>Jesus

               <p>That other faithful Witness of the Truth,

to sing Divine Praises with a holy hymn,
which by the very relation of <hi>Aeneas Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi>
who was afterwards Pope, called
<hi>Pius</hi> II, and of <hi>Pogius</hi> of <hi>Florence</hi> who

all who after those two saithful Witnesses,
espoused the defence of the same Truth,
which the greatest part of them have, as
they before them, sealed with their blood:
We behoved to make mention of that great
Assembly of persons at <hi>Doway,</hi> in the year
1421, who held the Doctrine of the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denses,</hi>
of whom a great number, as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported

Doctrine; which <hi>Reynauld Peacock</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Chichester</hi> in like manner main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the year 1457.<note place="margin">Naucler. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. de Siles.</note> We behoved
likewise to shew, that <hi>George Poggebrach</hi>
King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> together with his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
owned to the day of his death, the
profession of the Truth against the Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
of <hi>Rome;</hi> and that the King of
<hi>Poland</hi> stood inclined to its defence: Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
that, in the year 1480,<note place="margin">The Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuator of the Abbot of <hi>Vs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perg.</hi>
                  </note>

Basil</hi> of <hi>Groningue, Stephen Bralfer,</hi>
and <hi>Paul,</hi> Notary of <hi>Tubinge,</hi> Doctors in
Divinity, did in like manner in <hi>Germany</hi>
withstand the Doctrine of the <hi>Romish</hi>-Church;
for controlling of whose vanity
and many corruptions, <hi>Jerome Savonarole</hi>
was burnt at <hi>Florence</hi> in the year 1498:
notwithstanding which, <hi>John Francis Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
Count of <hi>Mirandula,</hi> failed not to
write in his behalf, and in like manner to
reprehend the very same abuses: That in
the year 1505, <hi>Paul Scriptoris</hi> did in his
Lectures in the University of <hi>Tubinge,</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
declaim against <hi>Transubstantiation:</hi>
And that in the year 1507, <hi>Thomas More</hi>
of <hi>Brockford,</hi> an English-man, was burnt
at <hi>Norwich,</hi> for preaching against the then
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:41182:95"/>
prevailing Superstitions of the Church. We
behoved moreover to produce that goodly
Confession presented in the year 1508, to
King <hi>Vladislaus</hi> by the persecuted <hi>Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
in <hi>Hungary,</hi> which was exactly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to that of the Protestant and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches: And likewise observe
all that is recorded by that great Lawyer
<hi>Charles du Moulin,</hi> in his History of the
<hi>French Monarchy,</hi> on purpose to give the
World to understand what reception the
Doctrine and Life of those of <hi>Cabrieres</hi> and
<hi>Merindol,</hi> found with King <hi>Lewis</hi> XII,
which gave such ample satisfaction to that
great Prince, as that upon the report there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
made to him of the same, he swore that
<hi>they had more goodness and worth in them,
than himself and all his subjects besides.</hi>
Finally, we behov'd in like manner for the
honour of that incomparable Monarch, to
add, how that, after the example of <hi>Philip</hi>
the Fair, one of his Predecessors, he quell'd
the sauciness and petulancy of <hi>Julius</hi> II,
who had excommunicated him, having as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
a Council at <hi>Pisa,</hi> in order to the
reforming of the Church, both in its Head

                  <hi>MArtin Luther,</hi> together with those

strike that great blow which did so migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
shake the Papal Power, and restore to

                  <note n="*" place="margin">About the year 1080 the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> IV. af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted by <hi>Gregory</hi> VII, was obliged to ask him his pardon bare-footed, and to suffer many other indignities.

(though controll'd) Authority, which they
hold of none but God himself: and this
was so marvellous, that after that time the

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:41182:96"/>
                  <hi>England, Scotland, Ireland, Swedland,

other Regions wherein the Light of the

Clouds of Popish Darknesse; that the
greatest part (I say) of those Kingdoms and
Republicks were from that time forward
wholly emancipated and disengaged from

and Error; which, amongst many others,
hath been likewise rejected by a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of their own authors or abettors, suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
proof, that it was the Divine Hand of
Omnipotency that gave those signal blows,
captivating all those thoughts and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
under the yoke of his obedience.</p>
               <p>In case our Adversaries alleage, 1. That
those whom God raised up for this great
and glorious work of <hi>Reformation</hi> were
so inconsiderable, as that there is no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of respect due to such abject and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:41182:96"/>
Instruments; And 2. being the
business which they attempted, was of such
an extraordinary nature, they ought to
have wrought Miracles for authorizing of
the same: It is no hard matter to assoyl
those Objections: In the first place then,
for satisfaction to the former; We grant
indeed that there is but little or nothing at
all of excellency in them, being considered
in and of themselves; but if they be eyed
with respect to the manutenency of Him
who set them to work, they are no wise
base or contemptible; There needs no more
but the smart of a silly Insect to quell and
confound the pride of <hi>Pharoah,</hi> and extort
from him a confession of <hi>the Finger of God,</hi>
who, that the Power of his Arm, and the
greatness of his infinite Majesty might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the more obvious and acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
can at pleasure serve the interests of
his Glory upon the most inglorious means,
even despicable vermine: For this reason
our Lord Jesus Christ, that he might hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and debase the <hi>Synagogue,</hi> confound
and baffle the fondness and arrogancy of
the <hi>Philosophers,</hi> reduce and defeat the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
and Superstition of <hi>Paganism,</hi> triumph
gloriously over the swelling ambition and
vanity of the <hi>Emperours,</hi> and cause the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:41182:97"/>
whole Earth to bend to the sacred Yock of
his Cross; would not make use of any of
those renowned Worldlings, but of poor
<hi>Fisher-men,</hi> a Mechanick <hi>Tentmaker,</hi> and
an ignominious <hi>Publican,</hi> who yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
caught whole Empires and
Kingdoms in their Nets, assembling the
whole World under the Tabernacle of the
God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and making the most obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and rebellious Tributaries to his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed.</p>
               <p>And after the same method did he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in the <hi>restauration</hi> of the Gospel, which
he used in the first <hi>publication</hi> of it; as we
have seen above, where we have noted the
marvellous exploits of the chief persons
whom he hath imployed in his admirable
Conquests. Insult therefore no more, but
rather confess with the Psalmist,<note place="margin">Psa. 118. 23</note> 
                  <hi>This is
Lords doing, and it is marvellous in our
eyes:</hi> Which they also have proclaimed
aloud, having alwayes in imitation of the
Apostles said,<note place="margin">Acts 3. 12, &amp; 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Such things were not wrought
by us, but only in the Name and Authority
of our Lord Jesus Christ;</hi> And with the
Church in the book of Psalms,<note place="margin">Psal. 115.</note> 
                  <hi>Not unto
us, Lord, not unto us, but unto thy great
Name be rendred all the honour and glory.</hi>
With the like facility we answer to the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:41182:97"/>
other Objection, urged from the defect
of <hi>Miracles:</hi> True it is, had those good
men taught any other doctrine than that
of the Gospel, in that case it had been
requisite that they should have given
some visible testimonies of their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;
besides that, according to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
caution,<note place="margin">Gal. 18.</note> he ought to be an <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>
though he were an Angel from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
whosoever preacheth <hi>any other Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel</hi>
than what hath been already evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelized:
He hath likewise taught us,
that all those <hi>extraordinary gifts</hi> which
the munificent God did so liberally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribute,
for authorizing of the Truth of
<hi>Christian Religion</hi> in its infancy, should
cease and become antiquated: And our
Lord Jesus Christ hath admonished us,
that whoever should brag or make osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
hereof,<note place="margin">Matth. 24.</note> should be very <hi>Teachers
of lies,</hi> making such a plausible shew
of the same, as that they should be able
(if it were possible) to deceive the very
Elect: And yet notwithstanding, what
more specious or signal ones can any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
than their very subsistence amidst
the raging persecution of their enemies,
when as they were like unto <hi>Moses</hi> in
<hi>Egypt</hi> in the hands of <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:41182:98"/>
yet, such is the Providence of God, they
never failed to meet with their true Mother,
who nourished them upon her chast and
untainted breasts; that is to say, some
sound Teachers who caused them to suck
the sincere Milk of the sound knowledge
of God's Word; as the <hi>Israelites</hi> in the
Deserts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> they did still feed upon
<hi>Manna</hi> from Heaven, and were furnished
with vessels of Gold and Silver, which they
had taken out of the houses of the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
whereof to make sacred Vessels and

of the Sanctuary: If at any time they
have,<note place="margin">1 Kin. 17. 6.</note> with the Prophet <hi>Elijah,</hi> by means
of a persecuting <hi>Jezebel,</hi> been constrained
to make a Cave their hiding-place, the very

them with necessary food. When as
they were like the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> in the

were not after Christ, that with them
<hi>Aristotle</hi> was in a manner more esteem'd

that admirable change the sacred Volume
of the Word of God, which was to them
before a Book sealed with seven seals,
&amp; hard to be understood, did through the
several Translations of the same into the
most part of the vulgar Languages of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:41182:100"/>
                  <hi>Europe,</hi> become general and common,
It was in like manner after the same time
that the Exposition of <hi>Divine Books</hi> was
re-established in the Church instead of
<hi>fabulous Legends,</hi> which were formerly
the ordinary subject of their Sermons:
Nor had they come this length, but upon
design to supplant the simple, &amp; through
the shame and reproach which they su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained
to see that we make that sacred
Word the very foundation and subject-matter
of our Doctrine and Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but that which they have ever offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and still offer such violence unto, as
that, so little inquisitive are they after
the establishment of the Truth therein
contained, their main care and business
is to defend and maintain their Errours.
And upon this very account do they tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
and misapply the Writings of the
Ancient Doctors of the Church, which
being humane, and consequently falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
can never serve for a Rule or Judge
in matters of Religion, insomuch that
even they themselves refer us to the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Canon of Divine Scriptures; But
failing of their reckoning, as touching
the Writings of the Fathers, aswell as
the Word of God, and perceiving that
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:41182:100"/>
all solid Antiquity doth deposite and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
in our favours, as we have shewed
above, they suppress and stifle the most
goodly and precious Monuments, and
the Originals of rich pieces of Christian
Antiquity, or else mangle, change, and
miserably deface them where-ever their
own Cause is discountenanced; and,
fearing lest that refuge might also fail
them, their Doctors have, in pursuance
of an Order of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi>
fram'd <hi>Expurgatory Indices,</hi> conformably
whereunto they exhibit to us the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of the Fathers: and not contented
to pay us in clipt money, they also force
upon us false and naughty allay, obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
many spurious pieces for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of Antiquity, or of some of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
which yet were never theirs; as
may easily appear, if we compare the
Counterfeit with the true Coin; which
is no other than what the more sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
of the <hi>Romish</hi> Communion them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
have been alwayes constrained to
confess; Nevertheless we doubt not but
that we shall still find, even in those mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilous
forms, matter enough for satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them, and for subverting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
of Errour by its own weapons:
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:41182:101"/>
Who then will not judge from hence of
the goodness and equity of our Cause?
who can infer the naughtiness or despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
of that of our party, against whom
they having commenced so criminal a
process, would yet notwithstanding, be
Judges in their own fact; and refusing
to understand our defences, traduce us
as guilty, and accordingly condemn us
in the force and form (as the saying is)
of a proscription of sackage; And (that

nothing but what he appointed them;
and albeit several Bishops inclin'd to
make some opposition in defence of the

proved ineffectual, they having in fine
submitted their necks under the Papal-Yoke.
Though all this succeeded very

from that time forwards they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
such a disgust and aversion to
Councils, that they never cared more

fearing lest they might set about that

and so absolutely necessary both in head
and members: All that they busied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
about after that, was, what yet
well became them, the regulating of the
Hoods, Hosen and Shooes of Monks, the

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:41182:103"/>
unsufferable pride and vanity, as may
sufficiently appear by the continual at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
made upon the <hi>Ordinaries,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Archbishops, Bishops</hi> and <hi>Curates,</hi> who

done before them, a religious and free
Council, wherein all parties abandoning
prejudices and animosities, might in

in concurrence with a privy Council con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of some of the more Learned and
more sober of both parties, prudentially
weigh the validity of Reasons urged, the
sincerity of Procedure, and the merit of the

that we have a veneration for <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:41182:104"/>
God only: And as touching the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
if the Word of God may be umpire,
as without all peradventure it ought to be,
we should soon likewise condescend upon
their <hi>number;</hi> And in conformity to that
sacred directory,<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 26. <hi>and</hi> Mark 14. 22. &amp;c. 1 Cor. 11. 24.</note> observing our Saviour's

us to do in like manner; we should <hi>take
the Bread,</hi> we should <hi>all drink</hi> of the <hi>Cup
of blessing,</hi> in commemoration of the inesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
Death of our dear Redeemer, whose
Flesh and Blood is meat and drink indeed,
whereby we are nourished unto an eternal
life. We should know, without further
debate, that this <hi>Union</hi> is wrought by the
mediation of his Spirit, who uniteth and
conjoyneth us to himself, after an ineffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but a <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real</hi> manner;<note place="margin">Eph. 3. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Christ
dwelling in our hearts by Faith,</hi> which is
the mouth of our souls, by which we feed
upon him; whereunto the conversion of
<hi>Bread</hi> into <hi>Flesh</hi> is not at all necessary, but
the Elevation of Faith unto Heaven, its ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
and proper act; for, as our Lord
hath taught us,<note place="margin">Joh. 6. 63.</note> 
                  <hi>it is the Spirit that quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eneth;
the flesh profiteth nothing: The
words that I speak unto you, they are spirit,
and they are life;</hi> that is to say, they are
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:41182:105"/>
of a spiritual and vivifick vertue, as well
in the publication of the Gospel, as in
the participation of the holy Supper,
wherein the <hi>Bread</hi> and the <hi>Wine,</hi> are
<hi>Signes, Gages,</hi> and <hi>Memorials</hi> of that
which is therein represented to us, whose
Name they bear, as is usual in all Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;<note place="margin">Gen. 17. 10. Exod. 12. 21</note>
as also because they are not only
<hi>significative,</hi> but likewise <hi>exhibitive</hi> of
the thing signified to the Faithful and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Communicant, so as shall be shewed
streight. And certainly this same <hi>Real-Presence</hi>
and <hi>Participation</hi> may be easily
enough conceived, without the necessary
admission of a <hi>Local</hi> and <hi>gross</hi> one; for
if it must be acknowledged that the Sun,
whilst bounded within its sphear, doth yet
communicate warinth, life, and nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and that truly, really, substantially
to Vegetables; can any one doubt without
Blasphemy, that the glorious Body of our
Lord and Saviour, the true <hi>Sun of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi>
who carrieth health and life in his
Divine Rayes, is furnished with less vertue
than that Globe of fire and light, which
himself hath enlightned? Or that his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature, which he hath united <hi>perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally</hi>
to his Divinity, cannot by its means
<hi>mystically</hi> unite it self to our souls, in order
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:41182:105"/>
to their warmth, quickening and nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but that his sacred Body must needs
first redescend to us here below, to be
prostituted to a thousand indignities, as
would necessarily follow upon that <hi>local</hi>
and <hi>gross carnal Presence,</hi> which is taught
and professed in the Communion of
<hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We should not stick to call the sacred
Ceremony of the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> a <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi>
but only an <hi>Eucharistical</hi> or a <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulatory</hi>
Sacrifice, there being none <hi>Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 25, 26, 27.</note>
other than that which our Lord Jesus
offered upon the Cross, as the Apostle in
the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> proveth. We
should in like manner accord, that none
can ever eat of the Supper of our Lord with
too much preparedness, for fear of propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
so sublime and dreadful a Mystery,
to use the notion of the Fathers, forasmuch
as those who approach unworthily, and
without a serious examination of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
that they may know whether they
are furnished with Faith, Repentance, and
Charity, which are qualifications prerequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the worthy participation of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Communion, do, instead of receiving
the Gages of their Salvation, take and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:41182:106"/>
In fine, we should make it
yet further appear, touching many other
controverted points, that we are not so
odious or hateful as we are represented:
But it may suffice to have remarked the
more principal ones, from which one may
judge whether there may be place for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
our selves any re-union between
those of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and us, by
holding of a Council in the manner by us
propounded, never doubting but that God
would crown with his Blessing, the design
of so August and Venerable an Assembly;
and that the Bishops, Doctors, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of Christ constituting the same, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
of themselves in the first place before
the Father of Lights, from whom cometh
every good and perfect gift, as also every
one of us in like manner with Repentance,
Fasting and Tears, thereby with fervency
imploring the assistance of his Holy Spirit,
he would infallibly vouchsafe the same un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us; and grant that the Spirit of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
Truth, Peace, and Concord might
preside in a most singular manner in the
midst of that Reverend and Pious Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
whose Members should all of them be
