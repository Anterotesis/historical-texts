         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

You beare both <hi>Spirituall</hi> Armes against the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of your Saluation, and <hi>Materiall</hi> Armes against the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of your Countrey.

               <hi>Iob</hi> calls mans life a <hi>Warfare:</hi> and wee find, Reuel. 12. that <hi>there was warre in heauen: Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael and his Angels fought against the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon; and the Dragon &amp; his Angels.</hi> Where by <hi>Heauen</hi> is meant the Church of God vpon earth; as
<pb facs="tcp:519:3"/>
Interpreters obserue generally. For in Heauen aboue there is no warfare, but welfare: no trouble, but <hi>Peace that passeth all vnderstanding</hi>: Now to this <hi>War</hi> euery <hi>Christian</hi> is a professed <hi>Souldier:</hi> not onely for a spurt, for sport; as young Gentlemen vse for a time to see the fashion of the warres: but our Vow runnes thus in <hi>Baptisme</hi>; that euery man vndertakes to <hi>fight manfully vnder Christs Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner against Sinne, the World, and the Deuill; and to continue his faithfull Souldier and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant to his liues end.</hi> And this <hi>Battell</hi> let vs fight with courage, because we are warriours vnder that Generall that (without question) shall conquer. <hi>Nil desperandu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christo Duce, &amp; Auspice Christo.

            <p>
               <hi>Bernard</hi> supposeth a great war between <hi>Christ</hi> the king of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> &amp; <hi>Satan</hi> the K. of <hi>Babylon.</hi> The <hi>Watchman</hi> on the wals spies a <hi>Christian</hi> soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier to be surprised by the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Host, &amp; car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried captiue to their Tents. Hereof he informes the king, who presently chargeth <hi>Timorem,</hi> the <hi>Feare</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> to run &amp; redeeme the souldier. <hi>Feare</hi> comes thundring vpon the aduersary power, &amp; forceth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> trembling to surrender backe their prey; which he
<pb facs="tcp:519:3"/>
is now returning home to the king. Hereupon steps vp <hi>Spiritus Tristitiae, Sadnes;</hi> &amp; cryes, O ye <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians,</hi> is it not a shame that one man should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scue a prisoner from such a multitude? Well <hi>ne ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meatis a Timore isto,</hi> be not afraid of this fellow <hi>Feare:</hi> I will giue you a stratagem how to reduce him. This must not be done <hi>Marte sed arte;</hi> not by force but by fraud: marke the euent.</p>
            <p>This Spirit of <hi>Sadnesse</hi> lyes in the way, and falls in with the <hi>Souldiers,</hi> colloguing as a friend, as a fiend; <hi>amica sed iniqua collocutione.</hi> Suspectles <hi>Feare</hi> followes a little off. But <hi>Sorrow</hi> had brought the Souldier to the brinke of a deepe Pitte, <hi>Despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>; and was euen vpon the point of thrusting him in; The <hi>Watchman</hi> obserues it, and againe tells the king: who (quicker then thought) dispatcheth a fresh supply of succour, <hi>Hope,</hi> to his deliuery. <hi>Hope</hi> mounted vpon a swift horse, <hi>Desire</hi>; comes amaine: and with the <hi>Sword</hi> of <hi>Gladnes</hi> puts <hi>Sorrow</hi> to flight; so quits him from the gulfe of Despaire. Once again is the <hi>Citizen</hi> of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> freed: now <hi>Hope</hi> sets him (being weary) on his own horse, <hi>Desire</hi>: himselfe leads him with the Cord of <hi>Promised mercy: Feare</hi> comes after with a switch made of <hi>Remembrance of sinnes,</hi> and so sets him forward to <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> calls a Councell;
<pb facs="tcp:519:4"/>
where some grieue, others rage, all Hell rores, that they had lost a prisoner, of whom they lately thought themselues so sure. There is not more ioy with the <hi>Angels</hi> in heauen, then there is sorrow with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils in hell, for this Sinners conuersion. But yet all is not well, as the Watchman certifies the King of Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence. The <hi>Souldier</hi> is mounted vpon <hi>Desire, Hope</hi> leads him, and <hi>Feare</hi> driues him amaine: but I doubt he comes too fast, because he hath neither <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle</hi> nor <hi>Saddle.</hi> Hereon the Kings, that hath euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting care of all Christian soules, sends forth two of his graue <hi>Councellors</hi> to him, <hi>Temperance</hi> and <hi>Prudence</hi>; Temperance giues him a Bridle, that is <hi>Discretion</hi>; and Prudence a Saddle, that is <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection.</hi> This is not all: <hi>Feare</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> giue him two Spurres; on the left heele <hi>Feare of punishment,</hi> on the right, <hi>Expectation of blisse. Knowledge</hi> cleares his <hi>Eye, Diligence</hi> opens his <hi>Eare, Obedience</hi> strengthens his <hi>Hand, Deuotion</hi> rectifies his <hi>Foot, Faith</hi> encourageth his <hi>Heart.</hi> And if he want any thing, <hi>Prayer</hi> offers him her seruice, to wait vpon him as a faithfull messenger; promising that whensoeuer he sends her to the King with a Petition, she will bring him backe a Benediction.</p>
            <p>Thus as in a little Tablet you see the whole world; that all of vs must be Souldiers on earth militant,
<pb facs="tcp:519:4"/>
that will be Conquerors in heauen triumphant. But are there not enemies in the flesh, so well as enemies in the Spirit? Is mysticall armour only necessarie to a Christian, &amp; is there no vse of materiall? No; <hi>Aequu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Deum illis esse propitium, qui sibi non sunt aduersarij</hi>; it is iust, that God should be a friend to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that are not enemies to themselues. I know pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are good weapons: and <hi>Exo.</hi> 17. there was more speed made to victorie by lifting vp of <hi>Moses</hi> hands, then of <hi>Ioshu</hi>'s word. He that would ouercome his enemies on earth, must first preuaile with his best friend in heauen. If the mercy &amp; strength of God be made thine by prayer, feare not the aduerse powers. Ro. 8. <hi>We shalbe conquerors through him that loued vs.</hi> But is it enough to bend the knee, without stirring the hand? Shall warre march against vs with thundering steps; &amp; shall we only assemble our selues in the Temples, lie prostrate on the pauements, lift vp our hands &amp; eyes to heauen, &amp; not our wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons against our enemies? Shal we beat the aire with our voices, and not their bosomes with our swords? only knock our own breasts, &amp; not knock their heads? Sure, a religious conscience neuer taught a man to neglect his life, his libertie, his estate, his peace. Pietie and Policie are not opposites: he that taught vs to be <hi>harmelesse as Doues,</hi> bad vs also <hi>be wise as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:519:5"/>
Giue way to a fiction: fables are not without their vsefull morals. A boy was molested with a dog; the Frier taught him to say a Gospell by heart, and warranted this to allay the dogs furie. The mastiffe spying the boy, flies at him: he begins (as it were) to coniure him with his Gospel. The dog (not capable of religion) approcheth more violently. A neighbor pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing by, bids the boy take vp a stone: he did so, and throwing at the dog, escaped. The Frier demands of the lad, how he sped with his charme. Sir (quoth he) your Gospel was good, but a stone with the Gospel did the deed. The Curs of Antichrist are not afraid of our Gospel, but of our stones: let vs fight, &amp; they wil flie.</p>
            <p>Fight say you; why who strikes vs? Yeeld that no enemies doe, are we sure that none will doe? When our <hi>securitie</hi> hath made vs weake, &amp; their <hi>policie</hi> hath made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> strong, we shal find the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (like that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome neighbour) knocking at our dore early in the morning, before we are vp; when it wil be too late for vs to say, If we had known of your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, we would haue prouided better cheare for you. They thank you, they wil take now such as they find, for they purpose to be their owne caruers, and the worst morsels they swallow shalbe your hearts. Let vs therfore like good housekeepers, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such vnbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> guests come, haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies a breakfast ready for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: which if we giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:519:5"/>
heartily, they shal haue smal stomach to their dinners.</p>
            <p>Be you but ready for warre, and I durst warrant your peace. Whilst you are dissolute, they grow reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute. <hi>Ludouicus Viues</hi> reports, that the yong nobles and gallants in a citie of Spaine were falne to such le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie of carriage; that in stead of marching to the sound of a Drum, they were dancing leuolto's to the Lute in a Ladies chamber: their Beauers were tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Beuer hats. Euery one had his mistresse, and spent his time in courting <hi>Venus</hi>; but <hi>Mars</hi> was shut out at the backe gate. The ancient Magistrates obseruing this, consulted what should become of that country, which these men must gouerne after they were dead. Hereupon they conferred with the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, their daughters, the Ladies: whom they instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to forbeare their wonted fauours, to despise the fantasticall amorists, and to afford no grace to them that had no grace in themselues. This they obeyed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, and wrought so effectually, that the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men soone began to spie some difference betwixt Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminatenes and Noblenes. And at last in honourable and seruiceable designes excelled all their Ancestors. If we had in England such Ladies, (though I doe not wish them from Spaine) wee should haue such Lords. Honour should goe by the Banner, not by the Barue: and Reputation be valued by valour, not
<pb facs="tcp:519:6"/>
measured by the acre: there would be no ambition to be carpet-Knights.</p>
            <p>How necessarie the readinesse of Armes, and of men practised to those Armes, hath beene to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good; what Nation hath not found, either in the habite to their safetie, or in the priuation to their ruine? Onely we blesse our selues in our peace; and say to them that aduise vs to militarie preparations, as the Deuils said to Christ, that we come to torment them before their time. But let them rest, that thus will rust: and for your selues, worthy Gentlemen, keepe your Armes bright; and thereby your names, your vertues, your soules: you shall be honoured in good mens hearts, whilst wanton and effeminate Gulls shall weaue and weare their owne disgraces. <hi>Spernite vos sperni:</hi> there are none that think base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of you, whose bosomes are acquainted with other then ignoble thoughts. But I haue held you too long in the gates, vnlesse I could promise you the sight of a better Citie. Yet enter in, and view it with your eyes: it hath alreadie entred your eares; God grant it may enter all our hearts. So your selues shall be renowned, our Peace secured, and the Lords great Name glorified, through <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was a custome in the Heathen world, after victorie to sing songs of Triumph.</p>
            <p>This fashion was also obserued among the Iewes; as we frequently find it. After a great conquest of the Philistins, the people of <hi>Israel</hi> sung; <hi>Saul hath

               <hi>The Lord is a man of warre, the Lord is his Name, &amp;c.</hi> Here <hi>Debora</hi> hauing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered <hi>Sisera,</hi> with his nine hundred Chariots of yron, shee sung this triumphant Song to the Lord; <hi>Praise ye the Lord for the auenging of Israel: Heare O ye Kings, I will sing to the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I haue chosen two straines of this <hi>Song</hi>; from which, as they shall teach me, so I purpose to teach you, to blesse the Lord that teacheth vs all. So the Psalmist; <hi>It is the Lord that teacheth our hands to warre, and our fingers to fight.</hi> This Lord giue me a tongue to sing it, you eares to heare it, and vs all hearts to embrace it.</p>
            <p>In all I obserue two generals, which expresse the nature of the two verses. There is great Affliction. There is great Affection.</p>
            <p>The Affliction; <hi>They chose new gods: then was warre in the gates,</hi> &amp;c. The Affection; <hi>My heart is toward the Gouernours of Israel, that offered themselues willingly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people: Blesse ye the Lord.</hi> In the Affliction, me thinkes I find three points of warre:

The exercises of warre steppe in here, to challenge their deserued praise. As with woodden wasters men learne to play at the sharpe: so practise in times of peace makes readie for the time of warre. It is good to be doing, that when Satan comes, <hi>inueniat occupatum</hi>; he may find thee honestly busied. The bird so long as she is vpon wing, flying in the aire, is safe from the fowler: but when the sits lasie on a tree, pruning her feathers, a little shot quickly fetcheth her downe.

Now there are two cautions obserueable in the iustnesse of warres. 1. that they be vndertaken <hi>iusta causa,</hi> vpon iust and warrantable cause. 2. that they be prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>bono animo,</hi> with an honest mind.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Cause</hi> must be iust. For

The cause doth either encourage or discourage the

cause is threefold, well comprised in that verse,

The destruction of their cities that reuolt from God to Idols, and the whole spoile, is for the Lord: it is the Lords battell, and the Lords spoile.

               <p n="2">2. The next caution, after a good ingression, is to be sure of a good prosecution. Wee say of the Chirurgion, that he should haue a Ladies hand, and a Lyons heart: but the Christian souldier should haue a Ladies heart, and a Lyons hand. I meane, though hee deale valiant blowes, yet not destroy without compassion. <hi>Fortitudo virtus bellica, man sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudo virtus bella.</hi> Though manfulnesse be a warlike vertue, yet gentlenesse is a Christian vertue. The sword should not bee bloudied, but in the heat of battell. And after victorie, when a souldier lookes on the dead bodies of his enemies, pittie should sit in his eyes rather then insultation.

Our Chronicles report, that when <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror landed at <hi>Pemsey</hi> neere to Hastings in Sussex, hee commanded all his ships to be sunke: that all hope of returning backe might be frustrate. You haue begun well; goe on, be perfect, be blessed.</p>
               <p>And remember alwayes the burden of this song, which euerie thing that hath breath must sing; <hi>Blesse ye the Lord.</hi> Those <hi>heauenly Souldiers</hi> that waited on the natiuitie of <hi>Iesus</hi> Christ,<note place="margin">Luke. 2.13.</note> sung this song; <hi>Glorie be to God on high.</hi> Vpon this Lord the <hi>heart</hi> of <hi>Debora,</hi> of Israel, of vs all, should be set.

               <p>To conclude with an obseruation of a reuerend Diuine: England was said to haue a warlike Saint, <hi>George</hi>; but <hi>Bellarmine</hi> snibbes <hi>Iacobus de Voragine</hi> for his leaden Legend of our English <hi>George.</hi> And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue inueighed against the authentike truth of that storie.

England of her Saint.
