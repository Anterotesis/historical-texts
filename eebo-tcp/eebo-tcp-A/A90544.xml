            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the ways of God from the ways of man;
were Gods ways like the ways of men, then a
poor ſoul hearing of ſuch rich booties to be had
in Chriſt, and at ſo low a rate, will be ready to
object and ſay, Oh ſir, the news is good, but I
fear too good to be true; what, to come to the
market and bring no money, and yet have the
commodities, this is ſtrange, men will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

therefore mark what God anſwers, <hi>My ways are
not as your ways, nor my thoughts as your thoughts,
ſaith the Lord.</hi> In your affairs it is not ſo, but in my
dealing it is ſo; the comfortable joy and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
theſe poor hungry ſouls ſhall go away with,
ver. 12. This, as I conceive, is the meaning of
the whole Chapter.</p>
            <p>The words in the Text are nothing elſe but a
precept and a reaſon.</p>
            <p>Theſe words note three things,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Inquiſition, <hi>ſeek</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The prayer,<hi> To call upon him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

your ways.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Inquiſition or Inquiring there are theſe
parts conſiderable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Barely an act, ſeek.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The circumſtance of time, implying there is
a time when he will be found, and a time when
he will not be found.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:119350:4"/>
3. The object, The Lord.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The ſeekers, <hi>Ye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt verſe there is ſome comfort for a
poor broken ſoul, and I cannot paſs it over; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let us a little conſider the invitation which
the words of the Text are a part. There is too
ſeldom proclaimation made with a O yes, Come
all poor and rich, great and ſmall, come without
money or moneys worth, bring only neceſſity
and deſire to buy; where you may ſee the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification
of the buyers; they are but mean men,
poor, hungry, thirſty ſouls that have nothing:
from whence take this Concluſion.</p>
            <p>Doct.<hi> That there is no unworthineſs in an humble
ſoul, or a poor broken hearted ſinner, can hinder the
work of his redemption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A poor ſoul he comes, and hath nothing to ſhew
what he hath done, no work to manifeſt, he can
ſcarce pray, he would fain have a Sermon, fain
have a Sacrament, fain have a Chriſt, and that
makes him long for him; ſuch a ſoul as this, is moſt
fit to receive Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe the miſeries of ſuch a poor
ſoul is the object of Gods mercy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſin is the object
of his Juſtice, but miſery is the object of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
what would become of a poor ſoul if this
were not a truth? what need a theif or a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer
cry out for pardon unleſs he were guilty of
the crimes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> Becauſe all eaſe and refreſhments flows
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:119350:5"/>
from the free mercy of God in Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Firſt,
There is a time when a ſinner is turned off from
God, but in mercy God turns to them again, and
turns them to himſelf; Ah poor wretch, in this
caſe you may ſay, I know God will abundantly
pardon, yea I have a promiſe, <hi>Rev. 12. 17. Who
ever is athirſt, come and drink of the water of life
freely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> No unworthineſs in a poor ſoul can
hinder a poor ſoul from getting Chriſt, becauſe
the greater the ſin, the greater honor God will
have in pardoning of your ſins, therefore hold
up your heads ye great ſinners, if your hearts
be broken God will have much glory by you,
by pardoning your ſins. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> pleaded
for <hi>Iſrael, Exod. 22. 11. If thou deſtroy them now,
what will become of the promiſes made to their
Fathers,</hi> nay ſaith he, <hi>what will the Egyptians ſay.</hi>
So ſaith a great ſinner, as <hi>David, If thou wilt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
this may hainous ſin, then ſhall many ſinners be
converted to thee;</hi> I will tell an old drunkard and
adulterer what thou haſt done for me.</p>
            <p>Object.<hi> It is a comfortable ſaying, ſaith a poor
ſoul, but I cannot finde it ſo in my ſelf, my ſins are
ſo great.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though all the ſins of the whole world
were upon thee, except the ſin of the Holy
Ghoſt, thou lying under them with a broken
heart, then I tell thee there is a pardon for thee;
a merciful God and a Saviour for thee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> True, I know God is merciful, but not
to ſuch a wretched ſoul as mine, you know not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119350:5"/>
me; Sir, I have been a prophane perſon, and
am ſo ſtill, and an Adulterer, and a Sabbath-breaker,
indeed I confeſs my heart hath been
a little humbled, but I am not worthy of
mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I tell thee, if thou wert worthy in thy
eſteem then there were no hope of mercy
for thee, for then thou wert in a poor
caſe; if in thy own eſteem thou wanteſt worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and if thou wilt ſtay till thou be worthy,
certainly thou wilt never finde Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Object.<hi> But if I could finde ſome lets and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments
taken away, there might be ſome hope of
comfort; but alas Sir, when I come to pray, I am
like a dead ſtock; and in preaching, and in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I have no life nor power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I pray you conſider, is it becauſe you
can pray well, or preach well that thou mayeſt
have Chriſt? or is it of Gods free mercy, and
that becauſe he delights in mercy? <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 17.
Never tell me of deadneſs in duties to keep thee
from Chriſt, but bring with thee an empty ſoul,
and my ſoul for thine, Chriſt will be found of thee
to thy comfort.</p>
            <p>Object.<hi> Sir, I am afraid it will not ſtand with
Gods juſtice, to pardon ſuch ſins as I have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
for if I were in his place, I ſhould not do
it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This God anſwers himſelf: Were you
in Gods place, you would not paſs by ſuch of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences;
but ſaith God, My ways are not as your
ways; I know a way how to be merciful to ſuch
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119350:6"/>
a ſoul in Chriſt, therefore let no unworthineſs
hinder thee from coming to Chriſt. Come we
then to the words of the Text, <hi>Seek ye the Lord,</hi>
and put all the parts together, the act, agent and
object, time, and caſt them up, and ſee what
the count will be: I think it will be thus much;</p>
            <p>Doctr. 2. <hi>That all thoſe that do ſeek for true
happineſs, excellent, ſolid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſound comfort,
muſt ſeek the Lord Jeſus to accompliſh their
ends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>See this made more plain by a place or two of
Scripture,<hi> John 3. 16. </hi>It is called the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Taken from the ground of contraries;
becauſe all other things beſides Chriſt, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they be, cannot give ſatisfaction to the ſoul,
they are all ſublunary, all things are ſhort but
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119350:6"/>
onely Chriſt: Take what you will, pitch upon
any thing, Honour, it paſſeth and comes to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
Riches takes the wings of the morning
and flies away; Beauty, there comes a diſeaſe,
and that is blaſted, whatſoever it be that man
can take pleaſure in; there is not a Goa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d under
Heaven, but it hath a worm in the root that will
eat it up, therefore look to your hearts: Many
people truſt in vain things; the old doting dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
he comes, and he hopes well of his eſtate and
condition; why? becauſe he comes to Church,
he was baptized, and he pays every man his own,
and he receives the Sacrament: Ah, the Lord
pity thee, thou yet falls ſhort of Chriſt. This is
as if a man come to ſome water ſide, and had
much buſineſs to go over, and all in poſt calls
for a boat, and he gets in, and he takes a nap in
the boat, and goes no farther, though his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s
be of great importance: This is the ſtate
of many, for want of going over the water,
they fall ſhort of Chriſt, and ſo neglect their
greateſt buſineſs; much to do they had, but they
never ſought Chriſt, there they reſt onely in the
boat of the Ordinance; we come to the Temple,
but we finde not Chriſt there. Again, thou haſt
many outward bleſſings, and thou ſayeſt, I have
a good ſtock, and thou reſteth there, well, but
there is a worm in that goard that will eat it out;
thou haſt a pretty childe, and thou much delights
in it, and thou ſeeſt not that it hath a deſperate
and curſed heart which it will bring to thee, and
as a worm will devour it. Again, ſome dote
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119350:7"/>
upon a wife, and beauty in a wife, and then
comes a diſeaſe and ſeiſeth upon her, then her
beauty is gone, and ſhe expoſed ſo much miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and death takes her away, and deprives thee
of all thy comfort thou tookeſt in her. Another
man, he ſhrewds himſelf under the King or State,
for there be but few but have ſome goard or
other; for will ſome ſay, and have ſaid, O the
Parliament will help us all: Some reſt in the
wiſdom and policy of our Stateſmen, but you
ſee there is a worm in that goard. Oh, but we
come to the Sacrament, and faſt and pray, and
that will help all, but a worm eats up that goard;
and you ſee our helps are almoſt blaſted, for ſay
ſome, we need not come ſo often tegether, and
keep Conventicles, as it is called, other matters
will ſerve the turn, we need not be ſo ſtrict, but
that worm will eat the goard. We truſted on
another ſort of people, that have another goard;
O, ſay they, we have the Goſpel, and that in a
flouriſhing manner, as none in the World have
the like; but alas, is there not a worm in that
goard? is not the Doctrine of Devils ſet up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us, Arminianiſm and Hereſie will ſoon
eat up your Goſpel that is now ready to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
with open mouth; If thou haſt all theſe
things, and no Chriſt, thou haſt yet an empty
ſoul, and unſatisfied for want of Chriſt, thou
art yet diſappointed of thy ends and hopes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. The ſecond Reaſon is, Becauſe that in
Chriſt there is all that a ſoul can long for, or heart
can deſire; therefore if you would have your
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119350:7"/>
hearts filled with joy, it muſt be drawn out of the
excellency and fulneſs in Chriſt; for there is in
him a balm to heal all our dumb and deaf, lame
and blinde diſeaſes; he is onely able to ſatisfie
a thirſty ſoul.</p>
            <p>There be three things that will not be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
without this all-ſufficient remedy:</p>
            <p>Firſt, the juſtice of God, it comes and claims
its right, this ſoul was forfeited to me, and ſo it
cryes out for condemnation againſt ſuch a ſoul,
becauſe it deſpiſed mercy when it was offered,
therefore juſtice claims his right. Here the poor
ſoul is loſt, no ſtay in the World, but if the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of juſtice be propounded, then the Lord
have mercy on thee, as we ſay of a condemned
man: Then in comes Chriſt and brings a pardon,
and he anſwers Gods juſtice, and ſays, this is an
humbled ſoul, it is mine, I have ſatisfied juſtice
for it, and thou haſt nothing to do with it; here
a poor ſoul were loſt for ever, if Chriſt had not
come in.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Devil comes, Oh, thou art
mine, for thou art forfeited to me in <hi>Adam,</hi> and
haſt been lead by me, and art a wretched ſinner,
and a damned creature, and therefore muſt ſhare
with me in torments for ever: Well, what will
help thee? now call all thy friends together, thy
wife and children, and ſee if they can help thee;
call all thy ſtate together, and offer it for a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
to the Devil, alas, it will all be nothing, all
thy ſilver, and gold, and friends, cannot redeem
thy ſoul from Hell; ah poor wretch, miſerable is thy
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119350:8"/>
caſe: Well, but in ſteps Chriſt, and ſaith, Avoid
Satan, this ſoul is mine, I have dyed for it;
time was when it was thine, but I have redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it out of thy hands; this is a poor broken
ſoul, and I have dyed for ſuch ſouls: Here is a
Saviour indeed in time of need.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Here is another thing to be ſatisfied,
and that is, the raging power of ſin. This ſoul
is mine, ſaith Sin, and I will dwell here, I will
make it a hypocritical heart, and a murderous
heart, and a proud and unclean heart, I will keep
it from mending; it hath been a proud heart,
and it ſhall be ſo ſtill, a Drunkard ſtill, a Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
and unclean ſtill, and no means ſhall do him
good. Then comes Chriſt; Nay, ſaith he, I have
redeemed this ſoul from the power of ſin, and
ſin ſhall have no more power over it: tell me if
any thing can help thee; for without Chriſt no
help, no ſalvation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> If this be ſo, That no thing can help us,
or do us good but Chriſt, and is all other things
eſteemed above him, and he onely neglected? I
cannot tell whether I ſhould weep or exclaim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
you. I anſwer, we have all cauſe to weep,
we ſpeak to a people that are dead, and almoſt
paſt feeling: Oh, it is a comfortable doctrine,
<hi>Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners:</hi> It is true,
but this belongs not to all. A man looſe his purſe,
and many jevvels in it (its found) every one would
have ſome, vvhen as they are all but one mans; ſo
in this caſe, vvhen vve offer Chriſt, every one is
ready to claim right in Chriſt, but he belongs but
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:119350:8"/>
to fevv. Novv therefore that vve may not be
deceived, let us mark this point is of ſingular uſe,
let us knovv to vvhom Chriſt belongs. There be
four ſorts of people in a miſerable condition, and
though Chriſt have caſt abroad ſo many excellent
jevvels, yet they are never a vvhit the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
I could vviſh you ſtood out by your ſelves,
you that are not for Chriſt; I vvould I did knovv
vvho vvere for Chriſt, and vvho for the Devil,
but ſuch of you as hear me, take your portion
vvhere it falls, for you beſt knovv your ovvn caſe:
Chriſt comes, and he offers healings, and vvould
fain do you good.</p>
            <p>The firſt of people, are ſuch as are ſick, and are
like a company of mad frantick men, they have
no ſenſe at all, their caſe is very deſperate: As
if a grave Phyſician comes in and offers them
good phyſick, intreats them to take it, or elſe
they are all dead men; yet theſe mad Patients
refuſe to take it, and kick out the Phyſician, and
throvvs the glaſſes againſt the vvalls, and vvill not
accept of his phyſick; ſo ſay I to a poor ſoul, now
for the Lords ſake take Chriſt, or elſe thou art a
damned wretch for ever. Oh, but ſaith one of
theſe mad Ruffins, we take Chriſt? get you out
of our Towns, what have we to do with Chriſt?
we cannot endure this earneſtneſs for Chriſt, keep
your Chriſt to your ſelf if you will, and ſee if
others will take him: O the Lord have mercy
on thee poor wretch: Let Miniſters ſay what
they will, and preach themſelves whorce, yet we
will drink, and ſwagger, and ſvvear; are not all
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:119350:9"/>
theſe the conditions of no ſmal fools? What, they
take on them the yoke of Chriſt, no, no, not they,
they vvill not: but alas for you that make ſo light
of Chriſt; yet many ſuch there be in the World.</p>
            <p>A ſecond ſort are ſuch as can be content to
hear of Chriſt, and to receive him a little; they
are like to a people of fine ſtomacks that can
take phyſick but it muſt be ſweetned, courſe
fare will not down with them; ſo theſe men
can be content to hear of Chriſt by this or that
man, and receive him ſo far as he ſuits with
them, but in all things they cannot indure him;
if he come to courſe fare, they cannot endure
this chear; of going to heaven and deliverance
from hell, this they can reliſh. I profeſs men
would have ſuch a Chriſt as I never heard of, he
muſt be a giving Chriſt, a Chriſt that ſtands with
their pride, hypocriſie and prophaneſs, or he is
no Chriſt for them; if they cannot have Chriſt and
their eaſe and gain, but muſt part with theſe, then
take Chriſt to your ſelves; rather then they will
part with theſe baſe luſts they will have no Chriſt;
if they may have him upon ſweet terms well and
good, if not, then farewel Chriſt. You ſhall have
one come to a Chaplain in a great mans houſe, and
he will ſay, Oh ſir beware that you ſpeak ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and fairly, take heed you touch not the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
by any means; you may have leave to
preach in forenoons, but in the afternoons let
them hunt and hauk and take their pleaſure;
but if you abridge them of their liberty, you
will ſcarce be heard any more; alas poor ſoul,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:119350:9"/>
never think to receive Chriſt, if thou canſt not
receive him but when he is a pleaſure and gain
unto thee. Such deal with Chriſt as Inn-Keepers
do with paſſengers ſo long as they have money,
and ſpend it willingly, they have what they will
call for, and you are welcome Gentlemen, but
if their money be ſpent, and no more gain got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by them, then let them be gone, there is no
more entertainment for them: So if you may
have eaſe, and pleaſure, and profit, and Chriſt
too, he is welcome; but if he will not, if he
will carry away any thing, though never ſo baſe
a luſt, yet we had rather part with Chriſt then
that which we may a great deal better ſpare. Oh
if they cannot have Chriſt but hazard their eſtates,
expoſe their bodies to impriſonment, theyle
have no Chriſt. Like the Soldiers they will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Chriſt to the Hall, but it was for his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
when they had got that then they let
Chriſt go; ſo many will follow Chriſt ſo long as
there is any thing to be gotten, but when they
muſt part with any thing they will go no further:
Its with theſe as with a childe, the childe having
cut its finger and ſeeing it bleed, it will cry and
bemoan the mother; but if the mother require
but an apple out of the childs hand, it turns the
back to the mother, and the mother may bleed to
death before the childe will give her ſo ſmall a
matter: And ſo likewiſe if Chriſt bring you
gain, it may be you will receive him, but if he
would have you part with prophaneſs, pride or a
baſe luſt, then Chriſt may bleed his heart out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they will look after him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:119350:10"/>
A third ſort of hearers that are to be reproved
are ſuch that will not meddle with Chriſt at all;
they take up a principle from the Country people
it is a dangerous thing to take phyſick, but let
nature work, and ſo far as nature will work they
are willing to go, and no further: They ſay
they are well-meaning men, that keep good
houſes, come to the Church, and pay every man
his own, and the like: Alas poor wretch that
crys out ſo for nature, and thinks it needleſs to
look any further for Chriſt, your condition is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
and deſperate.</p>
            <p>A fourth ſort of people here reproved are ſuch
as ſeem to have received Chriſt, but tbey diſgorge
their ſtomacks of what they have received; now
phyſick being received, and preſently coming up
again it doth no good at all; even ſo let Chriſt
come but to be a little coſtly unto us, and croſs us,
in any thing then up comes profeſſion, and Chriſt
and all muſt lie in the floar. Further to illuſtrate
the ſame; Say we do ſeek Chriſt; well, what time
didſt thou ever ſet apart to ſeek him in? how
many ſolemn days and hours haſt thou ſet apart
for that work? but art not thou ſuch a one that
doth not greatly care whether thou haſt Chriſt
yea or no, thou ſeeſt no great benefit by having
of him, nor no leſs if thou have him not, but if
Chriſt will have thee ſo it is, if not, well and
good: O poor wretch, that thou makeſt no more
reckoning of Chriſt: You ſee a man poſting to
the Phyſitian, riding as faſting as he can: Why,
whats the matter? O my wife or my childe lieth
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:119350:10"/>
at the point of death; but where is the man that
maketh ſo much haſte to the Miniſter for the
ſouls of his wife and children that are dead; nay
where is the Miniſter that took ſuch pains with
their people, and ſay, Oh neighbors look about
you, you are going to hell, you had need take
heed; now get a Saviour, take pains for him,
and that ſpeedily, or elſe you periſh; but Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
are ſo lazy and dead hearted that they have
no courage for Chriſt, but if the Miniſter did ſee
one ſtand at the Church door ready to chop off
his neck if he did not convert one at his Sermon,
O what zeal and earneſtneſs would be put forth!
You can tell every man of his bodily dangers,
and bid him look about, and tell him ſuch and
ſuch will deceive him, but his poor ſoul is going
poſt to Hell, and that moves you not; you preſs
no neceſſity on him then to take heed. A beggars
very neceſſity makes him to beg; but we are idle,
and will not pray, nor preach, nor hear a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
as we ought to do; why, what is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
we ſee not the neceſſity of Chriſt, and this
is the reaſon why we are ſo dull becauſe our
hearts are not poſſeſt with the need of the Lord
Chriſt; ſome ſay they can ſeek Chriſt, they can
weep, pray, and mourn, and yet walk looſly:
Well, as hard a matter as it is to find out an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite
from a true ſeeker of Chriſt, yet you may
know him, for though they agree in many gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
but in particulars there is a broad difference
between them; the one comes out of love to
Chriſt, the other out of love to himſelf: Look as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:119350:11"/>
a condemned man comes to the King for a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
he loves not to ſtay long in the Kings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
but ſo ſoon as he gets his pardon he is gone.
So an hypocrite comes to God in a ſpirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
and anguiſh of conſcience, and oh he would
fain have a pardon out of his own eaſie end, not any
love to God, having eaſe you ſhall not oft ſee him
deſire to come in Gods preſence. As I once ſaw a
drunken wretch when the torments of hell lay
upon his conſcience, I coming in, they told him
ſuch a one is coming to ſee you, methinks I hear
him ſtill cry, <hi>It is too late, it is too late; Oh ſir,
what ſhall I do?</hi> and when he had gotten a little
eaſe he turned to his filthineſs again, ſuch as thoſe
never knew what the love of God in Chriſt was:
Oh what a ſtir is there if an houſe be on fire,
though before all aſleep, then, oh ſave my wife
or my childe; ſo when the conſcience breaks out
into terrors, then oh help, help, but eaſe that and
you ſhall hear no more of him.</p>
            <p>Again, it may be an hypocrite prays, but either
he ruſhes into Gods preſence without any prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
or elſe paſſeth over the duty very ſlubber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
of any faſhion ſo it be done, or elſe after
the duty more proudly, ſaith, I have prayed and
preached, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but if he have not what he would
have, he leaves all. Like as Suiters coming to
a widow, ſome come for wealth, ſome for grace:
Now vvhen ſhe expreſſeth her eſtate, and ſaith,
<hi>My eſtate is not that it is taken for, it is but ſmall,
but if you like me as I am, ſo it is;</hi> then he that
comes for vvealth makes no further labour, but

               </gap>; ſo we hear of Chriſt that he bring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
heaven, and delivers from Hell, we would fain have
him, yet if there be no preſent gain to be had, we are
loth to take him as he is, if he comes once to be naked,
and poor, and bare Chriſt; then, what is this all the
gain, then farewel Chriſt? Ah poor wretch, the Lord

               </gap>ſe that have

a Saviour by theſe parts of ſeeking here ſet down.</p>
            <list>

            </list>
            <p n="1">1. As an action barely conſidered: There were
three things obſerved of the Heathen in every action,
Firſt, A ſerious deliberation. Secondly, A ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation.
And thirdly, A preſent execution. Try your
ſelves by theſe particulars. Firſt, Tell me I pray thee,
when didſt thou deliberate about Chriſt whether he
was worth the having? tell me, what time have you
taken to deliberate to think with your ſelves how to
come by him? tell me in what cloſet, in what field,
under what hedge haſt thou been caſting about this
point? you can caſt about how to pay your rents, but
tell me when didſt thou conſider thy ſoul was going to
Hell without Chriſt being a Saviour to thee?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Who is he that makes ſerious conſultation
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:119350:12"/>
how he may get Chriſt and ſalvation to his ſoul? and
who is he that goes to the Miniſters or neighbors,
and conſults how and by what means he may obtain
Chriſt: Phyſicians may have their Patients, Lawyers
their cliants come by twenties knocking at their door
before they be up, and good ſir follow my ſuit, I muſt
beg elſe; but your Miniſter may cool his heels in his
ſtudy all the week long before you come with ſuch a
queſtion, <hi>Alas fir, what ſhall I do? and cry out good
ſir help me to Chriſt or elſe I periſh:</hi> But alas poor wretch
thou haſt meat and drink, and a deal of worldly traſh,
and that contents thee, is this a ſeeking of Chriſt?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, And who puts this in execution, we ſtand
dreaming about it; it is good he ſaith, but we hope
all ſhall be well, and many other good thoughts; but
alas thou haſt a miſerable poor ſoul; ſo that take it as
an act we may in ſome meaſure ſee whether we ſeek
Chriſt or not.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider this as it is a Chriſtian and good action,
three things herein very neceſſary to be conſidered. 1.
A clear ſight or knowledge of the thing we go about.
2. A ſincere affection to it. 3. Quickneſs in diſpatch of
it. 1. Conſider the thing we go about is weighty,
and of great importance; to find Chriſt pardoning ſin,
and working our redemption; now there muſt be a
true knowledge of this, elſe there can be no true ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
Herein are reproved all ignorant Maſters and
Miniſters. I met lately with a man of eighty years of
age ſave one, I asked him how many Gods there were,
he could not tell. It is a pittiful caſe; one day their
children will cry out, <hi>Oh murdering parents, you might
have made me better had you catechiſed me, I had never
come to theſe flames; Oh curſed Father and Mother it is
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:119350:12"/>
you that ſent me to hell; I might have had a Saviour had
it not been for you for ought I know.</hi> Shall the Lord give
you children and will you give them to the Devil?
Your ſervants they moil and toil for you, and you ſend
them to hell for their labour; well they will one day
curſe you and ſay, <hi>I had not been here but for my bloody
Maſter;</hi> Oh the Lord help you to think of this better.
How good a courſe is it for a Miniſter to quarter out
his Pariſh, and ſet himſelf and make it his daily work
to go to four or ſix houſes in the afternoon, and ſee
how it ſtands with their families, and deal plainly
with the poor ſouls of his people, you will finde much
good follow this, you will deliver many ſouls from
hell, and meet with them you never met withal: Ah
the Lord help us, we want a ſpirit of love to their poor
ſouls. What is the reaſon ſo many make haſte to hell?
it is through ignorance and want of better inſtruction;
many old doting fools are ready to ſay of theſe times,
<hi>Never was good world ſince there was ſo much preaching.</hi>
But alas it is becauſe they know no better of Chriſt;
but alas for thee, poor ignorant old man or young
man who ever thou art, look to it, thou art going to
hell, if no knowledge of Chriſt, there is no love to
him. Now let me intreat you to buy orthodox books,
make ſtore of them, get Bibles into your houſes, get
your Miniſter to catechiſe you, and to inſtruct you, to
have a care of your poor ſouls. And thus much let me
ſay to Miniſters, If ever you would ſpend your ſelves
or be ſpent for the ſouls of your people: Now is the
time, the <hi>Palatinate</hi> and other Countries are ſhaken
already, and <hi>England</hi> begins to ſhake faſt, and it is
likely it cannot hold out, therefore labour as much as
you can to bring them to Chriſt; for Popery gets head
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:119350:13"/>
and grows faſt, therefore never more need.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To ſeek Chriſt argues ſome ſincere affection af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Chriſt. <hi>Judas</hi> had knowledge, but for want of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
he died in a halter. Would you think your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
dealt well with you, if you ſend him to look
your loſt cattel, and he goeth ſtep by ſtep, and ſpend
half the day before he get to the place where he
ſhould look them. Should not Miniſters now come
and lift up their voyces, and cry <hi>Oh get Chriſt you pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
elſe?</hi> yet ſee how undiſpoſed we go about it, and
we will take our own time; now here wants affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But finally, for quickneſs in diſpatch of this action,
it is too much ſeen what long delays, and excuſes, and
pretences we have, it is ſoon enough we hope, ſo
that any thing will hinder that work.</p>
            <p>Come we to the third rule of this ſeeking, and ſo
to the metaphor, which ſtands in three things:</p>
            <p>Firſt, It requires a good light: we have cauſe of
great thankfulneſs for the light we enjoy, God hath
been merciful to this Nation, light inſtead of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
many a poor ſoul hath had light, when moſt of
the Kingdom have been in darkneſs: Now if God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to ſave thee, he will ſend thee a light where
thou dwelleſt, or elſe remove thee to a light in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily;
if God intend to ſave thee, he will ſend a light,
ſome good husband, or wife, or childe, or ſervant:
If you would have Chriſt, you muſt have light, and
walk in the light while you have it; for it darkens
apace, and our Sun is decliming: Now for the Lords
ſake look about you; if ever you had need to get
Chriſt, and we to preach Chriſt, now is the time, for
it is almoſt paſt time already, and yet we believe it
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:119350:13"/>
not, ſee it not. If thou ſayeſt thou haſt Chriſt, I ask
thee how thou cameſt by him; either thou haſt Chriſt
by the Word, or elſe thou haſt him not at all: This
may be proclaimed to all the World, <hi>If any man come
to Chriſt, it muſt be by the light of the Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, In a particular action there is required a
good eye: A blinde man cannot tell how to do any
thing. Now this eye is the eye of Faith; for no faith,
no Saviour, no Chriſt: Now it is this faith that lays
hold on a particular promiſe, and gets Chriſt: It fares
with faith pitched on a particular promiſe, as it is with
a childe; a father dyes, and leaves ſix children, and
in his Will he bequeaths to every one of his children
a portion: When the Will comes to be read, <hi>Item,
I give to my eldeſt ſon</hi> John <hi>ſo much Land,</hi> that is mine,
ſaith he: <hi>I give to my daughter</hi> Elizabeth <hi>ſo much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi>
that is mine, ſaith ſhe: So in this caſe, when
Gods Will is read, that is his Word, wherein his lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
is bequeathed to his children, and there is read,
<hi>Whoſoever is a thirſt, let him believe, and here is water
of life for him:</hi> Oh, ſaith the thirſty ſoul, that is mine:
And ſo when he hears, <hi>That whoever believes in Chriſt,
ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life:</hi> Such a ſoul as
believes in Chriſt, he takes and receives Chriſt to the
uſe and benefit of his ſoul, as act and deed; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he claims his right in everlaſting life: Such a ſoul
will adventure any thing for Chriſt. Oh, ſaith ſome
to ſuch a ſoul, what need you be ſo earneſt in runing
to Sermons? it was a better world when there was
leſs. Ah poor hearts, you will not come together
to ſeek; well, when Gods judgements fall heavy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you, then it will drive you together pell mell; then,
O good Sir help, but help will not be found. And thus
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:119350:14"/>
much let me ſay to Chriſtians, learn to prize the good
eye, there is many curious tunicles in this eye: What
faith to procure me a Saviour? O preſerve it.</p>
            <p>Three things hurt the bodily eye, 1. Looking upon
water. 2. Wind. 3. Duſt. The like to theſe hurt the
ſpiritual eye; if you take water for the fleeting luſts,
profits, and pleaſures of this life, looking much on
theſe hurt the eye of faith; as <hi>David</hi> looked on <hi>Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheba,</hi>
ſhe was a pearl wind. Secondly, that is pride
that puffs a man up, now faith and a proud heart can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſtand together, theſe cannot agree; gifts received
puffs a man up, and much hurt a mans faith: A ſhip
is caſt away ſometimes by the ſame wind that brings
him into the Harbour; there is an evil fountain in
mens ſtudies, and that is covetouſneſs, when men
preach for hire and gain; when they are afraid to
truſt God with their wives and children, this hurts
faith: Take heed you ſtand not over long, leſt you
loſe the benevolence of ſuch a one; and in proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
a man had need have a good eye, to ſee through ſo
much thick clay.</p>
            <p>There be three objects whom we muſt ſeek; and
that is the Lord, he muſt be ſought in three parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars:
1. Nothing before him. 2. Nothing beſides
him. 3. Nothing with him. Thus doth a good ſoul
ſeek Chriſt; every one can ſay they ſeek Chriſt, but
when I pray you? One day, ſaith the Worldling, but
I would have ſome thing elſe firſt. Saith the young
man, it is time enough yet, I will take ſome pleaſure,
and when I can do little elſe, I will ſeek Chriſt. Oh,
ſaith the old doting fool, when I married all my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
then will I ſeek Chriſt; alas, for thee it ſeems
Chriſt muſt be laſt ſought, as if he were leaſt worth:
a lamentable condition.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:119350:14"/>
5. Some rules from Scripture, whereby a man may
know whether he have <hi>Chriſt</hi> or not, or whether he
ſeek him: You muſt ſeek him after his own manner
preſcribed in his Word; you muſt not pick and chuſe
with God, take and leave as you liſt: You would
ſeek <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but it muſt be on your own terms, you are
loath to be at coſt: But to prevent this, take four or
or five rules in ſeeking <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Church</hi> muſt be ſought, as the Spouſe in the
<hi>Canticles</hi> ſought him, <hi>Cant. 5. 8. I charge you if you ſee
my beloved, tell him I am ſick of love:</hi> If a man ſhould
meet one in ſuch a condition for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> you would
think him almoſt mad; but a poor ſoul muſt be thus
raviſhed with the love of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> A Lawyer poſting
up to the Term, O if I loſe my fees, I beg: Or if a
poor woman have many children, and all of them live
upon her husbands hand labour, alas, if he be ſlain in
the way, then I am undone: Thus muſt we ſeek <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
without him we have nothing, ſuch a ſoul is never at
reſt, till he finde <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Firſt, we muſt ſeek <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as
a thirſty man would ſeek for drink; will you agree to
this, will you promiſe to ſeek <hi>Chriſt</hi> thus. A man
that is ready to periſh for want of drink, will part
with any thing for drink: He comes into a room, and
ſpies a cup of drink, he ſaith, O good Sir, take my
clothes off my back, or any thing, ſo I may have but
a cup of drink: So a poor ſoul comes to ſeek <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
O that I might have but a <hi>Chriſt,</hi> give me but a <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
and take what you will from me; then away with
this faſhion, or that garment, ſo I may have but a
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> away with all this dung and droſs; ſo I may
have <hi>Chriſt,</hi> take <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> too, or any
thing, ſo I may have but a <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for it is <hi>Chriſt</hi> I
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:119350:15"/>
want, onely <hi>Chriſt,</hi> onely <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſaith the poor ſoul.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A thirſty man will be ſatisfied with nothing but
drink; let a man come and offer him gold, and ſilver,
and precious ſtones, alas, this ſatisfies him not, though
you ſtop his mouth full; but good Sir, give me a little
drink, or elſe I periſh; for ſaith a poor ſoul, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
do you offer me gold, the World, and all theſe
outward things, its <hi>Chriſt</hi> I want to ſave me: O what
hard ſhift will a man make for drink in extremity; As
once I heard of three men that went a fiſhing from
the Summer Iſlands in a boat, and being from the
Land by a ſtorm, and continued at Sea eight or nine
days, at length one dyed, and the other threw him
over board; a ſecond dyed, and then the third takes
up the dead and unbowels him, and ſets open his body
to catch rain water; in ſo doing, he lived with water
and blood, and ſo came to Land: Thus a poor thirſty
ſoul vvill make hard ſhift for <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. We muſt ſeek <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as a man vvould dig for
treaſure, Wife and children, all muſt dig: Oh it vvill
enrich me, vve muſt take all pains to get <hi>Chriſt,</hi> vvhy
vvhat is the matter? What? vvhy he vvill ſave me.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Chriſt</hi> muſt be ſought, as a condemned man
vvould ſeek for pardon. I have ſeen ſtout Gallants,
being condemned, deſire to fight vvith three or four,
and be ſlain; rather dye any death, then a Dogs death:
O Sir, is there no hope of pardon for me? O that I
had but a day more. I have been vvith ſome in that
caſe, and they have greatly complained of three things,
1. They vvould take no counſel. 2. They lived in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faning
the Sabbath. 3. They have loſt their time. I
have lived 20, 30, 40 years, but my time is novv gone
over; bring vvhat you vvill to a man in this caſe, bring
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:119350:15"/>
a ſilken, ſattin ſhute, and tell him he may have wife
worth ſo much by the year, alas, what do you mock
me? this will do me no good: I am going to dye, if
you bring me a pardon, I will ſay ſomething to it. So
I may tell you, the great day is coming, when fire and
faggot is about thine ears, a <hi>Chriſt</hi> will then be worth
ſomething: Thou that haſt not <hi>Chriſt,</hi> tell me what
thou wouldſt do, if thou waſt to dye this night; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Chriſt</hi> thou art a condemned man; without <hi>Chriſt</hi>
what will become of thy poor ſoul? if thou haſt not a
Saviour, Hell is fit to receive thee, the Devil fit to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thee thither; and then a <hi>Chriſt</hi> to ſtep in and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
thee, were worth thouſands: <hi>Now ſeek the Lord
while he may be found.</hi> Now let me proclaim to you,
in the name of the Lord, That if there be any man in
this congregation that doth mean and intend to ſeek
<hi>Chriſt</hi> from this day forward, well and good; but if
you purpoſe to be drunkards and ſwearers ſtill, and
Sabbath-breakers ſtill, and reſolve to live ſo, let me
entreat you to depart out of the congregatien, let me
ſee it, I have nothing to do with you: I pray you once
again, let me ſee it, who are for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and who are
not: Well, why do you not ſtir? you do not all mean
as you make a ſhew of: What, will you all take <hi>Chriſt</hi>
on this condition, to be drunk no more, to ſwear no
more, to break the Sabbath no more? Well, I ſee
none of you ſtir, if this be in truth, you are able to
ſave a whole Nation; but if it be not in truth, you are
horrible hypocrites before God: Therefore look to
your hearts; now therefore take notice of the day of
this moneth, this preſent <hi>Thurſday,</hi> that you have made
a covenant with God to forſake all your poophane
courſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which at your perils break not. I deſire again
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:119350:16"/>
to know your minde, Whether you are reſolved on
this or no. I tell you, its no jeſting with God; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
what you do, we are making or receiving a
covenant, do not gratifie vice with your preſence, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
on this condition, Well, I ſee none ſtir, therefore
fore this covenant is ratified; therefore look to it, for
I tell you, I my ſelf at the laſt will witneſs againſt you,
that on ſuch a day, and in ſuch a houſe, you made a
covenant with God to be drunkards no more, nor
ſwearers no more, &amp;c. therefore take notice what you
have done.</p>
            <p>Ob.<hi> But ſome may ſay, It is ſtrange Miniſters ſhould
ſpeak thus, after ſuch a manner: What, is it poſſible to
have Chriſt, and keep my pleaſe, my pride and hypocriſie
ſtill, this is marvellous ſtrange.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I tell thee thou muſt forgo all, and vvhat hath
been paſt, and novv to redeem out of the Devils hands,
and take this day to begin; delay no longer, its almoſt
paſt time already. Were it not a folly for a Mariner to
have his ſhip girt, rigged, and victualled, and he lie
ſleeping all the Summer, till proviſion be ſpent, and
Winter ſtorms and rumours, and Worms eat holes in
the ſhip, and then go out: So doſt thou think its a
meet time to ſeek the Lord, vvhen thy body is rotten
and decayed; no, no, the Lord vvill not alvvays be
found; nay, it is very likely the Lord vvill not give
thee a heart to ſeek him, then vvill you ſleep in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
vvhen the harveſt is paſt. Will any man vvhen
there is catching Weather, bid his ſervants reſt? nay,
vvill he not rather ſay, get you all into the field, and
vvork hard, for you ſee vvhat catching Weather vve
have; get all the Workmen you can, and vvork
hard, though you reſt for it aftervvards, that you may
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:119350:16"/>
have the harveſt in the barns before the ſtorms come.
Why truly brethren, theſe are catching times as ever
men lived in; how ſoon the ſtorms may fall, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell, but I believe very ſuddenly: I would I might
be a <hi>Falſe Prophet,</hi> but I am ſure there are dark clouds
abroad; therefore now ſet to work, and live no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in ignorance. I once lived in a place, where they
had not a Sermon once in ten or twelve years ſpace;
What a company of non-reſidents are there, that live
a hundred miles off their flock, that ſcarce ſee them
once in a year? and when they do come, it is with
ſuch tuff-taffity phraiſes of Hebrew, Greek and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
that ſcarce any one underſtands them, but need
bring Greek and Latine ears with them: And theſe I
cannot tell what better to compare to, then a great
pair of Braſs Andirons; a compariſon though homely,
yet ſometimes uſed by me: You know theſe Braſs
Andirons ſtand for ſhew, and not for uſe, and the little
creepers that ſtand by them muſt hold up the fire: So
theſe men make a ſhew, as if all were done by them,
when one Sermon in the year, and quarter, will ſerve
turn; as in <hi>Wales,</hi> which is moſt woful, you may have
one ride and ſerve four or five Pariſhes, and read a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Starvis, or Service, as they call it. O the Lord
help you, time will come when the Lord will not be
found; How is he found of the <hi>Palatinate?</hi> One day
you will ſay, I had ſweet times, I had a good Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
but the time is gone. Well, I tell you, it is now
high time, it is good making hay while the Sun ſhine;
the times are marvellous catching, therefore be not
afraid of coming together, but do any thing for Chriſt,
he will ſtand you inſtead. A poor man threſheth, and
takes great pains; what is the matter? it is to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:119350:17"/>
my poor family: But who are ye that ſeek
Chriſt, to get him into your houſes? Stand not
hawking with God, as a Woman is loth to part with
her old gold to buy commodities; why? it was a
token of an old Friend; for we would have Chriſt,
but we are loth to part with the Devils tokens, the
World, and our Luſts: Take heed thou haſt not the
Devil, and Hell and all, one day for it.</p>
