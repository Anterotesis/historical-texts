         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of a sicke and languishing
<hi>Common-Wealth,</hi> then the businesse
of this day; good <hi>God,</hi> how have
the guilty these late yeares beene
punished, when the Judges themselves have been
such Delinquents. 'Tis no marvell that an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular,
extravagant, arbitrary power, like a
Torrent, hath broke in upon us, when our
bankes, and our Bulworks, the Lawes, were
in the Custody of such persons. Men who
had lost their Innocence could not preserve their
courage, nor could we looke that they who had
so visibly undone us, themselves should have the
vertue or credit to rescue us from the oppression
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96659:3"/>
of other men, 'twas once said by one, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
spoke excellently, that the twelve <hi>Iudges
were like the 12. Lyons under the Throne of Solomen;</hi>
under the Throne in <hi>obedience,</hi> but yet <hi>Lyons:</hi>
your Lordships shall this day heare of six, who
be they what they will be else) were no <hi>Lyons:</hi>
who upon vulgar feares delivered up the pretious
Forts they were trusted with, almost without as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault,
and in a tame, easie, trance of flattery
and servitude, lost and forfeited (shamefully for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited)
that reputation, awe and reverence,
which the Wisedome, Courage, and Gravity
of their Venerable Predecessors, had contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and fastned to the places they now hold, and
even rendred that study and Profession, which in
all Ages hath been, and I hope now shall bee of
an Honourable estimation, so contemptible and
vile, that had not this blessed day come, all men
would have had that quarrell to the Law it selfe,
which <hi>Marius</hi> had to the Greeke tongue, who
thought it a mockery to learne that Language,
the Masters whereof lived in bondage under o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
And I appeale to these unhappie Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
themselves, with what a strange negligence,
skorne and indignation, the faces of all men, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of the meanest have beene directed towards
them, since to call it no worse) that fatall declen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of their understandings in those Judgements,
of which they stand here charged before your
Lordships: But (my Lords) the worke of this
day is the greatest instance of a growing; and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96659:3"/>
thriving <hi>Common-wealth</hi> too: and is as the dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a faire and lasting day of happinesse to this
Kingdome, 'tis in your Lordships power, (and I
am sure tis in your Lordships will) to restore the
dejected broken people of this Island, to their
former joy and securitie, the successors of these
men to their old priviledge and veneration, &amp;
<hi>sepultas propè leges revocare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords,</hi> the Iniquity of <hi>Iudges</hi> is infectious,
and their craftiest combination to leave as few
innocent as may be, your Lordships have heard of
the justice of two of the greatest Courts of <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi>
and that you may know how little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
the other of his Majesties Revenue, the
Court of <hi>Exchequer,</hi> hath of its fellowes in the
administration of right. I am commanded by the
House of <hi>Commons</hi> to present to your Lordships
three severall charges, against three Judges
of that Court, my Lord chiefe Baron <hi>Damport,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Barron Trevor,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Barron Weston,</hi> your
Lordships will please to heare them read.</p>
            <p>Your Lord ships observe, that the great reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
in <hi>Ship-money,</hi> was a Crime of so prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a nature, that it could not be easily swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and digested by the Consciences, even of
these men, but as they who are to wrastle or run
a race, by degrees prepare themselves by dyet,
and lesser assayes for the maine exercise, so these
<hi>Iudges</hi> enter themselves and harden their hearts
by more particular trespasses upon the Law: by
impositions and taxes upon the Merchant in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96659:4"/>
Trade, by burdens and pressures upon the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
in Knighthood, before they could arrive at
that universall destruction, of the Kingdome by
<hi>Ship-money;</hi> which promised reward and securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for all their former services, by doing the
worke of a <hi>Parliament</hi> to his Majesty in supplies,
and seemed to delude justice, in leaving none to
judge them, by making the whole Kingdome
party to their oppression.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My. Lords,</hi> of this Crime these three <hi>Iudges</hi>
seeme to be at least equally guilty, for however
one of them <hi>my Lord Chiefe Barron,</hi> is not
charged with that Judgement, in the <hi>Exchequer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Chamber</hi>
against Mr. <hi>Hampden,</hi> and how hee fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in making his conclusion from his owne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses,
he onely can informe you. Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
see how quickly he repented, that that mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe
was done without him there, by his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
his Brethren in his circuit, and as he said
of the vilest kinde of flatterers, <hi>Crudelissimo ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitutis
genere, quod intra se abominabantur, palam
laudabant:</hi> hee made all possible hast to redeeme
himselfe from that imputation of <hi>Iustice,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
publiquely in the face of the Country,
that it was adjudged by all the <hi>Iudges</hi> of <hi>England,</hi>
that <hi>Ship money</hi> was due to the King, though I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
he will be now glad to be thought none of
those Judges, and what others did he well knew,
And thereupon imprison'd a poore man for doing
that, which if <hi>Ship-money</hi> had beene due to his
Majesty by <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> had beene lawfull for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96659:4"/>
him to have done; of the Resolutions and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it selfe I am not to speak, your Lord-ships
have passed your noble Judgement.</p>
            <p>My Lords, the first charge in order is, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous
Decree against Mr. <hi>Rolles</hi> and others,
and in truth whatsoever glosse they put upon it,
is no other then a plaine grant of the Subsidy of
<hi>Tunnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage</hi> to his Majesty upon all
Merchandize; after their goods seised for <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payment</hi>
of that pretended duty, the Proprietors
brought <hi>Replevins</hi> (which is the naturall and <hi>genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine</hi>
remedy, appointed by Law in case of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
and grounded upon property) the Court-awards
an injunction to stay these <hi>Replevins,</hi> the
goods were in the Kings possession, and no <hi>Reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>
would lye against the King: truly (my Lords)
the Injustice here is not so scandalous, as the
fraud; we all know a <hi>Replevin</hi> (as no other suite)
lyes against the King, if the goods be in his owne
hands, in his Bedchamber, but to call a seizure
by the Farmours (of whose interest this Court
will not deny the notice, and if his Majesty had
any right, they well knew he had transferred it
to these men) or the Ware-houses of the Custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
the Kings possession, to defeate the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of his proper remedy, was the boldest piece
of <hi>Sophistry</hi> we have met with in a Court of Law:
Pardon me if I am transported: The <hi>Civilians</hi>

                  </gap>,
non cum pupillum spoliat:</hi> The Office of Judges is
to preserve and give remedy for right, here they
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96659:5"/>
found a right, a knowne and questionable right,
yet instead of assisting tooke away the remedy, to
preserve that right, what shall we call these <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es?</hi>
my Lords, in this Argument I am not willing
to say much; tis enough that your Lord-ships
know Tunnage and Poundage is not a duty to
the Crowne; but a Subsidie, and so granted in
<hi>Subsidium,</hi> sometimes <hi>pro una vice tantum,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
for yeares, and then ceased when the time
did expire, that when it was first granted for life,
it was with this clause: <hi>Ita quod non trahatur in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplum
futuris Regibus,</hi> but tis abundantly enough
that his sacred Majesty cannot bee tainted with
the advices and judgements of these men, but
lookes on this duty singly as the meere affection
and bountie of his Subjects, the which no doubt
he shall never want.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords,</hi> the next charge is concerning <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Vassalls</hi> goods are seised for not pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Impost, which hee conceived to bee against
Law, he is imprisoned, and judgement given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, without suffering him to bee heard,
upon the point of right, because that had beene
heretofore iudged in <hi>Bates</hi>'s Case: And yet
these very Judges have not thought themselves so
bound up by former judgements, but that since
this time they have argued a case upon the same
point, which was adjudged in <hi>Hillary Terme</hi> in
the 15. <hi>Eliz.</hi> and contirmed after by all the <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi>
of <hi>England</hi> in a Writ of Errour, in the 21.
yeare of that Queenes reigne, tis <hi>Walsinghams</hi> Case,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96659:5"/>
however the same modesty seized them againe
in the case of a Noble <hi>Lord,</hi> not now present:
Whether the King without assent of <hi>Parliament,</hi>
may set impositions upon the Wares, and goods
of Merchants, is no new question; it hath been
more then once debated in <hi>Parliament,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
whilst it was a question, was fittest for a
<hi>Parliament:</hi> I will not trouble your <hi>Lordships</hi>
long: 'tis now resolved, and nothing new can
be said in this Argument, though I may have
leave to say, if the King can by his Letters
Parents create such a right to himselfe, and by a
legall course recover that right under such a Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
such Letters Patents are in no degree inferior
to an Act of <hi>Parliament:</hi> to reconcile such a power
in the Prince, and the property of the Subject,
that the one must not be destructive to the other,
will require a much greater<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a subtler under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
then I pretend to; but my <hi>Lords</hi> I doe
not thinke the judgement in this point to
be so great a crime in these <hi>Iudges,</hi> as that they
presumed to judge at all; the matter had beene
long debated in <hi>Parliament</hi> undetermined, and
therefore not within the Conusance of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
Court, had it not beene true that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tescue

               <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and all the other Statutes to that
purpose, bee not cleere in the point, they might
easily have apprehended so much weight, so
much difficulty in the question, (especially since
in all our Law bookes, not so much as the
word imposition is found, untill the case in my
Lord <hi>Dyer</hi> of 1. <hi>Eliz. (fol. 163.)</hi> that they might
very well have suspected themselves to bee no
competent <hi>Iudges</hi> for that determination, and
I hope by the experience of this <hi>Parliament</hi> the
<hi>Iudges,</hi> will recover that ancient modesty, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
that some cases may fall out that may
not be properly within their jurisdiction in the
9. yeare of <hi>Eliz:</hi> (tis in the <hi>Parliament Rolls</hi>)
It being found by an office after the death of <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
de Clare</hi> Earle of <hi>Gloster,</hi> that his sisters were
his Heyres, <hi>nist Comitissa Glocestriae esset pregnans,</hi>
the question was, whether the King might
grant the Heyres their Livery in <hi>preiudicium im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnaturae:</hi>
This was conceived <hi>negotium novum,
&amp; difficile,</hi> and the King having commanded the
<hi>Chancellour</hi> and <hi>Iudges</hi> to deliver their opinions
in writing, they returned, <hi>quod non audebant
dictum negotium definire, nec Domino Regi consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lere
sine assensu magnatum, propter raritatem &amp; dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultatem:</hi>
whereupon day was given to the
parties, <hi>adproximum Parliamentum.</hi> And your
Lordships well know the speciall care that is
taken by the Statute of 14. <hi>Ed. 3. cap. 5.</hi> that such
matters as for the difficulty are not fit for the
<hi>Iudges,</hi> or through eminent delay are not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96659:6"/>
by the <hi>Iudges,</hi> shall be determined in
<hi>Parliament.</hi> Not such matters as the parties
concerned, had rather venture upon your
Lordships judgements, then upon the Rules,
and proceedings of the Law (<hi>God</hi> knowes what
mischiefe and confusion may fall out upon that
admission) there must be such difficulty, such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay,
before that Statute meant your Lordships
lustice should be concerned in the resolution, I
wish these Gentlemen had thought this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
a matter of that difficulty as had been fit for
such a delay.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords,</hi> we come next to the charge, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Knighthood. Mr. <hi>Maleverer</hi> appeares
upon the processe of that Court, pleads and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
to his fine, <hi>ponit se in gratiam curiae:</hi> The
<hi>Barons</hi> refuse to impose any fine, they had no
power to doe that, he must treate with certaine
Commissioners appointed for that purpose, and
compound with them: your Lordships have not
met in the same men such contradictions of
crymes, who would suspect the same men in one
charge, to have the mettle to usurp the power,
and exercise the jurisdiction of the highest
Court, the Court of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and presently
to want the Spirit to doe that which was so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained,
and peculiar to their places to have
done, as that none else could doe it? they had
no power to fyne as if the sole busines of sworn
<hi>Iudges</hi> in a Court of Law, were to summon and
call men thither, and then to send them on er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rands
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96659:7"/>
to other Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>missioners for Iustice: 'tis true
the Commissioners of 1. <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. to <hi>Tiptosse</hi> and
<hi>Berk,</hi> and since to others, were and have been to
compound with those, who desired to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound,
not otherwise, they had no power to
compell any, to fine any; that trust by the Law,
was and is onely in the <hi>Iudges:</hi> so that if this
duty were aright to his Majesty, and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
lyable refuse to compound, for ought these
<hi>Iudges</hi> can doe, the King must loose this duty,
they can impose no fyne, onely they have found
a trick, which they call the course of the Court;
to make his Majesty a saver: appeare while you
will, plead what your will, submit to the mercy
of the Court, Issues shall goe on still as if you
did neither, till you have done somewhat that
Court will not order you to doe, nor is bound
to take notice of when you have done: your
Lordships will help us out of this Circle? And
that you may see how incapable they are of any
excuse in this point, the very <hi>Mittimus</hi> out of
the <hi>Chancery</hi> gives them expresse command a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
other things, <hi>ut fines omnium illorum qui iuxta

worth your Lordships observation, this misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
commonly attends (and may it ever) those
absolute, disused rights, that be the thing in it
selfe in a degree lawfull, the advisers, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of it so faile in the execution, that as it
usually proves as grievous to the Subiect, so by
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96659:7"/>
some circumstances it proves as penall to the
Instruments, as if it were in the very nature of
the thing against all the Lawes of government.</p>
            <p>I have wearied your Lordships: you see in
what a dresse of injustice, subtilty and oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I am very unwillingly compelled to present
these <hi>Iudges</hi> to you: if they appeare to your
Lordships under any other character of known
and confessed learning in the whole course of
their lives, how farre that will aggravate their
fault your Lordships must onely judge; if under
the excuse of ignorance, or not much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in the duty of their places, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
will easily conclude, what infinite mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe,
of which your Lordships have no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
in formation, the Subjects of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
have suffered in their lives, in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
under such ignorance, and such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption:
if under the reputation of prudence
and integrity in all cases, except these present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to your Lordships; your Lordships will be at
least of the same opinion that he of <hi>Lacedemon</hi>
was of the <hi>Athenians</hi> if they carried themselves
well, when time was, and now ill; they deserve
a double punishment: because they are not good,
as they were; and because they are evill, as they
were not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords,</hi> if the excellent, envied constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Kingdome, hath beene of late dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered,
your Lordships see the causes: if the
sweet harmony betweene the Kings protection,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96659:8"/>
and the Subjects obedience, hath unluckily suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
interruption, if the royall Iustice, and
Honour of the best of Kings hath beene mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by his people, if the duty and affection of
the most faithfull and loyall Nation, hath been
suspected by their gracious Soveraigne, if by
these misrepresentations, and these misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings,
the King and People have beene
robbed of the delight and comfort of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the blessed peace of this Island beene
shaken and frighted into Tumults, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion,
into the poverty, though not into the
rage of Warre, as a people prepared for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
and desolation: these are the men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively
or passively, by doing or not doing, have
brought this upon us: <hi>Misera servitus falsa pax

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords,</hi> I am commanded by the House of
<hi>Commons,</hi> to desire your Lordships, that these
three <hi>Iudges</hi> may be speedily required to make
their answeres to these Impeachments: and
that such further proceedings may bee had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, as the course and Iustice of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
