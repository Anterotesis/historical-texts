         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I Need not Recommend this small Manual to the World, since it hears the Name of so Learned an Author, whose Works have given sufficient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of his Worth and Excellency, and will to his last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Honour be venerated in all Ages.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:64934:3"/>This Pattern of Piety hath lay concealed for many years, and was at first Dedicated to the service of an honourable Lady, in whose Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet it hath been choicely kept as one of her precious Iewels; it was never design'd for the Press, by reason the Reverend Authors Modesty should not be offended.</p>
                  <p>Upon her Bed of Mortality, she was pleased to honour me so far, as to commit it to my Care, with a particular Charge not to publish it; but one of her Mercenary Servants, by their vigilant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry, had Plagiary-like, got a Transcript, and since this Pious and Honourable Persons Decease, did design it for the Press, being unwilling so much Injustice should be acted against so Worthy a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,

I was forced to Cancel my Obligation, and to hand with all speed the Original to be Printed, that I might prevent any Surrep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious Copy.</p>
                  <p>What Alterations I was forced to make, was leaving out the Praying for our Royal Ancestors, and placing in our Royal Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Lord and Lady, King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> &amp;c. Some additional Prayers I thought proper to insert, as Thanksgiving for His Majesties Safe Return, and the Success of his Royal Navy and Armies, a Duty enjoyned on the Church in Publick, and ought to be the Duty of every Christian in Private. Lastly, I have added some few Graces which may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for Minor Christians; I

                  <head>THE Whole Duty OF PRAYER.</head>
                  <div type="prayer">
                     <head>What Prayer is, and the Parts of it.</head>
                     <p>PRayer is the Duty both of Soul and Body; it is an humble address unto God, for whatsoever we stand in need of, either in relation to this Life, or that which is to come: The First part of this Duty is Confession, which is the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging of our Sins in all Humility before the great Author of our Being: Now Confession is twofold, general, and particular; the general is when we Confess only we are sinful, without nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any particulars, which indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64934:5"/>
to publick Prayer, but the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging our Sins to God is very neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, whether Publick, or Private: Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Confession is when we express the several sorts, and acts of our Sins, and what ill habits we are most prone to; this is proper for Private Prayer, and ought often to be used, for we cannot repeat too often our soulest Sins which we are guilty of, nor cannot enough bewail our own unworthiness in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them.</p>
                     <p>THE next part of prayer is by way of Petition, which is begging of God what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we stand most in need of, either for our Souls or Bodies; first for our Souls we must beg pardon and absolution for all our Sins, in the name of Jesus Christ, who obtained it with his blood: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we must earnestly beseech the grace and assistance of Gods blessed Spirit to enable us to forsake all sin and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and to live in obedience to him: then it will be very necessary to beg all these particular graces, faith, hope, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, love, zeal, purity, and repentance; if thou art proud, pray for Humility, if lustful for Chastity, if guilty of gluttony pray for temperance, and so for all other vertues thou standest most in need of.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="3" facs="tcp:64934:5"/>IN Petitioning for our Bodies, we are to beg of God such accommodations of life, as are necessary for us, but in such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and measure, as his all-seeing Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom Knows is most suitable to our state, and Conditions the next duty, and Third part of Prayer is deprecation, which consists in praying to God to turn away from us either the evil of sin, or the evil of punishment; to pray against the evil of sin, is to beg earnestly of God to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve us by his Grace from falling into any sin; and when we are under any great temptation, and even ready to yield, then we must Humbly beseech him, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to withdraw the temptation, or else by the Power of his Grace Strengthen us against it: next we are to pray against the evil of Punishment, which are, two sorts, Spiritual and Temporal; Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la punishments, are the wrath of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the with-holding of his Grace, and Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Damnation: temporal punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is loss of Friends, goods or repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but in these things we must wholy Submit to the will of God, unto whom all we have belongs.</p>
                     <p>A Fourth Duty in Prayer is intercession, which is praying for all sorts and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Men, as Governours in Church
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64934:6"/>
and State, our Parents, Husband, Wife, Children, or other Relations and Friends, for all those in affliction either in Body; mind or Estate; nay even for our very Enemies according to the example of our Lord and Master, who prayed for his very Crucifiers, <hi>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do:</hi> The fifth Duty of Prayer is thanksgiving, praising and blessing God for all his mercies Spiritual and Temporal, Spiritual bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings are his sending his Son into the World for our Redemption and his holy Spirit to Sanctifie us, that we are born Christians and are made partakers of his holy word and Sacraments: We are likewise to return him thanks, for his patience and long suffering, in not Cutting us off in our Sins and Follies: Temporal blessings, which we are to give thanks for may be for the prosperity of a Church or Nation, and all diliverances which are remarkable: Some belongs to our selves, as Health, Wealth, Food, Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Friends, with many other Mercies we daily receive from God, which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever receives the least blessing is indebted all his life time to Praise the author and giver of all good things.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="5" facs="tcp:64934:6"/>THESE forementioned parts of our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Prayer, are to be made use of both in private and publick, that is in the Church and in our Closet, but more especially in the Church to which place there is a peculiar Blessing belongs, which Christ hath promised, that where two or three are gathered together in his Name he will be in the midst of them: The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Duty of publick Prayer, is that in a family, and that indeed ought to be the Masters Care to provide for the Souls of those that belong to him, as to provide food for their Temporal Nourishment: Now if he neglects this Duty and takes no care of his House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold in this important affair that Man cannot well be esteemed a Christian, but a Heathen.</p>
                     <p>PRIVATE Prayer is a Duty to be used in secret, where we can more particularize our sins when alone then is requisite to be done in publick: Next we are to be frequent in Prayer, and not Complain we want leisure for so doing; for he which is most busie may find some time to perform this Duty, else how can he expect his Employment should be Sanctified; now it is a great advantage for Men to seek God, at least
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64934:7"/>
Morning and Evening, if they expect a Blessing upon their endeavours: Next, the advantages we reap by Prayer are many: First It is a great honour, to speak freely to the Almighty: Secondly It is a great benifit, for it brings down Blessings both Spiritual and Temporal to us; Thirdly it is a pleasant Duty, it draws us nearer to God, which qualifies us for the joys of Heaven, where Christ is, at whose <hi>right hand are pleasures for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>NEXT we must take care that we ask nothing which is unlawful, but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever we stand in need of to ask it in faith, and great humility; Secondly we must be attentive and mind what we are about, Considering that it is the Majesty of Heaven we are to treat withal, and that our necessities cannot be supplied without his Divine aid and assistance. Thirdly, Vigilancy, Zeal, and Purity of intention must not be omitted, for <hi>the Sacrifice of the wicked are abomination to the Lord:</hi> Lastly what we Pray for, must be to a good end, that is, not to Pray for Wealth, to <hi>Consume it upon our Lusts:</hi> Or for grandeur to exercise our malice upon our Enemies; but whatever we do must be done to the glory of God, through
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64934:7"/>
whom we have Redemption in his blood, even the forgiveness of our Sins.</p>

                        <p>O FATHER of Mercy, and God of all Consolation, vouchsafe I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech thee, relief and succour, unto me a wretched Sinner, who am much tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in Mind, and afflicted in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science;
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:64934:50"/>
Lord, I am afraid of thy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the severe Threatnings writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in thy Law against those sins I have committed, but, O Lord, break not the bruised Reed, nor quench the smoaking Flax; wound not my humble and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite Heart, but revive my Spirit that goes mourning all the day long; though Satan thinks thou hast smitten and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken me, yet frustrate his hopes and expectations; leave me not destitute of thy Grace, as a prey unto the Enemy of my Soul, but mightily preserve, and evermore defend me.</p>
                        <p>AND though my Conscience accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses me, my Memory witnesses against me, and my Reason condemns me; though I am overwhelmed in discomfort, and have lost the voice of joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and have neither worth to appease thy wrath, nor patience to endure thy tryal, yet send me, O Lord, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of thy holy Spirit into my heart, that I may not be swallowed up with overmuch heaviness, but may rejoyce in thee with joy unspeakable and full of Glory: Open, and set open, the Gate of thy Mercy, to the greatness of my Misery, for my mind is sorrowful, my heart heavy, my spirit is oppressed, my
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:64934:51"/>
words are stopt with sighs, and my complaints watered with tears.</p>
                        <p>IN executing thy Judgments, Lord, remember Mercy, try me not least I be condemned; weigh not my offences, but pardon my offences; sanctifie all those means unto me which may afford me relief, as Prayer, Conference, Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, reading and hearing of thy Word, and receiving the Sacrament of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Blood of thy Son, and my alone Saviour and Redeemer; mitigate my extremities, abate my fears, and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate my afflictions; let not Night Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, like <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s, make me affraid, but when I awake, stay me with Flaggons, and comfort me with Apples, thy precious promises, which are pleasant to the Soul.</p>
                        <p>RECTIFIE my Understanding, as in the days of Old, and Drink no longer unto me in the Cup of Affliction, but in the Chalice of refreshing, that I may pay my Vows unto thee, and call upon thy Name in the sight of all thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; but if it be thy good pleasure to try me, and not take away this Cup from me, confirm my Faith, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue unto me that Hope which is to be revealed; to this end, cause me with

the Eye of Faith to look up to thee, who chastisest me, and wait for the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed time of my delivery out of all my Troubles.</p>
                        <p>LORD, suffer me not to be swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up with despair, but vouchsafe me a full assurance of thy Mercy, that thou wilt never leave me, nor forsake me, but wilt be in life my God, in death my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer, and after death my Eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder.

                        <p>WE are but of Yesterday, and know nothing; because our dayes upon Earth are as a shadow: When thou with rebukes dost correct Man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to Consume a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way like a Moth: Surely every Man is vanity; my time is in thy hand: Make thy face to shine upon thy Servant: Save me for thy Mercies sake.</p>
                        <p>HIDE not thy face from me; put not thy Servant away in thine anger: Thou hadst been my help, leave me not, neither forsake me, O God my of salvation: Thou shalt shew me the Path of Life, in thy presence is the fulness of joy, and at thy right hand there are pleasures for Evermore.</p>
                        <p>WE have had Fathers of the Flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence, shall we not much rather be in Subjection to the Father of Spirits, and live: he draweth the mighty with his power; he riseth up, and no Man is sure of Life.</p>
