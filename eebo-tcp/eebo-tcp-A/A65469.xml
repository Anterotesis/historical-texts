            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEN the Prophet <hi>David</hi> instructs
<hi>the Judges of the Earth,</hi> the lesson
he would have them learn is,<note place="margin">Psal. 2. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Serve
the Lord with Fear.</hi> And if you look into the
character of <hi>Jethro</hi>'s <hi>Justices of Peace,</hi> you will find
their main qualification to be,<note place="margin">Exod, 18. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Men fearing God.</hi>
And great reason.</p>
            <p>For first, They have their Commission and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
from God. <hi>By him Princes rule and Nobles,
even all the Judges of the Earth,</hi> Prov. 8. 16.</p>
            <p>2. They <hi>Judge not for men, but for the Lord, who
is with them in Judgment, 2 Chro.</hi> 19. 6. Again,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51862:3"/>
               <hi>Their Judgment is God's, Deut.</hi> 1. 17. and once
more, <hi>God himself hath said they are Gods, Psal.</hi> 82.
6. And now it would be a monstrous Solecism
and Contradiction, if they should be <hi>Vngodly Gods.</hi>
I am not of their opinion who hold Dominion is
founded in Grace, and make Saintship a Plea for
Soveraignty: but yet, considering that Dominion
is oftentimes confounded for want of Grace in them
that Govern; and since S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that the
<hi>Saints shall Judge the World,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 2.</note> yea <hi>the Angels hereafter</hi> in
Heaven: and again, Since none can be glorious
Saints there, who are not Gracious Saints here; it
is therefore very meet and necessary that Judges
should <hi>Exercise themselves unto Godliness,</hi> on Earth;
for alas, it would be but a poor Priviledge, and a
miserable Dignity, to Condemn Prisoners in this
World, and to be themselves Condemned in the
next, now, to have the Power of Gods, and then
to have the Portion of Devils. Though then the
Apostle prescribes this Counsel in my Text, to <hi>a
Man of God;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6 11.</note> yet it is very fit and proper to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in Charge to you that are <hi>Gods of Men. To Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
your selves unto Godliness;</hi> it is not only your
main Duty, but your greatest Interest and Concern,
far above all the Income of the Heads Projects,
or the Hands Performances; for <hi>Bodily Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
profiteth little,</hi> but <hi>Godliness</hi> (which is seat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Heart and shines in the Life of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an)
that <hi>is Profitable for All things, having Promise
of the Life that now is, and that which is to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> In the words there is, first, An Exhortation, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> thy self unto Godliness.</hi> Secondly, A Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Argument to incourage and inforce it, drawn
<hi>ab Vtili,</hi> from the <hi>Great Diana of Profit; Godliness
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51862:3"/>
is profitable unto all things, having Promise of the Life
that now is, and of that which is to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Exhortation, we have First, The Object,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>Godliness;</hi> Secondly, The Act, <hi>Exercise.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
            </p>
            <p>I shall begin with the Object, <hi>Godliness,</hi> and shew,
first, what that is. In the Greek the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
which signifies a Right Worship, or Awful Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God. And here now the Great Question
will be, What this Right Worship, or Religious
Adoration of God is. The Truth and Life of it is
in a manner lost in the Quarrels and Disputes about
it. It faring with Religion, as it did with the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> who having many Suiters, when
every one could not have her to himself, they
pull'd her in pieces that so none might have her.
And thus among those several Sects and Subsects
(which have been as numerous and busie almost as
Insects) every one beats down the price of another
mans Religion, to enhance the Value of their own;
yea, <hi>Et malunt nullam, quàm non suam,</hi> some of
them had rather there should be none, than that
their own should not take place. But as the <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arks</hi>
sheaves made obeysance to <hi>Joseph</hi>'s,<note place="margin">Gen. 37 7.</note> so must all
other Religions bow down to Christianity; all
other Books they must do homage to the Bible, and
every Christian must subscribe to what the Gospel
says is <hi>Godliness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now from thence the Schoolmen and other
Divines, define <hi>Godliness</hi> to be <hi>a Likeness or Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to God;</hi> which Conformity is twofold.</p>
            <p>1. A Conformity to the Nature of God, (as far as
may consist with our capacity) and therefore Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
are said <hi>to be partakers of the Divine Nature,</hi>
2 Pet. 1. 4. The meaning of which is, not that we
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51862:4"/>
participate of his Substance, which is incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable,
but that we are made like unto him, <hi>First,</hi> in
his Attributes, and <hi>Secondly,</hi> in his Affections.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> In his Attributes, when we are Holy, Just, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful,
Faithful and True, as God is, (for qualitie
though not Equality) then we are the Image of
God, as <hi>Adam</hi> was at first created, and by these
God becomes, (as it were) Visible in man.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> In his Affections, when we love what God
loves, when we hate what God hates; when
what pleases him, pleases us also; and when
what grieves and provokes his Spirit, grieves and
provokes ours too. This is Godliness as it is a
conformity to the Divine Nature.</p>
            <p>2. True Godliness consists also in our Conformity
to the Will of God, that is, to whatsoever he wills
us to do, or not to do, in his Word. The Will of
God, is (as one says) the Rule of Holiness,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>C.</hi> upon <hi>Job.</hi>
               </note> as his
Nature is the Pattern of it. So that, as it is the root
of all Sin, yea and a heavy Judgment too, when
men make their own Will, Wit, Reason, Phancy,
Humour, (things which some call Conscience) to
be the Spring and Warrant of all their Actions;
Thus it is the Power, and Perfection of Godliness
(and consequently the way to true Happiness)
when we do every thing in Obedience to Gods
Commands, regulating all our works by his Word,
and directing all to his Glory. This was the frame
of <hi>Adams</hi> Heart in the state of Innocency, this was
the disposition of Christs soul, when he humbled
himself in our Humanity, and this is that, in which
every Saint of God should be conformable to the
Son of God,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 16.</note> that so he may <hi>be Holy as he is Holy.</hi>
Thus you see what Godliness is. But where now
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51862:4"/>
shall we find this godliness? Is it to be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
all those who call themselves the Godly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie?
I wish with all my soul, that they were all such
Conformists, to wit, <hi>that they were Conformable to
the Image of the Son of God,</hi> as 'tis <hi>Rom. 8. 29. Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
Religionis est imitari quem colis,</hi> it is the summ and
substance of Religion, to Imitate Him whom we
worship. Those that are truly <hi>Godly,</hi> must be <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.</hi>
What the Devil in heighth of Pride once said
concerning Knowledg, and Power, the same should
every Christian in all Humility say concerning Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
and Righteousness,<note place="margin">Esay 14. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Ero similis Altissimo,</hi> I will
be like the most High. This, S. <hi>John</hi> calls a <hi>walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as Christ walked, 1 John</hi> 2. 6. And observe
I pray, how that was, in some few acts of his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Obedience.</p>
            <p>1. Look on him in his Devotions, and he is Hearing,
Reading,<note place="margin">Luk. 4. 16.</note> Kneeling on his Knees and Praying again,
and again,<note place="margin">Luk. 22. 41.</note> in the same Form of words; and that in
the Temple,<note place="margin">Matth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 26. 44.</note> and Synagogues,<note place="margin">Luk. 6. 6.</note> the publick places of
Gods worship; where he carefully observed the
Rites and Ordinances of the Church,<note place="margin">Joh. 10. 22. compared with 1 Macc. 4. 59.</note> though some
of them were of bare Humane Institution, and held
Communion with it,<note place="margin">Matth. 23. 3.</note> though the Priests were corrupt
in their Office,<note place="margin">Matth, 26. 14.</note> and a Judas was amongst the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.</p>
            <p>2. Take him in the Kingdom, or Common-wealth,
and he is subject to Authority; He payes Tribute,
and Renders unto Caesar the things that are Caesars,<note place="margin">Mat. 17 25, 27.</note>
yea,<note place="margin">Mar. 12. 17.</note> though Caesar gave not to God the things that
are Gods.</p>

And now, thou that callest thy self Saint, (though

neglectest and revilest that Liturgie, or Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
which is double-refined from Popery, and

            <p>

Thou art haughty, turbulent, and censorious,

            <p>On the other side; amongst Those who think

Heal'd,<note place="margin">Luk. 6. 7.</note> and did good Works upon it; But O,
how is that Day made the most sinful Day of the

Variety of Liquors is now the chiefest Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

Again, there are others, who purposely study Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,

But, O, that such would consider, that Religion is

<hi>Profit is there in Serving the Almighty?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 21. 15.</note> I answer (as

               <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>1. It profits more than all Bodily Trades and
Labours. Take Bodily Exercise in that sense, and the
Profitableness of the one, compared with the other,
is (as my Text says) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Little,</hi> or <hi>for a

               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 6.</note> whereas <hi>Godliness</hi> (says the Apostle)
<hi>is Great Gain;</hi> and <hi>that Good part which shall never
be taken away,</hi> Luke 10. 42.</p>
            <p>2. Understand by Bodily Exercise, the External
Duties of Religion; and Godliness, which consists in
Newness of Heart, and Life, that's more Profitable
than those also, yea and 'tis to be preferred before
the severest Exercises of Devotion, such as <hi>Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Fasting,</hi> and <hi>Abstinence from Meats, and Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age:</hi>
(as is hinted Verse 3.)</p>
            <p>To <hi>Keep our Heart with all diligence;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 4. 23.</note> and stand
daily upon our Guard, <hi>watching</hi> against Sin and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
so that neither of them take us Napping; this
is better than to turn the Night into Day, and by an
Unnatural Burglary force open the Windows of our
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51862:8"/>
Eyes, when sleep would shut them fast.</p>
            <p>Again, To <hi>Serve God in Singleness of Heart,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 6. 5.</note> that's
more considerable, than to <hi>Vow a Single Life,</hi> than
which, <hi>Marriage</hi> as it is <hi>more Honourable,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 4.</note> so it is
now Profitable and Useful, by how much Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
is more Commodious than Barrenness, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
more Immortal than Want of Issue, and in
brief, by how much <hi>Two are better than One,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccl. 4. 9, 11. 1 Cor. 7. 9.</note> and to
be <hi>Warm,</hi> better <hi>than to Burn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place, <hi>Fasting from Meat and Drink,</hi>
that is Good in its place and season, when 'tis done
in Order to the Exercises of Godliness; but, who
will not say, that to that end, An <hi>every-days Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance</hi>
may be as good,<note place="margin">Luke 18. 12.</note> as the <hi>Pharisee's Fasting
twice a-week.</hi> These are those Bodily Exercises,
which the Apostle does not here altogether Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn,
but extenuates in respect of Benefit, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with Godliness; and therefore he says in my
Text, <hi>Exercise thy self rather unto Godliness, for
that is Profitable for All things both in this Life, and
that which is to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Things of this Life, I shall instance only <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
in a few, as namely, Wealth, Health, Publick
Peace and Safety; as <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 16, 17. where 'tis said
of Godly Wisdom, <hi>Length of days are in her Right
hand, and in her Left hand Riches, and Honour.
Her ways are ways of Pleasantness, and all her Paths
are Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall begin with Wealth, and first shew, That
the way to be truly <hi>Rich, is to be Religious.</hi> Though
Great Gain, without Contentment is some mens
Godliness, yet the Apostle assures us,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 5, 6.</note> that <hi>Godliness
with Contentment is Great Gain.</hi> And needs must it
be so;</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:51862:9"/>
1. Because it is accompanied with Contentment;
for who so Rich, as he that hath Enough, and is
Content with what he hath. That is Wealth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
that frees a man from Want, and that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
doth, even in Want it self.</p>
            <p>2. This Exercising our selves unto Godliness,
it is <hi>Ars quaestuosissima,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls it, The
most Gainful Trade, because of Gods Blessing that
attends it; and now, the <hi>Blessing of the Lord, that
maketh Rich,</hi> says <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 10. 22.</p>
            <p>3. It is said of the Godly man, That <hi>whatsoever
he doth shall prosper;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 1. 3.</note> and then sure he must needs be
in a very Thriving way. If any of you had the
Philosophers Stone, that could turn Iron into Gold,
you would think your selves Abundantly wealthy,
as if you had both the <hi>India's;</hi> and much more may
you do so,<note place="margin">Matth. 13. 46.</note> when you have this <hi>precious Pearl,</hi> or
<hi>White stone</hi> of the Gospel,<note place="margin">Rev. 2. 17.</note> which hath the Vertue
to turn <hi>Losses into Gain, and that an hundred fold,
Matth.</hi> 19. 20. yea, and make <hi>All things work toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for your Good, Rom.</hi> 8. 28. The Godly mans
Expences may be reckoned as part of his Income,
and Revenue, in that, what he spends in Charity
to the Poor, and in Liberality to Pious Uses, is
counted <hi>a Lending to the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 19. 17.</note> 
               <hi>who will pay him
again,</hi> (in Kind, or in Kindness, in money, or in
money-worth) for which he has the Bond of God's
Promise, which is the best Security in the world.
Riches thus scattered, <hi>Non periunt sed parturiunt,</hi>
by an Honest Usury, and happy Brocage, they are
Improved and Insured; and like good Seed sown,
they are not cast away, but Multiplied and Increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
Away then with the old Wives Proverb, which
says, <hi>Plain, (or Pious) dealing is a Jewel, but he
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51862:9"/>
that uses it shall die a Begger.</hi> I acknowledge the
first part of it to be Orthodox, 'tis a Jewel of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable
value, but I cannot see how the latter
part can be true, when I consider how many Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
there are in the world, and how few Plain and
Pious dealers. Examine things aright, and you
will find, that there is no such <hi>Vnthriftiness</hi> and <hi>Ill-husbandry</hi>
as Sin. Many complain of Wars, and
Taxes, and these (they say) have wasted and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poverish'd
their Estates. But alas, their Sins are
far more Chargeable and Consumptive. Think
but with your selves at what a High rate Contention
and Revenge are maintain'd, when the <hi>Toll</hi> is more
than the <hi>Grist,</hi> and the Fees far greater than the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.
Think what vast summs of money Pride
and Idleness exact, when a whole Lordship shall be
hung at the Tip of the Ear, and men spend their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony
meerly to spend their Time, making it
their every-days work, only to Play all day.</p>
            <p>Again, Think but how the Drunkard swallows

            <p>And here my Humble Address shall be, to you,

would for the Health of your Souls and Bodies,

injoyned in my Text.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:51862:12"/>
There are none that have stronger, and more
pressing Engagements upon them to be Good, than
those whom the Lord hath made Great. 'Tis all
the Equitie in the world that those whom God hath
most Honoured, should most Honour God. 'Tis fit
that they Return, as they have Received, and not
be like some Gentlemen-Servants, and Tenants,
who do the least work,<note place="margin">Quo majores terras possident, minores census solvunt. Paeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sien.</note> because they have the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Wages, and pay the smallest Rent, when they
have the largest Farms. They, who are first in
Dignity, should have a Holy Scorn in them, to let
others go before them in Duty. I know your Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
are manifold and weighty, and so cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
were King <hi>Davids,</hi> yet he served God, not
only on the seventh Day,<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 164.</note> but <hi>seven times a Day.</hi>
Let not then the multitude of your Agencies be
your Apologie for neglect of Godliness, from which
Crowns are no Excuses. He that pretends Business
to keep him from the Exercises of Religion, makes
his Affairs his Idol, and saith (in effect) that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more necessary than Salvation, and more
Worthy than God himself. Again, I know your
Authority and Place is <hi>High,</hi> your Births and Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
are <hi>Gentile,</hi> but he that thinks it <hi>below</hi> a
Gentleman to be Righteous and Religious, may
think also into the Bargain, that it is <hi>below</hi> a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
to go to Heaven. Greatness, without God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
it is but like the Greatness of a Gouty, or a
Dropsical man, which is his Disease and Deformity
rather than his Ornament, and Honour. Besides,
a prophane Magistrate, is not only a Sinner, but
(<hi>Jeroboam</hi>-like) a Sinner-maker;<note place="margin">2 Kings 10. 3<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </note> in that he puts

            <p>But now, on the other side, when Greatness and

Judge;</hi> and <hi>an Active, and Religious Sheriff:</hi> This
will strike an Awe and Terrour into the boldest
Sinner, this will rectifie and reform a crooked and
perverse Generation, yea, and this (if any thing)
will propagate Godliness and Virtue in a debauch'd,
Atheistical Nation. There hath been much talk

And may You (through his Grace) God-like dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
your Goodness, and make others like You, in
what You are like God. As it is your Care, to have
all things well in your Consciences; so let it be your

with some, is raised to that High pitch, that they
think it a disparagement to have the Fear of God;
instead of taking Heaven, they strive to take Hell
by Violence; and make it a piece of a Great and
Gallant spirit, to dare to be Damn'd; and hence it
is, that they so often call upon God to do it. But
let such know, that no man is truly Valiant, but he
who is Affraid of Sin more than Hell;<note place="margin">Virtus est viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um um fugere.</note> and Flies
