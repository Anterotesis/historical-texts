         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <p>When the Huntſman commeth to the kennell in the morning to couple vp his hounds, and ſhall iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet once or twice to awake the dogs: opening the kennell doore, the Hunteſman vſeth ſome gentle rating leſt in their haſty comming forth they ſhould hurt one an other: to which the French man vſeth this worde Arere, Arere, and we, ſoſt ho ho ho ho once or twice redoubling the ſame, coupling them as they came out of the kennell. And being come into the field, and hauing vncoupled, the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man vſeth, hors de couple auant auant onſe or twiſe with ſoho three times togither: wee vſe to iubet once or twice to the dogges crying, a traile a traile, there dogges there, and the rather to make the dogs in trailing to hold cloſe together ſtriking vppon ſome Brake crie ſoho. And if the hounds haue had reſt, and being ouerluſtie, doe beginne to fling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, the French men vſe to crie, ſwefames ſwef, redoubling the ſame, with Arere ames ho: nowe we to the ſame purpoſe vſe to ſay, ſoſt ho, heere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine ho, doubling the ſame, ſometimes calling them backe againe with a iubet or hallow: poynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with your hunting ſtaffe vpon the ground, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoho.</p>
                     <p>And if ſome one of the hounds light vpon a pure ſcent, ſo that by the manner of his eager ſpending

you perceiue it is very good, yet ſhall the ſame hounds crying, there, now there: and to put the reſt of the crie in to him, you ſhall crie, ho auant auant, liſt a Talbot, liſt liſt there. To which the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man vſeth, Oyes a Talbot le vailant oyes oyes, troue le coward in the ſame manner with little difference. And if you find by your hounds where a Hare hath beene at relefe, if it be in the time of greene corne, and if your hounds ſpend vppon the troile merily, and make a goodly crie, then ſhall the Huntſman blow three motes with his horne, which hee may ſundry times vſe with diſcretion: when hee ſeeth the houndes haue made away: A double, and make on towards the ſeate: now if it be within ſome field or paſture where the Hare hath beene at relefe, let the Huntſman caſt a ring with his houndes to finde where ſhe hath gone out, which if the hounds light vppon, hee ſhall crie, There boyes there, that tat tat, hoe hicke, hicke, hicke auant, liſt to him liſt, and if they chance by their brainſickneſſe to ouerſhoote it, he ſhall call to his hounds, ho againe ho, doubling the ſame twice.

And note, that this word ſoho is generally vſed at the view of any beaſt of Chaſe or Venerie: but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede the word is properly ſaho, and not ſoho, but for the better pronuntiation and fulnes of the ſame we ſay, ſoho, not ſaho.

termes are in deede deriued from their language: now we finde the olde and antient Huntſmen had diuers termes vpon the view of the pricking of the Hare, which although I finde not very needefull, yet for the loue I beare vnto Antiquitie, I wil not omit: as when the Hare hath gone ouer ſome graſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie place where her prickes cannot be ſeene, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by ſtraying the graſſe, or by breaking ſome looſe mould, we ſay ſhe ſorths or reſorths: but theſe terms I will leaue to the indifferent opinion of the skilful Huntſman.</p>
                     <p>Now the reaſon why they ſay, the Hare fumaies and crottes or crottiſeth is this, we ſay the Hare fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maies, becauſe he beareth ſewet, and crottiſeth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he beareth greace, and becauſe ſhe croucheth on the houghes when ſhe letteth it go: ſo that wee ſay all beaſts that beare tallow, and ſtand vpright re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine as they goe, all that crouch or ſtoupe doe.</p>

Seth was made a Gentleman through his father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers bleſsing, from whoſe loynes iſſued Noah a gentleman by kinde and linage. Noah had three ſonnes truely begotten, two by the mother, named Cham and Sem, and the thirde by the father called Iaphet, euen in theſe three after the worlds inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was both gentlenes and vilenes diſcerned, in Cham was groſe barbariſme founde towardes his owne father in diſcouering his priuities, and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from whence hee proceeded.

And now I entend to proceede to coates caried in Armes, and the blazing of all armes: But by the way, ſhould I ſtand vpon all ſundrie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes borne in Armes, as the Peacocke, the Pie, the Dragon, the Lion, the Dolphine, with leaues and flowers, I ſhould rather cumber and tire the Reader with friuolous circumſtance, than any way inſtruct him in that which I vndertake: Therefore I ſhall ſhortly and truely teach you to blaze all Armes: if you giue diligent intention to the rules that I doe preſcribe which ſhall not be many, but paſsing ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall: And becauſe the Croſſe is the moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie coate or marke which is carried in Armes, I wil beginne with the Croſſe, in which the renowmed and valiant Prince king Arthur had ſuch great truſt, ſo that he left his armes which hee bare of the three dragons, and another coat he bare of three crownes and tooke to his armes, a Croſſe of ſiluer in a fielde of vert, and on the right ſide an Image of the virgin

                     <p>Now I turne againe to the ſigne of the Croſſe and aske a queſtion, how many Croſſes be borne in armes? To which queſtion, vnder any certaine num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I dare not anſwere, for Croſſes innumerable are now borne daily: but deſcending to euery Croſſe which I haue ſeene before, and heere meane to ſet downe, the plaine croſſe ſhall be firſt deſcribed, of which croſſe more doubts be made than of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Croſſes. Foraſmuch as wiſe men in blazing of Armes hold for a certaine rule that you muſt begin to blaze at the loweſt point of the ſhield. If the point be of one colour: and ſo that colour that is in the point of the ſheelde is the fielde of the armes.</p>
                     <p>But in that rule to remooue away all doubtes ye muſt very diligently obſerue, that that ſame rule is true with a little addition, that is to wit, that in Armes to be blazed, it is alwayes to beginne at the point of the ſhield, if the point bee of one colour, then that is true: if the colour of the point be more copious or greater in thoſe Armes, and then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt you ſhall beginne there, or elſe not. And when the colours be equall parted, either in length or ouerthwart, then euermore you ſhall beginne to blaze thoſe Armes in the right ſide, and in that caſe you ſhall haue no reſpect to the point.</p>

                        <pb n="94" facs="tcp:3781:95"/>For, of all the markes and ſignes which be found in Armes, as flowers, leaues, and other deuiſes, it were too long and tedious to ſpeake of, they be ſo innumerable: but for ſuch rules as generally holde in Armourie, obſeruing theſe which here I haue ſet downe, I doubt not but you ſhall finde them ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to blaze the hardeſt coate. Therefore take you heede to theſe rules: and although they touch not euerie particular in Armourie, yet ſhall you finde them to profite much, and ſhew you a neare way to ſome perfection in this knowledge.</p>
                     <p>And nowe laſtly I wil proceede to this queſtion, that is, Whether the Armes by the graunt of a Prince, or other great Lorde be of more dignitie, than thoſe Armes which a man taketh by his owne aucthoritie, when it is lawfull for him to take him Armes at his pleaſure. By which queſtion you ſhal well knowe that wee haue Armes foure manner of wayes.</p>
                     <p>The firſt of the which is the Armes which wee haue by deſcent from our fathers or mothers, or our predeceſſours: the which manner of bearing of Armes is moſt vſuall, and moſt famous, vppon the which I intend not to ſtand long, being ſo wel approoued.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:3781:96"/>The ſecond manner wee haue Armes by, is by our merites, as plainely appeareth by the addition of the Armes of France to the Armes of England, wonne by that victorious prince Edward the eldeſt ſonne of King Edward the third then king of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, after the taking of King Iohn of Fraunce in the battaile of Poicters, which Armes are rightly and lawfully borne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in the ſame manner may a priuate ſouldier take ſome great Lorde in battaile, the ſame ſouldier may carry the Armes of his priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his heire ſhall in his fathers right carrie the ſame Armes.</p>
                     <p>The third manner is, when wee haue Armes by the grant of a Prince or ſome other great Lord: and it is to bee vnderſtoode, that theſe Armes which wee haue by the grant of the Prince receiue no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion why a man doeth beare ſuch a coate, for the Prince will not that ſuch a queſtion be asked, whie hee gaue to any man ſuch Armes? Becauſe whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer pleaſeth the Prince, hath the ſtrength of the lawe, ſo it be not to ouerthrowe the lawe: except any man bare thoſe Armes before, becauſe that that which is a mans owne by a right title, may not bee taken from him, nor may the Prince doe it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing wrong.</p>
                     <p>The fourth manner is, when wee beare Armes which we take by our owne proper authoritie, as we ſee in theſe daies, how many men by their grace,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:3781:96"/>
labour, fauour, or deſeruing, are made gentlemen, ſome by their wiſedome, ſome by valour, ſome by their ſtrength, ſome by arte, ſome by vertue: and of theſe men, many by their owne aucthoritie haue taken Armes to be borne by them and their heires, whoſe names I thinke it needeleſſe to repeate: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe I thinke thoſe Armes ſo taken may bee lawfully borne: but yet they are not of ſo great dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and authoritie as thoſe Armes which be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the authoritie of a Prince or great Lord. And it is the opinion of many, that a Herald of Armes may giue Armes: But I ſay, if any Armes be giuen by a Herauld, that thoſe Armes be of no more authoritie than thoſe Armes taken by a mans owne au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.</p>
