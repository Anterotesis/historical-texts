            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The next thing necessary in an Heresie, is that it be maintained with obstinacy, which is the dead flesh, making the greene wound of an errour, fester into the old soare of an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.

Learning void of humility. <hi>The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent was the subtilest of all the beasts in the field, Gen.</hi> 3.1. in this kind a Dance is no dish for the Devilstooth. But in default of learning, good naturall parts will serve the turne, especially Memory (which is <gap reason="foreign">

Boldnesse and brazen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac't impudence will supply the place, especially if hee trades with the Vulgar, broaches dregs, and founds a dull and sottish Heresie, which hath no affinity with Learning. To varnish all these, there must bee pretended Piety, and Austerity of life, and how fowle or filthy soever the

Posterne or Back-doore be, the doore which opens to the street, must be swept and garni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed: put all these together, Pride, Discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, Learning, (at least-wise good parts, or impudency) pretended sanctity, and they spel together <hi>Haeresiarcham,</hi> one cut and carved out to be Ring-leader and Captaine of an heresie.</p>
               <p>To prevent these mischiefes, let such men pray to God for Humility (that vertue which is most worth, yet costeth the least to keepe it) and beware of spirituall pride, which is the Hectick Fever of the soule, feeding on the very moisture of the heart of Piety. Let them beware of discontentment, which is a direct quarrelling with God, who is the fountaine of all preferment, though men may be the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell; and hee who hath the least from him, hath more than he deserveth: And grant pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment is denyed thee, bee not so childish to cast away a Crowne, because thou canst not get a counter; willingly throw away thy soul, and foolishly revenge the fault of the times, (as thou countest it) upon thy selfe. Lastly, if God hath bestowed good parts upon thee, pray to him to sanctifie them to thee, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the greatest memory may soone forget it selfe, and a fluent tongue may cut his throat that hath it.</p>
               <p>So much for the Character of an Arch-He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike. But those whose barren wits want pregnancy to be the Mothers of Heresies, may
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:27228:10"/>
notwithstanding serve for dry Nurses to feed and foster them; and to this purpose the Devil will make use of them.</p>
               <p>A plaine Follower of an Heresie may bee thus described: First he must be ignorant, for hee that knowes nothing will beleeve any thing; these bee Maidens for their Religion; and therefore the opinion, which first woed them, first wins them, first come first served. Old Seducers, as it is 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Creepe into houses, and leade captive silly women laden with sinnes, led away with divers lusts, ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> Secondly, desirous of Novelty: It is an old humour for men to love new things, and in this poynt even many Barbarians are Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Lastly, (what resulteth from the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer) they must have the persons of men in much admiration, doting on some fancied mans parts and perfections, and entertayning any thing he saith, because he said it.</p>
               <p>To prevent these mischiefes, that men may not be Followers of Heresies, let the meanest parted labour to attaine to some competent measure of knowledge in matters of salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that so hee may not trust every spirit, but be able to try whether he bee of God, or no; beleeve no man with implicite faith in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of such moment; for hee who buyes a Iewell in a case, without ever looking on it, deserves to be couzened with a Bristoll Stone,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:27228:11"/>
instead of a Diamond. Secondly, kill the itch of novelty in thy soule, practising the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets Precept, <hi>Ier.</hi> 6.16. Thus saith the Lord, <hi>Stand yee in the wayes, and see, and aske for the old pathes, where is the good way, and walk there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and yee shall find rest for your soules:</hi> Lastly, love and admire no mans Doctrine for his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but rather love his person for his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.

               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:27228:18"/>Only duties pious, and publike are to be performed in the Church.

They might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive others, either unwillingly by these fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named slips and infirmities, or else willingly and wittingly by venting those things as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Apostles, which they had not received from them.</p>
               <p>And by usurpation, intitling the fancies of your owne heads, to bee Apostolicall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts.</p>

good worth. That is well spoken, which is well taken, and that man is worthy, who by God is accepted so to bee. Indeed if base and ignorant people should cry one up to bee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and prize pebles to bee pearles, hee is no whit the better for the over-valuing of him; but if God pleaseth to esteeme men, worthy, things are as they are accounted by him, his valuing of them puts worth into them, <hi>I have blessed him</hi> (saith <hi>Isaac</hi> of <hi>Iacob, Gen.</hi> 27.33.) <hi>Yea and hee shall be blessed</hi>; God hath accounted them worthy; yea, and they shall be worthy, as it is <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.4. <hi>They shall walke with me in white, for they are worthy.</hi> Let us when wee come to the Sacrament bring with us the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse of fitnesse, and convenience; and God of his goodnesse will be pleased to reward us with the worthinesse of acceptance.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Yet a mans examining of himselfe excludes not his examination of those who are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his care and charge; as Pastors exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning such young people, as according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Church they are to catechise.

            <p>Two sorts of people are unfit to receive. 1. Those that wilfully wil not examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. 2. Those that cannot by reason of their want of age, or some other impotency.</p>

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:27228:39"/>
that resemblance: <hi>David</hi> was in a great strait, betwixt three evils; I am in a straight betwixt three goods, not knowing which to chuse: how ever wee will follow the latter as most consonant to the Apostles sense.</p>
            <p>A man in examining himselfe, must perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate three, and act three severall parts. 1. The part of the Offender. 2. Of the Accuser. 3. Of the Iudge. The part of the Accuser, may be wel performed by that faculty of the soul, which is called <hi>Conscience</hi>; for besides her office, to be the Regester and Recorder of the soule, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancer of the acts thereof; It is also the <hi>Atturney Generall</hi> of the King of Heaven in our hearts, to press the evidence against us after the inditement. As for our reason and judgement, that must supply the office of a Iudge, <hi>Et secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum allegata &amp; probata,</hi> acquit or condemne us.</p>
            <p>But here it is to be feared, men will be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to themselves in two respects; first in not giving their conscience fair play: they will not give it that liberty <hi>Agrippa</hi> granted to S. <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 26.1. <hi>Thou art permitted to speak for thy selfe,</hi> but what in whol they cannot silence, they wil in part disturb &amp; interrupt. 2. It is to be feared our judgement wil not be upright, but as S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> said to our Saviour, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Master spare thy selfe, Propitius tibi sit, Mat.</hi> 16.22. So our judgement will be partiall, and favourable to us, as foundred feet will never tread hard.</p>
            <p>Wherfore because of this double suspition of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:27228:40"/>
partiality; this is a sound and safe Rule. Let us account our selves to be worse, than upon examination wee find ourselves to be: Thus did Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor</hi> 4.4. <hi>For I know nothing by my selfe, yet am I not hereby justified, but he that judges mee is the Lord.</hi> That is, since his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, his conscience accused him of no great sinne unrepented; and yet hereupon he durst not pronounce himselfe to be innocent, for <hi>God judgeth not as man judgeth, neither seeth as man seeth</hi>; but those who are acquitted by themselves, may be condemned by him.</p>
            <p>Seeing thus as it is said, a man is to act three parts, by the way wee may observe.</p>

Fools to drive away that which is winged, and which though they should strive to stay, they cannot.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:27228:40"/>1. Now the Interrogatories; wherupon every man is to be examined, are these. 1. Whether thou dost repaire to receive the Sacrament, with a competent measure of knowledge?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether dost thou come with unfained Repentance for thy sinnes past? which Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance consisteth not so much in outward sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row (for their faces may be flints, whose hearts may bee Fountaines, their soules may drop blood, whose eyes cannot shed teares) as in the inward contrition, and hatred of sinne, and shunning of it in the sequell of our lives.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whether dost thou come with a lively faith, relying upon God in Christ, for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of thy sinnes?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Whether dost thou come with love un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dissembled, freely from thy heart to forgive all injuries committed against thee? Some when they are to partake of the Sacrament, say to their malice, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did to his two servants, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.5. <hi>Abide you here, and I will goe yonder, and worship, and come againe to you.</hi> They leave their injuries at the Church doore, till they have received the Lords Supper, and then returning make a resumption of them againe: But let us not onely lop the bowes, but grub up even the roots of our malice, not only sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the act, but depose the habit of our ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred.</p>
            <p>And here as God said to the Iewes, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.3. that they should have no occasion any
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:27228:41"/>
more to use that Proverbe in Israel; <hi>The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have eaten sower Grapes, and the childrens teeth are set on edge</hi>; In like manner I could wish no occasion, that the English by-word be any more used, <hi>I forgive him, but I will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get him.</hi> Such people I dare say, neither forgive nor forget; like sluts, they sweepe the house of their heart, but leave all the dust still behind the doore; but let us not only breake the teeth of our malice in forgiving, but also pluck out the sting, which is still behind in the tayle, and labour fully to forget.</p>
            <p>To these Interrogatories, some have added these additionals, which vertually are contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the former: Whether dost thou come with an earnest desire, and longing to be made partaker of these heavenly mysteries?</p>
            <p>Whether dost thou come with thankfulnes to the God of heaven; for this his great blessing?</p>
            <p>Hereon let every one examine himselfe, I dare boldly say, none can decline the answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to these interrogatories; not that common evasion, <hi>Non tenetur respondere,</hi> as if they were not absolutely pertinent to the matter in hand, but it concernes every one of us to make a pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall and direct answer thereunto.</p>
            <p>Vpon examination all will confesse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves guilty, except a dumbe Devill, or a Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risaicall spirit hath possessed any. Yet are there degrees of guiltinesse: Some are guilty that they have not these graces at all, but the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:27228:41"/>
vices in stead of them; in stead of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ignorance. All the reason <hi>Laban</hi> could render <hi>Iacob</hi> in cozening him with the elder si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster for the younger, was but pleading the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the countrey, <hi>Gen.</hi> 29.26. And this is the best account some can giue, why they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacrament: It is an old ceremony, a fashion of their Fore-fathers, a custome of the Church, that young men and maidens at such an age use to receive; and so of the rest; in stead of repentance, obstinacy in sin, in lieu of faith unbeliefe, in place of charity, malice, an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency for desire, and ingratitude for thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; these in no case must presume to receive, but tarry till these vices are amended, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in some degree begotten in them.</p>
            <p>Others are guilty, that though they have them in sincerity, yet they have them not in perfection, these are bound to come to Gods table, his dainties are provided properly for such guests, &amp; by his blessing these holy myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries may worke in them what is wanting, and strengthen what is weak. And to conclude, as the father of the lunatick child cryed out, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.24. <hi>Lord I beleeve, help my unbeliefe</hi>; so may the best of us all, when we come to communicate, call out with teares, Lord I come with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, helpe my want of knowledge, Lord I come with repentance, help my want of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.

            <p>The death of the Godly in Scripture lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, is often stiled <hi>sleepe.</hi> And indeed sleepe and death are two twins; sleepe is the elder brother, for <hi>Adam</hi> slept in Paradise, but death liveth longest; for <hi>the last enemy that shall bee destroyed is death.</hi> But some will object, was Saint <hi>Paul</hi> so charitably opinioned to these Corinthians, as to thinke that they, some wereof were drunken at the receiving of the Sacrament, that they <hi>slept</hi>; that is, dyed and went to Heaven? me thinkes so strong a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity argues too weake a judgement: I answer, the Apostle had perceived in these mens lives, the strength of unfained piety, and though God suffered them to fall into a sin of so high a nature, as this must be confest to be, yet Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did Christianly beleeve, that this sinne by Repentance, and faith in Christ was pardoned, and their soules eternally saved. Let us mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:27228:43"/>
the estates of men after death, by the rule of their lives; and though wee see some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit grievous sinnes; yea such sinnes for which they are brought to exemplary death (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance by the orderly proceeding of the Law) yet withall, if wee had knowne, that the drift and scope of their lives had beene to fear God, wee may and must charitably conceive of their finall estate, and that with the Corinthians in my Text, they are fallen asleepe. So much for the punishment, wee come now to the cause. <hi>For this cause many are weake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All sicknesses of the body proceed from the sinne of the soule: I am not ignorant that the Lethurgy ariseth from the coldnesse of the braine, that the dropsie floweth from wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish blood, in an ill affected Liver, that the spleen is caused from melancholly wind, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in the midriffe; but the cause of all these causes, the Fountaine of all these Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines is the sinne of the soule. And not onely the sinnes, which wee have lately committed, and still lye fresh bleeding on our consciences, but even those which wee have committed long agoe, and which processe of time hath since scarred over, <hi>Iob</hi> 13.26. <hi>For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me possesse the sinnes of my youth.</hi> So that <hi>Iob</hi> being gray is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished for <hi>Iob</hi> being greene; <hi>Iob</hi> in the autumn of his age, smarts for what he hath done in the spring of his age; and as those which have
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:27228:44"/>
beene given to violent exercises in their youth, when they are old reade the admonitions of their former folly in the aches of their bones; so they who have prodigally ryoted their youth out in vitious courses, in their old age find the smart of it in their weak and diseased bodies. Doe wee then desire to lead our old age in health, I know no better preservative, or dyet drinke can bee prescribed, then in our youth to keepe our soules from sin; for now wee sow the seeds of health or sicknesse, which perchance wee shall reape twenty yeares after.</p>

                  <hi>Quest.</hi>
               </note>But how came Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to know that this sicknesse of the Corinthians proceeded from the irreverent receiving of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, especially sithence there were four other grand sinnes, which then raigned in their Church, each whereof upon hew and cry, might be taken as suspitious, to be the cause of this disease. 1. Factious affecting of one Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster above another, to the disgrace of God and the Gospel, 1 <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1.12. <hi>Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>I am of</hi> Apollo, <hi>I am of Cephas, and I am of Christ.</hi> 2. Suffering an <hi>incestuous person</hi> hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to his mother, and sonne to his wife, to live amongst them without publike penance and punishment: For though this incest, as it was committed but by one man, was but a particular and personall sin, yet as it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nived
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:27228:44"/>
at, and not punished, it began gangreen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to spread, and leaving its nature of perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality, it intituled it selfe to be a publike gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Church-sin of the Corinthians. 3. Going to law one with another under heathen Iudges, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Dare any of you, having busines against another be judged by the unjust, and not by the Saints?</hi> 4. Denying the Resurrection of the body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.12. <hi>How say some among you, that there is no Resurrection of the dead?</hi> Sithence therefore at the same time, the Corinthians were guilty of factious affecting of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, going to law under Pagan Iudges, suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring an incestuous person to live amongst them unpunished, denying of the Resurrection of the body; why might not Saint <hi>Paul</hi> thinke, that any one, or all of these might be the cause of this disease in the Church of Corinth, as well as the irreverent receiving of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
            <p>Because this sinne was the sinne paramount,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
               </note> like <hi>Saul, higher then his fellowes, from the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders upwards,</hi> the other four sins were fellony, robbing God of his glory; but the irreverent receiving of the Sacrament, was high treason against the person of Christ, &amp; so against God himselfe. The other for sins were Tetrarchs raigning over the Corinthians; but this was as <hi>Augustus</hi> the Emperour over the Tetrarchs more conspicuous then any of the rest. Learn we then, that though God of his goodnesse
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:27228:45"/>
may be pleased graciously to pardon, and passe by sins of an inferior nature and meaner alloy, yet he wil not hold them guiltless, &amp; let them escape unpunished, who irreverently receive the body and blood of his Sonne. This stentor sin shouts in Gods eares for revenge. Saint <hi>Anselme</hi> saith, that many diseases that raigne in the summer (though Physicians may impute them to other second causes) proceeds from peoples irreverent receiving the Sacrament at Easter.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 2.</note>Because the Apostle perceived some resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, betwixt the sin committed, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment inflicted. For as a Physician when he comes to his Patient, and finds him strangely affected, so that the disease puzles al his rules of art to reduce it to some naturall cause, then he will be ready to suspect, that his Patient hath eaten some poyson, which hath strangely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venomed the estate of his body; so Saint <hi>Paul</hi> seeing the Corinthians to be punished, with a strange and unusuall sicknesse (some conceive it was the plague) presently suspected, that they had eaten some poysenous thing, and on inquiry he finds that it was the Sacrament irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently received: It being just with God to turne that which was appoynted to bee preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative for the soule, to prove poyson to the body, being not received with due prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And here I may adventure upon a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable discourse, how a man in his sicknesse
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:27228:45"/>
may come to know the very particular sin, for which God hath inflicted that sicknesse upon him. It is not a meer curiosity, which will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford the ground work of much good medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nor an impossibility, though a difficulty to arrive at the knowledge of it: Wherefore let a man in such a case summon all his great sins to make a personall appearance in his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and not onely those of the last edition, but even those whose impression is almost out of the date of his memory, such as were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted long agoe in his youth: This done, all the matter will bee to find out, which is the veriest sinne for which God punisheth him at that time; and here I must confesse my can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels to be but dim, but I will light the more of them.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rea</hi> 1.</note> see to which sin the punishment thou sufferest, bears the most proportion of resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, for God commonly punisheth like with the like. Thus one may see Gods hand in the cutting of one of <hi>Adonibezecks</hi> fingers, he being served, as hee had served 72. Kings. And thus King <hi>Ioram,</hi> who had cruelly slaughtered his brethren on a stone, was troubled with an incurable disease, that his bowels fell out, and just it was that he should have no bowels, that had no compassion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. See if thou canst not find some proportion in the disproportion,<note place="margin">2.</note> and likenesse in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likenes of some sin to this punishment; God oft
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:27228:46"/>
times punishing by the contrary. Thus those who out of nicenesse, and curiosity, have tooke more then comes to the share of a corrupt creature, are commonly sent to their graves, by some nasty and loathsome disease; as proud <hi>Herod,</hi> whom the wormes impatient to stay so long, till death had dished him for their palate, devoured him alive.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Something may be gathered from the place or part, wherein the disease lieth; For if it be in the eyes, it is probable, its inflicted for the shooting out of lustfull &amp; lascivious glances, or looking with envious and covetous sight on the meanes of others; if in the eares, for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving audience to wanton sonnets, or for being over credulous in the hearing ill reports of others; if in the tongue, for lying, swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="4">4. See whether Chronology, or the time wherein the sicknesse seizeth upon thee, will not something advantage thee, for the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the cause thereof. Thus as one observes, the Lord <hi>Hastings</hi> was beheaded at London, that very selfe-same day twelve-moneth, yea the same houre; and if curiosity may goe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the same minute, wherein he had conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the death of the Queenes kinred at Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fret Castle.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Consider what sinne it is, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting whereof thou hast conceived the least sorrow. For though wee can never bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignly
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:27228:46"/>
sorry for our least sinne, yet we may be more penitent for one sinne, than for another, and that sinne which hath cost us the slightest and shallowest Repentance, is most likely to be the cause of our present sicknesse.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Hearken chiefly to the Inditement of thy conscience; for when wee hunt after that sin, which causeth our disease, and wee find our selves to be either at a losse, or at a cold sent, if once our conscience begin to spend her open mouth, wee may certainely conclude, that the game went that way, and that that is the very sin for which at that time wee are punished. Thus the Patriarks, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42 21. <hi>Said one to another, we have verely sinned against our Brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soule, where hee besought us, and wee would not heare, therefore is this evill fallen upon us. Reuben</hi> did not impute it to the defiling of his Fathers bed, nor <hi>Iudah</hi> to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest, nor <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> to their murthering of the Shechemites, for these were but personall sinnes; but all joyntly agreed, that it was for their cruelty to their Brother, a sin wherein all they were equally ingaged, as they were equally inwrapt in the punishment.</p>
            <p>If by these or any other meanes we attaine to the knowledge of that particular sinne, for which wee are punished; let us drown that sin in penitent teares, and in the blood of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; but if we cannot find it out, let us imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the example of <hi>Herod, Mat.</hi> 2. Who that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:27228:47"/>
he might make sure work to kil our Saviour, slew all the children in Bethelem, and the countrey about it, from two years old and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; a plot probable to have taken effect, if heaven had not beene too wise for hell. In like manner, let us indifferently, and imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally repent for all our sins in generall: if wee know not which was the Bee that stung us, let us throw downe the whole Hive; if wee know not which was the thorne, that prickt us, let us cut downe the whole hedge, and so wee shall bee sure that sinne shall not escape, which hath caused our present sicknesse.</p>
            <p>Now whereas God might have tumbled the Corinthians down into hell-fire, for their irreverent receiving of the Sacrament, and yet was pleased to inflict on them bodily weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and sicknesse, and death, we learn.</p>
            <p>God oftentimes with his Saints commuteth eternall torments into temporall punishments. Hee is therefore angry in this world, that hee might not be angry in the world to come, <hi>Et misericorditer adhibet temporalem paenam, ne juste inferat aeternam ultionem.</hi> If any object, but why will God pardon talents, and not tokens, pounds, but not pence; and for Christs sake forgive, and strike off eternall torment, and yet not crosse the score of temporall punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? I answer, 1. To make us take notice that wee have beene offenders. 2. That by feeling the smart of what hee inflicteth on us,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:27228:47"/>
wee may bee the more sensible of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, how much paine he hath forgiven us. 3. To make us more wary and watchfull in time to come. But farre bee it from us, to conceive that there is any satisfactory, or expiatory power in the afflictions which wee suffer. Satisfaction for sinne could not be but once, and once was fully made, when Christ offered himselfe upon the Crosse.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore learne patience under Gods afflicting hand, when hee layeth any sicknesse upon us. <hi>Solomon</hi> said to <hi>Abia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thar,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2.26. <hi>Get thee to Anathoth, to thine owne fields, for thou art worthy of death; but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the Arke of my Lord God before</hi> David <hi>my Father:</hi> Thus God dealeth with us, when hee might justly deprive us of our life, yea of our eternall life; yet if wee have borne his Arke, if wee can plead any true reference, or relation to Christ our Saviour; God will be graciously pleased, not to take away our lives, but onely to send us to our <hi>Anathoth,</hi> to confine us to our beds, to keepe us his close Prisoners, and onely to deprive us of our health, pleasure and delight. Let us therefore patiently endure the aking of the teeth; wee have all deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the gnashing of the teeth. Let us pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently endure a burning Fever; for wee
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:27228:48"/>
have all deserved Hell-fire. Let us <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 words">

precedent grace, as disposing one therto, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king capable therof; the other subsequent, &amp; is an effect therof, &amp; a reward of it through Gods mercy.

            <p n="5">5. Three things are required to make a plant to grow; first that it hath life within it. Thus the Christian must have in his soul a quickning vivifying faith. Secondly it must be watered in a man with the dew of Gods Word, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.10. <hi>For as the rain commeth down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater, so shal my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth, &amp;c.</hi> And the same allegory is followed by <hi>Moses, Deut.</hi> 32.2. <hi>My doctrine shal drop as the rain, my speech shal distil as the dew, as the smal rain upon the tender herb, &amp; as the showers upon the grass.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:27228:50"/>
the blessing of God is requisite, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which both the former are nothing worth; <hi>Paul may plant, and Apollo may water, but God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the increase.</hi> It was observed of Master <hi>Greenham,</hi> that painefull and zealous Preacher of Gods Word; that though hee was very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious in his calling, yet his people still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned most ignorant; and as one saith,
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Greenham</hi> had Pastures green,</l>

            </p>
            <p>So true it is, that Gods blessing is the Key of the worke, without which all is but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in vaine.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Now wee may take notice of two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeables in the growth of a Christian. First plants have their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, their bounds, both in heigth and bredth set by nature: (Hither shalt thou come and no further) to which when they have attayned they grow down-ward, and waxe lesse; yea all sublunary things, <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent suos terminos, quo cum venerint sistunt retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedunt ruunt.</hi> But <hi>growth in grace</hi> admits of no such period, but still there is <hi>Plus ultra</hi>: What Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Pray continually, rejoyce ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.17. is as true of spirituall growth, grow continually, encrease ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, never stop nor stay in grace, till thou commest to glory. Secondly, trees dote as well as men in their old age; yea then they
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:27228:50"/>
are barren, and bring forth little or no fruit; whereas Christians on the contrary, <hi>Psal.</hi> 92.13.14. <hi>That bee planted in the house of the Lord, shall flourish in the Court of our God, they shall still bring forth fruit in old age: They shall be fat and flourishing.</hi> Like wine, they are best when they are oldest; like <hi>Caleb,</hi> able and active men, even at four-score years of age.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Come wee now to set downe those things, which doe either in part hinder, or in whole destroy mens growth in Grace. For the first let us take heed of <hi>Suckers</hi> in our soule, such superfluous excrementall sprigs, which like so many theeves, steale away the nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which should maintaine the tree. By these Suckers we may understand those feloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous avocations of worldly employments, which either out of season, or out of measure, busie our soules in earthly things, when they should bee employed in heavenly matters. The onely way to prevent this mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, is to prune and cut off these Suckers, and speedily to stop up these Emissaries, by out-lets and private sluces, lest they drain dry the very main channell of grace in our hearts.</p>
            <p n="8">8. As for destroyers of grace it is two-fold: first the blighting or blasting of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science-wasting sinne: Thus drunkennesse and Incest destroyed grace in <hi>Lot</hi> for that very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, till hee recovered himselfe againe by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained repentance. Secondly, the drowth,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:27228:51"/>
and scorching heat of persecution. How pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising a Plant? what a shoot in Goodnesse did he give on a sudden, who said to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Master I will follow thee whether soever thou goest?</hi> But how quickly was he withered with one scorching beame, when Christ told him, how hard service he must undergoe?</p>
            <p n="9">9 Observe by the way: There is a double rooting in Grace, the one a sound and sure one, the other but shallow and superficiall: The former rooting belongs to the Saints of God, and these though they may bee blighted with sinne, or scorched with persecution, yet still as I may say, there is a secret sprig of life in the root, though in outward appearance, the leaves and bowes may seeme quite dead, and in Gods due time they grow out of their sins by repentance, out of their afflictions by pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

This Doctrine if applyed, serves to confute many: First, those that grow back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in grace, and are worse now, then they were seven yeares before; like the Galatians, <hi>You have run well, who hindred you?</hi> Secondly, those who stand still in goodnesse; like those women, whereof the Apostle complayneth, that they were <hi>Ever learing, and never come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> Thirdly, those that grow, but not proportionably to the long time, wherein they have beene planted, the fat soyle wherein they have beene set. The long time wherein they have beene planted, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12. <hi>For when for the time yee ought to bee teachers, you have need that one teach you againe, which be the first principles of the Oracles of God, and are become such as have need of milke, and not of strong meat.</hi> The fatnesse of the soyle wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they have beene set, and plenty of water powred on them, and herein no countrey
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:27228:52"/>
comes neere to ours; and therefore wee are most unexcusable, if wee grow not in grace. Out-landish men call our Iland the Rainy Iland; because wee have such plenty therof, arising of the store of vapours, from the vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the sea. They call it also the Ringing Iland, because it hath bels, so many and so tuneable; I am sure without flattering it maybe thus called in an higher sense, the dew of Gods Word is no where powred more plentifully, and we have (God increase their number) many and melodious bels, tuneable amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and loud-sounding the Word of God to others: Most heavie therefore will be our account, if wee yeeld not some proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble growth in grace, to these great means God affords us.</p>
            <p n="11">11 Now in examining themselves, I find three sorts of men to be deceived. Some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count themselves to be growne in grace when they are not: others esteeme themselves to be not growne, when they are. Of the former some account themselves to bee improved in goodnesse, when God takes from them the ability to commit sinne they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. An old man saith, I thanke God I am growne in grace: well, how shall this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare? Thus, saith the old man: Twenty yeares agoe I was given to lust and wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; now I have left it. Alas hee puts a fallacy on his owne soule; for the sinne
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:27228:52"/>
hath left him, his moysture is spent, his heate abated, and hee disabled from performing the taske of wickednesse. So the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall, who hath spent his estate, hugs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in his owne happinesse, that now hee is growne in grace; because hee hath left Vanity in clothes, Curiosity in dyet, Exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sivenesse in gaming; when alas needs must the fire goe out, when the fuell is taken away; he is not growne in grace, but decreased in estate. Others construe it to be growth of grace in themselves, when only God takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from them the temptations to sinne. Hee that living in a populous place was given to drunkennesse, who now being retyred to a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Village, takes himselfe to bee turned very sober. Alas, it is not hee that is altered, but his place, he wanteth now (a want with gain) a crue of bad good fellowes to solicite him to the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne; but had he the same temptation; let him examine himselfe, whether he would not be as bad, as ever hee was before.</p>
            <p>A third sort count themselves, growne in grace, when they have not left, but onely exchanged their sin; and perchance a lesse for a greater: <hi>Thou that abhorrest Idols, committest thou sacriledge? Rom.</hi> 2. Some thinke themselves improved in piety, because they left prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and reele into Covetousnesse: left Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanenesse, and fallen into spirituall Pride, or peevish affecting of out-side holinesse.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:27228:53"/>
Thus like the Sea, what they loose in one place, they gaine in another, and are no whit growne in Grace.</p>
            <p n="12">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 12. Others conceive themselves not to bee growne in grace when they are growne; and that in these foure cases. First sometimes they thinke that they have lesse grace now, than they had seven yeares agoe; because they are more sensible of their badnesse. They daily see and grieve to see how spirituall the Law of God is, and how carnall they are; how they sinne both against Gods will, and their owne, and sorrow after their sinne, and sinne after their sorrow. This makes many mistake themselves, to be worse than they have beene formerly; whereas indeed the sick-man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to amend, when hee begins to feele his paine.</p>
            <p n="13">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 13. Many thinke themselves to have lesse saving Knowledge now, than they had at their first conversion; both because (as we said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of Grace) they are now more sensible of their ignorance; and because their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge at their first conversion seemed a great deale, which since seemeth not increast, because increast insensibly, and by unappearing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. One that hath lived all his life time in a most darke Dungeon, and at last is brought out but into the twi-light, more admires at the clearnesse and brightnesse thereof, than hee will wonder a moneth after at the sun at noon-day.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:27228:53"/>
So a Christian newly regenerated, and brought out of the darke state of nature, into the life of grace, is more apprehensive at the first illumination, of the knowledge hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, than of farre greater degrees of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which hee receiveth afterwards.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Some thinke they have lesse grace now,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> than they had some yeares since, because a great measure of grace seemes but little to him that desires more. As in worldly wealth, <hi>Crescit amor nummi quantum ipsa pecunia crescit</hi>; So is there an holy, heavenly, and laudable covetousnesse of grace, which deceives the eye of the soule, and makes a great deale of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse seeme but a little.</p>
            <p n="15">15 Many thinke they are growne lesse and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> weaker in grace, when indeed they are assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with stronger temptations. One saith se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years since, I vanquished such temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as at this day foyle me; therefore surely I am decreased in grace. <hi>Non sequitur,</hi> for though it be the same temptation in kind, it may not be the same in degree and strength; thou mayest still be as valiant, yet thy enemies may conquer thee, as assaulting thee with more force and fury: when thou wert newly converted, God proportioned the weight to the weaknesse of thy souldiers, bound up the Devill, that hee should set upon thee with no more force, than thou couldest resist and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due. Now thou hast gotten a greater stock of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:27228:54"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5,"/> grace, God suffers the devil to buffet thee with greater blows.</p>
            <p n="16">16 Some thinke grace is lesse in them now than it was at their first conversion, because they find not in their souls, such violent flashes, such strong impetuous (I had almost said) fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious raptures of goodnesse, and flashes of grace and heavenly illumination: But let them seriously consider, that these raptures which they then had, and now complaine they want, were but fits short and sudden, <hi>Nimbus erat, cito preterijt,</hi> not setled and constant, but such as quickly spent themselves with their own vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: Whereas grace in them now may bee more solid, reduced, digested, and concocted: <hi>Bos lassus fortius figit pedem,</hi> more slow, but more sure, lesse violent, but more constant; though grace be not so thicke at one time, yet now it is beaten and hammered out to bee broader and longer; yea I might adde also, it is more pure and refined: This we may see in Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> when hee was a young man in a bravery, he would walk on the water, yea and so daring was hee in his promises; <hi>Though all forsake thee, yet will not I:</hi> But afterwards in his old age hee was not so bold and daring; expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience had not only corrected the ranknesse of his Spirit, but also in some sort quenched, sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tempered the flashes of his zeale for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturousnesse of it; yet was he never a whit the worse, but the better Christian, though he
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:27228:54"/>
was not so quick to run into danger, yet hee vvould answer the spur when need required, and not flinch for persecution, when just occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion vvas offered; as at last hee suffered mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome gloriously for Christ.</p>
            <p n="17">17 To conclude; Grace in the good Thiefe on the Crosse, like <hi>Ionah's</hi> Gourd, grew up pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, for hee was an extraordinary example; but in us it is like the growth of an Oak, slow and insensible; so that wee may sooner find it <hi>crevisse,</hi> then <hi>crescere,</hi> it must therefore bee our daily taske all the dayes of our lives; to which end let us remember to pray to God for his blessing on us: our Saviour saith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.27. <hi>Which of you by taking care is able to adde one cubit unto his stature</hi> in the corporall growth? Much lesse able are wee in the spirituall growth, to adde one inch or haires bredth to the heigth of our soules. Then vvhat vvas pride in the Builders of Babel, vvill be piety in us, to mount and raise our soules so high, till the top of them shal reach to Heaven. Amen.</p>

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:27228:56"/>
Worshippers of many gods; for they made every attribute of God to be a distinct Deity. Thus in stead of that attribute, the wisedome of God, they fained <hi>Apollo</hi> the God of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; in stead of the power of God, they made <hi>Mars</hi> the God of power; in stead of that admirable beauty of God, they had <hi>Venus</hi> the Goddesse of beauty: But no one attribute was so much abused, as Gods Providence. For the Heathen supposing, that the whole world, and all the creatures therein was too great a Diocesse to bee daily visited by one, and the same Deity; they therefore assigned sundry gods to severall creatures. Thus Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in ruling the raging of the seas, was counted <hi>Neptune</hi>; in stilling the roaring wind <hi>Aeolus</hi> in commanding the powers of Hell <hi>Pluto</hi>; yea sheep had their <hi>Pan,</hi> and Gardens their <hi>Pomona</hi>; the Heathens then being as fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in faigning of gods, as the Papists since in making of Saints.</p>
            <p>Now because <hi>Naomi</hi> used the example of <hi>Orpah,</hi> as a motive to worke upon <hi>Ruth</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne; wee gather from thence. Examples of others set before our eyes, are very potent and prevalent Arguments, to make us follow and imitate them, whether they bee good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, so the forwardnesse of the Corinthians to beleeve the Iewes, provoked many: or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be bad, so the dissembling of <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Antioch, Drew Barnabas and others into the same

            <p>When wee see any good example pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded unto us, let us strive with all possible speed to imitate it: what a deale of stirre is there in the world for civill precedency and priority, every one desires to march in the Fore-front, and thinkes it a shame to come lag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Rear-ward. Oh that there were such an holy ambition, and heavenly emulation in our hearts, that as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> ran a race, who should come first to the grave of our Saviour, so men would contend, who should first attain to true mortification; and when we see a good example set before us, let us imitate it, though it be in one, which in outward respects is far our inferior: shal not our Masters be ashamed, to see that their men, whose place on earth is to come behind them, in piety towards Heaven to goe before them? shall not the Husband blush to see his Wife, which is the weaker vessell in nature, the stronger vessell in grace?

shall not the elder Brother dye his cheeks with the colour of vertue, to see his younger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who was last borne, first reborne by faith, and the Holy Ghost? yet let him not therefore envie his Brother, as <hi>Cain</hi> did <hi>Abel,</hi> let him not be angry with his Brother, because hee is better than himselfe, but let him be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with himselfe, because hee is worse than his brother, let him turne all his malice into imitation, all his fretting at him into follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him. Say unto him, as <hi>Gehazi</hi> did of <hi>Naaman; As the Lord liveth I will run after him:</hi> and although thou canst not over-run him, nor as yet over-looke him; yet give not over to run with him, follow him, though not as <hi>Aza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> did <hi>Abner,</hi> hard at the heeles; yet as <hi>Peter</hi> did our Saviour, <hi>a farre off</hi>; that though the more slowly, yet as surely thou mayest come to Heaven; and though thou wert short of him while hee lived, in the race, yet thou shalt be even with him when thou art dead, at the marke.</p>
            <p>When any bad example is presented unto us, let us decline and detest it, though the men be never so many, or so deare unto us.

            <p>For the better understanding of which vvords, knovv that the Devill goes about to make an unfitting match, betwixt the soule of a Christian, on the one party, and this

world on the other. A match too likely to goe on, if wee consider the simplicity, and folly of many Christians (because of the remnants of corruption) easily to be seduced and inveagled, or the bewitching entising, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luring nature of this world: But God by Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in my Text forbiddeth the banes, <hi>Love not the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In prosecuting whereof, wee will first shew the worthinesse of a Christian soule, then wee will consider the worthlesnesse of the world, and from the comparing of these two, this Doctrine will result that.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is utterly unfitting for a Christian to place his affections on worldly things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us take notice of a Christians Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and of his Possibilities; what he hath in hand, and what he holdeth in hope: In posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion he hath the favour of God, the Spirit of Adoption, crying in him, <hi>Abba father,</hi> and many excellent graces of sanctification in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in his heart. In hope &amp; expectance he hath the reversion of Heaven and happinesse, (a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version not to be got after anothers death, but his owne) and those happinesses which eye cannot see, nor eare heare; neither it can enter into the heart of man to conceive.</p>
            <p>Now see the worthlesnesse of the World; three Load-stones commonly attract mens affections, and make them to love, <hi>Beauty, Wit,</hi> and <hi>Wealth.</hi> Beauty the world hath none at
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:27228:64"/>
all. I dare boldly say, the world put on her Holy-day Apparell, when shee was presented by the Devill to our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.9. She never looked so smug and smooth before or since, and had there beene any reall beauty therein, the Eagle-sight of our Saviour would have seene it; yet when all the glory of the world was proffered unto him, at the price of Idolatry, hee refused it. Yet as old <hi>Iezabel,</hi> when shee wanted true beauty, stopt up the leakes of age, with adulterated complexion, and painted her face; so the world in default of true beauty decks her selfe with a false ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing fairenesse, which serves to allure amorous fooles, and (to give the world, as well as the Devill her due) shee hath for the time a kind of a pleasing fashionablenesse: But what saith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 7.31. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

us whilst wee live; but wee must leave them when wee dye.</p>
            <p>Seeing then the World hath so little, and the Christian foule so much; let us learne a Lesson of Holy Pride, to practise heavenly Ambition. Descend not so farre O Christian, beneath thy selfe, remember what thou art, and what thou hast, loose not thy selfe in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing thy affections, on so disproportioned a Mate: There is a double Disparity betwixt thy soule, and the world: first that of Age. Perchance the world might make a fit mate for thy old Man, thy Vnregenerate halfe, thy Reliques of sinne; but to match the old, rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, withered, worme-eaten World, to thy new Man, thy new Creature, the regenerated and renewed part of thy soule, gray to green, is rather a torture, then a marriage, altogether disproportionable.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that of quality or condition, thou art Gods Free-man: <hi>If I have freed you,</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>then are you free indeed,</hi> the world is, or ought to be thy slave, thy vassaile, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.5.4. <hi>For whosoever is borne of God overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the world, and this is the victory that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth the World, even our faith.</hi> Bee not then so base, as to make thy vassall thy mate. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> denyed to marry <hi>Darius</hi> his Daughter, though proffered unto him, scorning to bee conquered by her beauty, whose Father hee had conquered by his valour. Let us not make
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:27228:65"/>

who improveth his utmost power to advance a match betwixt thy soule and the world. And when any breach happens betweene thee, and the world; so that thou art ready to cast her off, the flesh in thy bosome pleads her cause: Why wilt thou (saith it) deprive thy selfe of those contentments, which the World would afford thee? Why dost thou torment thy selfe before thy time? Ruffle thy selfe in the silkes of security, it will be time enough to put on the Sack-cloath or Repentance, when thou lyest on thy Death-bed. Hearken not to the Flesh, her Inchantments; but as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> charged <hi>Moses,</hi> to get him out of his presence, he should <hi>see his face no more, Exodus</hi> 10.28.

was any whit inferiour to any of <hi>Davids</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.

laying thy hand on thy mouth, confesse God hath justly found thee out, and dealt with thee, as hee did with <hi>David.</hi>

            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Observ.</hi> 2.</note> hence we may observe: <hi>The most politicke heads have not alwayes the faithfullest hearts. Achitophel</hi> was the Iewish Nestor, or their <hi>Salomon</hi> before <hi>Salomon,</hi> and like <hi>the Oracle of God for his wisedom,</hi> but like the Oracle of the devill for his deceitfulnesse; for whilst <hi>David</hi> swaied the scepter, who more loial to him then <hi>Achitophel,</hi> and once when <hi>David</hi> is in banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he fals first to <hi>Absalom,</hi> he loved to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the sun rising; yea whils <hi>David</hi> the true sun was but over-cast with a cloud, he fals adoring that blazing star, that Comet only fed with the evaporations of pride and ambition, which shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for a while, and then went out in a stink.</p>
            <p>Reasons why the most politick are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the most faithfull.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Because that cement which conglutinates hearts, and makes true friends indeed, is Grace and Goodnes, wherof many politick heads are utterly devoid, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26. <hi>For ye see your calling Brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. Politick men make their owne profit, the rule and square of their loves, they steere their course by the pole-star of their own good.

            <p>Come wee now to consider, what good uses one may make to himselfe, from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulnesse of friends, when they forsake us.</p>
            <p n="1">1 First consider with thy selfe, whether thou hast not beene faulty, in entertaining Tale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers, and lending a listning eare unto them: <hi>Solomon</hi> faith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.28. <hi>A whisperer separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth chiefe friends.</hi> Whethersoever hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, he bringeth with him, the fire, fuel, and bellowes of contention.</p>
            <p n="2">2 If herein thy conscience accuse thee not, examaine thy selfe, whether there was not a <hi>Laesum principium,</hi> in the first initiation of your love: How came you acquainted, whereout grew your amitie, whereon was your intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie grounded? Didst thou not first purchase
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:27228:70"/>
his favour with the price of a sinne? for know, friends unjustly gotten, are not long comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably enjoyed. Thus <hi>Absalom,</hi> by sordid flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery stole the hearts of the Israelites, descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding too much beneath himselfe, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.5. As alwayes ambitious spirits, when they would personate Humility, over-act their part, and play basenesse: Wee see King <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi> who procured <hi>Senacharibs</hi> love by his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge, enjoyed not that purchase, which he made God and his Temple pay for, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18. 16. For <hi>Senacharib</hi> no sooner received his money, but <hi>hoc non obstante,</hi> persisted in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer enmity and hostility against the Iewes, and as it followeth in the very next verse, sent up his Captaines to besiege Ierusalem.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If there be no fault in the inchoation; Examine, hath there beene none in the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of your friendship, hast thou not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted many sinnes, to hold in with him? If so, then it is just with God, hee should forsake thee: Thus Tyrants often times cut off those staires, by which they climbe up to their Throne: Yea, good Princes have often times justly sacrificed those their Favorites to the fury of the people, who formerly have been the active Instruments to oppresse the people, though to the enriching of their Princes. Hast thou not flattered him in his faults, or at least wise by thy silence consented to him? If so, God hath now opened thy friends eyes, he
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:27228:71"/>
sees thy false dealing with him, and hath just cause to cast thee out of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Amnon</hi> had defiled his sister <hi>Thamar,</hi> the Text saith, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.15. that <hi>the hatred wherewith hee hated her, was greater than the love, wherewith hee loved her.</hi> Poore Lady, shee was in no fault, not the cause, but onely the object, and the occasion of her brothers sinne, and that against her will, by his vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Now to reason, <hi>A minore ad majus</hi>; If <hi>Amnon</hi> in cold blood viewing the hainous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his offence, so hated <hi>Thamar,</hi> which onely concurred passively in his transgression, how may our friends justly hate us, if haply we have beene the Causers, Movers, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curers of their badnesse. If wee have added fewell to the flame of their ryot, played the Pandors to their lusts, and spurred them on in the full speed of their wantonnesse, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve wee not (when their eyes are ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to see what foes we have been unto them, under pretended Friendship) to bee spit in the face, kik't out of their company, and to bee used with all contumely, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Hast thou not idolatrized to thy friend? hath he not totally monopolized thy soule, so that thou hast solely depended on him, without looking higher, or further? <hi>Tu pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronus, si deseris tu perimus.</hi> Thus too many
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:27228:71"/>
wives anchor al their hopes for outward mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, on their husbands, and too many children leane all their weight on their Fathers shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; so that it is just with God, to suffer these their woodden Pillars to breake, on whom they lay too much heft.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Hast thou not undervalued thy friend, and set too meane a rate and low an estimate on his love? If so God hath now taught thee, the worth of a Pearle, by loosing it? And this comes often to passe, though not in our friends voluntary deserting us, as <hi>Achitophel</hi> did <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> yet in their leaving us against their wils, when God taketh them from us by death.</p>
            <p>But here this question may be demanded;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Quest.</hi>
               </note> whether is one ever againe to receive him for his friend, and to restore him to the old state of his favour, who once hath deceived, and dealt falsely with him?</p>
            <p>Many circumstances are herein,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
               </note> well to bee weighed; first did hee forsake thee out of frailty, and infirmity, or out of meer spight and maliciousnesse? Secondly, hath he since shewed any tokens, and evidences of unfained sorrow? hath hee humbled himselfe unto thee, and beg Gods, and thy pardon? If hee hath offended mischievously, and persists in it obstinately: O let not the strength of thy sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed charity, so betray thy judgement, as to place confidence in him! <hi>Samson</hi> was blind, before hee was blind; the lust of <hi>Dalilah</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:27228:72"/>
him of his eyes, before the Philistims bored them out, in that once and againe being deceived by <hi>Dalilah,</hi> hee still relyed on her word: But if hee hath shewed himselfe such a Penitent, and thou art verely perswaded of his Repentance, receive him againe into thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. Thus dealt our Saviour with Saint <hi>Peter, Marke</hi> 16.7. <hi>But goe your way, tell his Disciples, and Peter, Peter</hi> especially; <hi>Peter</hi> that had sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and <hi>Peter</hi> that had sorrowed, <hi>Peter</hi> that had denyed his Master; but <hi>Peter</hi> that <hi>went out and wept bitterly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Sixthly, and lastly, it may bee God suffers thy friends to prove unfaithfull to thee, to make thee sticke more closely to himselfe: Excellent to this purpose is that place, <hi>Mica.</hi> 7.5. <hi>Trust yee not in a friend, put yee no confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in a Guide, keepe the doers of thy mouth from her, that lyeth in thy bosome:</hi> For <hi>the Son disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth the Father, the Daughter riseth up against the Mother, the Daughter in law, against her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in law; a mans enemies are the men of his own house.</hi> But now marke what followes; <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will I looke unto the Lord, I will wayte for the God of my salvation.</hi> As if hee had said, is the world at this bad hand? is it come to this bad passe? That one must bee farre from trusting their neerest friends; it is well then I have one fast Friend, on whom I may relye, the God of Heaven. I must confesse these words of the Prophet, are principally
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:27228:72"/>
meant of the time of Persecution, and so are applyed by our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.21. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they containe an eternall truth, whereof good use may bee made at any time: Let us therefore, when our friends forsake us, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally relye on God, who hath these two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent properties of a friend; first he is neere to us, so saith the Psalmist, <hi>Thy name is neere, and this doth thy excellent workes declare:</hi> They have a speedy way, of conveying Letters from <hi>Aleppo</hi> to <hi>Babylon,</hi> sending them by a winged Messenger, tyed to the legs of a Dove; but wee have a shorter cut to send our prayers to God, by sending our prayers by the wings of the Holy Spirit, that heavenly Dove, whereby they instantly arrive in Heaven. As God is neere to us, so hee is ever willing, and able to helpe us: On him therefore let us ever relye; and when other Reeds bow or break, or run into our hands, let us make him to bee our staffe, whereon wee may leane our selves.</p>

                     <hi>Rea.</hi> 3.</note>Because of the sundry dangers it brings; first to the soule, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.34. <hi>Take heed lest your hearts bee oppressed with surfetting:</hi> And indeed the soule must needs bee unfitting to serve God, being so incumbred. That man hath but an uncomfortable life, who is confined to live in a smoaky house. The braine is one of these places of the residence of the soule, and when that is filled with streames, and vapours arising from unconcocted crudities in the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, the soule must needs <hi>malè habitare,</hi> dwell unchearfully, ill accommodated in so smoaky a mansion. And as hereby it is unapt for the performance of good, so it is ready for most evill, for uncleannesse, scurrulity, ill speaking; this being the reason, saith Saint <hi>Gregory,</hi> why <hi>Dives</hi> his tongue, was so tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in Hell, because hee being a Glutton, with his tongue had most dishonoured God. Secondly, this sinne empaires the health of the body: the out-landish Proverbe saith, <hi>That the Glutton digs his Grave with his owne teeth, hastens his death by his intemperance</hi>; For if there were a conflict in <hi>Rebeckaes</hi> body, when two Twins were in her wombe, must there not bee a Battell and Insurrection in his stomack; wherein there is meat, hot, cold, sod, rost, flesh, fish; and which side soever wins, nature
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:27228:75"/>
and health will bee overcome, when as a mans body is like unto the Arke of <hi>Noah,</hi> containing all Beasts cleane, and uncleane; but hee the most uncleane Beast, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines them: Our Law interprets it to bee murther, when one is killed with a knife. Let us take heed wee bee not all condemned by God, for being Fellons, <hi>de se</hi>; for wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full murthering our owne lives, with our knifes by our superstitious eating. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it wrongs the creatures that hereby are abused: Indeed they willingly serve man, so long as hee is a King over them; but they are loath to doe it, when he turnes Tyrant: So if when the Drunkard sings, the drinke sighes; when the Glutton laughes, the Meate grieves to bee so vainely mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent by him. God saith, <hi>Hosea.</hi> 2.9. <hi>That hee will recover his Flaxe, and his Wooll from the Idolatrous Iewes, Vindicabo,</hi> I will rescue and recover them, as from slavery and subjection, wherein they were detayned against their will; and in such like tyrannie are the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as Bread, Wine, and Meat tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red under the Glutton. Lastly, it wrongeth the poore; for it is the over-much Feast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Dives,</hi> which of necessity maketh the Fasting of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and might not the superfluous Meat of the Rich bee sold for many a pound, and given to the poore.</p>

This sinne therefore consisteth, either in the quantity of the meate, or in the quality, or in the manner of eating. In the quantity: And here it is hard to define the Omer of Manna, for every mans belly; the proportion of meate for every mans stomacke; that quantity of raine will make a claye ground drunke, which will scarce quench the thirst of a sandy Countrey. It is thus also in men, that propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of meat surfetteth, and surchargeth the stomacks of some, which is not enough to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the hunger of others, especially of those, who being young, have hot and quick disge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, of those who living in a cold clymate, and thereby have the heat of their stomacks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, of those whose stomacks are strong, by reason of their labour and travell; and not to speake of the disease, called (<hi>Boulamya</hi>) mens natures being thus diverse, by what standard shall I measure them? let this be the rule, hee shall be arraigned and condemned before God, for <hi>Gluttony</hi> in the quantity of meat, who hath

eaten so much, as thereby hee is disabled, either in part, or wholly, to serve God, in his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, or particular calling, be his age, clymate, or temper whatsoever.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In quality, and that foure wayes, 1. When the meat is too young, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.19. <hi>Thou shalt not seeth a Kid in his Mothers milke</hi>; that is, thou shalt not eat it before it hath age, to bee just and firme flesh: Circumcision was deferred till the eighth day; one reason ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by Divines, is because a Child before that time, is not <hi>Caro consolidata</hi>; and sure there is a time, before which Beasts and Fowles are not sollid, fast, and lawfull to bee eaten. I must confesse, wee are to live by the creatures death, they being borne are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to dye, for our necessity, or pleasure; and these condemned persons desire not a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, but deserve a Reprive, that they may be respited, and reserved so long, till they bee good and wholesome food, and not clapt into the Gluttons bowels, before they be scarce out of their Mothers belly. Secondly, when the meat is too costly; thus <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> macera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an Vnion, a Pearle of an inestimable worth, and dranke it in a health to <hi>Marke An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>; a deed of hers as vaine, as the other wicked, when she poysoned her selfe. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when the meats are onely incentives, and provocations to lusts, in some kind thereof; I could instance, were I not afraid to teach sin,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:27228:77"/>
by confuting it. Why is the Furnace made seven times hotter; then ever it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? Is not the Devill of himselfe suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently mischievous? Is not our owne cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of it selfe sufficiently forward? yea, head-long to evill? But also wee must advantage them by our owne folly. Have wee vowed in our Baptisme to fight against, and doe wee our selves, send Armour, and Munition to our Enemy? yea, many set their owne houses on fire, and then complaine they burne, <hi>Labor est inhibere volantes, parcere puer stimulis, &amp; fortiùs utere <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> loris.</hi> Lastly, when the Meat is such, as is onely to increase Appetite; when one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is plentifully fed. Such is the cruelty of the Spanish Inquisition; that when they have brought a man to the doore of death, they will not let him goe in, when by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite tortures, they have almost killed him; then by comfortable Cordials they doe againe revive him: And whereas of God it is appoynted, for all men once to dye: these mens cruelty makes men to dye often. Thus men, when they have stabbed and killed hunger with plentifull eating, with sauce, and salt meats of purpose, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store it againe to life; and for severall times, according to their owne pleasures, kill and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, stab and revive their appetites.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the manner of eating. 1. Greedily
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:27228:77"/>
without giving thankes to God: Like Hogs, eating up the Maske, not looking up to the hand that shaketh it downe. It is said of the Israelites, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.6. <hi>The people sate downe to eate and to drinke</hi>; there is no mention of Grace before Meate; and rose up to play, there is no mention of Grace after. Secondly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Constantly, <hi>Dives</hi> fared deliciously every day; there was no Friday in his weeke, nor Fast in his Almanack, nor Lent in his yeare: whereas the Moone is not alwayes in the full, but hath as well a wayning, as a waxing; the Sea is not alwayes in a Spring-tide, but hath as well an Ebbing, as a Flowing; and surely the very Rule of Health will dictate thus much to a man, not alwayes to hold a constant tenure of Feasting, but sometimes to abate in their dyets. Lastly, when they eat their meats studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> resolving all the powers of their mind upon meat, singing <hi>Requiems</hi> in their soul, with the Glutton in the Gospel, <hi>Soule take thine ease, &amp;c.</hi> And whereas we are to eat to live, these only live to eat. Let us therfore beware of the sin of <hi>Gluttony,</hi> and that for these Motives.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because it is the sin of <hi>England</hi>;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mot.</hi> 1.</note> for though without Vsurpation, we may intitle our selves to the pride of the Spanish, Jealousie of the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, Wantonnesse of the French, Drunkennes of the Dutch, and Lazinesse of the Irish; and though these out-landish sins have of late bin naturalized and made free Denisons of <hi>England</hi>

It is said of old men, that they are twise children; the same is true of this old doting World, it doth now revert, and relapse into the same sinnes, whereof it was guilty in the Infancy, wee on whom the ends of the World are come, are given to the sinnes of <hi>Gluttony,</hi> as in the dayes of <hi>Noah.</hi>
               </p>

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mot</hi> 3.</note>The third Motive is from the time, <hi>These seven full Eares, these seven fat Kine</hi>; these seven weekes of Feasting, betweene Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas and Shrovetide are past; these seven leane Eares, these seven leane Kine, the seven Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting Weeks in Lent, are now begun: Practise therefore the counsell, which <hi>Salomon</hi> gives, <hi>Prou.</hi> 23.1. <hi>When thou sittest to eate with a Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, consider diligently what is before thee, and put thy knife to thy throat, if thou beest a man given to thy appetite.</hi> This is thy throat, that nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row passage of Importance, guard it with thy knife, as with a Halbert, that no superfluous meat passe that way, to betray thy soule to <hi>Gluttony.</hi> But it is to be feared, that wee will rather turne the backs of our knifes, then the edges; I meane we will use little violence to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:27228:78"/>
represse and restraine our owne Greedinesse, that our knifes may therefore bee the sharper; let these Whet-stones set an edge on them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Consider the Bread that thou eatest, is the Bread that perisheth: And our Saviour saith, <hi>Labour not for the meat that perisheth, but for that which endureth to everlasting life</hi>: Biscate is but perishing Bread, though it may laste two yeares; for what is two yeares to Eternity?</p>
               <p n="2">2. We shall perish that eate the meat, but God shall destroy both it and that: And then the Glutton which hath playd the Epicure on meat, whist he lived, the wormes shall play the Epicures on him when he is dead; and whilst the temperate Man shall give them but ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary commons, the larded Glutton shal afford them plentifull exceedings. To conclude this point, wary was the practise of <hi>Iob, Iob</hi> 1.5. <hi>Who after the dayes of his sons feasting, were gone about, offered burnt Offerings to God for them; for he said, it may be my sonnes have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So sith <hi>Gluttony</hi> is so subtill a sinne, and so hard to be discerned, when we have beene at a great Feast in the day; Let us sacrifice our prayers to God, and sue out a Pardon from him, lest peradventure in the heart of our mirth, without our knowledge, and against our will we have inseverably been overtaken with the sin of <hi>Gluttony.</hi>

Text, to be perswaded of faith dwelling in in him, with whom hee hath beene thus long, and intimately acquainted.

One complayned to a Philosopher; that it was an hard thing to find a wise man. It is true (said hee) for hee must first bee a wise man that seekes him, and knowes when hee hath found him: So that on the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it is not one wise man, but two wise men, must meete together. So it is an hard thing to know true Sanctity in another man; because hee must have true Piety in himselfe, that knowes it, or else hee is an Incompetent Iudge, to passe a Verdict on a another. Let us therefore labour first to

Now hee said in his heart, (I could not have told his thoughts, except first hee had told them mee)

hee will surely come out to mee, and stand and call on the name of the Lord, his God, and strike his hand over the place, and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Leper: Thus hee thought, that the very noyse of the wheels of his Chariot, should call <hi>Elisha</hi> to come to him, because hee was Captaine of the Hoast of Syria, hee thought to be Commander of Gods Prophet, and hee expected a great deale of service from him, and truly hee might expect it: For the Prophet beate him at his owne weapon, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot him in his owne bow, out-stated him in statelinesse it selfe.</p>

            <p>By the way, I dare boldly say, <hi>Elisha</hi> in himselfe was not proud at other times, hee could fare hardly on Barley Loaves, and feed hungerly on plaine pottage; but at this time his affecting of state, was both lawfull and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary. First it was the sight of <hi>Naamans</hi> shoe, which made <hi>Elisha</hi> so high in the Instep; with the stately, hee would be stately; the rather because hee did perceive that <hi>Naaman</hi> must bee humbled, before hee could bee healed, and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:27228:86"/>
the proud flesh first taken out of his heart, ere the putrid flesh could bee cured in his body. Secondly, <hi>Naaman,</hi> though hee was a Prince, yet hee was but a Pagan; and in this respect, the lowest Hebrew was higher than hee; <hi>Elisha</hi> therefore would teach him to learne himselfe; that hee was not proper to receive so great favours, as being but a Goat, and no lost sheepe of the Fold of Israel. Lastly, <hi>Elisha</hi> was an extraordinary man, hee might well stand upon termes of double distance, who had a double portion of <hi>Elijah's</hi> Spirit.</p>
            <p>You my Brethren of the Ministery, let us know, that wee succeed to the office, but not to the Eminencies, to the place, but not to the personall perfections of the Prophet <hi>Elisha.</hi> And let us know, that Humility is our Honour and Crowne; so that except wee be forced unto it against our wils, <hi>Se defendendo,</hi> to maintaine the Honour of God, and our office, to stand upon our points, let us leaving the Patterne of <hi>Elisha's</hi> state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, rather follow the president of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Humility, <hi>I was made all things to all men, that by all meanes I might gaine some.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Wise men must sometimes follow the counsell of their Inferiours, as</hi> Naaman <hi>did of his servants.</hi> The reason is, that wise men may bee decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in those actions, wherein they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are parties, and interested, it is possible that Passion, prejudice, and Partiality one, or all of these, like so many Pearles, may blind the eyes of your Iudgement. Whereas such as looke on, may see more then those that play the game, and though in other respects their
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:27228:88"/>
judgements be farre inferiour, yet herein they may be more cleare, because lesse ingaged: Yea, <hi>Salomon</hi> himselfe, though the wisest of Kings had a Counsell of aged men, that stood before him. And though this might seeme but the lighting of so many Candles to the Sun, yet no doubt hee knew wisely to make use of them, who in wisedome were farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath him. I have seene a dull Whet-stone set an edge on a Knife: yea, the wisest of men need not thinke scorne to learne of the worst of men, when we may be taught, not to take car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king care by the Lillies, and yet providently to provide from the Pismire.</p>
               <p>But then especially are wee to listen to the counsell of Inferiours, whose advise we know proceeds from a loving heart, and is aymed and levelled at our good, especially if they be such, that our credit and profit is imbarked in the same bottome with theirs, together they sinke, and together they swim; so that wee cannot suspect, dare not deny, and must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that their advise lookes straight forward at our good, and squints not aside at any sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster respect. Wherefore, sometimes let <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> hearken to <hi>Sarah,</hi> his wife, <hi>Moses</hi> the Iew, to <hi>Iethro</hi> the Gentile; <hi>David</hi> the Soveraigne, to <hi>Ioab</hi> the subject; yea, let not <hi>Apollo,</hi> though eloquent, and mighty in Scripture, thinke scorne to learne his Christ-crosse from <hi>Aquila,</hi> and <hi>Priscilla.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:27228:88"/>Yet when Inferiours presume to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their counsell to their Superiours, let it be qualified with these cautions.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Let them doe it seasonably, in a fit op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity. Now opportunity is the Spirits of time extracted, or the quintessence of time at large, distilled, and such an opportunity must he waite for, who hopes to doe any good by his advise to his betters. <hi>Abigail</hi> was excellent hereat, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.36. <hi>Shee told her Husband</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal, <hi>nothing lesse or more, untill the Morning light:</hi> Either because shee would not cast the pearle of her good counsell before a Swine, wallowing in Drunkennesse; or because shee thought her physicke would worke the better with him, if shee gave it him fasting.</item>
                  <item>2. It must be done secretly. An open re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe of our betters, is little better than a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell. True it is, wee Ministers may publikely, (when occasion is offered us) reprove the vices of those, who in outward respects are far our Superiours, yet we must doe it Publikely, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly; publikely for the place, secretly for the manner. We are not to make in the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit such an Hue and Cry after the Offender, that the capacity of the meanest may take him on suspition, whom we meane. No, let us deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our Doctrine in common, and let the guilty conscience inclose it to it selfe.</item>
                  <item>3. They must doe it with all reverence, and humility, as the servants of <hi>Naaman,</hi> in my

But surely were our eyes anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with that Eye-salve, mentioned, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.18. then (as Heraulds account the plainest Coats, the most ancient) better then those of a later Edition, which are so full of fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that they are empty of honour) wee should see the inward state in the outward simplicity, and inward Majesty, in the outward meannesse of Gods Ordinance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When one of his Courtiers shewed the Great Turke the Sword of <hi>Scanderbag<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

But if they saw the Arme of God, with what a mighty strength hee enforceth these Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and how his invisible Grace attendeth them, they would be of another mind; Gaze then no longer on <hi>Ehuds</hi> hand, for that was lame, or on his Dagger, for that was short; but looke on Gods finger in <hi>Ehuds</hi> hand, and that can worke wonders.

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:27228:90"/>
Creame, Oyle, Spittle, and other Ingredients, which I as little know what they be, as they know why they use them. Yea all their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, is not onely made sweet, but lus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to the palate of flesh, and they plainely shew by their baits, what fish they angle to catch; namely, rather to get mens senses, then their soules, and their eyes then their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Not that I am displeased with neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or plead for nastinesse in Gods service; surely God would have the Church his Spouse, as not an Harlot, so not a Slut; and indeed outward Decencie in the Church, is an Harbinger to provide a lodging for inward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion to follow after. But wee would not have Religion so bedaubed with lace, that one cannot see the cloath, and Ceremonies which should adorne, obscure the substance of the Sacraments, and Gods worship. And let us labour to be men in Christianity, and not only like little children to goe to Schoole, to looke on the guilt and gaudy Babies of our Bookes, and to be allured to Gods service, by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward pomp and splendor of it. But let us love religion not for her clothes, but for her face, and then shall wee affect it, if shee should chance (as God forbid) to bee either naked, through poverty, or ragged through persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In a word, if God hath appointed it, let us love the plainenesse of his Ordinance, though therin there be neither warm water, nor strong

water, nor sweet water, but plaine water of Iordan.</p>
               <p>Come we now to the <hi>Quoties,</hi> how often? He dipped himselfe seven times; that is, hee went in, and washed himselfe, and came out againe, and went in, and washed himselfe, and came out againe, and so till the seventh time. Thou therefore, whosoever thou art, who art afflicted in body or mind, or any other way, doe not grudge against God, and grieve in thy selfe, if thy paine be not eased in an instant, if thy malady bee not removed in a moment: O tarry the Lords leisure (the Lords pleasure is the Lords leisure) waite and attend his time: Thinke not that thou shalt not be cured at all, because thou art not all cured at once. <hi>Naaman</hi> himselfe was not compleatly cleansed at the first entrance into <hi>Iordan,</hi> but it cost him seven times washing.</p>
               <p>The number of seven is most remarkeable in Holy Writ, and passeth for the Emblem of perfection, or compleatnesse, as well it may, consisting of an Vnity in the middle, guarded and attended with a Trinity on either side. Once I must confesse, I find this number of seven to be defective, and too little; and yet the correction, and supplying thereof, still runs on a septinary number: <hi>Shall I forgive my Brother seven times? yea said our Saviour, seventy seven times.</hi> If any aske, why God pitched on this number, and imposed on <hi>Naaman</hi>; the best
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:27228:91"/>
answer I can make, shall be in the words of our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. <hi>Even so Father, because it pleased thee well: Naaman</hi> was bid to wash seven times, and hee did wash seven times: Hence observe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wee must observe Gods Commandements,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doct.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>both in matter and manner, both in substance and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance:</hi> But some will say, had <hi>Naaman</hi> washed once more, or lesse, under or over se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times, would so small a matter have broken any squares? and would God have imposed any penalty on so sleight a forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? I answer, things that are small in themselves swell great, when they are either forbidden, or commanded by God: Looke upon <hi>Lots</hi> Wife, looking backe with carnall eyes, and it will seeme a small offence: O how flesh and blood could easily be her Advocate, to plead for her? What if she did look back? Shee did no more, and could doe no lesse, and be a Mother; Would you have her to bee a Pillar of stone, before shee was a Pillar of salt; I meane so hard, so remorselesse, as not to send one farewell glance, to that unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Citie, wherein shee had so much kindred and acquaintance: VVell, however we must know, the Offence was most hainous, by the heavinesse of the punishment inflicted upon her.</p>
               <p>And as it is thus in small things forbidden, so is it in small things commanded. They must
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:27228:92"/>
bee precisely observed: In those generall Maps of the world, which are usually made in a sheet of paper; the least prick or poynt which can bee made with a pen, extends to five mile at the least: But I say the smallest Deviation and Declination, the least imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Deflection, from the commanded will of God, is an infinite distance from it, as breaking the command of an infinite God, and deserveth infinite punishment. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve therefore, not onely all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable, but all things in Gods will: For indeed all things therein are considerable; not onely every Syllable, but every <hi>Iota,</hi> the least Letter; yea every prick, Comma, and Accent, hath his Emphasis, and must bee pronounced in our practise: As <hi>Moses</hi> therefore in making the Tabernacle, made it in all things alike, to the Patterne hee saw in the Mount, not a Knop or a Bole, or an Almond in the Candlestick, under or over; not a Bell or a Pomegranate in <hi>Aarons</hi> Coat, more or lesse; but <hi>Concordat Copia cum Originali:</hi> The transcript agreed with the Originall in all things; so let us precisely follow the instructions God giveth us; let us not willingly bee <hi>Hetroclites</hi> from his will; either Defectiues, to doe too little, or Redundants, to doe too much; but let us bee truely regular, not washing more then seven times, with the superstitious man,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:27228:92"/>
nor lesse then seven times with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane man; but with <hi>Naaman</hi> in my Text, just seven times.</p>

Here is a little Child to bee cured of a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosie: For so may Originall Corruption fitly bee called: First for the Hereditarinesse of it, it is a successive disease, entayled from Father to Child, ever since the fall of our first Parent <hi>Adam:</hi> Secondly, from the over-spreading nature thereof, the Infection defiling all the powers of our soules, and parts of our bodies. Here also is the water of <hi>Iordan</hi> to wash it away, since Christ washed <hi>Iordan,</hi> by being washed in it, hee hath given it a power to cleanse our Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall Corruption: Some Theeves have eat off their Irons, and fretted off their Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with Mercury water; but there is no way to worke off the Chaines of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Corruption, whereby our feet are hurt in the Stocks, the Irons have entred into our soules; but onely by the VVater in Baptisme: Onely the Maiden-head, and Virginity of the water, in the Poole of <hi>Bethesda,</hi> was medicinall to cure Diseases; hee that came first was cured; the second got no profit. But in our <hi>Iordan,</hi> our Water in the Font; the vertue thereof is
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:27228:93"/>
not lessened in the using, the Child that is last baptized, shall receive as much benefit, as that which is first washed therein.</p>
               <p>But herein I must confesse, there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence on the cure of <hi>Naaman,</hi> and this Child, he was totally, and perfectly cleansed from his Leprosie; but this Child is wash't but in part, so farre as is Gods pleasure. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning power of Originall Corruption is drowned in the Font; but though the bane be removed, the blot doth remaine, the guilt is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, the blemish is retayned, the sting is gone, the staine doth stay; which if not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to, cannot damne this Infant, though it may hereafter defile it: Secondly, the finall peaceable-commanding power, is washed away in the Laver of Regeneration; though afterwards it may dwell in us: it shall not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineere over us; it may remaine there as a slave, not as a Soveraigne sure not as a lawfull one, be he ever resisted, often subdued, though never expelled. These things deserve larger Prosecution, but this is none of <hi>Ioshua's</hi> day, wherein the Sunne standeth still, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I must conclude with the time.</p>

               <hi>The factious affecting one Pastor above another, is very dangerous.</hi> Indeed wee may, and must give a <hi>famous part</hi> of Reverence, and a <hi>Benjamins Portion</hi> of respect, to those, who (<hi>Data paritate in ceteris</hi>) excell in age, paines, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Parts and Piety.

            <p>

            <p>I confesse, wee that either have, or intend to take on us the high calling, and holy Function of the Clergy, ought to endeavour by Gods Grace, so to qualifie our selves, that our affections never mistake the true object, nor exceed their due measure: But alas such is our misery (rather to bee bemoaned, then amended; the perfect removing whereof, is more to be desired, then hoped for) that as long as wee carry Corruption about us, wee are men <hi>subject to like Passion with others.</hi> Hence is it come to passe, that as the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.1. Murmured against the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes, <hi>Because their Widdowes were neglected in the daily Ministration:</hi> So Ministers will find themselves agrieved, that people in the partiall dispencing of their respect, passe them by unregarded. Perchance the matter may fly so high, as it did betwixt <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Numb.</hi> 12.2. <hi>And they said, hath the Lord indeed spoken onely by Moses? Hath hee not spoken also by us?</hi> It will anger not only <hi>Saul,</hi> a meere carnall man, but even those that have degrees of Grace, <hi>Hee hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted his thousands, but such a one his ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands:</hi> These discords betwixt Ministers, I could as heartily wish they were false; as I doe certainely know, they are too true.</p>

            <p>Lastly,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Misch.</hi> 4.</note> it will cause great Dishonour to God himselfe, his Ordinance in the meane time being neglected. Heare is such do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the Dish, there is no regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Dainties: Such looking on the Embassadour, there is no notice taken of the King, that sent him. Even <hi>Maries</hi> Complaynt is now verified: <hi>They have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away the Lord, and placed him, I know not where.</hi> And as in times of Popery: <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> dispossessed our Saviour of his Church: in Canterbury (instead of Christ's Church, being called Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> Church): And whereas rich Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations were made to the Shrine of that supposed Saint, <hi>Summo Altari nil:</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was offered to Christ at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion-Table: So whilest some Sacrifice the Reverence to this admired Preacher, and others almost adored this affected Pastor:
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:27228:97"/>
God in his Ordinance is neglected, and the Word being the savour of life, is had in respect of persons.</p>
            <p>To prevent these mischiefes, both Pastors and people must lend their helping hands. I begin with the Pastors, and first with those whose Churches are crowded with the thickest audience.</p>
            <p>Let them not pride themselves, with the bubble of popular applause, often as causelesly gotten, as undeservedly lost. Have wee not seene those that have preferred the Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Flesh-pots of Egypt, before hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Manna, Lungs before Braynes; and sounding of a voyce, before soundnesse of matter. Well, let Princes count the credit of their Kingdomes to consist in the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of their Subjects: Farre bee it from a Preacher, to glory when his Congregation swels to a Tympany, by the Consumption of the Audience of his Neighbour Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</p>
            <p>Yea, when Pastors perceive people trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with an immoderate Admiration of them, let them labour to confute them in their groundlesse humours. When Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> would have worshipped the Angel, <hi>See thou dost it not</hi> (saith hee) <hi>worship God.</hi> So when people post head-long, in affecting their Pastors, they ought to wave and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline this popular honour, and to seeke to
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:27228:97"/>
transmit and fasten it on the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Christ went into the Wildernesse, when the people would have made him a King: Let us shun, yea fly such dangerous Honour, and teare off our heads, such wreathes, as people would tye on them, striving rather to throw Mists, and Clouds of Privacy on our selves, then to affect a shining appearance: But know, whosoever thou art, who herein art an Epicure, and lovest to glut thy selfe with peoples ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause, thou shalt surfet of it, before thy death, it shall prove at the last pricks in thy eyes, and thornes in thy side, a great affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, if not a ruine unto thee, because sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegiously, thou hast robbed God of his Honour.</p>
            <p>Let them labour also to ingratiate every Pastor, who hath tolerability of desert with his owne Congregation. It was the Boone <hi>Saul</hi> begg'd of <hi>Samuel, Honour me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my people</hi>: And surely it is but reason, wee should seeke to grace the Shepherd in the presence of his Flock, though perchance privately wee may reprove him, disgrace him not publikely before those that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him.</p>
            <p>I am come now to neglected Ministers, at whose Churches, <hi>Solitudo ante ostium,</hi> and within them too, whilst others (perchance lesse deserving) are more frequented.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:27228:98"/>Let not such grieve in themselves, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine at their Brethren. When Saint <hi>Iohn Baptists</hi> Disciples told him: That all flock't to Iesus, whom hee baptized beyond <hi>Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan: I must decrease</hi> (answered hee) <hi>and hee must increase.</hi> Never fret thy selfe, or vexe out thy soule, if others bee preferred before thee, they have their time, they are <hi>Crescents</hi> in their waxing, full Seas in their flowing: Envie not at their Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. <hi>The Starres in their course did fight against Sisera</hi>; thy course of credit may chance to bee next, thy turne of Honour may chance to come after. One told a Grecian <hi>Statist,</hi> who had excellently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served of the Citie hee lived in: That the Citie had chosen foure and twenty Officers, and yet left him out: I am glad (said hee) the Citie affords twenty foure abler than my selfe: So let Ministers triumph, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in this, that the Church yeilds so many men, better meriting then themselves, and be farre from taking exception thereat.</p>
            <p>And let us practise Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Precept, by Honour and Dishonour, by good Report and Disreport: Seven yeares have I served God in good esteeme, and well respected, by the time I have served God so long in disgrace and reproach, perchance the Circulation of my credit may returne, and with patience I may regaine the esteeme I have lost; and if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:27228:98"/>
let him say with <hi>David, Lord here I am, doe with thy servant as thou pleasest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this time mee thinkes, I heare the people saying unto mee, as the Souldiers to <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Remedy</hi> 1.</note> but what shall wee doe? Now the Counsell I commend to you, is this. First, ever preserve a reverent esteeme of the Minister, whom God hath placed over thee. For if a Sparrow lighteth not on the ground without Gods especiall Providence, surely no Minister is bestowed in any Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, without a more immediate and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar disposing of God, and surely their owne Pastor is best acquainted with their diseases; and therefore best knoweth to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply spirituall Physicke thereunto. And as Gods Word hath a generall Blessing on every place, so more particularly is it sanctified and blessed there, to those Parishioners from the mouth of their lawfull Minister. Let not therefore the Sermon of a stranger, who perchance makes a Feast of set purpose, to entertaine new Guests, be preferred before the paines of thy owne Minister, who keeps a constant house, and a set Table, each Lords day, feeding his owne family. Wherefore, let all the Ephesians confine themselves to their <hi>Timothy</hi>; Cretians to their <hi>Titus</hi>; every Congregation to their proper Pastor. And I hope Pastors considering the solemne oath they tooke at their Institution, and the profit
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:27228:99"/>
they receive from their people, and how irrationall it is to take wages, and doe no worke, and the heavie account they must make at the day of Iudgement, will provide Milke in their brests, for those who must suck of them. As for those, whose necessary occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions doe command their absence from their Flocks, let them be Curats of their Curats; over-see such, whom they appoynt to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see their people. <hi>Columella</hi> gives this counsell to Husband-men, never keepe a horse to doe that worke, which may be done by an Asse; both because Asses are of a lower price, and cheaper kept: But God forbid Ministers should observe this Rule, and so consult with their profit, as to provide unworthy Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes, to save charges.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Remedy</hi> 2.</note>Let them not make odious comparisons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Ministers of eminent parts: It is said of <hi>Hezechiah,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.5. <hi>That after him, was none like him, of all the Kings of Iudah, neither any that were before him.</hi> It is said also of King <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi> 2 King. 23.25. <hi>And like unto him, there was no King before him, that turned to the Lord with all his heart, and with all his soule, and with all his might; neither after him rose up any like him:</hi> The Holy Spirit prefers neither for better, but concludes both for best; and so amongst Ministers, when each differs from others, all may bee excellent in their kinds. As in comparing severall handsome persons,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:27228:99"/>
one surpasseth for the beauty of a naturally painted face: A second for the feature of a well proportioned body: A third for a grace of Gesture, and Comelinesse of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: so that Iustice it selfe may bee puzled, and forced to suspend her Verdict, not knowing where to adjudge the Victory: So may it bee betwixt severall Pastors. Ones Excellency may consist, in the unsnarling of a knowne controversie; an other in plaine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding of Scripture, to make it portable in the weakest memory. One the best <hi>Boanar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> an other the best <hi>Barnabas:</hi> Our Iudgements may bee best informed by one, our Affections moved by a second; our lives reformed by a third: I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded there is no Minister in England, for his Endowments like <hi>Saul, Higher then his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, from the shoulders upwards</hi>; But rathes some hundreds like the Pillars in <hi>Salomons</hi> House, all of a height: But grant some in parts farre inferiour to others: was not <hi>Abishai,</hi> a valiant, and worthy Captaine, though hee attayned not to the Honour of the first three? And may not many bee ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable in the Church, though not to bee ranked in the first forme, for their sufficiencie?</p>
            <p>Let them entertaine this for a certaine truth, That the Efficacy of Gods Word de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends not on the parts of the Minister; but on Gods blessing, on his Ordinance: Indeed
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:27228:100"/>
there is a Generation of Preachers, that come upon the Stage, before ever they were in the Tyring-house, whose backwardnesse in the Vniversity, makes them so forward in the Countrey; where what they lack in Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they supply in boldnesse: I could wish, that as <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.19. <hi>When Hagars Bottle of water was spent, God opened her eyes, and shee went to the Fountaine againe</hi>; So when these Novices have emptied their store of set Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons they brought with them, that their Parents would remit them backe to the Vniversity, the Fountaine of Learning and Religion, to furnish themselves with a better stocke of sufficiencie: Such Ministers as these, I account as none at all; but as for those that have the <hi>Minimum ut sic,</hi> the least degree of tolerability, to enable them in some measure, to discharge their Office: God may bee, and often is, as effectuall in, and by them; as by <hi>Rabbies,</hi> of farre greater parts.</p>
            <p>To conclude, let us with one mind, and one mouth, advance the Glory of God, that thereby the Gospel may bee graced, Wicked men amazed; some of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; the rest of them confounded: weake Christians confirmed, to the griefe of Devils, Ioy of Angels, Honour of God himselfe: Amen.</p>
