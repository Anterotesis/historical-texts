         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

we do hold, &amp; defend, that the grace

And that is in dede, the ryght, and

teth, that we do attribute: &amp; aſcribe

that it is not gyuen after oure me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.
But they rather do make the

be deſtenye, whiche do ſaye, that
wher as no merit, or deſeruing is,
there is deſtenye. For accordynge
to the ſaying of the pelagians, ther
can be found no merits in younge

are ſent vp to heauen, and ſom ſhit
forth from thens. And lykewiſe, as
I haue declared, and proued now,
that the grace of god is not giuen
after any merit (whiche thinge I
thought good to proue, as well by

treated, ful of mercy &amp; good fruits
without grudging &amp; diſſimulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
Do you ſe &amp; perceiue (I pray you)
how many &amp; how greate vertues,
this wyſedome hath, whiche com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
doune fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the father of light?
For euery good gyft. &amp; euery per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte
gyft (as he ſayeth) is frome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue,
&amp; commeth doune frome the
father of lyghtes.</p>
               <p>To be ſhort we do rebuke thoſe,
which ar vnchaſte and contentios
perſons, and yet we do preche and
teche vnto them, that the wyſdom
which is chaſte, and gentyl, is the
gyft of god, hauing no doubt nor
fearing leſt they, whom we do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
(when they are not certayne to
whom god doth giue this wiſdom)
ſhulde by this preachinge take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to fall into deſperation, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than to receiue any fruyte of
good exhortation. And agayne,
<pb facs="tcp:8879:161"/>
fearing nothing, that they by oure
rebukyng of their vyce, ſhulde not
only not be moued agenſt them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
but agenſt vs, becauſe we do
rebuke them, which haue not thoſe
vertues, which vertues we do ſay
are not broughte forth by the wyll
of man, but ar geuen liberallye by
the bountefull goodnes of god.</p>
               <p>Wherfore did not the preachinge
of this grace pluck backe the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell
Iames, frome rebukynge of
them, and ſaying vnto them, theſe
wordes: Yf you haue the zeale of
anger and ſtrife in your hartes, be
nothinge proude therat, nor yet ly
not againſt the veritie. For that is
not the wyſedome, which commeth
downe from aboue, but it is an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thly
wyſedome, a beaſtly, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelyſh
wyſedome. For where as
zeale, and contention is, ther is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtedfaſtnes,
and all euyll workes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8879:162"/>
Lykwiſe then, as we may, by the
authoritie of the holy ſcriptures, &amp;
as our own dedes do make menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the ſame doing (I ſaye theyr
dedes as wel as ours) rebuke thoſe
perſons whiche are vnquiete, and
troublous, although we do preach
that the wiſedome, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell
nameth, is the gyfte of God,
which wiſedome doth amend, and
correct thoſe that are contentiouſe,
and brawlynge perſons: euen ſoo,
thoſe perſons, whiche are vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and thoſe, which do not conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
in the faith whiche they haue
receiued, (although we do preache,
and tech the grace of god, wherby
both fayth it ſelf, and perſeuerance
therein ar declared to be the gyfts
of god) maye alſo be rebuked and
toulde of their vnfaithfulnes, and
vnſtedfaſtnes. For although, that,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> godly wiſdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is obteyned thorow

faith (according to the ſaying of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>

him aſke it boldly in faith, hauing
no miſtruſt) yet we muſte not ſaye,
becauſe we obteyne that wyſedom
thorow faith, therefore faith is of
our ſelfe, &amp; not the gift of god. For
faith is gyuen to him which hathe
receiued it, before it is aſked or pra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>yed
for. For the apoſtel Paul ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
playnly and openly, ſayinge,
Peace be to the brethren, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
with fayth from god oure fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and our lorde Ieſu Chriſte.
From whom we haue peace a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
from hym haue we fayth.</p>
               <p>For the whiche cauſe. we doo
deſyre, and praye, that in them
<pb facs="tcp:8879:163"/>
them which haue alredy receuyd
the fayth, he wold encreſe it, and to
them whiche haue it not, that he
wolde vouchſafe to gyue it. And
alſo, thei them ſelf, which do cauſe
vs to make al theſe wordes, which
do crye out, that the prechinge of
predeſtinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and of grace, is a let
and ſtop that men can not exhorte
frutfully, as they might, if predeſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tination
were not ſpoken of, theye
I ſaye, them ſelfe do not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
men vnto thoſe vertuſe, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
they do hold to be of them ſelfe
(as the begynnyng of fayth, and
the continuance therin, to thend)
which thing they are bound to do
that by ther exhortations thei whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ch
are vnfaithful may beleue, and
the other to continew ſtyll therin,
but they do exhorte them to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vertuſe alſoo, whiche are the
gifts of god (as thei ſay) only and
<pb facs="tcp:8879:163"/>
not the other.</p>
               <p>But as toching thoſe thinges
which they do confeſſe againſt the
pelagians error to be the gyfts of
god, as chaſtyte, continency, paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and other vertuſe perteyning
to a godly lyfe, which ar obteyned

for other, that he woulde gyue
thoſe vertus vnto them, and not
that they ſholde exhorte and byd

               <p>For ſomych then as thei do exhort
people to theſe vertuſe alſo,<note place="margin">The begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and the middes of our lyfe, are the gyftes of god</note> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
they do confeſſe to be the gifts

and in that they do exhort men vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to
them (declaring themſelfe to be

men) they do ſufficiently manifeſt,
&amp; make open vnto vs, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge
of predeſtination, &amp; of the

that, that men ſhulde exhorte other
vnto faith, and perſeueraunce to
the end, forſomuch as we do prech,
that theſe alſo, (that is to ſay) fayth
and perſeueraunce are the gyftes
of god, and that no man hath theſe
gyftes of hym ſelf, but ar gyuen to
hym of god.</p>
               <p>But yet no man can deny, but that
it is his own fault &amp; blame, what
ſoeuer he be, whiche doth forſake
this faith, in geuing place to tenta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cion,
whereby he is broughte fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
faith, which he hath receyued. And
again, although it be his own fault
that he doth go from the faithe, we
may not therfor deny, that the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of perſeuerance to the end, is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
gift of god. For, for this ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance
<pb facs="tcp:8879:164"/>
iv. faith to thenv, that man
doth make his daily petition, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch

And yf his prayer be hard, he
dothe receyue hys petytyon.</p>
               <p>And ſo by that reaſon, prayenge
dayly that he myght perſeuer &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu,
he doth not ſet the hope of his
perſeuerance &amp; ſtedfaſtnes in hym
ſelfe, but in god, I wyl not amply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fye,
&amp; exaggerate the matter with
many more wordes, but rather I
wyl leue it to them to think, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelf what maner a thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
they haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to perſwade,
which is, that by the preching &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
of predeſtinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the herers
therof ſhuld receiue more cauſe of
deſperation, than frute of godly ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hortacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
Which is as much to ſay
as men ar taught to deſpair of ſal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uation,
when they do learne to put
their confidence not in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelf but
in god. And yet the prophet doth

cry out with a loud voyce ſaying:

though this queſtyon (wher ar the

had byn demaunded of hym:
he aunſweryd incontynetly theſe

ſelf, that, by and for the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynning,

               <p>And againe if we wold ſay that

to begin. And ſo after this faſhion
they do conclude, that the grace of

But if both to gither, as wel to be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gin,
as to make an end, ar the gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ts
of god, and alſo if he knowethe

the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt predeſtination be pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chid,
that the right, and trew grace
of god (that is to ſay) which is not
gyuen after any humain meritts,
maye with al power and ſtrength
be defendid. And as tochinge my
ſelfe, in the boke which I wrotte,
entituled (of correction &amp; of grace)
which worke coulde not ſatiſfie &amp;
