         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The ſerious conſideration hereof, hath often made me wonder, why many Popiſh treatiſes being in ſome ſort exhortations to repentance ſhould be ſo accounted of, as they are by ſome: for though I confeſſe there
<pb facs="tcp:152015:4"/>
are in ſome of them, good and hole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome meditations, and many motiues to mortification, and good life, yet would I gladly learne of any man but this one thing, how thoſe exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons can be pithie, or powerful, ſound or any way ſufficient to moue a man to repentance, when as, not thoſe bookes, nor all Poperie is able to teach a man ſufficiently what true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is.</p>
                  <p>If any man reply: I will therefore learne the doctrine out of the Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants bookes, and vſe the Papiſts for exhortation onely: I then anſwere, is it not a more compendious, and conuenient, and a leſſe ſcandalous courſe, to ſeeke exhortations out of ſuch writers, as do teach the doctrine aright? nay I doubt how it is poſſible to finde a powerfull exhortation to repentance in any Papiſt, who erres in the Doctrine: the reaſon is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, becauſe Doctrine is the ground
<pb facs="tcp:152015:4"/>
of exhortation: and if the doctrine be vnſound, how can the exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be any better. Let vs therefore leaue theſe muddic puddles, and fet our water at the fountaine: the water of life, at the fountaine of life, I mean the doctrine of faith, and repentance at the written word of God, and at ſuch mens writings as are grounded therevpon, and agreeable thereunto. <note place="margin">Deering<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:152015:5"/>
may truely ſay, that by the grace of God &amp; his good meanes principally, I am that I am: But leaning him in that glorious manſion, which Chriſt the Lord of the Harueſt hath prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for him: and now giuen him. I returne to my ſelfe, and doe humbly praiſe the Lord of heauen, who gaue mee my time in the Vniuerſitie, in thoſe happie dayes, wherein (beſide many other worthy men of God, whereof ſome are falne aſleepe, and ſome remaine aliue vnto this day) this holy man did ſpend him ſelf like a Candle to giue light vnto others:</p>
                  <p>The ſcope of all his godly ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours was to teach <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> and him crucified, and much laboured to moue all men to repentance, that as our knowledge hath made Popery aſhamed of their ignorance: ſo our holy liues might honour our holy profeſsion. And as repentance was one of the principal ends, both of his
<pb facs="tcp:152015:5"/>
continuall preaching and writing: ſoeſpecially and purpoſely hath hee twiſe dealt in that Argument.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in his Treatiſe of Repentance: publiſhed 1592. wherein briefly (as his manner was) but ſoundly, pithily, and feelingly, hee layeth downe the true doctrine, and the very nature of repentance: and after the poſitiue doctrine, hee toucheth ſome of the principall controuerſies and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in that doctrine, but afterwards thinking with himſelfe, that hee had not ſeriouſly and forcibly enough, vrged ſo great &amp; neceſſarie a Leſſon as Repentance is, therefore ſhortly after, being deſired and called to the duty of preaching, in that great, &amp; ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral aſſembly at <hi>Sturbridge-Faire,</hi> he thought it a fit time: for this neceſſary and generall exhortation to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: to the intent, that as wee were taught the doctrine of Repentance, in the former treatiſe: ſo in theſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
<pb facs="tcp:152015:6"/>
we might bee ſtirred vp to the practiſe of it. And certainly, (Good Sir:) I iudge there could haue beene no matter, more fit for that aſſembly then an exhortation to repentance, for as the audience was great and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, of all ſorts, ſexes, ages and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of men, and aſſembled out of many corners of this kingdom ſo, is this doctrine generall for all: ſome doctrines are for Parents, ſome for children, ſome for ſchollers, ſome for tradſe-men, ſome for men, ſome for women, but repentance is for all: without which, it may bee ſaid of all, and euery one of age, not one excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: No Repentance, no ſaluation</p>
                  <p>Theſe Sermons being in my hands, and not deliuered to mee from hand to hand, but taken with this hand of mine, from his owne mouth, were thought worthy for the excellencie, &amp; fit for the generallity of the matter, to be offered to the publique veiwe:
<pb facs="tcp:152015:6"/>
I haue alſo other workes of his in my hands: of which (being many,) I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe my ſelfe, to be but the keeper for the time, taking my ſelfe bounde to keepe them ſafely, to the benefite of Gods Church, of whoſe treaſure vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth I make no queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but they are a part: and I hartily deſire you (my godly friends) &amp; all other faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Chriſtians to ſolicite the Lord in prayer for me, that I may faithfully diſcharge my ſelf of that great charge which in this reſpect lyeth vpon me: and that his grace and bleſsing may be on mee, and all others, who are to be imployed in this ſeruice, wherein (had the Lord ſo pleaſed) wee could heartily haue wiſhed neuer to haue bin imployed: but that his life might haue eaſed vs of the labour: and that as I begin with this, ſo I, or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther better able (which I rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire) may goe forward, vndertaking the weight of this great burthen, and

In this ſecond he exhorts them to repentance, and withall reproueth ſome of their ſpeciall ſinnes. In the three firſt verſes he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth the Doctrine of Repentance,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:152015:16"/>
and addeth ſome ſpeciall reaſons to mooue and ſtirre them vp to the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of it. In propounding the Doctrine of repentance, he directs it to two ſorts of men. Firſt to the obſtinate and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent Iewes in the firſt and ſecond ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Secondly, to the better ſort of them, in the third. So that the ſumme and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of theſe two firſt verſes, is a briefe and ſummarie propounding of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Repentance to the obſtinate Iewes.

                  <p n="4">4. In the ſecond verſe: the time limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them, when to repent, <hi>before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree come forth</hi> that is, before God put in execution the iudgements which are already decreed &amp; appointed for them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. A forcible reaſon vrging them to doe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:152015:16"/>
it which lieth hid, and is neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in the fourth point: namely, that <hi>there is a decree againſt them,</hi> which wants nothing but execution: which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſhal come vnleſſe they repent, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they ſhal be fanned: and if they ſhall be found to be chaffe, they ſhal fly away with the winde of Gods iuſtice.

                  <p>For the firſt, the holy Ghoſt ſaith; <hi>Search your ſelues.</hi> The words are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly reade thus. <hi>Gather your ſelues,</hi> which, though it be good, for that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance a man gathereth himſelfe, and all his wits together, which afore were diſperſed, &amp; wandred vp &amp; down in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: yet <hi>I</hi> rather allow their tranſlation who read thus. <hi>Search, or fan your ſelues:</hi> but either of them may ſtand, becauſe <note place="margin">I<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>unius.</note> the word in the original doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d both ſignifications; yet it ſeemeth that to ſearch, or ſift, fits this place better, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the ſame manner of ſpeech is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards continued in the word <hi>Chaffe:</hi> ſo that the meaning of the Holy Ghoſt ſeemeth to bee this: Search, try, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:152015:17"/>
fanne your ſelues, leaſt you bee found light chaffe, and ſo fly away and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed before the iuſtice of God.</p>
                  <p>Concerning this duty of ſearching, let vs obſerue firſt, that the holy Ghoſt vrging the Iewes to repent, vſeth not the word Repentance, but bids them ſearch themſelues: yet meaning, hee, would haue them to repent: giuing vs to vnderſtand, that no man can haue true and ſound repentance, but hee who hath firſt of all ſearched and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined himſelfe: and this ſtands with good reaſon, for no man can repent, who firſt of all doth not know himſelfe, and his owne wretchedneſſe. But no man can ſee into himſelfe, nor knowe himſelfe, but hee that doth diligently ſearch himſelfe: ſo that the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all grace, is for a man to ſearch and try, and fanne himſelfe, that thereby he may knowe what is in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: that ſo vpon the ſearch, ſeeing his fearefull and damnable eſtate, hee may forſake himſelfe &amp; his owne waies and turne to the Lord. Thus ſpeaketh
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:152015:17"/>
the holy Ghoſt in the heartes of holy men; <hi>Let vs ſearch and try our waies:</hi> and <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lamen.</hi> 3.</note> make what followeth; <hi>and turne againe to the Lord:</hi> as though there were no turning againe to the Lord, but after a ſearching of our ſelues. With this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of the holy Ghoſt, agreeth the teſtimonie of al holy mens conſciences, who all knowe, that the firſt beginning of their turning to the Lord, was a ſearching of themſelues: Let any repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſinner aske his conſcience, and call to minde his firſt calling and conuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and he will remember that the firſt thing in his repentance was this; that he ſearched into himſelfe, and looked narrowly into his waies, and finding his waies dangerous, and his caſe feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, did thereupon reſolue to take a new courſe, and turne to the Lord for pardon and mercie, and for grace to enter into more holy, and more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table courſes.</p>
                  <p>The man that paſſeth vpon ridges of Mountains, and ſides of hils, or that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ouer a narrow bridge, or ſome dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:152015:18"/>
(as wee are bredde and borne) hath a vaile before his face: ſo that hee ſeeth nothing: the wrath of God and the curſe due for ſinne, Hell and damnation ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to deuoure him, he ſeeth them not, although (liuing alwaies in ſinne,) hee walketh in the very Iawes of Hell it ſelfe: and becauſe he ſeeth not this feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full daunger, therefore hee refuſeth no ſinne at all, but ruſheth ſecurely into all maner of ſinne: the night of impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and the myſt of ignorance ſo blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his eyes, that he ſeeth not the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row bridge of this life, from which if he ſlide, he falles immediatly into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But when as Gods ſpirit hath by the light of Gods word opened his eyes &amp; touched his heart to conſider his eſtate, then hee ſeeth the fraile bridge of this narrow life, and how little a ſleppe there is between him and damnation; then hee ſeeth Hell open due for his ſinnes, and himſelfe in the high way to it: ſinne being the craggy rocke, and Hell the gaping gulfe vnder it; this life
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:152015:19"/>
being the narrowe bridge, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation the ſtreame which runneth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it: Then hee wondreth at his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable eſtate, admireth the mercie of God in keeping him from falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bottome of hell, wondreth at the preſumptuous boldneſſe of his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, which ſo ſecurely plodded on towards deſtruction, and being aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of himſelfe, and theſe his waies, he turnes his heart to the God that ſaued him from theſe daungers; and ſets himſelfe into more holy wayes, and more comfortable courſes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth that ignorance made him bold, and blindneſſe made him ſo preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous; but now hee ſeeth the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and will by no meanes goe the ſame way againe: and thus the ſearching and ſeeing into the foulneſſe of ſinne, and the daunger thereof, is the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of repentance, and the firſt ſtep into grace.</p>
                  <p>This doctrine teacheth vs what faith and repentance is generall in the world: All men ſay, they beleeue, and haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented

long agoe; but trie it well, and we ſhall finde in the bodie of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but a lippe faith, and a ſippe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: for euen when they ſay ſo, they are blinde and ignorant of their owne eſtate, &amp; know not themſelues, but preſume of themſelues, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are baptized and liue in the Church, therefore they are in Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and in very good eſtate, when as they neuer yet were reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciled to God: and are ſo farre from it, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer yet ſaw any ſinnes in themſelues wherof they ſhuld repent: as a man tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelling in the night, ſeeth no daunger, but plods on without feare: So the moſt part of our common people, in the night of their ignorance, think and preſume they loue and feare God, and loue their Neighbour; and that they haue euer done ſo: Nay, it is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion that a man may do ſo by nature, and that hee is not worthy to liue, who doth not loue God with all his heart, and beleeue in <hi>Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> But alas poore ſimple ſoules, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

knewe what ſinne was, neuer ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched nor ſaw into theirown harts with the light of Gods lawe, for if they had, they ſhould haue ſeene ſuch a Sea of corruption, that then they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it to bee the hardeſt thing in the world, to loue God, and to beleeue in Chriſt, and for ſake ſinne: it is therefore manifeſt, that they haue not yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to beleeue or repent, nor haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the firſt ſtep of grace, which leadeth to repentance, for that they haue not learned this leſſon, which the Prophet teacheth: that is, to <hi>ſearch them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Furthermore, let vs in the ſecond place, obſerue better the ſignification of the word: it ſignifieth to Search nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly, as a man would doe for a piece of gold, or a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Hence wee may learne, that in true Repentance, and conuerſion, we muſt

                  <p>And further, it is a meanes alſo to preuent Gods Iudgements: for when men ſearch not themſelues, then God

ſendes the fire of afflictions, and Croſſes to trie and Search them: but, when they Search themſelues, then God ſpareth to Search them by his iudgements.</p>

for ſecret and hidden corruptions. Our liues, for committing of euil, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of good. Doe with your hearts as men doe with their wheate: they will not ſuffer their corne to lie long in the chaffe, leaſt the chaffe hurt it, but commits it to the fanne that the winde may ſeparate them: So the graces of God in our hearts are pure corne, our ſinnes and corruptions are Chaffe: looke well, and thou ſhalt finde in thy ſelfe much chaffe, and but little corne: let not then the chaffe lye too long mingled with the Corne, leſt it cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the corne. Let not thy ſinnes lye mingled with the grace of God in thee, if thou doe, they will choake it in the end, and ſo depriue thee of all grace; therfore rippe vp thy heart, and looke into thy life, and when thou haſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, enter into thy ſelfe, aske thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience what thou haſt done, &amp; be not quiet till thou haſt found out thy ſin, and the fouleneſſe of it: and neuer thinke that thou knoweſt any thing in Religion, till thou knoweſt what

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:152015:27"/>
againſt his Church, and againſt my owne ſoule?</p>
                  <p>The want of this, is that, which the Prophet complaines of in that place: not as though it were ſufficient thus to doe, in a mans owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: but becauſe it is a good begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and a ſtep to further grace. For if a man did ſeriouſly thus deale with his conſcience after his ſinne, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience would ſhape him ſuch an aunſwere, and would tell him ſo roundly, <hi>what hee had done,</hi> that hee would take heede, how hee did the ſame againe, and looke more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly, and warily to himſelfe all the dayes of his life. Seeing therefore it is ſo neceſſarie a dutie, let euery one of vs indeuour the practiſe of it, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to rippe and ranſacke our hearts, and to ſearch our wayes vnto the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome.</p>
                  <p>Now for your better inſtruction, and furtherance in the performance hereof: you muſt know that this <hi>Search</hi> is to be made by the Lawe of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:152015:28"/>
God, for nothing els, but Gods law can helpe vs, &amp; let vs ſee <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                     </hi> which we muſt ſearch for: for if wee ſearch by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means, we may ſeek &amp; ſearch long enough, ere we find any thing that wil be matter of repentance. Aske the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel, he will tell thee all is well, &amp; that thou art in an excellent eſtate: and God loues thee, and thou art ſure of Heauen: this ſong the diuell alwayes ſings for the moſt part til a man comes to die, for then hee appeares in his colours, but till then, hee laboures, to ſing, and lull all men a ſleepe in the cradle of ſecuritie. Aske our owne fleſh, &amp; our owne hearts and natures, and they will anſwere, and ſay, that all is well and ſafe, and that wee haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued, and loued and feared God all our dayes. Aske the world, and men in the world: and they will aunſwere, all is well; and they will ſay further, that thou art a right good fellow, and art worth twentie of theſe curious fooles that ſticke vpon points, &amp; ſtand vpon circumſtances, as ſwearing and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:152015:28"/>
drinking, and good fellowſhippe, and gaming, and ſuch other nice and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtanciall points: thus will worldly men anſwere: for thy prophane courſe is acceptable to them, becauſe thereby thou approueſt the ſame in them. Nay, goe further, and aske all humane lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the world, and it cannot tell thee what one ſinne is, nor what it is to offend God: ſo that there remaines onely the law of God, the light where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of will diſcloſe the darkneſſe of our hearts, and the iuſtice whereof will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale the vnrighteouſneſſe &amp; the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſneſſe of our natures: therefore to the lawe of God muſt we flye to helpe vs in this Search.</p>
                  <p>And yet for our better helpe in this dutie, and that there may bee nothing wanting to that ſoule, that ſeeketh God, therfore we are further to know, that if we will ſearch our ſelues by the law profitably, wee muſt marke three rules, the truth whereof vnleſſe wee know, acknowledge, and feele: wee
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:152015:29"/>
ſhall neuer ſee our owne eſtate, nor profite by this <hi>Search,</hi> but plodde on from finne to ſinne, vntill wee plunge into hell.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Rule is, that euery man that came from <hi>Adam,</hi> ſinned in the ſinne of <hi>Adam:</hi> Thou muſt therefore know, that his ſinne in eating the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruite, was thy ſinne: and thou ſinnedſt therein, as well as he (though thou waſt then vnborne) and that thou art guiltie of it before God, and muſt anſwere for it to Gods iuſtice, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Chriſt doe it for thee. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hereof is, becauſe we are his ſeede &amp; poſteritie, we were the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his loynes, he was the father of vs all: and was not a priuate ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as we are now, but a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like perſon, the pledge of al mankind, and bare the perſon of vs all at that time: therefore what he did then, hee did it for himſelf, &amp; for vs: what coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant God made with him, was made for himſelfe and vs: what God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, and he to God, he promiſed for himſelfe, &amp; for vs: what he receiued
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:152015:29"/>
in his Creation, he receiued for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and for vs: and what he gained or loſt by his fall, he gained and loſt for vs, as for himſelfe. He loſt the fauour of God, and originall puritie: therefore he loſt it for all his poſteritie: guiltineſſe, and Gods anger, and corruption of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which he gained, he got for vs all, as well as for himſelfe. If we doubt of this point, it is proued by the Apoſtle: where the holy Ghoſt ſaith; <hi>Sin entred by one man, and death by ſinne: and that ſinne went ouer all, and that it went ouer</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 14</note> 
                     <hi>all them, which ſinned not in the like tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion with Adam</hi> (that is, euen our children) who as they are borne, are borne not onely tainted with originall corruption: but guiltie alſo of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne. This is a moſt certaine truth, though it ſeeme ſtrange, for fewe men thinke of it, that euer they ſhall anſwer for <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne: and therefore if any obiect, what reaſon is there that <hi>I</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere for another mans ſinne? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, true, if it had bene <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne alone: but it was his and thine alſo: for
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:152015:30"/>
hee was thy father and ſtoode in thy roome: and thou alſo ſince thou waſt borne, haſt confirmed what hee did. Now therefore though not one of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thinkes ſeriouſly thereof: namely, that he ſhould ſtand guilty of a ſin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted more then fiue thouſand yeares before he was born, yet ſeeing it is moſt true, both in Scripture and good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: let euery man ſubſcribe in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to this truth. And let this be thy firſt reſolution in this Search, that thou ſtandeſt guilty of <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond rule to bee knowne is, that in euery man are all ſinnes: more plainly, that in euery man by nature are the ſeedes of all ſinnes: and that not in the worſt, but in the beſt natured men: make choyſe of the beſt man and the greateſt ſinne, and that worſt ſinne is to be found in that beſt man. If any doubt of this, let him conſider what originall ſinne is, namely, a corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the powers of our ſoules; and that not of ſome, or in part, but of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:152015:30"/>
all, and wholy. This corruption hath two parts. Firſt a want, not of ſome, but of all good inclination, a want of all goodneſſe. Secondly, a deprauation &amp; proneneſſe, not to ſome, but to all euill: and not a proneneſſe onely, but origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſin infuſeth into euery mans heart, the ſeed of all corruption.</p>
                  <p>Many men ſtand much vpon their good meaning, and vpright heart, and bragge of a good nature: but they are foulely deceiued; for take the ciuileſt man vpon the earth, and the ſeeds of all ſins in the world are in him by nature. But to explaine this point fully, obſerue theſe two clauſes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>I</hi> ſay not, the <hi>practiſe</hi> of all ſinnes, but the <hi>ſeedes;</hi> for all men pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe not all ſinne: the ſeedes are in their nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the practiſe is reſtrained, ſometime by education, ſometime by good and wholeſome lawes, ſometime the conſtitution of mens bodies deny the practiſe of ſome ſinnes, ſometime the Countrey a man dwels in, or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a man liues in, keepes him from
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:152015:31"/>
the practiſe of ſome ſinnes: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a generall and limitting grace of God, reſtraines the natures of all men from running into many ſinnes: which hand of God, if God ſhould take away, and leaue euery man to his nature, wee ſhould ſee that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man would practiſe any ſinne in the world: yea, euen the greateſt ſinnes that euer wee heard to bee done in the world. All men which knowe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues knowe this to be true. And the more a man knowes his owne heart, the more he ſeeth that his heart is a ſea of all wickedneſſe: &amp; that it is the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and grace of God, that hee hath not fallen into the mightieſt &amp; moſt mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous ſinnes in the world.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I ſay, by nature. For I know by good education, &amp; by grace, it is otherwiſe: grace rectifieth na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but that is no thankes to nature: for it is as euill and corrupt ſtill, being ſeuered from grace: and therefore na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture muſt be fully aboliſhed, afore man come to heauen. And yet (though all
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:152015:31"/>
this be true <hi>(I</hi> ſay not, that ſin breakes out in all natures alike, though all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures be alike corrupt: for the courſe of nature is reſtrained in ſome more then others, by the meanes aforeſaid; but this is the truth, that whereas ſome are not ſo angry, ſome not ſo wanton, ſome not ſo cruel, ſome not ſo couetous, ſom not ſo ambitious, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as others: that comes not from any goodneſſe of nature in them, aboue the other originally, but from Gods hand, which tempereth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineth, and moderateth euery mans nature as he ſeeth good.</p>
                  <p>And if God did not thus moderate &amp; reſtraine the natures of men, but ſuffer them to breake out to the full: there would then be no order, but all confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the world: therefore, (as eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for his Churches quietneſſe, ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for the preſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of publike peace, and the vpholding of ſocietie in the world betweene man and man) the Lord holdes a hand ouer euery mans nature, and keepes euery one in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine compaſſe limitted by the wiſdom
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:152015:32"/>
of his power, which reſtraining hand of his, if the Lord ſhould take away: all ſocieties and common wealths would be turned vpſide downe, becauſe euery man by the vniuerſall corruption of his nature, would breake out into euery ſinne: <hi>I</hi> ende this point with appealing to the teſtimonie of the conſciences of all men, and eſpecially of the beſt and holieſt men, of whom <hi>I</hi> would aske this queſtion, whether they find not in their natures an inclination, euen to the fouleſt ſinnes in the world; if ſhame, or feare, or elſe the grace of God reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them not? ſo that the beſt men doe knowe well enough, what adoe they haue with their corrupt natures, to keepe them within the compaſſe of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>
                  <p>Nay, I yet adde further, the nature of men, and of all men is ſo corrupt, ſince <hi>Adam:</hi> that euen the ſeede of the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, and a proneneſſe to it, is in the nature of euery man (though not one man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many thouſandes doe commit
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:152015:32"/>
that ſinne,) for ſeeing in that ſinne, there is a heape or Sea of all ſinnes gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together, hee therefore that hath in his nature the ſeede of all ſinnes, hath alſo the ſeede of it. And againe, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all euill tendes to a perfection, as well as grace doth; what reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is there, but wee may ſafely thinke that the Diuell would hale euery one to that height of ſinne: if it were not that the powerfull hand of God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented him, who will neither ſuffer wicked men, nor the Diuell himſelfe to bee ſo wicked as they could, and would be.</p>
                  <p>The vſe of this ſecond rule, is nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For in this ſearching of our ſelues, it ſheweth vs what wee are, without all colours or deceit, and fully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couers vnto vs, the vglineſſe of our natures: and it may teach vs all how <note place="margin">

When we heare of the fearefull murders, treaſons, periuties, ſinnes againſt nature, blaſphemies, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacies, witchcrafts, and other the horrible ſinnes of the world: let vs then returne into our ſelues, &amp; looke home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, euen into our owne hearts, and confeſſe euery one, that theſe ſhould haue bene euen thy ſinnes alſo, if Gods grace had not preuented thee.</p>
                  <p>This will humble thee, and make thee thinke vilely, &amp; baſely of thy ſelfe, and ſo conſequently bring thee to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and true amendment: and the very reaſon, why men repent not, nor amend their waies, is, becauſe they are Phariſies by nature, and thinke highly of themſelues, and of their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and their naturall inclinations: this will be a harſh and a ſtrange Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine to them: Oh, they haue excellent natures, and they cannot indure ſuch, and ſuch ſinnes, and they thanke God, they are not as ill as others: but let all ſuch men knowe, they muſt ceaſe mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:152015:34"/>
nature, and learne to magnifie Gods grace. Let them knowe, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in them, is in the Roote, as much corrupt, as in the worſt man in the world, and euery mans heart is a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe fountaine of all ſinne; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore praiſe not thy nature, but Gods grace and mercy, in giuing thee ſo good a nature; or rather, ſo well reſtraining, and rectifying thy nature; and ſtay not there, but deſire of the Lord, that as he hath giuen thee a better tempered na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to other men: ſo alſo he would beſtowe on thee his ſpeciall and ſauing grace: and as he hath kept thee from the feareful ſins of others (thou being as ill, naturally, as they) ſo he would alſo lead thee into the way of ſaluation, which elſe the beſt nature in the world, can neuer attaine vnto.</p>
                  <p>The third rule to be known and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by him, who will truly ſearch himſelfe, is, that euery man borne of <hi>Adam,</hi> is by nature, the child of wrath, and Gods enimie: this is true of all without exception; High or Low, Rich
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:152015:35"/>
or poore, noble or ſimple, borne in the viſible Church or without. And further, by being enemy of God, he is therefore borne ſubiect to hell, to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and to all other curſes: ſo that looke as a Traytour conuicted, ſtands therby in his Princes high diſpleaſure, and is ſure of death without ſpeciall pardon: ſo ſtands euery man, when he is borne, conuicted of high trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt God, in his high diſfauour; and is in daunger of Hell, which is the fulfilling of the wrath of God. Thus <hi>Dauid</hi> confeſſeth of himſelfe. <hi>I was borne in iniquitie, and in ſinne hath my Mother conceined me:</hi> If in ſinne, then in Gods wrath, and vnder the danger of damnation, If any aske, how, or why this is ſo. I anſwere, the truth, as alſo the equitie of this third rule depends on the two former: for, becauſe euery man is borne guiltie of <hi>Adams</hi> great ſinne, and alſo tainted originally with all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption &amp; a pronneſſe to all ſin: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it followeth in equitie and iuſtice, that euery man is borne vnder the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:152015:35"/>
wrath and curſe of God. This point is a plaine and euident truth: yet men in the world thinke not ſo, and it is the cauſe, why men repent not of their ſinnes: for moſt men thinke that by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they are in Gods fauour; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they neede not to ſue for it in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation and repentance; but onely liue ciuily, and do no open wrong, and all is well: whereas (alas) there is no condemned Traytour, more out of his Princes fauour, nor more ſure of death without a pardon, then al we are out of Gods fauour, and ſure of damnation, vnleſſe we procure Gods fauour again, by faith and repentance,</p>
                  <p>For the better opening of this third rule, and the manifeſting of the truth: let vs know further, that the curſe of God, vnder the which we are all borne, is three-fould.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, is a bondage vnder Sathan: It is a certaine truth that euery man as he is borne of his Parents, and till hee repent, is a ſlaue of Sathan: man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, high or low, Sathan is his Lord
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:152015:36"/>
and Maiſter. Hee ſittes as iudge in his heart; and in this ſence Sathan is the King of the Nations, and God of the world. Men will in wordes defie Sathan, and not name him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out defiance, and ſpitte at him; and yet (alas,) hee is in their hearts: they ſpit him out of their mouthes, but hee is lower; they ſhould alſo ſpitte him out of their hearts, and that is true defiance indeede: for alas, hee lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth in thy heart, and there he makes his Throne, and raignes vntill the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of regeneration diſpoſſeſſe him: and till then, no ſeruant is ſo ſubiect to his maiſter, no ſlaue to his Lord, as is the heart of man by nature vnto Sathan, the prince of darkneſſe. Nay, our bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, is more fearefull, then the ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery of any poore Chriſtian, in the Spaniards, or in the Turkes Gallies: for their bodies are but in bondage, and at commaund, and vnder puniſhment: but our beſt part, our heart, our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, our ſoule it ſelfe is captiuated vnto him, and vnder his commaunde,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:152015:36"/>
who is the King of crueltie, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and Lord of Hell, whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements are Iniuſtice, whoſe ſeruice is ſinne, and whoſe hyre is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond part of the Curſe, is the <hi>firſt death,</hi> or the death of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: that is, a ſeparation of the ſoule and body a ſunder for a time, namely, till the laſt iudgement. This death is duly and iuſtly the puniſhment of any one, or the leaſt ſinne: therefore, how due and iuſt a puniſhment vpon that hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible heape of ſinfulneſſe, which is in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery mans nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it is a moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible curſe. For it is the very gate of hel, and the downfall to damnation, vnto all men, but ſuch, as by faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance doe get their death ſanctified by the death of Chriſt: vnto ſuch men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is no curſe, but a gracious and glorious bleſſing, for it is altered by Chriſt his death. But vnto all men by nature, and which repent not, it is the heauy curſe of Gods wrath, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry downfall into the gulfe of Hell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:152015:37"/>
The thirde part of the curſe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which euery man is borne, is, the <hi>ſecond death:</hi> the death of ſoule and bodie; which is the eternall want of Gods preſence, and the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his wrath: and an apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and feeling of that wrath, ſeazing on body, ſoule, and conſcience. The firſt curſe, was a ſpirituall death; the death of the ſoule, The ſecond a temporarie death, the death of the body. The third, is an eternall death, a death both of ſoule and bodie together; and for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. This eternall death is the curſe of all curſes, the miſerie of all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, and torment of all torments: and I ſhewe it thus. Often when thy tooth acheth, and ſometime when thy head acheth, or in the paine of the ſtone or collicke, thou wouldeſt giue all that thou haſt in the world to bee eaſed of that paine: Nay, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtremitie of ſome fitts, many will wiſh them-ſelues euen out of the world: Now, if the paine of one tooth, can ſo farre diſtemper minde and body, that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:152015:37"/>
it cannot bee releiued with all the pleaſures of this life; O then, what a torment ſhall that bee? when not one kinde of paine, but the whole viole of Gods wrath ſhall bee powred, not on one member, but on the whole ſoule body, and conſcience, and that not for a time, vnder hope of better: but eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally without hope of releaſe; and that not in this world, where there are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, helpes and remedies: but in that vgly and darkſome place of torments: and that not amongſt liuing men, which might mittigate thy paine, or elſe bemone thee, and beway leit with thee: but with the Diuels, and damned ſpirits, which will now laugh at thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and ſolace themſelues in this thy miſery, and will reioyce, as thou dideſt ſerue them in earth, ſo now in hel to be thy torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ters. It may be ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (by the way), good warning and wiſedome to vs all, when we feele the extremity of ſome bodily paine, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with our ſelues, and ſay: O then, what ſhall be my miſery and torment
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:152015:38"/>
if <hi>I</hi> repent not; when not one member, but ſoule, bodie, and conſcience, ſhall be racked and tormented in the feeling and apprehenſion of the anger of the Lord of Hoſtes.</p>
                  <p>In theſe three points, ſtands that curſe and wrath of God, vnder which euery man is borne. And theſe doe anſwer to the three degrees of ſinne, which are in vs: for as the two firſt Rules taught vs, there is in euery man by nature, till hee repent, a three-fold guiltineſſe. Firſt, a guiltineſſe of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne. Secondly, the taint of originall, and vniuerſal cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. Thirdly a pollution by many outragious actuall ſinnes. In the firſt of theſe, euery man is equally guiltie. In the ſecond, euery man is equally cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt. But in the third, euery one keepes that compaſſe, within which the Lord wil keepe them, by his limitting power.</p>
                  <p>Now as in our guiltineſſe of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, ſin hath his beginning: In origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne, his continuance: in actuall ſin, his perfection: So anſwerable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, the wrath of God (which alwaies
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:152015:38"/>
ſtandeth oppoſite to ſinne) is begun in leauing vs by nature to the ſlauerie of Sathan, is continued by death, and is accompliſhed in damnation.</p>
                  <p>And now theſe three Rules, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to the carefull &amp; Chriſtian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of you all: certifying you from God, that as you can neuer bee ſaued, vnleſſe you repent: nor repent, vnleſſe you Search your ſelues (as here the Prophet bid deth) So, that you can neuer ſearch your ſelues aright, til you bee perſwaded, and reſolued of theſe three Rules, and of the truth of them all, euen in your hearts and conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: namely, Firſt, that thou art guiltie of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin. Secondly, that thou art prone by nature to al euil in the world. Thirdly, that for theſe, thou art ſubiect to the wrath of God, and to all the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of his wrath: but when thou art in heart, &amp; conſcience reſolued, that theſe are true, then thou art a fit Scholler, for this Leſſon of the Prophet, <hi>Search thy ſelfe.</hi> For when thou goeſt, thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared vnto this Search, and eſteemeſt
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:152015:39"/>
of thy ſelfe, as theſe three Rules haue deſcribed thee: then if thou Search in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy ſelfe, thou wilt finde thy ſelfe, and thy eſtate to be ſuch, as will cauſe thee to repent, returne and take a new courſe: therefore, what the Prophet ſayd to thoſe <hi>Iewes,</hi> I ſay vnto you alſo, my brethren of this Realme of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who are here now gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of ſo many countries, &amp; quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this Realme: yea, in the name of the ſame God, I cry vnto you. <hi>Search, O Search your ſelues:</hi> and thinke it not a matter indifferent to do, or not to doe it: but know it, that God commandes you, as euer you will come to ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>Search your ſelues.</hi> And the rather, becauſe by theſe three Rules<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you ſee how much chaffe of corruption is in your nature, and what neede there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it hath to bee ſearched into, and fanned by Repentance. Bee well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured: thou man, whatſoeuer thou art: there is ſo much Chaffe in thee, that if thou ſearch not, and fanne it not out, thou wilt proue nothing but
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:152015:39"/>
Chaffe at the laſt day, and ſo be blown away with the winde of Gods iuſtice into Hell. Take hold therefore of this exhortation, and deferre it not.</p>
                  <p>Thou wilt not ſuffer thy Wheate to lye too long in the chaffe, for feare of hurting it: Is it then ſafe to ſuffer the chaffe of thy ſinnes and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to lie cankering and rotting in thy heart? Bee ſure that that little portion of grace, which thou attaineſt vnto, by liuing in the Church, and vnder the Miniſtrie of the Word of GOD, will bee putrifyed, and cleane cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with the Chaffe of thy ſinnes: therefore againe, and againe, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you to make conſcience of this dutie: Search into your ſelues, fanne out this Chaffe, this preſumption of ours, and high eſteeming of our owne nature, and conceits of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour before wee haue it: that ſo this Chaffe being blowne away, the Lord may then beſtow vpon vs foundneſſe of grace, &amp; the foundation of al good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which is a holy &amp; humbled heart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:152015:40"/>
                     <hi>Salnation</hi> is ſuch a building, as the foundation thereof had need to be ſure and ſtrong: Ignorance, blindneſſe, and preſumption, are not ſufficient foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations for ſuch a building: therefore as no man wil build a ſtrong houſe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any earth, but will firſt ſearch it, leaſt it prooue Sandie, &amp; ſo ouerthrow all: So a wiſe Chriſtian will not build his ſaluation, vpon fancies &amp; conceits, and naturall preſumptions: but will <hi>Search,</hi> and looke into his heart: and finding theſe to be ſandie, and rotten, and therefore too weake for the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of ſo glorious a building, wil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe them all, and labour to furniſh his heart with ſuch ſound grace, as wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon he may truſt ſo weighty a work, as is the Saluation of his ſoule. <hi>Againe,</hi> if thou wilt ſtand in the day of triall, then Search thy heart betime, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne betwixt Chaffe &amp; Wheat: thou ſeeſt, that chaffe flyeth away before the wind; but good corne indures the Fan, and the furie of the wind: ſo in the day of triall, temptation, ſickneſſe, or open
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:152015:40"/>
perſecution, the chaffe of natural pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and outward formalitie in Religion, wil flye away: and it muſt be the penitent, humbled, and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing heart, which muſt then abide it out, and endure the fanne of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and perſecutions.</p>
                  <p>And to conclude, Let not the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell deceiue thee, in making thee ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine or hope to pleaſe God, and yet to let thy corruptions lie vnſeene, and thy ſins vnſearched out, leaſt thereby thou marre all: for thou vſeſt not to lay vp-wheat in thy garners, vntil it be purged from the Chaffe: ſo thinke not to ſtore vp any ſauing knowledge, or any other grace of God in thy heart, vntill the chaffe of vanitie be firſt blowne away, that ſo the holy graces of God, may be layd vp in the garners of thy ſoule. And therefore queſtionleſſe (to ſpeake one word to touch our common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, in the very ſore of their ſoule) al knowledge that is ſtored vp in theſe impure and vnſearched hearts: is euen as Wheat layd vp in the Chaffe, which
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:152015:41"/>
is (a thouſand to one) ſure to bee eaten vp by the chaffe, ſo that, when the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowing time of tryall and perſecution comes: I feare, that ſuch men will (for al their knowledge) ſhrinke aſide, and betray the truth: there knowledge then prouing no better then chaffe, becauſe it was layde vp in an vnholy heart: If therefore, thou wouldeſt ſtand and endure when Poperie, or perſecution, or temptations come, if thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt abide the furie of the fanne of temptations: now, then exerciſe thy heart with the fanne of GODS law, Search and ranſacke it, purge out the chaffe of corruption, and ſtore vp knowledge in an holy heart, and a good conſcience, and that will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide the violence of all temptations: yea, when God ſuffers the Diuell to doe with vs, as he did with <hi>Peter,</hi> to winnow vs like Wheate, to ſift and trie vs, as he did <hi>Iob,</hi> with the furious winde of all his mallice: this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge will proue Wheate, that will abide the winde, and gold that will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:152015:41"/>
the fire: thus glorious will it be in the ende, if we follow this holy Prophets councel, and Search our hearts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And thus much for the firſt point (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) the dutie of Searching heere comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, in which wee haue ſtayed the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, becauſe it is the foundation of all the reſt: and this being wel laid, the whole building wilt goe vp the faſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now we come to the ſecond gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral point here laid down: that is, whom muſt we Search? the Prophet aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth: <hi>your ſelues</hi> not other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but your ſelues. This ſearch ſo vrged and infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Prophet, muſt not be of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens hearts and liues, but of our owne: our owne are our charge, and not other mens: and therein is the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing true, which elſe is moſt falſe: <hi>Euery man for himſelfe:</hi> for as euery ſoule muſt bee ſaued by it ſelfe ſo muſt it beleeue, Repent, and ſearch it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:152015:42"/>
The dutie therefore here comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, is, for euery man that would haue his ſoule to be ſaued, to Search it, and reforme it, and leaue others to bee ſearched by themſelucs. Here the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt meetes with the common cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of this world, (and that is) that men are Eagle eyed, to ſee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the liues of other men, but to looke into their owne hearts, and liues, they are blinder then Moles: they can ſee moates in other mens liues, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne not beames in their owne: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it comes to paſſe, that they ſtumble and fall fowly: for the eies of moſt men are ſet vpon others, &amp; not vpon them ſelues: and thereupon it is, that an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil, man ſeeing other men, &amp; not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: thinkes beſt of himſelfe, &amp; worſt of other men: but contrariwiſe, a good man ſeeing himſelfe, &amp; not other men, thinkes worſt of himſelfe, and better of other men: an euil man lookes out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and iudgeth other men: but a good ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lookes homeward &amp; iudgeth himſelfe: and in iudging, condemnes
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:152015:42"/>
himſelfe, farre aboue other men: and that becauſe by ſearching into his own heart and wayes, hee knowes that by himſelfe, which he knowes not, by any man in the world beſides.</p>
                  <p>So then we muſt ſearch, not other men, but our ſelues: our owne hearts and our owne liues are our charge, and burthen: the liues of other men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne vs not, being priuate me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, further the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, either to follow them being good, or take heede of them being euil: but to ſearch, or to bee inquiſitiue into them, is no dutie commaunded vs, but rather a foule &amp; a baſe vice forbidden of God. Indeede Magiſtrates in their people, Paſtours in their congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and houſe-holders in their families are to ſearch: but they can ſearch onely for criminall cauſes, or open actuall ſinnes: but this ſearching muſt bee of our hearts, which no man can ſearch, but our ſelues onely. Few men haue a calling to enquire into other mens liues, but euery man hath a calling to ſearch into himſelfe: but (alas) men
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:152015:43"/>
doe farre otherwiſe, they ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to rotte in their owne ſinnes, and erect an Inquiſition ouer other mens liues, &amp; it is to be ſeene in dayly expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that thoſe men, who are the great Searchers and priers into other men, are the neglecters and forgetters of themſelues: And contrariwiſe they who doe narrowly ſearch themſelues and their owne wayes, and looke into the corners of their owne hearts, doe finde ſo much worke to do with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues that they little buſie themſelues, with other men.</p>
                  <p>And thus much may ſuffice for that point.</p>
                  <p>It followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O Nation not worthy to be beloued.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third point: <hi>Who muſt ſearch?</hi> the Iewes, who are here termed a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not worthy to be beloued: &amp; yet for al that, they are bid to ſearch them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that ſo vpon their Repentance, they might bee beloued. Where, wee
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:152015:43"/>
may ſee the vnſpeakable loue of God, and his wonderfull mercie, offering grace vnto ſuch men, as are altogether vnworthy of it. Gods children are by nature like other men, and God findes nothing in them, why to reſpect them aboue others: but euen of his owne mercie, makes them worthy, who of themſelues are not: therefore how worthy is that God, to haue all the loue of our hearts, who loued vs, when wee were not worthy to be beloued.</p>
                  <p>But let vs examine more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, why GOD doth call the Iewes a Nation, not worthy to bee beloued: I anſwere, God had bleſſed them aboue other Nations: He gaue them his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant of grace, and thereby made them his people, &amp; commited to their truſt, his holy word and Oracles: but <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 2.</note> he delt not ſo with other Nations, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had the Heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knowledge of his lawes. Beſides all this, they had a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143. 20.</note> land then others about them, it flowed with Milke, and Honie, (that is, with all commodities, &amp; delights)
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:152015:44"/>
and though their Countrie was but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: yet themſelues ſo populous, and ſo powrefull, that whileſt they pleaſed GOD, no enemie durſt ſet vppon them.</p>
                  <p>Thus for ſoule and bodie, they were euery way a Nation, bleſſed of God, a people beloued of God aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Now, how did this people (thus beloued of their God,) requite this his loue, which they had no more deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, then any other Nation? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as they deſerued it not afore they had it: ſo they requited it not, when they had it: but requited this loue of God with ſinne, with rebellion, and with diſobedience. They tempted him, they prouoked him to wrath, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed of his mercy, &amp; proued a moſt ſtubborne and ſtifnecked people, a fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward generation: <hi>Moſes</hi> partly ſawe this in his owne experience, &amp; better diſcerned it in the ſpirit of Propheſie: and therefore wondering at this their wickednes, he cryed out, <hi>Do you thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite the Lord: O fooliſh people, &amp; vnwiſe? <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 5</note>
                        <pb n="53" facs="tcp:152015:44"/>
thus:</hi> that is with ſin, &amp; diſobedience, which is the only meanes to diſpleaſe the Lord, &amp; to prouoke him to wrath: for this cauſe, they are worthily called a fooliſh and vnkind people by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and here, by the Prophet. <hi>A Nation, not worthy to bee beloued,</hi> namely, for their vnthankefulnes, and vnkindnes: which was ſuch, as they not only were ſlacke, and careleſſe in performance of ſuch duties as God required: but euen multiplyed their ſinnes, &amp; committed thoſe foule rebellions, which his ſoule hated.</p>
                  <p>And amongſt many, the Prophet here in this Chapter, noteth three of their great ſinnes: for which they were a Nation not worthy to bee beloued. <hi>Couetouſneſſe, Crueltie, and Deceite:</hi> all which were the more hainous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable, becauſe they were the ſins of their Princes, their Rulers, and their prieſts: who ſhould haue beene lights and examples to the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Now, although euery ſin in it ſelfe, is of that ill deſert, as it is able to caſt vs
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:152015:45"/>
out of Gods fauour, and depriue vs of his loue: yet, behold, here God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines, not vpon a little cauſe, but for wonderfull, &amp; exceeding vnthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, &amp; vnkindneſſe in them: who of all other ſhould haue loued the Lord.</p>
                  <p>As a man cares not for hard vſage from him, whome hee eſteemes not: but a little vnkindneſſe doth greatly greiue a man, from him who is loued and reſpected: ſo is it with the Lord our God, he loued not the Gentiles, as hee did the Iewes, neither was hee ſo bountifull vnto them: and therefore, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. <hi>Acts</hi> 17. <hi>verſe.</hi> 30.</note> (as we may ſee) though they liued al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in ignorance, and continued al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in diſobedience, yet, the Text ſaith, the time of that ignorance God regarded not: but when as the Iewes, his owne people, whome he choſe out of all people, &amp; beſtowed his loue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and made his Couenant of grace with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when they became vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, vnthankfull, forgetfull, ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, and rebellious, that cauſed the Lord euen to complaine of the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:152015:45"/>
and to cry out by <hi>Moſes. Doe yee thus requite the Lord: O fooliſh people &amp; vnwiſe?</hi> And hereby the Prophet, <hi>O nation, not worthy to be beloued:</hi> &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ther is no man, but if he be asked what he thinkes of this Nation of the Iewes: he will anſwere, that they are a moſt vile &amp; wicked people, a froward generation, and that they are worthy to taſte deepely, of all Gods plagues, who ſo farre abuſed his loue and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</p>
                  <p>But what doth this belong to them alone? and is <hi>Iſrael</hi> onely a Nation not worthy to be beloued? Nay, I may cry out with as good cauſe: O <hi>England,</hi> a nation not worthy to be beloued. For, God hath beene as good a God to vs, as he was to them: and we haue beene as vnkinde a people to him, as they were to him: But that I may bee free from diſcrediting our nation, and from defiling my owne Neſt: let vs prooue both theſe points, and lay them open to the view of the world.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Firſt therefore, the ſame mercies,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:152015:46"/>
and farre greater, haue beene powred &amp; heaped vpon vs: hee hath called vs out of the darkneſſe; Firſt, of Heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſme, &amp; then of Poperie: his couenant of grace and ſaluation, he hath confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with vs, his treaſures of his word and Sacraments, hee hath imparted to vs: his holy word neuer better prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and the myſteries thereof neuer more plainly opened, ſince the time of the Apoſtles: and as wee haue Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo wee haue it vnder a religious prince, whereby it comes to paſſe, that theſe bleſſings of ſaluation, wee inioy not in ſecret, or by ſtealth: but wee haue it countenanced by authoritie: ſo that religion is not barely allowed, but euen as it were thruſt vpon men. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides al this, wee haue a land alſo, that floweth with milke &amp; hony, it is plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull in all good things: we haue liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, &amp; peace vnder a peaceable prince, and the companions of peace: proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie, plentie, health, wealth, corne, Woole, gold, ſiluer, abundance of all things, that may pleaſe the heart of

man: thus hath God deſerued the loue of England.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 But now England, how haſt thou requited this kindneſſe of the Lorde? certainely euen with a greater meaſure of vnkindneſſe: that is, with more and greater ſinnes then euer <hi>Iſraell</hi> did: ſo that if <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake true of them: then may our <hi>Moſes</hi> much more truly cry out againſt <hi>England,</hi> doeſt thou thus requite the Lord, thou fooliſh people? And if this Prophet ſaid thus of <hi>Iſraell</hi> for three ſins: then may it bee ſaide of <hi>England,</hi> for 300 ſinnes (O <hi>England)</hi> a Nation not worthie to bee beloued: for thou haſt multiplyed thy tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, aboue theirs of <hi>Iſraell;</hi> euen as though, thou haddeſt reſolued with thy ſelfe, the more Gods kindneſſe is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped on thee, the more to multiply thy ſinnes againſt him.

2 The ſecond maine ſin of <hi>England,</hi> is: <hi>Contempt of Chriſtian Religion.</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion hath bin among vs theſe fiue and thirtie yeares: but the more it is publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, the more it is contemned, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached of many: in ſo much, as there is not the ſimpleſt fellow in a country town, who, although he knowes not one point of religion, yet he can mock, and ſcorne ſuch as are more religious then himſelf is: this is one of the moaths of <hi>England,</hi> that eates vp religion, this is grieuous in whomſoeuer, but moſt intollerable in two ſorts of men. Firſt, in them, who are altogether ignorant: that they ſhould mocke they know not what. A pittifull thing to hear one, who himſelfe cannot giue the meaning of one petition in the Lords praier, to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braide other men, becauſe they are too forward: but it is the worſt of all, when men of knowledge, and ſuch as liue ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilly, and would be counted good chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: and are indeede of the better ſort: cannot abide to ſee others go, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before them: but if they doe: pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:152015:48"/>
they are Hypocrites and diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers: Thus not prophaneneſſe, nor wickedneſſe; but euen Religion it ſelfe is a by-word, a mocking-ſtocke, and matter of reproach: ſo that in <hi>England,</hi> at this day, the man or woman that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to profeſſe religion, and to ſerue God, muſt reſolue with himſelfe to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine mockes, and iniuries, euen as though he liued among the enimies of religion, and not among profeſſors: and as religion increaſeth and ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it ſelfe: ſo doth the number of theſe mockers: O what a curſed ſinne is this? to contemne the greateſt fauour, that God can giue vs; that is his holy religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for the which, wee ſhould rather praiſe him all the dayes of our liues. All that God can giue a man in this world, is his Goſpell: what then can God giue to be regarded, when his goſpel is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned?</p>

                  <p>Our ſinnes lye open before the face of God, and ſtincke in his preſence, and and cry for vengeance: and before the face of Gods Angels, who bewaile it, and before the face of the Diuell, who reioyceth in our confuſions: and ſhall they lye hid onely to our ſelues? Now then, if wee would haue them hidde from God, and ſtoppe the cry, that they make againſt vs, and keepe them
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:152015:52"/>
from Sathan, who accuſeth vs for them: wee muſt ſo Search our ſelues, that they may lye open to our owne hearts: remember thou thy ſinnes, and God will forget them: lay them open before thy owne face, and God will hide them from his: write them vp for thy owne ſelfe, and God will blot them out of his remembrance: but if contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, thou hideſt them: then aſſure thy ſelfe, the more thou hideſt, and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieſt them, the more open doe they lye in the face of GOD: and then what will followe, but that they will all bee diſcloſed at the laſt day, to thy eternall confuſion. Therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and againe, I exhort you in the name of GOD, Search your ſelues, finde out your ſinnes, confeſſe them to GOD, freely, and ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly; confeſſe their deſert to bee Hell and damnation, humble your hearts to God, cry and call for pardon, as for life and death, purpoſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to leaue them, begin a new courſe of life, beleeue ſtedfaſtly, and doubt not

                     <hi>Hitherto, of the third generall point.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 The fourth generall point in this exhortation, is the time limitted them, when they ſhould Search. <hi>Before the Decree come forth &amp;c.</hi> As though the Prophet ſhould ſay. <hi>Iſraell,</hi> repent, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore God execute his iudgements on thee. For behold the gratious dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of God: Man ſinneth, his ſinnes deſerue plagues: but GOD preſently plagueth not, but deferres it, he puts a time betwixt the ſinne and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (ordinarily:) this he doth to ſhew his
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:152015:53"/>
mercie to mankinde, becauſe that hee would not deſtroy them, if they would amende. Therefore, after the ſinne, he ſmites not preſently, but puttes of his puniſhment, that in the meane time man may Repent. Here the Prophet compares the Lord to a mother; for as ſhe conceiues the fruite in her wombe, and beares it a long time, ere ſhe bring it out: ſo the Lord after a mans ſinnes, or a peoples ſinnes, conceiue (that is) ordaines, and decreeth a iudgement for it, but he keepes it vp, and all that while he heares it: But as ſhe, when her time is come, then trauailes and bringes forth: ſo, when the time that God hath appointed, is come, and ſtil ſinne is not repented of: then his iuſtice trauailes to be deliuered of that iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which mercy hath kept vp ſo long a time. Thus the old world had an hundred &amp; twentie yeares giuen them for time of repentance; all that while God was in conceiuing, at laſt when there ſinnes were ripe, and no hope of amendment: then GOD trauelled, and brought
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:152015:53"/>
forth a fearefull byrth, namely the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall flood, to waſh away, and take reuenge vpon the vniuerſall iniquities of thoſe times. So many hundred yeares he gaue vnto the <hi>Iewes,</hi> long hee was in conceiuing their deſtruction, and oftentimes hee had it at the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth, as in the captiuitie of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> and vnder <hi>Antiochus;</hi> yet his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſtayed it: and ſtill hee trauailled longer: telles them here by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, that yet the Decree is not come forth, (though it bee conceiued:) but at laſt when <hi>Iſraell</hi> would not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, but grewe worſe, and worſe; (as in Chriſt his time) then hee could containe no longer, but trauelled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, and though it bee with griefe, yet hee hath brought foorth: and what? a moſt fearefull byrth, euen an vtter diſolation of that kingdome and Countrey, of their Citie, and Temple, and a diſpertion of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ouer all the world: but as a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man at laſt is deliuered with daunger, and difficultie, with paine and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe:
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:152015:54"/>
ſo the Lord long conceiues, but at laſt bringes forth his iudgements: yet it is with griefe and vnwillingneſſe, and hee is loath (as it were) and much agrieued to execute his moſt iuſt iudgements on thoſe, who haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed his name: hee often touched the <hi>Iewes</hi> a little, and as being vnwilling to ſmite them: hee drue backe his hande againe: but at laſt when their ſinnes did ſo increaſe, and were ſo ſtrong, that they euen did wring out, by violence his plagues from him, then with much bewayling of their great miſery (as wee may ſee in Chriſt, weeping for them,) hee executes his iudgements on them. But as they are long a comming: ſo, when they come forth, they were the heauier; as a child, the more fulneſſe of time it hath, is the greater, the liuelier, and the ſtronger: ſo, Gods iudgements, the longer God deferreth them, and is in conceiuing them, the heauier are they, when they come: that is manifeſt in the <hi>Iewes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> once his owne people, for he hath deſtroyed
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:152015:54"/>
their land with an irrecouerable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and ſmitten their poſteritie with a blindnes of minde til this houre, ſo that to this day, when the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is read, the vaile is ouer their eies, that they cannot ſee the light of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> but plodde on in fearefull and palpable blindneſſe.</p>
                  <p>This Doctrine hath ſpeciall vſe to this our Church, to teach vs to looke to our ſelues betimes, and try our owne wayes, and turne to the Lord, for wee cannot tell how farre of his iudgments are: in reaſon they muſt needs be near, they haue beene ſo long deferred, and yet beene ſo iuſtly deſerued of vs. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly God hath long beene in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing iudgements and plagues for the ſinnes of <hi>England,</hi> and often hath Gods hand beene vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs by warre<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, peſtilence, inundations: and yet it hath been puld backe againe: and his ſword hath beene put vp into his ſheath, and God hath ſtayed his birth euen in the very trauell, and we haue eſcaped, euen as a man, whoſe necke
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:152015:55"/>
hath beene vpon the blocke, and the Axe holden vp to ſtrike: ſo then, yet the day is not come, yet we haue time: happie wee that euer wee ſaw this day, if now wee haue grace to repent, and <hi>ſearch our hearts,</hi> for then wee ſhall ſtay this Iudgement decreed, that it ſhall neuer come forrth againſt vs: but if we deferre to repent, &amp; put off from day to day, and lye rotting ſtill in our ſinnes: then know and be aſſured that as the Decree is eſtabliſhed, ſo it muſt needes come foorth: and then, when iudgement is come forth, &amp; the ſtroke ſtricken, Repentance is too late: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what he ſaid to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> I ſay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, <hi>Search thy ſelfe, O England,</hi> (a Nation not worthy to be beloued) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Decree come forth,</hi> which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready paſt againſt thee.</p>
                  <p>Thus much for the fourth point.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Now followeth the laſt point: the reaſon of all. <hi>Why ſhould we ſearch our ſelues?</hi> The reaſon is included in the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:152015:55"/>
fourth point: <hi>For there is a Decree come forth againſt thee.</hi> And though the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution be deferred, and though God be vnwilling to take it out, yet without Repentance, it is moſt certaine, it ſhall come foorth and bee executed at the laſt. In one word, this is the reaſon. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, or elſe certainely God will take vengeance: But (will mans heart ſay) is this true? Or rather theſe bee but words to feare men, and to keepe them in awe. I aunſwere, for the proofe and experience hereof, neuer goe further, then this place, and preſent example wee haue in hand: the Prophet bids them <hi>Search, Search, and repent,</hi> elſe, as certainly, as there was a iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, ſo certainly it ſhould be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: they would not heare, nor Search, nor repent: but what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; let all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iudge whether God is not true, of his word to them or no: yea, alas, who ſeeth not that God hath trauelled indeede, and hath brought foorth a fearefull iudgement on them, and hath made them for theſe thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:152015:56"/>
yeares and a halfe, the gazing ſtocke, the by word, and the amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the world.</p>
                  <p>Thus was it threatned to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and thus it is performed: and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thus hath it beene threatned, &amp; thus ſhall it be performed to thee, O <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> except thou preuent the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are comming: O happy <hi>England,</hi> that I may ſay to thee, it is yet but comming.

If therefore <hi>Ely,</hi> and many <hi>Elyes</hi> haue ſpoken to <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>England</hi> heares not, <hi>England</hi> obeyeth not, <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> repents not: take heed the Lord in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſay not, <hi>England will not heare the voyce of the Prophets, becauſe I will deſtroy it.</hi> Let no man ſay, wee take vpon vs to propheſie: wee onely giue warning, and ſhewethe daunger, by example of the like.</p>
                  <p>My ſecond reaſon is this. One iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment executed: and not working Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, is alwayes a fore-runner of another, that Rule is certaine, and an euident truth, and needs no prouing. Now; we haue beene viſited with Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, Earthquakes, peſtilences, inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, Thunder &amp; lightning in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and moſt ſtrange &amp; vnſeaſonable weather: but alas, all theſe haue taken no effect: where is the humiliation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and reformation which they haue wrought? therefore it muſt needs bee, there remaines behinde a greater iudgement. Men may be ſo madde to thinke theſe to be ordinary things, and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:152015:58"/>
to come by courſe of Nature, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie cauſes: but certainly, they are the ſhaking of the Rod, and fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of a greater iudgement, vnleſſe Repentance cut of their courſe. For looke as one cloud followeth another, till the Sunne conſume them: ſo one iudgement haſtens after another, and repentance onely is the Sunne, which muſt diſpel them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Thirdly, it ſtands with the iuſtice of God, according as he hath reuealed it in the Scripture, eſpecially in <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. out of the whole Chapter, it muſt needs be gathered as a Rule. <hi>I wil curſe that people which breake my lawes:</hi> now we may not deny but this land of ours, is for abundance of ſinne, a people of <hi>Sodome.</hi> All kinde of ſinnes, in all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of men, rage and raigne euery day more and more: therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that vnleſſe wee repent, and ſo diſſolue this cloude of iudgement, that hangs ouer our heads: it cannot be, but a moſt fearefull tempeſt is to come at the laſt, and when it is come, it will be
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:152015:59"/>
too late to wiſh we had done it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the bowels of Chriſt Ieſus, Let this be to intreate and exhort you all, to ſearch and looke into your ſelues, that ſo Repenting and changing your wayes, you may get the ſword againe into his ſheath, which is already drawn out, but yet hath not ſtricken home, &amp; may quench the wrath which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready kindled, but yet burns not out as it wil do, if by repentance we quench it not: &amp; do this euery one as you tender the ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your owne ſoules, &amp; the continuance of the Goſpel to this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions Nation, and the peace and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous ſtate of this Church &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth. For let men make what cauſes they will, it is certainely ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that ouerturnes kingdomes, and changeth ſtates, as all theſe kingdomes and ſtates haue felt, who haue continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed finally to contemne the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>It followeth:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And you be as Chaff, that paſſeth on a day.</hi>

(for the word preached, doth not confound a man actually, but only pronounce the ſentence, and thereby ſtrike the conſcience) then God hath another fanne, and that is the <hi>fanne of his iudgements:</hi> and that fanning or win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowing time is, when he executes his vengeance and his iudgements on a Nation: this is his latter fanne, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p n="1">1 Theſe three fannes of God make a three-fold ſeparation of the Chaffe from the Wheate, that is, of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked from the elect: with the fanne of his word which is powerfull, he ſeuers them in affection, and diſpoſition, and makes a diſtinction of them, ſo, as generally the Wheate is knowne to be Wheate, and Chaffe diſcerned to be Chaffe, by the preaching of the word:
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:152015:61"/>
but though the tare be knowne to bee tare, yet both grow together, ſo that the word onely ſeuers them in affection, and ſets ſeueral notes of diſtinction vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them both.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 But then the ſecond fanne of his Iudgements is more violent, for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, he ſeuereth them a ſunder in ſoule, gathering the godly men, as his wheat into the heauens, &amp; blowing the ſoules of the wicked into hell: but yet the bodyes of them both lye together, as partakers of the ſame iudgement, ſo ſubiect to the ſame corruption, and are all lodged in the ſame graue of the earth, and death hath like dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them all.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But afterwards at the laſt day, at Gods great harueſt, &amp; great winnow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time, he then with the winde of his power, ſeuereth them a ſunder in ſoule and body. Wheate from the Chaffe, ſheepe from the Goates, &amp; ſeparateth them, neuer to be mingled againe for euer &amp; euer: and then with the winde of his wrath, he blowes the chaffe into

fire vnquenchable, and with his louing fauour gathereth his wheate into the euerlaſting and glorious garners of heauen.</p>
                  <p>So then the firſt ſeuereth them in affection. The ſecond in ſoule for a time. The third, actually in ſoule and body for euer and euer.</p>
                  <p>Now of theſe three winnowing times, the holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh here properly of the ſecond: namely the <hi>fan of Gods iudgements:</hi> ſo that, the meaning of the <hi>Metaphor</hi> is this: ſearch your ſelues and repent betimes, leaſt God come vpon you with ſome fearefull <hi>iudgements:</hi> becauſe you haue ſo long contemned the <hi>fan of the word,</hi> and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding you too light to abide the try all, doe take you away in the iudgement, and caſt you into hell: for as ſure as the fan of the word hath made difference of you, which are chaffe, and which are wheate, ſo ſure ſhall the fanne of his iudgements blow away the chaffe to hell and damnation.</p>
                  <p>Thus much for the meaning.</p>

Now for the vſe, for vs in <hi>England,</hi> the caſe ſtands thus: Our church doubtleſſe is Gods corne field, &amp; we are the corne heape of God: and thoſe <hi>Browniſles</hi> and <hi>Sectaries</hi> are blinde and beſotted, who cannot ſee that the church of <hi>England</hi> is a godly heape of Gods corne: but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, we muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe, we are ful of chaffe: that is, of prophane, &amp; wicked Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crits, whoſe hearts and mindes abound in ſinnes and rebellions: and many of our beſt profeſſors are alſo too full of chaffe (that is) of corruptions, and doe giue themſelues too much libertie in many ſinnes: but alas, the pure wheate, how thinne is it ſcattered? howe hard to finde a man (at leaſt a family) which dedicate themſelues to the Lord in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſincere obedience, and labour to make conſcience of all ſinnes: now therefore, ſeeing wee are Gods corne field, and we haue ſome pure wheat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt much chaffe, therefore God will winnow vs, to find out the corne, if hee haue but one corne of wheat in a handfull of chaffe, but one good man

of many, he will ſtirre all the heape for thoſe fewe cornes, hee will not care to blow all the chaffe to hell, to finde out thoſe fewe cornes of wheat, to lay them vp in heauen: ſo that out of all queſtion, <hi>England</hi> being ſo ful of chaffe, muſt look to be winnowed.</p>
                  <p>Nowe for the firſt Fanne of his word, it hath beene vſed in this land theſe fiue and thirtie yeares, and that as powerfully, and as plentifully as any where in the worlde, and yet (alas) many are more Godleſſe, more ignorant, more prophane then euer they were, yea wickedneſſe grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and the Chaffe increaſeth aboue the Wheate: bee ſure therefore, that God will bring his ſecond Fanne vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs; becauſe wee will not ſuffer the firſt and the milde and <hi>gentle fanne of his word to</hi> try and ſearch vs: therefore hee will bring the <hi>fearefull fanne of his iudgements,</hi> and with it, hee will blowe ſoule &amp; body into hell, with thoſe our ſinnes &amp; corruptions, which we would not ſuffer the Fanne of Gods worde to

O then, entertaine the word of God into thy heart, ſubmit thy ſoule vnto it, let it pearce, &amp; try, and ranſacke thy heart, and lay before thee thy wretched eſtate by thy ſinnes, and when thou ſeeſt thynakedneſſe and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, confeſſe it, bewayle it, be humbled for it, cry &amp; call for mercy and forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; pray againſt thy ſpeciall ſinnes, ſtriue to purge them out as the poyſon of thy ſoule, craue grace from God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt al thy ſinnes: and if thou ſeeſt any ſins more welcome to thy nature, more deere vnto thee, and which more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile

                  <p>The firſt point in order is, the <hi>feare &amp; extaſie</hi> into which the Lord droue his holy Prophet, which the Lord did not in his anger, but in his loue vnto him, not for a puniſhment of ſinne, but as an euidence of his further loue: for the intent and purpoſe of God in ſtriking this feare into him, was to inable him to be a true prophet, &amp; a fit meſſenger for himſelf. It may ſeeme a ſtrange courſe, which God taketh to confirme &amp; raiſe vp his ſeruant in zeale and courage, to ſtrike him into an extreame feare, euen to aſtoniſh and amaze him, and yet we ſee it is the courſe which the Lord ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth: out of which practiſe of the Lord, we learne this doctrine: That all true <note place="margin">Doct.

The reaſon of this dealing of the Lord is plaine: namely, becauſe mans nature is alwayes ready to take e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough and too much vnto it ſelfe, God therefore in his wiſdome puts a bridle vnto the corrupt nature of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth it, leaſt it preſume too much, &amp; take too much vpon it ſelfe: Againe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Miniſter is to preach vnto the people, feare &amp; reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Lord: but how can he do ſo to others, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath not

tyed that bond in his owne conſcience, nor was euer caſt downe in admiration of Gods glory &amp; Maieſtie: And laſtly, the miniſtery is a high &amp; excellent cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling (eſpecially the office of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary prophets in the old teſtament) &amp; is therefore ſubiect to pride, and to bee puft vp with ſelf-conceits, &amp; therefore teacheth the Apoſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> that <hi>a</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now follow the cauſes of his feare, which are two. The firſt is, <hi>his owne pollution</hi> and ſinfulneſſe, and the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of his people: his own he free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">1 His owne.

But it may be demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, how could the Prophet ſay thus truely, for he was a holy man, and iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <note place="margin">A he was a polluted man.</note> in Gods prefence, by his true faith in the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and ſanctified by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: can a man iuſtified and ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſay, he is a man polluted? <hi>I</hi> anſwere, <note place="margin">And he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth not of capltall ſinnes.</note> It is doubtleſſe, he was ſo, he therefore complaineth here not of any great and enormous ſinnes, which hee had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the publike ſcandall of the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:152015:114"/>
Church, but firſt of the corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his <note place="margin">But of the corruption of his nature</note> nature, which in him as in all men is a very ſea of iniquity, &amp; which alwaies appeares the more, the neerer a man comes to God, and therefore did now moſt apparantly diſcouer it ſelfe in the prophet, when he was in the preſence of the Lord himſelf. Secondly, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth of ſome actual ſins of his life, and it is more likely of ſome ſins of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, <note place="margin">2 Of ſome omiſsion in his calling.</note> then of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſsion: for we find not that the prophet was euer touched with any great ſin, &amp; where we know it not, we are in charitie not to imagine it. So that it is moſt probable, hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth of ſome ſmaller faults, or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences in his Miniſtery: as not prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to the people at ſome time when he ought, or not preaching ſo willingly or cheerfully as he ſhould, or deſire to leaue preaching, becauſe the people were ſtubborne &amp; diſobedient, or ſome impatience in his Miniſtery, when the people were rebellious and reſiſted his doctrine, which paſsion might the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vexe him (as we read it did <hi>Ieremy)</hi>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:152015:114"/>
the Iewes were ſo ſtubborne &amp; ſtifnec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked a people: or it may be ſome want of zeale or forwardnes, theſe, or ſome ſuch were the cauſe of his feare: And the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience of theſe makes him here cry out that he cannot ſtand in the ſight of God. Where we learn, firſt, what a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">Doct. Ergo, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters muſt be men of tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</note> conſcience godly Miniſters muſt haue aboue all men: namely, that they muſt make conſcience, not of the great and groſſe ſins onely; but euen of the loweſt &amp; leaſt ſins: and he muſt ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour in his calling, not only to be cleere of great crimes, but as far as may be, to bee free from the leaſt appearance of euill, and from the leaſt negligences in his place, for a ſmall faultin other men is great in them, and that which may be ſome waies pardonable in other men, is no way in them: they muſt therefore watch ouer themſelues moſt carefully, <note place="margin">And make confidence of the leaſt ſinnes.</note> and take heede to all their waies: &amp; for this ende is it, that a Miniſter in godly wiſedome muſt often depriue himſelfe euen of many things (which it may be, lawfully hee might vſe) leaſt his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:152015:115"/>
be an occaſion of euill to others: and muſt abſtaine from the leaſt ſins, leaſt euen they be blemiſhes to his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and burthens to his conſcience. And hence is it, that a miniſter cannot be too carefull in his calling, in his words, diet, company, recreation, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, geſtures, and in his whole carriage, becauſe little ſins are ſo great in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially <note place="margin">And be moſt carefull in his miniſtery both pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely and priuately.</note> miniſters muſt here learne the Apoſtles leſſon, to bee <hi>inſtant in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon: to preach and exhort, to comfort and rebuke, publikely and priuate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi> to good, to bad: when it is wel taken, when it is ill taken: when they willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiue it, and when they ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſiſt it: when they commend him, and reward him, and when they raile at him, and perſecute him for it: thus muſt he be diligent in ſeaſon and out of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for the leaſt negligence in his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or omitting the leaſt opportunity of doing good, will when God viſits his conſcience, bee a burthen and vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him, as it was heere to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</p>

And furthermore, if theſe ſmal ſinnes <note place="margin">Vſe.

If therefore a Miniſter liues with ſuch a people, his caſe is pittifull and daungerous, for he walkes in the midſt of nets and ſnares, which are layd for him on euery ſide, and if he eſcape them (I meane, if hee

                  <p>THe ſecond cauſe of the Prophets feare and aſtoniſhment is, <hi>He ſan the Lorde,</hi> who then appeared in glory vnto him: not that hee ſawe the ſubſtance of God (for that is inviſible <note place="margin">How?

                  <p>Wherein let vs firſt of all obſerue the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:152015:128"/>
connexion and dependance of theſe two cauſes, one vpon another: for as they are both ioyntly the cauſe of his feare, ſo one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is in a ſort the cauſe of another: he feareth, <hi>becauſe of his own and his peoples ſinnes, and becauſe he ſawe the Lord:</hi> but why is he <hi>afraid to ſee the Lord?</hi> the cauſe thereof is <hi>his owne and their ſins,</hi> without which he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue beene affraid, but rather haue gloried to ſee the Lord: but his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience checking him, for ſome defect of dutie in his calling, therfore he trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth at the leaſt glimſe of Gods glory. Here let vs marke the ground of his <note place="margin">Doct: the man that is in his ſinnes endures not Cods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. 1 For God hates ſinne, aboue all things.</note> reaſon, which is this: <hi>That man that is in his ſinnes, is not able to ſtand in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God:</hi> this is a generall and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine truth, &amp; the reaſons of it are; Firſt, the contrarietie betwixt God, and the nature of ſinne, it being the onely thing which offends him, &amp; which prouokes his wrath and iuſt diſpleaſure: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as a ſubiect cannot but be much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, if he hap to come into the kings preſence, with any thing about him

which the king hates, or cannot abide to ſee: ſo a man cannot but be extreame aſtoniſht, if hee knowe himſelfe to bee in Gods preſence with his ſinnes, which Gods ſoule hateth. <note place="margin">2 Sin makes a man a debter to God.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſin makes a man indebted to God: for as the Lawe tyeth him firſt to <hi>obedience,</hi> ſo if he ſin and faile in that, it bindes him to <hi>puniſhment:</hi> and the more a man ſinneth, the deeper is he in Gods debt.

                  <p>All miniſters therfore, as they would ſee any fruite of their Miniſterie, let them firſt ſanctifie themſelues, &amp; clenſe their hearts by repentance, afore they preſume, to ſtand vp to rebuke ſinne in others: elſe let them not thinke, that <note place="margin">Good words are vaine, where there is no good life.</note> their golden wordes ſhall doe ſo much good, as their leaden liues ſhall doe hurt: and they may happe to confirme men, that already are conuerted, but hardly ſhall any ſuch men, conuert any ſoules from Poperie or prophaneſſe.

                  <p>The matter of the conſolation is laſt in order. Let vs therefore firſt ſpeake of the Circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>The firſt circumſtance, is the time <note place="margin">1. Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the time that is after his feare.</note> when this Prophet was comforted and raiſed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his feare. <hi>Then</hi> ſaith the text: that is, after his feare and aſtoniſhment, but not afore. Thus dealt God alwaies with all his Saints, he beſtoweth no <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pertaining to ſaluation, but after he hath by ſome meanes or other
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:152015:139"/>
brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to true <hi>humiliation</hi> in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, <note place="margin">Doct. No conſolation but after humiliation.</note> and to ſorrow for their ſinnes: Humiliation is the preparatiue for grace: for when by ſight and ſenſe of their ſinnes, and their owne miſery by ſinne, he hath euen driuen them quite out of themſelues, finding nothing in themſelues, but cauſe of feare and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, then powres hee the oyle of grace, and of ſweete comfort into their hearts, &amp; refreſheth their weary ſoules with the deawe of his mercy: this point needes no further proofe, for looke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Scriptures, &amp; we ſhal finde, God neuer called any man to the ſtate of grace, or to any notable worke or fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in his Church, but hee firſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled them, and then brought them out of al conceit with themſelues, and then wrought <hi>in them, and by them,</hi> his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull workes.</p>
                  <p>The vſe of this doctrine, is firſt of all to teach <hi>all men,</hi> to eſteeme aright of the <note place="margin">Vſe 1. To al men: Ergo, eſteeme of afflictions, namely, as</note> afflictions that God layeth vpon them in this world: commonly men take them impatiently, &amp; our nature grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grudgeth
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:152015:139"/>
againſt them: but let a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian man conſider with himſelfe, how God hath alwaies dealt with his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and he hath cauſe not to thinke ſo: for doth God lay ſome great affliction on thee? it may be he hath ſome mighty worke of his grace to worke <hi>in thee,</hi> or ſom great work of mercie to bewroght <hi>by thee</hi> in his church, and hereby <hi>prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth</hi> thee for the ſame. Say therefore <note place="margin">Pſal: 39. 9.</note> with the holy Prophet; <hi>I helde my tongue ô Lord, and ſpake nothing, becauſe it was thy doing:</hi> and what God may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in his ſo doing to thee, thou canſt not tell: and therefore in ſilence, <hi>and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience poſſeſſe thy ſoule.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, here is a <hi>comfort</hi> to all ſuch <note place="margin">2 To men di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed in conſcience, that their ſtate is not deſperate as they Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine but moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable</note> as are <hi>diſtreſſed</hi> in mind, in ſenſe of their finnes, and ſight of Gods wrath: their ſtate is not miſerable, much leſſe deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, for they are in the high way to grace and fauour. God <hi>iustifieth</hi> not, but him that <hi>repents:</hi> God <hi>exalts</hi> not, but him that is <hi>humbled:</hi> God <hi>comforts</hi> not, but him that is <hi>diſtreſſed:</hi> God <hi>hath mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi> on none, but ſuch as both knowne
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:152015:140"/>
and feele they <hi>want it:</hi> and knowe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that they knowe not where to haue it, but at his hands. Happie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is that ſoule, that feeles the waight and burden of ſin, for to him wil Chriſt bring moſt eaſe and comfort. Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters therefore are hereby to comfort diſtreſſed conſciences, to aſſure them, that if with this Prophet they bee ſo deepely touched with ſight of their ſins, and Gods iuſtice, as that they cry, <hi>Woe is me, I am vndone. Then,</hi> eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Then,</hi> are they moſt capable of comfort, and beſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to receiue it, as here it ſell out to the holy Prophet. Thirdly, here is the <note place="margin">Vſe 3. The way to get excellent graces at Cods band, is to labour to feele the wan. of them.</note> way taught vs <hi>how to attaine</hi> to any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t graces of God, either for our own ſaluation, or the good of the Church, namely to labour for a ſencible feeling of the want of them in our ſelues: for God vſeth to beſtowe no gifts on any man, but ſuch as do in humilitie &amp; low-lineſſe, confeſſe to God, &amp; acknowledge in themſelues, the want of them. So the bleſſed <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgin</hi> ſingeth, <hi>God filleth the</hi>

ſendes emptie away:</hi> And ſo the Pſalmiſt, <hi>God ſatisfieth the hungry ſoule, and filleth the emptie ſoule with goodneſſe.</hi> So then if thou be rich in thy conceits, God hath not for thee: but if thou be <hi>hungry,</hi> he is readie to <hi>fill</hi> thee with good things: and doſt thou acknowledge thy ſoule emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, then behold treaſures of goodneſſe, to feede and <hi>fill thee:</hi> and art thou <hi>caſt downe</hi> with the Prophet, and is thy ſoule <hi>emptie</hi> of hope, and fraught with feare, <hi>then</hi> behold, <hi>euen then,</hi> God and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ready to raiſe thee vp, &amp; to fill thee with conſolation.

at this day, their protection, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable aſſiſtance, is no leſſe preſent to the godly Miniſters of the newe Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though not in ſuch ſenſible ſignes, and ſuch viſible manner, as in the olde: for if they bee miniſtring ſpirits, ſent out for the good <hi>of them which ſhall bee ſaued,</hi> howe much more for their good, which ſhall <hi>bee both ſaued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and ſaue others alſo.</hi>

                  <p>And it may alſo encourage any man, <note place="margin">3.

                  <p>To doe theſe three duties, is to <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour good angels:</hi> and that <hi>Miniſter</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Thus to do, is to honour them.</note> that conſcionably performeth them, the <hi>angels</hi> will take themſelues ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently honoured of that man.</p>

And if beſide this <hi>honour,</hi> we would <note place="margin">And if a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter would reioyce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, let him la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, ſo to preach as he may winne ſoules.</note> 
                     <hi>reioyce Gods angels,</hi> and miniſter matter of <hi>ioy</hi> vnto them, then in the fourth place, let all <hi>Ministers</hi> propounde to themſelues aboue al things, <hi>the converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſoules,</hi> rather then their own praiſe, or liuing, or pleaſing of men, and ſo endeuour it both in teaching, and all their other courſes, that the <hi>angels</hi> may ſee it, and bee witneſſe of it: for if they reioyce at the <hi>converſion of a ſinner,</hi> (as Chriſt ſaith they doe, then thoſe men make them ofteſt <hi>reioyce,</hi> which doe moſt ſeriouſly aime at the <hi>converſion of ſinners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus we ſee, both the ſeruice of <hi>angels</hi> to Gods <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they are to performe to them in that regard.

                  <p>But let vs ſee how the <hi>angel</hi> perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his ſeruice to the Prophet: not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly, not lingeringly, but <hi>ſpeedily:</hi> ſo ſaith the Text.</p>

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:152015:147"/>

                  <p>Secondly, we ſee here how great loue <hi>angels</hi> beare vnto Gods children, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially vnto godly <hi>Miniſters,</hi> how <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Here <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> &amp; <hi>Miniſters,</hi> muſt <note place="margin">1. Vſe.

                  <p>If therefore <hi>Princes</hi> loue their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, they will not ſpare any care, coſt, <note place="margin">And ſhew it by doing them good.</note>

                  <p>And if <hi>Miniſters</hi> loue their people, they will forget their owne dignitie, which oft-times they might ſtand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and will make themſelues euen <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants to all, that they may winne ſome.</hi>

                  <p>Laſtly, this <hi>diligence</hi> of the <hi>angels,</hi> &amp; their willingneſſe, proceeding from <hi>loue,</hi> muſt ſtirre vp al Chriſtians, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme

Here is the true way to peace of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and quietnes of minde.</note> often mooued in the worlde.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, many would haue quietneſſe of minde, and peace of conſcience, and cannot attaine vnto it; If they aske how they might, to them I anſwere; Here is the way, ſeeke it not in wordly wealth, carnal pleaſures, nor humane learning, in companie nor recreations: but ſeeke it in the fauour of God, and pardon of thy ſinnes, and thou ſhalt not miſſe of it. Thus ſhalt thou haue comfort in thy owne conſcience, courage before men, and boldneſſe toward God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, many Students in Diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, would gladly be <hi>Miniſters</hi> and doe <note place="margin">Vſe. 2. To ſtudents. 1. If they would be Miniſters, repent and get pardon of their ſinnes.</note> much honour to the Calling: but they finde a feare and ſhrinking in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and thereby an vnwillingneſſe to venter vpon it. If they aske, how they may amend this: I anſwere, or rather the example of his <hi>Prophet</hi> anſwereth for me); Let that man ſet himſelfe in
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:152015:167"/>
Gods preſence, enter into himſelfe, ſearch his conſcience, finde out his ſins, confeſſe and bewaile them to God, craue pardon in <hi>Chriſtes blood,</hi> &amp; grace to leaue them, &amp; ceaſe not till he heare the voyce of Gods ſpirit ſounding in his conſcience: <hi>Thy ſinnes are forgiuen thee.</hi> Then when God ſhal aske whom ſhall I ſend, thou wilt anſwere readily, and with ioy, <hi>Heere am I, ſend me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And againe, many are driuen from <note place="margin">2. If they would be encouraged againſt the contempts and wrongs of the world be aſſured of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour in the Pardon of thy ſinnes.</note> this calling, to beholde the contempt and reproach, and daungers which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto it. But let thoſe men marke heere the phraſe of this holy <hi>Prophet,</hi> when God asked, <hi>Whom ſhall I ſend?</hi> Hee might haue anſwered: Lorde, <hi>I</hi> would goe, but ſuch diſgraces and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements doe accompanie this Function, as I deſire to bee excuſed: but hee caſting aſide all ſuch conceits, anſwereth peremptorily, <hi>Here am I, ſend mee.</hi> How came this to paſſe, for certainly the Prophet was as ſenſible of theſe wrongs as any of vs all, for he was
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:152015:168"/>
nobly borne and brought vp, &amp; was of the blood royal: ſurely, becauſe he ſaw he was in Gods fauour, he had him and his Commiſsion on his ſide, &amp; he held this for a ſure ground: <hi>If God bee on my ſide, who can be againſt me?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore doubtleſſe, thoſe men who are driuen backe by theſe diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, were neuer ſetled in aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that their <hi>ſinnes were forgiuen:</hi> nor ſatisfied ſufficiently, that <hi>God is on the ſide of all good Miniſters,</hi> and that their Calling as it hath his authoritie from God, ſo likewiſe, allowance, bleſsing, aſſiſſtance, and defence of God aboue any other calling: for if they were, they would ſcorne the ſcorne, and contemne the contempt of the prophane world, and with much courage and comfort ſet their hand to Gods Plough, and ſay with the Prophet; <hi>Here I am, ſend me.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, let vs obſerue, how the Prophet when God askes the queſtion, ſends him not to <hi>others,</hi> nor commends <hi>others</hi> to that ſeruice, as is to be thought
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:152015:168"/>
hee might haue done many in the Churches of the Iewes, but offers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>Here am I.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Let ſuch men therefore learne, when God &amp; his Church giue them a calling, to anſwere with the Prophet: <hi>Here am I, ſend me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="174" facs="tcp:152015:169"/>
And let all ſuch as are <hi>Students</hi> of <note place="margin">And Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents muſt not deferre too long, but haſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</note> Diuinitie in the <hi>Vniuerſities,</hi> marke here the Prophets anſwere, not, I <hi>will</hi> bee ready, but <hi>here I am:</hi> why takes hee no longer time? becauſe hee was now ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently qualified.

                  <p>And to conclude this ſecond point; It is not vnworthy to be noted, that the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſaith not, <hi>Here I am:</hi> and I <note place="margin">Doct. 3. The Prophet wil not goe till he be ſent.</note> runne on my owne head, but, <hi>Send me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hee willes the Lord to ſend him: then where are they who dare bragge
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:152015:169"/>
of their priuate motions, and will runne when they are not ſent?</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Prophet</hi> might haue ſaid: Oh, <note place="margin">And that not by priuate motion onely, but in expreſse words.</note> now I feele a motion from the Spirit, therefore I will goe and preach: but he ſtayeth til he <hi>be ſent</hi> in expreſſe termes: Let no man therfore preſume to preſſe into this function, till hee bee fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued in his conſcience, that God and his Church hath ſaid vnto him, <hi>Goe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And though a man be neuer ſo well qualified with all maner of ſufficiency, <note place="margin">Men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are to offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but not to goe till they be ſent.</note> yet let him ſit ſtill and ſtay Gods lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and let him ſay, <hi>Heere I am, ſend me:</hi> and ſo reſt contented vntill hee bee ſent. If any man ſay it is vnfit that a man ſhould ſay ſo of himſelfe, <hi>I</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, let him not ſay ſo in words, but in deeds: let him therfore make proofe of himſelfe, and giue the Church tryall of his gifts.

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus wee ſee the Prophet would
