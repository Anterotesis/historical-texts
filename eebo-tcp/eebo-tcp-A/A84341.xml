         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <note place="margin">Mat. 20. 20.</note> deſiring a Petition; <hi>The one to ſit on his right
hand, and the other on his left, in his Kingdome.</hi> Chriſt told them;
<hi>You know not what you aske; Are yee able to drinke of the cup,
that I ſhall drink of, and to be baptized, with the baptiſme, that I
ſhall be baptized with?</hi> And though you may; <hi>yet that ſhall be given
of my Father, to them for whom it is prepared,</hi> Mat. 20. 20. As if
he ſhould have ſaid; Doe you dreame of a temporall Kingdome, wherein
you deſire to be chiefe? This is but Ambition; <hi>you know not what you
aske. For my Kingdome is not of this world:</hi> Prepare your ſelves
for the Croſſe, and <hi>through many afflictions, to enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of heaven,</hi> Act. 14. 22. You muſt drink of the cup and baptiſme
of afflictions. And though they ſaid, <hi>They were able;</hi> yet it was not in
their power; for they fled in his paſſion: <hi>yee ſhall be baptized with the
baptiſme of affliction,</hi> which you cannot eſcape; <hi>but to fit at my right
hand, and at my left, it is not mine to give,</hi> nor wiſely done of you to
aske it; <hi>for that ſhall be given of my Father:</hi> So I ſay to you, <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
and <hi>Independents;</hi> You would ſit on the right hand, and at the
<pb facs="tcp:123255:3"/>
left, in his Church, and Kingdome; I tell you, you know not what you
aske; for our Church of lukewarme <hi>Laodicea,</hi> ſhall drink of a bitter cup
of calamities, and be baptized with great afflictions: And do you dreame
of a temporall Kingdome? Wherein you deſire to be chiefe? You know not
what you aske; for the Government of a Church, muſt be given of the
Father of heaven; not ſuch as you imagine; and alſo to whom he pleaſe.
What did the two brethren get, but diſdaine of the ten? So there be ten
to two againſt you in heart, for your Petition, and think themſelves as
wiſe, as you, and have the diſdaine of five to one against you; and you two
Brethren, are ready to deſtroy each other, for the preheminence. Doe you
not know that old <hi>Axiome</hi> of Satan, and of the Jeſuites? <hi>Divide, &amp; vince,</hi>
divide them, and overcome; it muſt needs be of Satan; for God is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of peace, and lover of concord, and bleſſer of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133. 1, 2, 3.
I deſire you to love it alſo. Satan by his inſtruments hath buzzed into
the phantaſies of many people, that wee ſhall have a worſe Government,
for the Conſcience, then before; to ſet them againſt the Parliament, and
one ſide againſt another; and they have toſſed this ball, up and downe, by
many reaſons in print; and they ſtrive for the live-childe; 'tis mine ſay the
<hi>Presbyters,</hi> and thine is dead; nay, 'tis mine, ſay the <hi>Independents,</hi>
and thine is dead: and many people deſire a new Government, before they
be handſomely rid of the old. Are not you like the couple of men, that ſtrove
for the Beares skin before ſhe was dead? And ſhee bit them both: So this
Beare of a civill warre, will bite you both, before it end. For there is a <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
that hath called for a ſword, to divide the living Childe, as you
ſuppoſe, that you ſtrive for; for thus ſaith the Lord: <hi>Behold, that which
I have built, will I deſtroy, and that which I have planted, will I
pluck up, even this whole Land: And ſeekeſt thou great things for
thy ſelfe?</hi> (a <hi>Presbytery,</hi> or <hi>Independent) ſeek them not; for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
I will bring a plague upon all fleſh, ſaith the Lord; but thy
life will I give thee for a prey, in all places whither thou goeſt.
i.</hi> If thou deſire not great things, of a <hi>Presbytery,</hi> or <hi>Independent;</hi> for
they ſhall not have their lives for a prey, that deſire great things, in ſuch
dangerous times as theſe are; for others will make a prey of them; for if
man ſeeke for great things of a <hi>Presbytery,</hi> the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and <hi>Prelates,</hi>
and <hi>Independents,</hi> will ſeeke to make a prey of them: and if men ſeek the
great things of an <hi>Independent,</hi> all others will make a prey of them.
<hi>Therefore ſeek them not,</hi> Jer. 45. 4. &amp; 5. Conſider what the Lord
ſaith in <hi>Hag. 2. 22, 23. I will ſhake the heavens, and the earth, and
<pb facs="tcp:123255:3"/>
I will overthrow the Thrones of Kingdomes,</hi> (beware <hi>England)
and I will deſtroy the ſtrength of the Kingdomes of the Heathen,
and I will overthrow the Chariots (or Ships) and thoſe that ride
in them, and the horſe, and the riders, ſhall come downe, every
one by the ſword of his brother. i.</hi> By a civill warre. This was ſpoken
about the time of the building of old <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and how know you, but
that it doth agree to this time, wherein the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> ſhall begin
to be built? and <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall be burnt, and the <hi>Jewes</hi> called. I doe finde
that the Lord threatned the Angels of the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> of the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans,</hi>
for lying in the dead faith, and not watching, but ſleeping in
ſinne, that he would come on them, as a theefe, and they ſhould not know
what houre he would come upon them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 3. That is, by a plundering,
robbing, and ſpoyling civill warre, that <hi>Germany</hi> ſhall be like an houſe
robbed of theeves: as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Brightman</hi> propheſied, of the ſword to come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> ſixteene years before it began. Doe you thinke it were
a fit time now, for the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> now the
ſword is upon them, to quarrell one with another, for a new Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
when they know not whether they ſhall have any or no. So Chriſt
is now come, as a theefe upon our lukewarme Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
with the judgement of a plundering, robbing, ſpoyling, ſtealing,
civill warre; that both <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſhall be like an houſe rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
of theeves; for Chriſt is now come, to fulfill his promiſe, or threat,
againſt the lukewarme Angels, of our Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> in <hi>England;
Becauſe thou art lukewarme, neither hot nor cold, it will come to
paſſe, that I ſhall ſpue thee out of my mouth,</hi> Rev. 3. 16. Is not this
Scripture fulfilling in your eares, this day? That Chriſt is ſpuing out the
lukewarme Angels of <hi>England,</hi> out of his mouth. And ſome have a
little hope to remaine, and yet you cannot tell, whether Chriſt will ſpue
them out alſo; they fall to ſtrife for a Church-Government, when you doe
not know, whether Chriſt will ſpue out the lukewarme Church of <hi>England</hi>
out of his mouth; as well as the Angels? And you reaſoned ſo faire both,
that you have divided your Citie, and Armies; as you remember lately at
<hi>Dunnington Caſtle:</hi> If you goe on with this Controverſie, the kite is at
hand, to catch both at ſtrife. See another place of Scripture, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 15.
<hi>Behold, I come as a theefe; bleſſed is he that watcheth, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his garments, that he may not walke naked, and they ſee his
filthineſſe,</hi> I would faine know why this Scripture is not fulfilled in our
dayes. This place troubled <hi>Theodore Beza,</hi> as if it had come into a place
<pb facs="tcp:123255:4"/>
unmeet: but I gather this is the Reaſon, that it might not be knowne,
at what time, Chriſt would come upon all the world, whether under the
fourth, fift, or ſixt Viall, and therefore you ſee it comes in by a parenthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,
that it might not be knowne;<note place="margin">Revel. 3. 3.</note> for Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Sardis, he would
come on them, as a theefe, and thou ſhalt not know, what houre I
will come upon thee, as a theefe.</hi> So this generall coming of Chriſt as
a theefe, by a civill warre, on all the world, is ſo brought in, that it might
not be knowne, untill he came, which now it appeares, is come upon <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and upon all the world. For when the fourth Angel had powred out
his Viall on the Sunne, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 8. here in <hi>England,</hi> and it was given
him to torment men with heate of fire, and men have boyled in great heat,
and blaſphemed the Name of God, (<hi>i.</hi> by rayling on the truth, and the
Children of God; as <hi>Brightman</hi>) therefore <hi>behold Chriſt is come as a
theefe upon England,</hi> and on all the world. Now he ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed is he
that keepeth his garments,</hi> which are neither an <hi>Epiſcopacie,</hi> nor <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,</hi>
nor <hi>Independent,</hi> but they are the <hi>white wedding garment
of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, that is bright, and ſhining, the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the Saints;</hi> which make us trimme and ready for our bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome;
which was put on at Baptiſme, by the Father, Sonne, and
Holy Ghoſt, when ſhee was baptized into Chriſt, and put on Chriſt,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And what ſay you to this Scripture;</hi> Sonne of man propheſie, and
ſay, A ſword, a ſword, both ſharp, and furbuſhed. It is ſharpned, to
make a ſore ſlaughter, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21. 9. I will overtune, overturne,
overturne it, and it ſhall be no more, untill he come, <hi>ver.</hi> 27. A
kingdome divided cannot ſtand. <hi>The reaſon why,</hi> Becauſe thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineſt
in thy filthineſſe, and wickedneſſe. Becauſe I would have
purged thee, and thou waſt not purged, thou ſhalt not be purged
from thy filthineſſe, till I have cauſed my wrath to light upon thee;
I the Lord have ſpoken it, it ſhall come to paſſe, and I will doe it,
I will not goe back, neither will I ſpare, neither will I repent; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to thy wayes, and works, ſhall they judge thee, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.
13, 14. <hi>But God hath purged the lukewarm Angels, and Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<hi>by Baptiſme, but they will not beleeve it,</hi> and I have counſelled
thee, and thou wilt not be counſelled, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 18. to buy of me gold,
white raiment, and eye-ſalve, for thou wilt not beleeve, that I have
purged thee from thy ſinnes in Baptiſme, and clothed thee with
white raiment, that no filthineſſe of ſinne ſhould appeare. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:123255:4"/>
Thou ſhalt not be purged from thy filthineſſe, till I have cauſed my
wrath to ſeiſe upon thee: I the Lord have ſpoken it, it ſhall come
to paſſe, and I will doe it, I will not goe backe, neither will I ſpare,
neither will I repent; I will ſpue thee out of my mouth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 16.
<hi>And here is one cauſe why the lukewarme</hi> Hierarchie <hi>is ſpued out of
Chriſts mouth, and when God can lie, they ſhall be in hope to remaine
there ſtill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tell me, you that ſtrive for a <hi>Presbyteriall,</hi> or <hi>Independent</hi> garment,
whether you be ſure, that Chriſt is not come in now, to ſee his gueſts? that
have been a bidding to the Marriage of the Kings Sonne of Heaven, by
faith, and Baptiſme, theſe 1600. yeares; for no queſtion <hi>thoſe by the
hedges, and high wayes,</hi> are the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which were called by faith,
and Baptiſme, to be married to Chriſt. When the <hi>Jewes</hi> refuſed, and
would not come (ſaith <hi>Brightman</hi>) his ſervants have called the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>
to the marriage, and the marriage is furniſhed with gueſts, of good
and bad, <hi>Mat. 22. 10. Then the King came in to ſee the gueſts;</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
not before it was furniſhed with gueſts; which is now accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
For Chriſt <hi>is now come as a theefe,</hi> unexpected, to view all the gueſts
of the Churches of Chriſtendome, whether they have <hi>a wedding garment</hi>
or no; not whether they have an <hi>Epiſcopall,</hi> or a <hi>Presbyteriall,</hi> or an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent;</hi>
but <hi>white raiment of the righteouſneſſe of the Saints,</hi>
which is Chriſts, wherein no ſinne appeares; ſuch as have none, <hi>ſhall be
bound hand and foote, and caſt into hell, as</hi> Mat. 22. 13. And ſuch
as have <hi>defiled their garments,</hi> ſhall be ſpoyled by a civill warre, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.
3. &amp; 4. And ſo the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſhall be called, and that bride ſhall make her
ſelfe ready, and trimme, for her bridegroome, by faith, and Baptiſme; for
the word, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in the Parable, ſignifieth, that there ſhall be two mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages;
the one of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> (the laſt called, was firſt married) and
the other of the <hi>Jewes;</hi> (the firſt called, ſhall be the laſt married) for
there ſhall be an <hi>Hallelujah</hi> ſung in heaven, for the marriage of the
Church of the <hi>Jewes</hi> unto Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 6. &amp; 7. Well, Chriſt is come
<hi>as a theefe,</hi> by a civill warre, and to view his gueſts; you muſt make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
he will not returne untill he have put them all out of the marriage-chamber,
that have not on a <hi>wedding garment,</hi> and he be married to the
bride of the <hi>Jewes.</hi> Now he ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed is he that keepeth his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that he may not walke naked in ſinne before God.</hi> That
Church, or people, is bleſſed, and ſhall have a Government given them of
my Father. For they keepe the word of my patience, which is the faith in
<pb facs="tcp:123255:5"/>
               <hi>the merits of Chriſts death in baptiſme, and Chriſts blood; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I will deliver them from the hour of tentation that is come
upon all the world, to try them that are upon the earth,</hi> Rev. 2. 10.
Now let any man ſhew that there ſhall come another hour of tentation,
<hi>i.</hi> a more generall judgement of a civill war upon all the world, but this,
which is now come. For my part, I look not for another; but that this
civill war begun, ſhall laſt till <hi>Rome</hi> be burnt, and the <hi>Jewes</hi> called;
and therefore is it time now, to ſtrive for a <hi>Presbyterie,</hi> or <hi>Independent,</hi>
in ſuch an hurly-burly, of a civill war? where no face of a Church ſhall
ſearce remain, when it is more needfull to ſtrive for a wedding garment;
<hi>for to him that overcometh, and keepeth his garments,</hi> Rev. 16. 15.
<hi>will I give,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>to ſit with me in my Throne,</hi> Rev. 3. 21.
ſignifying that ſhall be the conquering and raigning people, <hi>whom
Chriſt hath loved and waſhed from their ſins in his own blood,
and made Kings and Prieſts to God his Father, and they ſhall raign
upon earth,</hi> Rev. 1. 5. and 5. 10.</p>
            <p>Let <hi>England</hi> conſider Chriſts words; <hi>Rev. 3. 18. I counſell thee
to buy of mee gold, tried in the fire, that thou mayeſt be made
rich;</hi> which is the lively faith, in the merits of Chriſts death, in baptiſme
which make men rich, that were poor by <hi>Adam: and white raiment,
that thou mayeſt be cloathed, that the filthineſſe of the wickeneſs
of ſin may not appeare,</hi> which is the white wedding garment of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
which makes a Chriſtian know, hee is ready for Chriſt, when he
hath it; <hi>and eye-ſalve of the ſpirit of Chriſt,</hi> that we may ſee, how
to walk by the Spirit, and in diſcipline of the Word; for, untill this
counſell of Chriſt be taken in <hi>England,</hi> both of the Angels and Church,
this war will not ceaſe: for untill a mans wayes (or Churches wayes)
pleaſe the Lord, he will not make all <hi>his enemies to be at peace with
him,</hi> Prov. 16. 7. And when ſhall that be in <hi>England,</hi> think you?
when they will be guided by his counſell, <hi>i.</hi> Rev. 3. 18. he will then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them to glory, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. Now many men dote ſo much about
Diſcipline, that they think to make a rare Church by it, but are greatly
deceived. For if a man ſhould take a company of <hi>Vipers,</hi> to make them
<hi>Nightingals,</hi> do you think he can make them ſuch by Diſcipline? all the
orders and skil, let him order them how he can, will not make them become
<hi>Nightingals;</hi> but if he can make them new creatures, they may be made
<hi>Nightingalls,</hi> as well as any other creature. There were two Phariſees
which were the generation of <hi>Vipers,</hi> Matth. 3. which were made ſweet
<pb facs="tcp:123255:5"/>
               <hi>Nightingals</hi> by baptiſme, wherein they were made new creatures, and
ſang ſweetly in the night; as <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> that having learn'd the doctrine
of regeneration, of water and the Spirit in baptiſme, he was ſo changed,
that in the night, when the other Phariſees as <hi>Vipers,</hi> would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
Chriſt, ſang for him thus; <hi>Doth our law condemn any man
before it heare him?</hi> and hee ſweetly buried him with ſweet odors:
And another notorious <hi>Viper,</hi> that was a murtherer, and a blaſphemer,
<hi>Saul,</hi> was ſo changed by baptiſme, when he did ariſe and was baptized,
he waſhed away his ſins, in calling on the name of the Lord, that of a
murtherer and blaſphemer, he became a ſweet Preacher of the Goſpel, by
night, and till the dawning of the day, and ſang Pſalmes in the night,
ſo ſweetly, that the Lord heard him, and ſent an earthquake, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.
Wherefore, if you would make a good Church, it muſt be by faith in our
baptiſme into Chriſt, when wee were little children; and by the white
raiment of Chriſts righteouſneſſe applyed by faith: Diſcipline may or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a childe in good manners, but he muſt have a ſoul and body firſt.
Now <hi>Baptiſme</hi> and the <hi>white raiment,</hi> is as the ſoul and body of all
Chriſtianity, he that wants faith in this, cannot tell, whether hee be in
Chriſt or no: Diſcipline may order a Church, but cannot make one.
Truly, I never look to ſee a pure Diſcipline, untill the <hi>Jewes</hi> be called,
(which I wiſh all the faithfull to pray for) except the woman clothed
with the <hi>Sun,</hi> begin to make one, which hath the <hi>bright morning Star,</hi>
which are that chaſt and holy Congregation, as <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Brightman</hi> calls them,
which are the place of Gods pleaſures, and the hill of his delights, wherein
God taketh more delight, then in any thing of the world, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 17.
which Church is now ariſing out of the corruption of the Church of <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea,
Corruptio unius eſt generatio alterius,</hi> for though he will ſpue
the luke-warm out, yet there is a few names in <hi>Laodicea,</hi> that ſhall ſit
with Chriſt in his Throne; wherefore if you be brethren, and going to
the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> remember <hi>Joſephs</hi> words to his brethren, Fall not
out by the way for a Diſcipline, who ſhall have the preeminence: <hi>Let not
him that putteth on the armour, boaſt as he that putteth it off;</hi> for
as victory is of the Lord, ſo is government. If you look for government be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee have peace, <hi>the gift of God,</hi> you reckon without your hoaſt;
wherefore I command you from the Lord, <hi>ſtudy to be quiet, and do your
own buſines,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 4.</note> and <hi>work out your ſalvation with fear and trembling,</hi>

            <p>I have writ of the miſeries of <hi>England,</hi> and of the remedies of the

brought the ſword into their own bowells, to make the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſport;
wherefore let no man ſpeak any more of any government, in the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> except by Parliament, untill the wars ceaſe; thoſe that

but by the <hi>Manna</hi> the day before? And how did they know by the <hi>rods,</hi>
which was choſen to be Prieſt; but becauſe one budded and bloſſomed,
and brought forth ripe Almonds? So I know that <hi>England</hi> doe keep the
right day that Chriſt was borne on, above all the Nations in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
becauſe we have a miracle hath often been ſeene in <hi>England</hi> upon
that day; for we have a tree in <hi>England,</hi> called the <hi>Holy thorne,</hi> by
<hi>Glaſſenbury Abby,</hi> nigh the <hi>Bathe,</hi> which on the 25. day of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
which is our <hi>Chriſtmaſſe day,</hi> hath conſtantly bloſſomed; which
the people of that place have received from antiquitie, that it was that
kinde of thorne, wherewith Chriſt was crowned: Which I have received
from credible men, that have ſeene the thorne, that have inquired, and
tooke the teſtimony of the ſubſtantialſt-men in that Countrey, which did
affirme, that if you come to that tree over-night, there appeares nothing,
but a bare thorne; but come on <hi>Chriſtmaſſe day,</hi> and it is bloſſomed;
Many people have come, and ſeene it, ſo that they would cut off a piece
with their knives, that it is much whitled; and ſome nigh that place
have graffed ſome of that thorne upon others, which doe alſo bloſſome on
that day. You may reade of this Miracle in many Authors, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in <hi>Cambdens Britannia,</hi> a Chronicler to be credited, for that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
becauſe there are ſo many eye-witneſſes of knowne credit, that have
ſeene, and teſtified of the ſame. Wherefore ſo long as that Thorne ſhall
bloſſome in <hi>England,</hi> on Chriſts Nativitie day, or can be proved, that it
hath bloſſomed on that day, <hi>England</hi> ſhall keepe that day of praiſing
God, for the birth of Chriſt. Becauſe the Angels ſung an hymne on
that day, <hi>Glory be to God on high, peace on earth, and good will

taken from the earth, and there is ill will towards men. I am perſwaded
that the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſhall receive their Chriſts Nativitie day from <hi>England,</hi>
and from our bloſſoming Thorne, rather then from any other Church in
Chriſtendome. I wiſh if there be any <hi>Jewes</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> that are incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous,
in this point, that they might be ſent to that place, to prove the
truth of it; for what doe we know, but that ſome of the <hi>Jewes</hi> may be

<pb facs="tcp:123255:7"/>
and for me not to beleeve this of the Thorne, were alſo naught. Becauſe
for theſe Reaſons, I am bound to beleeve it.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe my Father, which dedicated me to the Miniſtry, before I
was borne, to be for the Lord. (And the world ſhould ſee I was dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Lord, if they would let my Books come out.) He having ſeene
the tree, told me the diſcourſe of it, and the bloſſoming on that day.
I pondered it in my heart, with <hi>Mary.</hi> After that my brother went to
the <hi>Bathe,</hi> and ſaw the tree, and tooke the Teſtimony of honeſt, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall
men in the Countrey, which told him, of the conſtant coming of
people to ſee it, and how that ſome have graffed of it, upon other thornes,
which alſo doe bloſſome on <hi>Chriſtmas day;</hi> and how it was whitled;
cauſed me further to ponder it; and then hearing it confirmed by many
that came from the <hi>Bathe,</hi> and by the teſtimony of credible Chroniclers,
<hi>Cambden,</hi> and others, that writ ſo of it, being a thing that hath been
ſeene of five hundred Brethren. Now for me not to beleeve my Father, and
brother, and ſo many honeſt Witneſſes, and Hiſtoriographers, that write
ſo of it, were to account them all lyers, which in me were a ſinne. Well,
you ſee my reaſons, why I am bound to beleeve it. I will alſo ſhew ſome
reaſons, why ſuch a perpetuall miracle ſhal remaine in the world. All
will grant thus much, that Chriſt was crowned with thornes; for the
Scripture is cleare, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 29. and that thornes and thiſtles were the
curſe of the earth for <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, is plaine, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 18. Now it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
that Chriſt being crowned with thornes, tooke the curſe upon him;
for as God the Father hath throwne upon him the iniquities of us all,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 6. and ſo he threw on him the curſes of us all, and ſet the curſe of
the earth upon his head, in that he was crowned with thornes by the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers;
it was the determinate counſell of God, that Chriſt ſhould be made
a curſe for us;<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 13.</note> 
               <hi>for curſed is every one that hangeth on a tree;</hi> and
that he ſhould beare the curſe of the earth alſo, which was impoſed, as the
fruit of mans ſinne, and therefore he did not onely <hi>beare our ſinnes in
his owne body upon the tree,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 24. but alſo the curſe of the
earth, which was thornes, which came for mans ſinne. Now when ſinne
was throwne upon everlaſting Righteouſneſſe, ſinne muſt needs be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
ſaith <hi>Luther;</hi> for Righteouſneſſe was infinite, and could not be
overcome; and therefore muſt needs conquer ſinne: So the curſe of thornes
being ſet upon Chriſts head, which was everlaſting holineſſe, Chriſt hath
turned away the curſe of that Thorne, and in token that it was ſet upon
the head of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>God-man,</hi> that he hath taken away the curſe of
<pb facs="tcp:123255:7"/>
the earth to beleevers, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. That Thorne by a perpetuall miracle
ſhall bloſſome on <hi>Chriſtmas day morning,</hi> to the end of the world, for
the convincing of unbeleeving <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> That Chriſt did
come on that day, and for the confirmation of the faith of beleevers, not
onely by the world of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. but by that miracle alſo, that Chriſt
was made a curſe for us, and hath taken away the curſe of thornes of the
earth to all beleevers; and being everlaſting bleſſedneſſe, hath made the
curſed thorne to become a bleſſed thorne, and therefore called an <hi>Holy
thorne</hi> to this day; and that as the Angels ſung on that day, ſo ſhould
wee ſing with them that ſung on that day; <hi>Glory be to God on high,
peace on earth, and good will towards men.</hi> And I wiſh that all
faithfull Preachers of <hi>England</hi> might preach on that text, on every
Chriſts nativitie day, becauſe the Angels have given us that text from
heaven; ſaying, <hi>Behold, I bring you tidings of great joy, that unto
you is borne this day in the Citie of David, a Saviour, which is
Chriſt the Lord.</hi> Therefore ſing and make melody in your hearts to the
Lord: <hi>Glory be to God on high, peace on earth, and good will

is true, in that his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt, which is very God, and eternall
life, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 20. by Baptiſme into him, ſhall finde more peace with God
in conſcience, and finde good will with men, that are the children of God.

Eloquence, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew you,
that love not your lives unto the death,
how to overcome the Devill, by the bloud
of the Lambe, and by that word of your

wee heare there was a battell in Heaven,
<hi>i.</hi> in the Church, ſaith <hi>Brightman;</hi> and ſo

lay in the Wilderneſſe; for the wrath of the Dragon, as it doth
now lie in warre by the wrath of the Dragon the Devill, and the

whom none is ſtronger in heaven or earth. <hi>For who is like our God</hi>
(as <hi>Meyer</hi> noteth) <hi>in heaven? i.</hi> in the juſtified Church, which is
rightly called <hi>heaven;</hi> as, <hi>Gal. 4. 26. Jeruſalem which is above, is the

of which Satan was caſt, which led the people to dumb Idolls,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 2. And ſo he ſhall in this battell; for <hi>Michael,</hi> and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
will fight for you, which is called the great Prince, for the

            <p>
               <hi>A great battell;</hi> firſt, in reſpect of the Souldiers, all beleevers on
the one part, and all unbeleevers on the other part.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In reſpect of the time; the <hi>Enmitie between the ſeed of
the woman, and the ſeed of the Serpent,</hi> is the cauſe of it; and <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as the ſeed of the bond-woman perſecuted the ſeed of the free-woman,</hi>
ſo it is now, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 29. that now reached to you, and will be
to poſteritie.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The manner of the Battell; all beleevers fight by the
bloud of the Lambe, and by the word of their teſtimonie, which
are invincible. But the adverſaries fight with infidelitie, and armed
with lies: the juſtified muſt fight by faith in the bloud of the
Lamb, that <hi>he hath loved you, and waſhed you from your ſinnes in his
own bloud, to make you without ſpot, or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing,</hi> Eph.
5. 26. and <hi>made you Kings and Prieſts to God his Father;</hi> and prove
it by the Word, <hi>Rev. 1. 5. Col.</hi> 1. 22. That he hath throwne upon
Chriſt the iniquities of us all, <hi>i. e.</hi> guilt and puniſhment. The other
fight by infidelitie, which doe not beleeve this, but by hatred, lies,
and ſword, perſecute them that beleeve ſo; <hi>for the Devill was a lyer
from the beginning, and a murtherer,</hi> as his children are.</p>
            <p>Ver. 8. <hi>But they prevailed not.</hi> Here is comfort for all you faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Souldiers, they ſhall not prevaile againſt you; for <hi>the gates of

Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His place was no more found in heaven. i.</hi> The Devill was caſt out
of heaven, that <hi>accuſed the Saints before God day and night,</hi> by the
victory of Chriſt upon the Croſſe, (ſaith <hi>Elton.</hi>) And the Heathen
Emperour, a Dragon, was caſt out of the heaven of the Church,
by <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> ſaith <hi>Brightman;</hi> and the Beaſt and the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
muſt be caſt out of the heaven of the Church, by our <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael.</hi>
i. Chriſt, and his Souldiers, which all you are, that are faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;
For by our <hi>Michael,</hi> he is caſt out of the hearts of the Elect;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:123255:10"/>
as the Apoſtles ſaw <hi>Satan fall like lightening from heaven,</hi> Luk. 10.
18. as <hi>Meyer.</hi> For now is the Judgement of this world, now ſhall
the Prince of this world be caſt out; ſo now ſhall Antichriſt be
caſt out of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> not ſo much for the ſword, as
by the Word preached. For where the death of Chriſt is preached,
and by faith received, (<hi>that he bare all our ſinnes in his body upon the
tree,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 24. <hi>That we being dead to ſinne, ſhould live in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
by whoſe ſtripes yee were healed</hi>) the Devill muſt needs be caſt
out, ſaith <hi>Marlorat.</hi> So that here is the cauſe why Satan dwells in
the hearts of the wicked, they beleeve not, that the bloud of the
Lamb hath purged their hearts from all ſinne; therefore Satan
an uncleane ſpirit will dwell in that heart that is not waſhed by
faith in the bloud of the Lambe. But where the heart is waſhed
by faith in that bloud, Chriſt dwells there, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 17. For
where Chriſt is received into the heart, for Idolatry and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition,
true Religion and piety comes in; for carnall reaſon,
the Spirit of God comes in, which illuminates the minde, and
changeth the will to God, from uncleanneſſe, to ſanctitie; as
<hi>Marlorat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ver. 9. <hi>And the great Dragon, the old Serpent, &amp;c.</hi> The Devill is
called <hi>the old Serpent</hi> (ſaith <hi>Pignetius</hi>) becauſe he hath alwayes
deadly poyſon, prepared to infect men.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He is the ſame that labours by all meanes, to hinder
you from Paradiſe, as he cauſed our firſt parents to be caſt out,
and therefore ſo much the rather to be taken heed of, in his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe,
to bring thee to ſinne; for if he did thus to our firſt parents,
when they were pure from all ſpot of inherent ſinnes, what will
he doe againſt thee that art inherently uncleane by ſinne, if thou
haſt not the bloud of the Lambe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which is called the Devill,</hi>

by his fallacies, and lies, (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) to feare, leſt as
Satan ſeduced <hi>Eve,</hi> ſo your minds ſhould be corrupted from the
ſimplicitie that is in Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3. He was caſt downe to the
Earth, even to be troden under foote of men; as <hi>Pſal. 91. 13. Thou
ſhalt goe upon the Lion, and the Aſpe; the young Lion, and the Dragon,
ſhalt thou tread under thy feet;</hi> as <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 19.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He is caſt downe to the earth.</hi> i. to hurt earthly minded men one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
for <hi>woe to the inhabitants of the earth, and of the ſea, becauſe the
Devill is come down amongst you, that hath great wrath, becauſe his time
is but ſhort:</hi> So you ſhall finde that theſe warres ſhall be wofull to
the Inhabitants of the earth, and Sea, by the Devils meanes; but
it ſhall not hurt the true Church. For Satan departing from them
that are faithfull, and overcoming him by the bloud of the Lambe,
he ſhall hurt onely earthly-minded men, that preferre earthly
things before heavenly, and contemne the truth, as <hi>Eraſmus.</hi> And
they are caſt into the earth, in reſpect of any power to doe hurt to
you the children of God, but ſhall hurt earthly men by Sea and
Land.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ver. 10. Then I heard a loud voyce in heaven.</hi> For the faithfull
cannot but praiſe God for the confuſion of Satan, their deadly ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,

ſhews the cauſe why many men doe not praiſe the Lord with a

are afraid of him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In Heaven.</hi> i. In the Church, which dwels in the large heaven of

            <p>All you that truly believe, that the blood of the Lamb hath

is not only plain by the Text, which ſaith, <hi>They overcame him by

the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, that giveth thanks for the victory through our Lord
Jeſus Chriſt, 1 Cor.</hi> 15. And what victory is that, but even over ſin,
death, and the Devill? for Chriſt by his blo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

is the law,</hi> which was by that blood blotted out, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 14. And
therefore we ſay, <hi>Thanks be to God, which hath given us victory through
our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that is, to our faith, and hath given you
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:123255:12"/>
power to get victory over the Devill to your ſelves and conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<hi>by the blood of the Lamb;</hi> for that muſt needs be fulfilled in the
members, that is fulfilled already in the Head, ſaith <hi>Meyer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond proof is 1 <hi>John 4. 4. Little Children, yee are of God,
and have overcome them; for greater is hee that is in you, then he
that is in the world.</hi> For where Chriſts blood dwells he dwells:
in <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. he ſaith, <hi>that every ſpirit that confeſſeth not that Jeſus Chriſt
is come in the fleſh, is not of God;</hi> but <hi>this is the ſpirit of</hi> Antichriſt.
Some may object the Devill, and the Pope confeſſe ſo much, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to the word <hi>come in the fleſh</hi> you muſt underſtand, And
waſhed us from our ſins in his own blood, and made us Kings and
Prieſts to God his Father, and that the blood of the Lamb hath
made us clean from all ſin, before the Throne of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 5.
That neither the Devil nor the Pope believe,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1. 7.</note> for he hath invented a
Purgatory to purge them from ſin after death; for he believes not
the blood of the Lamb hath purged them from all ſin in this life.
<hi>But little children, yee are of God (i.</hi> all you true Believers, that have
faith that the blood of Jeſus Chriſt hath purged your ſins) and
<hi>have overcome them, i. Satan, Antichriſt,</hi> and all his ſervants; for
ſeeing Chriſt hath given you victory over the Devill, certainly you
have victory over his ſervants, ſaith <hi>Aug. Marlorat; for greater is he
that is in you, then he that is in world;</hi> for Chriſt dwels in your
hearts; where his blood dwels by faith, that is greater then the
Devill that dwels in the hearts of all unbelievers, where the blood
of the Lamb is not ſprinkled by faith. And therefore wee over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
not by our own power, but by the ſtrength of Chriſt; for
we muſt needs be overcome, if we truſt to our own ſtrength, ſaith
<hi>Calvin:</hi> as to the arme of fleſh, or great ordnance, ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
&amp;c. which he will cauſe them ſometime to loſe, to cauſe them
know, that their victory muſt be by the blood of the Lamb.</p>
            <p>Now there be three things requiſite to make a man able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the Devill, and all his enemies.</p>
            <p>Firſt, hee muſt be born anew in Chriſt, <hi>of water, and the holy
Ghoſt,</hi> as 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 4. for ſo by regeneration, hee is freed from the
bondage of ſin, death, the Devill, and Hell: hee muſt believe his
Baptiſme, that he is new born of God, which is the foundation of

for us; as <hi>John</hi> 13. 7. but do know it after that we are there
buried with Chriſt, and new born, and ſo were made capable
to overcome the Devill by the blood of the Lamb, when wee
ſhould have faith in the ſame afterward. If we do not forſake our
firſt baptiſme to take a ſecond, for that is to depart from the faith;
for if God have but one baptiſme, the ſecond is of the Devil, and all
that are baptized again ſhall be overcome of the Devill, which

for if any ſin be imputed before God, the Devill will be too hard

are that fight for money, and by ends, but get the Devill into their
hearts by covetouſneſſe and cheating ſouldiers, as <hi>Judas</hi> did, and
the Devill gets them, as he did him; you muſt therefore buy of
Chriſt, eye-ſalve of his Spirit, <hi>i.</hi> to walk by the Spirit, to fight by
the Spirit, <hi>i.</hi> by the directions of the Oracle of Gods Word: for
men ought not to fight any battell, before they have asked counſel

do approve of that war or no; and eye-ſalve to diſcern the true
Religion from the falſe, for elſe he may fight for the falſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,

            <p>1. In regard of the torments; they put the Martyrs to death,
to make them deny the bloud of Chriſt, they rejoyced in tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
as the Diſciples when whipped, rejoyced that they were
counted worthy to ſuffer any thing for Chriſts ſake, they were
more then conquerers by the joy which they have in ſuffering;
but conquerers of men or Cities, when they have got the greateſt
victories, may ſit downe, and weepe; as <hi>Titus Veſpaſianus,</hi> when he
had conquered, and ſaw the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> wept to ſee
the greatneſſe of the miſery of his enemies; ſaying, <hi>This is not I,

the conquerers by Chriſts bloud; as <hi>Haukes</hi> in the <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents,</hi>
pag. 1447. in token of triumphant victory, to give a figne
to his friends, when his eyes were burnt out, and his hands on a
flaming fire, yet lifted up both the ſtumps of his hands, and clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
them over his head, declaring he was more then a conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.</p>
            <p>2. They are more then conquerers, in reſpect of the tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors;
for they ſtrive to make them deny the bloud of Chriſt; but
the true beleevers, for all their torments, confeſſe Chriſt ſo much
the more; the one fumes and chafes, that he hath not his will,
and is overcome; but the Chriſtian rejoyceth, and goes away with
the victory; as the tormentors of <hi>Blandina</hi> confeſſed that ſhee over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
them.</p>
            <p>3. They are more then conquerers, in regard of the unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
for they put them to death, that they may convert no more;
but as <hi>Sampſon</hi> ſlew more <hi>Philiſtims</hi> at his death, then he did in all
his life; ſo doe the Martyrs often convert more at their death,
then they did in any time before; for when men ſeek to conquer
Chriſtianitie, it conquers them (ſaith <hi>Juſtin Martyr:</hi>) as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
confeſſed in the <hi>Marian</hi> dayes, it was in vaine to burne any

by the patient ſufferings of the Martyrs; becauſe they would ſuffer
for it, they beleeved it was the truth.</p>
            <p>4. We are more then conquerers; becauſe we ſlay our enemies
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:123255:15"/>
with their own ſword; <hi>Bis perimitur qui ſuo gladio interimitur,</hi> he
is double ſlaine that is killed with his own ſword; for true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
take the ſword out of their own hands, and kill them with it;

bloud of the Lamb, for the Devils head was broken with it; doth
he caſt the curſes of the Law upon thee? caſt on him the bloud of

            <p>Thirdly, Doth Satan fight againſt thee with the feare of death,
and hell? ſhew unto him the bloud of the Lamb, bid him read,
Here's thy victory, O Death, O Hell; I have victory by the bloud

that tels them of death and hell; ſo when thou doeſt tell

fight valiantly with the bloud of the Lambe till death, againſt the
world, the fleſh, and the Devill, and thou ſhalt be ſure of victory;
for Chriſt having overcome already, his victory is thine; <hi>Be thou
faithfull unto the death, and I will give thee a crowne of life,</hi> Rev. 2. 10.
<hi>And feare not little flocke, (i.</hi> that fight by the bloud of the Lamb)
<hi>for it is your Fathers pleaſure to give you a kingdome,</hi> Luk. 12. You have
conquered the world by faith, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 4. conquer your ſelves, for
ſo ſhall you be wiſer then he that conquers a Citie; be an enemy

to perſwade men againſt the power of God, that it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible;
as he perſwaded <hi>Cain, his ſinnes were greater then could be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given

things which ſeeme impoſſible, yet faith gives aſſent thereunto,
and teſtifieth that God is Almightie; as <hi>Abraham</hi> when he heard
that he ſhould have a ſonne by <hi>Sarah,</hi> when ſhee was barren, and
when it ceaſed to be with her after the manner of women; here

againſt ſight and reaſon, that the juſtified ſhould have ſin dwelling

this cannot be, ſaid <hi>Bildad,</hi> againſt <hi>Job</hi> 25. For how ſhould a man
be clean that is born of a woman? and therefore reproved of
God for it, <hi>Job</hi> 42. 7. but faith in the word of our teſtimony in
Chriſts blood, teacheth us to believe the Almighty power of the
blood of the Lamb, that it is able to do it againſt ſight and reaſon,
and perſwaſion of the Devill, and gives glory to the Lamb, that his
blood was able to do it, that promiſed that the new covenant was

which is the proper object of Faith: For, when Satan perſwades a
poor ſinner, that there is no mercy for him, but anger, and wrath
by our teſtimony of the blood of the Lamb; wee are perſwaded
that God is rich, yea infinitely abundant in mercie; and therefore
believeth the pardon of his ſins from the rich price of Chriſts
blood, that was more worth then all the world; for while men are
perſwaded by Satan, that God is poor in mercie; or that he hath
mercy for <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Righteous, and for others, but not
for them that are great ſinners; therefore they deſpair, and do not
believe the pardon of their ſins. But by faith in the blood of the
Lamb, we give God the glory of the riches of his mercy; for had
he not been rich in mercy, he would never have given ſuch a rich
price as the blood of Chriſt, which is more worth then all the
world; and by it, wee prove God is rich in mercy, and the Devill
is overcome, that perſwades us that God is poor in mercy, or hath
no mercy for us.</p>

the juſtice of God: for when Satan objects, that God is a juſt
God, infinite in juſtice, and therefore muſt needs puniſh ſin; thou
haſt ſinned, and therefore ſhalt thou be puniſhed; but by the
blood of Chriſt, wee give God the glory of his juſtice, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
that God is perfectly juſt, that without expiation and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:123255:20"/>
for ſin, there can be no hope of mercy. But now by the
blood of Chriſt, that was of infinite value, wee teſtifie that ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
is made to Gods juſtice; and therefore we believe that
Gods juſtice will not exact that of us, for which Chriſt hath ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with his own blood, but will manifeſt his mercy and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
which is purchaſed for us with the blood of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28.
Thus juſtice and mercy are met together in the blood of the Lamb,
the juſtice of God is ſatisfied by throwing upon him the iniquities
of us all, by ſhedding his blood, and mercy is ſhewed unto us, that
he ſuffered for us, <hi>the juſt for the unjuſt to bring us to God,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 18.</p>
            <p>For there are three points of Juſtice:</p>
            <p>Firſt, to require ſatisfaction for a treſpaſſe committed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to remit that for which ſatisfaction is made.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, to beſtow that which is merited and purchaſed.</p>
            <p>Now, faith in the teſtimony of the blood of the Lamb, gives
glory to the juſtice of God in all theſe: For,</p>
            <p>Firſt, it giveth teſtimony, that God hath required ſatisfaction

            <p>Thirdly, it believeth that that ſhall be beſtowed, that Chriſt

faith, that the blood of Chriſt is his? whoſoever hath any ſuch

               </label> To let paſſe how this point of Popery confutes the reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the ſame body and blood of Chriſt, that was conceived
in the virgins womb, if when they have received it, they cannot be
aſſured that the blood of Chriſt is theirs, I anſwer, That the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
of faith in Chriſts blood is no preſumption; for thus
they differ:</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe when a man hath ſeen himſelf wounded by ſin,
both perſon and actions, his own righteouſneſſe and ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
all unclean, and an horrible ſinner, by the curſe of the Law,
then faith in the blood of the Lamb driveth a man out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
to caſt himſelf wholly upon Chriſt (as <hi>Eſther</hi> did upon the
Kings mercy) as upon the precious blood of the Lamb undefiled
and without ſpot, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. But preſumption finds ſome good
heart or meaning, ſome righteouſneſſe, as he calls it, to truſt to.</p>
            <p>Secondly, faith in the teſtimony of Chriſts blood, reſteth on
a ſure foundation, which is Gods Word, that both commandeth
us to believe, and promiſeth to perform that which we do believe:
as 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 23. and <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 24. but preſumption relieth upon
phantaſie, to do as well as others.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, true faith delighteth in the blood of the Lamb, and
can never heare too much of it, and uſeth the means whereby it
was firſt bred; as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>I will never forget thy promiſe, for by it
thou haſt quickned me,</hi> Pſal. 119. ſo faith will never forget the
blood of the Lamb, for by it thou haſt cleanſed me; they will not
be weary to hear of it. But preſumption hateth that doctrine, and
the profeſſors of it, and ſuch as preach moſt of it, and moſt pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſhall have ſome groſſe name or other.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, true faith increaſeth by degrees, from faith to faith,
from a weak to a ſtrong: as,</p>
            <p>1. To know the vertue of it.</p>
            <p>2. To grieve for the want of it.</p>
            <p>3. To hunger and thirſt after it, and ſet an high price of it.
Preſumption is a ſudden flaſh, and ſo continues, it had no aſſurance
forty yeers ago, and no more it hath yet.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, true faith in the teſtimony of the blood of the Lamb,
maketh a man truly valiant; for he that believeth, the blood of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:123255:21"/>
the Lamb hath cleanſed him from all ſin before God, and is a
childe of God by his Baptiſme, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 26, 27. What need hee
feare? hee doth not fear to go to heaven, and therefore he doth
not feare death, the Devill or man; for the righteous are bold as a
Lion, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26. 1. but preſumption, though it be fool-hardy at firſt,
yet will flie at the laſt, where no fear is.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, true faith in that teſtimony, maketh a man depart from
all iniquity, and keep a good conſcience before God and men, in
hope of the reſurrection. But preſumption hath an evill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
before both, by reaſon of ſin.</p>

there is ſatisfaction made to Gods juſtice, for thy treſpaſſes, by the

the treſpaſſes you have done to your brethren. And ſecondly, doth

<hi>murus aheneus nil conſcire ſibi, null apalleſcere culpa.</hi> i. 'tis a brazen wall

a good conſcience, ſprinkled with the bloud of the Lambe. Cauſe
the Law, and the Goſpel to be preached powerfully in your armies.
There be ſome Anabaptiſts, that would not have the law preached.
I met with an Anabaptiſt lately that heard me preach the Law, and
the Goſpel, and he told me to my face after the Sermon, that he had
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:123255:25"/>
been oftentimes ſcared by the Law; he would have heard none of
the Law, but onely the Goſpel; and to ſpeak ſo much of Baptiſme
was an offence to him. Herein are two Doctrines of Devils; 1. To
forbid the Law to be preached: 2. To forbid children to be married
to Chriſt.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 1.</note> Now the Spirit ſpeaketh evidently, <hi>that in the later times,</hi>
(which are now) <hi>ſome ſhall depart from the faith.</hi> i. of their Baptiſme,
and <hi>counteth the bloud of the Covenant, as an unholy thing,</hi> wherewith
he was ſanctified in Baptiſme, <hi>and doth deſpight to the Spirit of Grace.
i.</hi> in deſpight of the Spirit, that ſaith, <hi>he that is waſhed. i.</hi> in Baptiſme,
in Chriſts bloud, <hi>is cleane every whit, needeth not ſave to waſh his feet.
i.</hi> his conſcience and converſation in the bloud of the Lamb, but will
have <hi>their hands and their head waſhed againe,</hi> contrary to Chriſts
counſell, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. For my part I beleeve, <hi>one God, one faith,</hi> and <hi>one
Baptiſme,</hi> Eph. 4. 5. The firſt is of God; the ſecond muſt needs be of
the Devill, that deny little children to come to Chriſt, which can
come no other way to him, but by Baptiſme, either of themſelves,
or of their parents; for Baptiſme is the Arke, for the parents, and
their houſhold, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. and then withdraw themſelves from the
children of God to perdition, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 39. Now the Law hath moſt
need to be thundred out in the moſt killing manner that can be, in
the Armies, to make them flee, and ſtand a far off from injuſtice, and
all ſinne; for although the Law is not given to the righteous man,
who are freed from the condemnation, accuſation, malediction, &amp;
coaction of the Law, as they are in Chriſt; <hi>but it is given to the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
and diſobedient, to the ungodly, and to ſinners, to the unholy, and to
the prophane, and to the murtherers of fathers and mothers, to manſlayers,
to whoremongers, to buggerers, to menſtealers, to lyers, to the perjured, and
to whatſoever is contrary to wholeſome doctrine,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 9, 10. And
therefore it muſt be preached to them; you muſt hold out to them,
firſt the glaſſe of the Law, to ſee their faces how foule they are, they
may goe waſh their hearts in the bloud of the Lamb; and then ſhew
them the glaſſe of the Goſpel. Thus did Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. Thus did <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
when he converted three thouſand, he ſhewed them by the law,
what betrayers and murtherers they were of the Lord of glory; and
then be preached baptiſme unto them, for ſalvation, and ſhewed the
<hi>promiſes were made to them, and to their children, and as many as the Lord
ſhall call.</hi> i. to beleeve that Baptiſme belongs to them; and all the
true Churches of Chriſt have ever ſo underſtood it.</p>
