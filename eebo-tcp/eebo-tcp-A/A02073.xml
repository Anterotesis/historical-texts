            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Gentlewomen began to blush, because shee spake so broad, be sure, and blamed her that shee would so fondly foyle her owne nest. Shee still maintained it, that what she had spoken was true: and more, that she had forgotten their little secrecie. Whereupon there grew arguments: and a Sophisticall disputation fell out among the Gentlewomen, about their owne qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. I sate still as a cypher in Algorisme, and noted what was spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: which after I had perused in my chamber, and seeing it would be profitable for yong Gentlemen, to know and foresee as well their faults as their fauours, I drew into a fiction the forme and method, in manner of a Metamorphosis: which (Gentlemen) I present vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your wonted curtesies, desiring you not to looke for any of</hi> Ouids <hi>wittie inuentions, but for bare and rude discourses: hoping to finde you, as hitherto I haue done, whatsoeuer in opinion, yet fauourable and silent in speech.

            <p>With this shee rose from her stoole and went to prouide supper, leauing me amazed at her gracious reply, making me to coniecture by her words, that as she was wise, so shee had beene well brought vp, and was descended of no small Parentage: I sate in a muse till shee had made ready our rates: which being set on the table, we fell to make tryall of our téeth, as before we had done of our tongues, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan and ended supper without any great chat.

            <p>Mother, if I may without offence presume to vse a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, I would inquire what I muse at, and be absolued in a darke Enigma that I haue found in your cottage: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had I still hold my thoughts in suspence, than be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue either to your age, or to so courteons an Oastesse. The old woman smiling at my feare, or at my folly, bade me say on: and I boldly prosecuted my purpose thus.</p>
            <p>Since my arriuall in your Cottage, I haue noted your thoughts to be passionate, and your passions to be violent: I haue seene care lurking midst the wrinkles of your age, and sorrow breath'd out with broken sighes. I do not deny but age is giuen to melancholy, and many yeeres acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with many dumps: but such farre fetcht grones, the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calts of griefes, such deepe sighes the Ambassadors of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, make me thinke either you grieue at your sinnes with repentance, or else recount some great forepassed misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes: this is the doubt, and here lies the question.</p>
            <p>I had no sooner vttered these words, but the old woman leaning her head against her staffe, fell into such bitter teares, as did discouer a multitude of sorrowes and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed passions: insomuch as taking pittie of her griefes, I lent her a fewe luke warme drops, to shew how in minde I did participate of her vnknowne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And here multiplying sigh vpon sigh with double and trebble reuies, shee ceased: but I desirous to know the sequell of their misfortunes, asked her the cause and manner of their mishaps: she replyed not, but taking mee by the hand, shee led mee from her cottage, to a valley hard by, where she brought me to a marble piller, fashioned and pourtraied like a woman, which made me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <hi>Pigmalions</hi> picture, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

shee séemed an immortall creature, shrowded in a mortall carcase, in somuch that if her times had been equall with <hi>Troy, Paris</hi> had left <hi>Greece,</hi> and come to <hi>Taprobane</hi> for her loue. Liuing thus loued and admired of all: selfe-houe the moth that créepeth into young mindes, so tickled her with the conceit of her owne beauty, that shee counted no time well spent which shee bestowed not in setting out that more glorious by Art, which Nature had made so absolute and excellent: no drugges from <hi>Arabia,</hi> that might cleere the skinne, were vnsought for: no herbes nor secrets that any Philosopher in Physicke had found out, which might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease beautie, but she made experience of: following <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> euery way in such vanities, and playing the right wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: for, to confesse the truth, their sexe careth more for the tricking of their faces, than the tearing of their soules, spending an houre rather in righting the tresses of their haire, than a moment in bending their thoughts to deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The foulest must be faire, if not in déed, yet in conceit: and she that is faire must venter her soule to kéep her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty inuiolate: but leauing off this digression, my daughter <hi>Flordespine</hi> being thus selfe conceited, was more curious than wise, and could sooner afford a pound of pride, then an ounce of humility: for diuers Noble men resorted from all the bordering Ilande to be sutors vnto her, but her beauty made her so coy, that happy was hee that might haue a glance of her perfection. So that many came ioyful in hope to haue fauor, but departed sorrowfull, answered with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine. For as none pulleth vp the barran root, but he is sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled with the sauour: as none looketh into the poole of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> but he hasardeth his health: as none gaseth against the Cockatrice, but either hee loseth his sight, or his life; so none tooke view of the beauty of <hi>Flordespine,</hi> but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned either frantike in affection, fond with fancy, or pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a thousand perplexed passions.

               <p>And thus he marched vnder the standard of fancy, being but a fresh water souldier to abide the alarums of affection, feeling a restlesse passion that fretted his minde, as the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpiller the fruit, he could not tell on which care to sleep,

but builded Castles in the ayre, and cast beyond the moone: first, hee began to consider with himselfe, how many braue Noble men of sundry Ilands, rich in possessions, honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in parentage, in qualities rare, in property excellent, had sought her loue, and yet missed. When hee had made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison betweene himselfe and them, despaire began with darke perswasions to disswade him from attempting such high loues, knowing, that <hi>Aquila non capit muscas:</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of great beauty looke not at meane <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Therefore though they mist, as either infortunate, or crossed by some contrary influence, sith loues fee simple was registred in the court of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinies, there was no cause of his despaire, but that hee might bee the man that should enioy <hi>Fiordespine,</hi> and set vp the trophee of loue, maugre all the sinister determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Cupid,</hi> Floting thus between despaire and hope; he passed ouer three or foure dayes melancholy and passionate, taking his only content in being solitary: so that at last fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himselfe all alone, feeling the fire too great to smother in secrecy, he burst forth into these flames.</p>

               <p>These considerations so tickled the mind of <hi>Eriphila,</hi> that shee fell thus to debate with her selfe.

That the bulwarke wanteth but batterie, that at the first parley yeelds vp the keyes? Yes, yes <hi>Eriphila,</hi> his beauty argues inconstancy, and his painted phrases deceit: and if he see thee wonne with a word, hee will thinke thee lost with the winde: he will iudge that which is lightly to be gained, is as quickly lost.</p>
               <p>The Hawke that commeth at the first call, will neuer proue stedfast on the stand.

Take heed <hi>Eriphila,</hi> the finest scabbard hath not euer the brauest blade; nor the goodliest chest hath not the most gorgeous treasure: the Bell with the best sound hath an iron clapper: the fading apples of <hi>Tantalus</hi> haue a gallant shewe, but if they be touched, they turne to ashes: So a faire face may haue a foule mind; swéet words, a sowre heart: yea rotten bones out of a painted se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre; for all is not gold that glisters.

               <p>The Foxe winnes the fauour of the Lambes by play, and then deuours them: so perhaps <hi>Meribates</hi> shewes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in outward shewe a demy god: whereas who tries him inwardly, shall finde him but a solemne saint. Why, since his arriuall in <hi>Taprobane,</hi> all the Iland speakes of his vertue and courtesie: but perchance hee makes a vertue of his néede, and so layes this baulmed hooke of fained honesty, as a luring baite to trap some simple Dame.</p>
               <p>The cloth is neuer tried, vntill it come to the wearing, nor the linnen neuer shrinkes, till it comes to the wetting: so want of liberty to vse his will, may make a restraint of his nature: and though in a strange place hee vse faith and honesty to make his marriage, yet she perhaps that shall try him, shal either find he neuer had them, or quite forgot them: for the nature of men (as I haue heard say) is like the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-stone, which will burne outwardly, and frieze inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and like the barke of the Mirtle trees that grew in <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,</hi> that is as hot as fire in the taste, and as colde as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the operation.</p>

But the law of necessitie (saith <hi>Plato</hi>) is so hard, that the gods themselues are not able to resist it: for as the water that by nature is cold, is made hot by the force of fire, and the straight tree pressed downe groweth alwayes crooked, so nature is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to necessitie, that kind cannot haue his course: and yet if there be any thing which is more forcible then necessitie,

               <p>MY two daughters beeing thus metamorphosed, and transformed for their follies into strange shapes: I had left mee onely my youngest daughter <hi>Marpesia,</hi> in face little inferiour to her eldest sister <hi>Fiordespine,</hi> for shee was passing bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nister chance of <hi>Eriphila,</hi> hated to be inconstant, insomuch, that fearing their natiuities to be fatall, and that hers being rightly calculated would proue as bad as the rest: Shée kept such a strict method of her life and manners, and so foregarded all her actions with ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, that she thought shee might despise both the fates and fortune.</p>
               <p>Liuing thus warily, I and her brother conceiued great content in her modestie and vertue: thinking, though the gods had made vs infortunate by the mishappe of the other two: yet in the fortunate successe of <hi>Marpesias</hi> life, amends should bee made for the other mishap. Perswaded thus, it fortuned that my sonne intertained into his seruice the son of a Gentleman, a bordering neighbour by, a youth of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter beauty then birth, for hee was of comely personage: of face louely, and though but meanly brought vp, as nusled in his fathers house: yet his nature discouered that hee was hardie in his resolution touching courage: and courteous in disposition, as concerning his manners.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:6209:31"/>This youth, called <hi>Eurimachus,</hi> was so diligent and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull towards his lord, so affable to his fellows, and so gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to euery one, that hee was not onely well thought on by some, but generally liked and loued of all. Continuing in this method of life, hee so behaued himselfe, that in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of his seruice, my sonne promoted him not onely to higher office and some small pension, but admitted him into his secret and priuate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>amiliarity. Liuing thus in great credit, it chanced that <hi>Venus</hi> seeing how my daughter <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pesia</hi> liued carelesse of her loues, and neuer sent so much as one sigh to <hi>Paphos</hi> for a sacrifice: shee called <hi>Cupid,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining that shee was atheist to her deitie, and one oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to her principles: whereupon the boy at his mothers becke, drewe out an inuenomed arrow, and leuelling at <hi>Marpesia,</hi> hit her vnder the right pappe, so nigh the heart, that giuing a grone she felt she was wounded, but how, or with what, she knew not; as one little skilfull in any amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous passions: yet shee felt thoughts vnfitting with her wonted humor, for noting the person of <hi>Eurimachus,</hi> which she found in property excellent, and admiring the qualities of his minde, co-vnited with many rare and precious ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which she perceiued to bee extraordinarie, she fell to conceiue a liking, which for the basenesse of his birth, shee passeth ouer as a toy: but the blinded wagge, that suffers not his wounds to bee cured with easie salues, nor permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth any lenitiue plaisters to preuaile where hee pierceth with his arrowes, put oyle in the flame, and set fire to the flaxe, that she felt her fancy scarce warme, to grow to such a scalding heate, as euery veine of her heart swet passions: feeling this new lord, called loue, to be so imperious, shee stooped a little, and entred into deeper consideration of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimachus</hi> perfection, and so deepe by degrees, that although shee coueted with the Snaile to haue her pace slow, yet at length she waded so farre, that she was ouer her shooes: so that feeling her selfe passing into an vnknowne forme, shée fell into this doubtfull meditatiou.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:6209:32"/>What flame is this <hi>Marpesia,</hi> that ouer heateth thy hart? what strange fire hath <hi>Venus</hi> sent from <hi>Cipres,</hi> that scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth thee heere in <hi>Taprobane?</hi> hath <hi>Cupids</hi> bowe such strength; or his arrowes such flight, as being loosed in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, hee can strike here vpon earth? a mighty goddesse is <hi>Venus,</hi> and great is <hi>Cupid</hi> that work effects of such strange operation: make not a doubt (<hi>Marpesia</hi>) of that is palpable: dreame not at that which thou seest with thine eyes, nor muse not at that which thou feelest with thy heart: then confesse and say thou art in loue, and loue in thee, so deeply as Pumice-stones of reason will hardly raze out the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters. In loue? thou art young <hi>Marpesia,</hi> so is <hi>Cupid,</hi> a very childe? a maid, so was <hi>Venus</hi> before shee lost her Uir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitie, and yet for her lightnesse, shee was the goddesse of loue: but with whom art thou in loue? with <hi>Eurimach!</hi> one of base birth, and small liuing; of no credite, a meane Gentleman, and thy brothers seruant?</p>
               <p>Consider <hi>Marpesia,</hi> that loue hath his reasons, and his rules to settle fancy, and gouerne affections: honour ought not to looke lower in dignitie, nor the thoughts of Ladies gaze at worthlesse persons: Better is it for thee to perish in high desires, then in lowe disdaine: oppose thy selfe to <hi>Venus,</hi> vnlesse her presents be more precious: say loue is folly, except her gifts be more rich: count rather to dye in despising so meane a choice, then liue in liking so vnlikely a chance: what will thy mother, thy brother, thy friends; nay all <hi>Taprobane</hi> say: but that thou art vaine, carelesse, and amorous: but note this <hi>Marpesia,</hi> loue is a league that lasteth while life: thou art in this to feede thine eye, not thine humour: to satisfie the desire of thy heart, not the consideration of their thoughts: for in marying, either a perpetuall content, or a general mistike is like to fall to thy selfe: what though he be poore, yet hee is of comely perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage: though he be base of birth, yet he is wise: what hee wanteth in gifts of fortune, hee hath in the minde: and the defect of honours is supplied with vertues.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:6209:32"/>
                  <hi>Venus</hi> her selfe loued <hi>Adonis: Phoebe</hi> stooped from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to kisse a poore Shepheard, <hi>AEnone</hi> loued <hi>Paris,</hi> as hee was a Swaine, not as the son of <hi>Priamus:</hi> loue is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies companion to dignity, nor fancy euer lodged in kings Palaces. Then <hi>Marpesia,</hi> looke at <hi>Eurimachus,</hi> for hee is courteous, and loue him as he is vertuous; supply thou his want with thy wealth, and increase his credite with thy countenance: but how dare he motion loue, that is so low? or enterprise to attempt so great an assault? Neuer stand in doubt <hi>Marpesia,</hi> giue him thou but fauors, and loue and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune will make him bold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marpesia</hi> hauing thus meditated with her selfe, sought by all meanes possible, how to make him priuy to her affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: she vsed in her salutations affable courtesie, and som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more then ordinary: her lookes were full of fauours, her glances many and milde; he vsed no exercise but she did commend, nor performed any thing, which shee sayd not to be excellent. The young <hi>Eurimachus</hi> was not such a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, but hee could espie a pad in the straw, and discerne a glowing coale, from colde cinders: hee noted her glances, her looks, her gestures, her words, examining euery parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular action, in the depth of his thoughts, finding by the touchstone, that all tended vnto meere loue, or extreme dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation; for whatsoeuer she did was in extremes. Well, hope put him in comfort that shee was too vertuous to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble; and feare, that she was too honorable to loue so base a man: yet supposing the best, he tooke her passions for loue, &amp; had a desire to return a liking with affection: but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of his parentage, of his small possessions, of her honour, his lords disfauour, and the impossibility of his sute, was a cooling card to quench the hottest flame that <hi>Cupid</hi> could set on fire with his inchanted brand: but <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> had pittied the fondling, gaue him such precious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortiues to incourage her champion, that he resolued to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt whatsoeuer his fortune were: thus in suspence he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to debate with himselfe.</p>

As shee should haue prosecuted her talke, her brother who was stalking to kill a Déere, came by, and espying them at so priuate and familiar chat, frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, commanding <hi>Eurimachus</hi> (as halfe in anger) to get him home: hee leauing his sport, accompanied my daughter to the court.</p>
               <p>These louers thus parted, were not long ere they met, where <hi>Eurimachus</hi> following the precepts of <hi>Marpesia,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan very boldly to giue the assault, she very faintly, for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion sake, making a womans resistance, but the batterie was so freshly renewed, that <hi>Marpesia</hi> yeelded, and there they plighted a constant promise of their loues: vowing such saith and loyaltie as the troth of two louers heart? might afford.</p>
               <p>In this happie content they liued along while, till <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pesia</hi> blabbing the contract out to a gentleman of the court, it came to her brothers and her mothers eare, who taking the matter grieuously, had her strictly in examination. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pesia</hi> confessed her loues, and maintained them: on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

side, they perswaded with promises, and threatned with bitter spéeches: but in vaine, for <hi>Marpesia</hi> was resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and tolde for a flat conclusion, <hi>Eurimachus</hi> was the man, and none but he. Whereupon, my sonne seeing no means could preuaile to remoue her affection, he thought by taking away the cause, to raze out the effects: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he sent for <hi>Eurimachus,</hi> whom after he had nipped vp with bitter taunts, he banished from the Court.</p>
               <p>This being grieuous to the two louers, yet the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of each others constancie, and the hope in time to haue the Prince reconciled, mitigated some part of their martyrdome: and <hi>Marpesia,</hi> to shew to the world shee was not fleeting, whatsoeuer her friends said, discouered the grief she conceiued by his absence openly, for she went ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled in mourning attire. Well, <hi>Eurimachus</hi> thus ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, went home to his father, who for feare of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince, durst not entertaine him, which vnkindnesse had doubled his griefe, that he fell almost frantike, and began to leaue the company of men as a flat Timonist: in which humor, meeting with the Gentleman that bewraid their loues, he fought with him and slew him, and buried him so secretly as the care of his owne life could deuise.</p>
               <p>Well, <hi>Cleander</hi> was mist, but heare of him they could not; Postes were sent out, messengers through all <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probane,</hi> but no newes, so that diuerse did descant diuers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of his departure; some said he was vpon secret displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure betweene him and the Prince, passed out of the land: others, that he was slaine by theeues: some that hee was deuoured by wild beasts. Thus debating of his absence, he was generally lamented of all the court.</p>
               <p>But (leauing the supposition of his death) againe to <hi>Marpesia,</hi> who taking the exile of <hi>Eurimachus</hi> to her heart, began to growe into great and extreme passions, and for griefe of the minde, to bodily disease, that she fell into a Quartaine, which so tormented her, as the Physicians said, ther was no hope of life, nor no art to cure her disease
<pb facs="tcp:6209:37"/>
vnlesse her minde were at quiet: whereupon her brother fearing his sisters life, recalled home <hi>Eurimachus,</hi> admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him into great fauour, and gaue frée grant of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will to their marriage.</p>
               <p>Upon this, <hi>Marpesia</hi> growing into a content, in short time amended. After shee had recouered her health, shee dayly vsed the company of <hi>Eurimachus</hi> very priuately and familiarly, but she found him not the man he was before: for before he was exiled, no man more pleasant nor more merrily conceited; now none more melancholly nor ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of dumps, vttering farre fetcht sighes, and vncertaine answers, so that it discouered a minde greatly perplexed. <hi>Marpesia</hi> noting this, being on a day all alone with <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus</hi> in his chamber, shee sought with faire intreaties and sweete dalliance, to wring out the cause of his sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, protesting, if shee could, euen with the hazard of her life redresse it: if not, to participate in griefe some part of his distresse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eurimachus,</hi> that loued her more than his life, although hee knew womens tongues were like the leaues of the Aspe tree, yet thinking her to bee wise, after a multitude of mortall sighes, hee discoursed vnto her, how hee had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>Marpesia</hi> hearing this, made light of the matter, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort <hi>Eurimachus,</hi> promising and protesting to kéepe it as secret as hitherto she had been constant. But shee no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was parted from her best beloued, but shee was with childe of this late and dangerous newes, laboring with great paines till shee might vtter it to her Gossips: where we may note, sonne (I speake against my selfe) that the closets of womens thoughts are euer open, that the depth of their heart hath a string that stretcheth to the tongues end, that with <hi>Semele</hi> they conceiue and bring forth oft before their time: which <hi>Marpesia</hi> tried true, for sitting one day solitarie with a Ladie in the court, called <hi>Celia,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:6209:37"/>
shee fetcht many pinching sighes, which <hi>Celia</hi> marking, desired her to tel her the cause of that late conceiued grief, as to a friend, in whose secresie she might repose her life. <hi>Marpesia</hi> made it somewhat coy and charie a great while, insomuch that <hi>Celia</hi> began to long; and therefore vrged her extremely. <hi>Marpesia</hi> could keep no longer, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vsing this preamble, began to play the blabbe.</p>
               <p>If I did not, Madam <hi>Celia,</hi> take you for my second selfe, and thinke you to bee wise and secret, I would not reueale a matter of so great importance, which toucheth me as much as my life to conceale: Women, you know, hauing any thing in their stomake, long while they haue discourst it to some friend: taking you therefore for my chiefest, and hoping all shal be troden vnder foote, know Madam, that <hi>Eurimachus</hi> hath slaine <hi>Cleander,</hi> and that is the cause that makes him thus melancholy.
