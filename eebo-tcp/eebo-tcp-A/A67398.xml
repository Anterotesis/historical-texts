            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>May it please Your Lordship,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE ensuing Sermons (Preached, in my ordinary turns, to the Vniversity,) were not intended to be more publick than that Auditory: But (being made acquainted that they would not be unacceptable to your Lordship;) I have presumed to Publish them under your Lordships Patronage. I have therein purposely waved (as I alwaies do) all nice disputes of Speculative Subtilties in Controversal Points (wherein those may possibly differ, who yet agree in the setled Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;)</hi> as more tending to disturb the peace of the Church, than to promote Piety. The design of them is, to shew the Necessity of <hi>Habitual</hi> Grace in our Hearts with the <hi>Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice</hi> of it in our Lives; and the need we have of God's <hi>Assistance</hi> to both. And I therein keep close to the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of our own Church (which I judge, in the whole, to be Sound and Orthodox,) and as near as may be, in her own Words. If any shall please themselves with thoughts of <hi>Doing</hi> good, without <hi>Being</hi> so; or, contrariwise, of a
<pb facs="tcp:101939:3"/>
good <hi>Heart,</hi> without a good <hi>Life</hi>; or, that he is of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self sufficient for One or Both of these (so as to please God) without the Divine <hi>Assistance:</hi> I am sure he is, therein, no true Son of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Thus far, I hope we do all agree. And, being to speak to many of those, whose Function calls them to speak to others; I thought it seasonable to inculcate these Necessary Truths: Whereof they cannot be Ignorant, and of which I would not have them Vnmindfull, in their great Work of saving Souls. And I heartily wish there were more Zeal for these Great Truths, and less Animosities about little things, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily Divide good Men, Break our Peace, and Gratifie those who seek our Ruine. I am</p>

               <q>
                  <bibl>JOHN iij. 3.</bibl>
                  <p>Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdome of God.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE words are <hi>Christ</hi>'s to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> a great man among the <hi>Jews: A Pharisee; a Ruler of the Jews; a Master in Israel:</hi> (for so we find him stiled <hi>ver.</hi> 1. &amp; 10.) Yet did not understand the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101939:4"/>
of Regeneration. As appears by his questions <hi>ver.</hi> 4, &amp; 9. <hi>How can these things be? How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his Mothers womb?</hi> &amp;c. And by <hi>Christ</hi>'s Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postulation, ver. 10. <hi>Art thou a Master in Israel and knowest not these things?</hi> Much like that of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle to those <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12. who, <hi>when for the time they ought to be Teachers, had need themselves to be taught again the first principles of the oracles of God; and had need of Milk, not of strong Meat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Pharisees,</hi> we know, though great pretenders to Religion, and a strain of Devotion beyond others, and to a great exactness to the modes and formalities of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Worship then in practice: yet were no great friends to <hi>Christ,</hi> or to his Doctrine.</p>
            <p>This made <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> being one of them, not willing at first to own it openly, (that he might not give a publick scandal to those of his own party,) till he should be better informed of the truth of it: And therefore, in a private way, (to avoid offence,) <hi>came to Jesus by night.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, being an inquisitive person, willing to satisfie himself, and not (relying only upon others judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) to go blindfold as the crowd carried him; and suspecting , there might be somewhat more, than men were commonly aware of, in this despised Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: He resolved first to know what it was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would condemn it. And therefore made this address to <hi>Christ,</hi> as best able to inform him.</p>
            <p>And he came not, as at some other times the <hi>Pharisees</hi> did, to Tempt him, to Deride him, to Cavil at him, to Blaspheme him, to Insnare him, seeking how they might Destroy him: But, with an honest intention, to be Informed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:101939:4"/>As appears by that his respectfull address, ver. 2. <hi>Rabbi, we know that thou art a Teacher come from God; for no man can doe those miracles that thou dost, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept God be with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Christ,</hi> being as willing to Teach, as he was to Learn; sets him first this Lesson, <hi>Except a man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdome of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not as being the most Easie to learn, (for, we see, to <hi>Nicodemus</hi> it seemed at first very strange:) But as being one of the most Necessary and Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Doctrines in Religion.</p>
            <p>And that which is <hi>Christ</hi>'s Doctrine in the Text, shall be my Doctrine at present; whereof (through God's assistance) I now purpose to speak: <hi>The Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of Regeneration,</hi> or a New Birth, <hi>Except a man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdome of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a Doctrine, which perhaps may seem as strange to some in this age, as it did to <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> then.</p>
            <p>There being those, who do not only (as perhaps at first he did) Doubt of it; but Scoff and Reproch it, who make but a Jest of it at the best; if not a subject of Burlesk and Drollery, and such like unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury discourse, unbeseeming a Christians Mouth and Ears.</p>
            <p>But we shall find it, first or last, to be a Serious thing: Not so Needless, nor yet so very Easie, as prophane persons perswade themselves.</p>
            <p>As to the truth of this Doctrine; it will need no great Proof; being the very words of the Text. And those who, upon the evidence of this one Text, will not believe it; would perhaps as little believe it, if I should produce many more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:101939:5"/>It will rather need Explication, than Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>And two things there are to be explained: What is here meant by <hi>seeing the Kingdome of God</hi>; and, what by <hi>being born again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> What is meant by <hi>seeing the Kingdome of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The word <hi>Kingdome,</hi> in its first and proper signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, imports, that <hi>State, Dignity,</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> which Earthly <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> have over their People and Subjects; with the <hi>Greatness, Splendour,</hi> and other Appurtenances to such <hi>Dominion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But is here to be understood in a Figurative sense; for something Great, Splendid and Excellent; as Kingdomes are, or be thought to be.</p>
            <p>For it is not meant, that those who are here said to be <hi>born again,</hi> shall be Kings and Princes, such as on Earth are so called,</p>
            <p>But, that they shall injoy a condition, as Great, as Glorious, as Excellent; as that of Kings and Princes: Yea, much more than so.</p>
            <p>And thus much is implyed in that Addition, when it is called the Kingdome <hi>of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which is partly a Note of <hi>Distinction,</hi> partly a Note of <hi>Eminence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis usual in Scripture, when a word of ordinary use for Natural and Earthly things, is Metaphorical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applied to signifie somewhat that is Spiritual; to add some Epithete for Distinction.</p>
            <p>As when <hi>Christ</hi> is called the <hi>True</hi> Vine, the <hi>True</hi> Shepheard, the Bread <hi>of Life,</hi> the Bread <hi>that came down from Heaven,</hi> the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Rock, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by way of <hi>distinction,</hi> from <hi>Bread,</hi> a <hi>Rock,</hi> a <hi>Vine,</hi> a <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard,</hi> in the proper acceptation of the words.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:101939:5"/>But they do, withall, imply an <hi>Eminency,</hi> or <hi>Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Excellency,</hi> of the things so Metaphorically de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed; then of that which the words in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per sense do signifie.</p>
            <p>For the meaning is not, that <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>Truly</hi> a Vine, or <hi>Truly</hi> a Shepheard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the proper sense of those words:</p>
            <p>But, somewhat that is thereby resembled, more Excellent than it.</p>
            <p>That he is so Fruitfull, so Pleasant, so Comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; as that the Fruitfulness of the <hi>Vine,</hi> the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santness of the <hi>Grape,</hi> the Comfortableness of the <hi>Wine, (which makes glad the heart of man,)</hi> is but a faint <hi>Shadow</hi> and <hi>Resemblance,</hi> of what he is <hi>in Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That he is so Kind, so Tender, so Carefull of his; as that the Kindness, the Tenderness, the Care of a <hi>Shepheard,</hi> towards his Flock, doth but <hi>faintly Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> what he is <hi>in Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So here: The <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> or (as elsewhere) the Kingdome <hi>of Heaven,</hi> the <hi>Heavenly</hi> Kingdome, (with the like expressions;) do import; not such as what <hi>Men,</hi> on <hi>Earth,</hi> call a <hi>Kingdome</hi>: But, <hi>some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what else,</hi> thereby resembled; and <hi>somewhat more Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent</hi>; which <hi>God</hi> vouchsafes to call by that name: as much surpassing that of <hi>Men,</hi> as <hi>Heaven</hi> is above the <hi>Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heb. 12.28. <hi>A Kingdome that cannot be shaken.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.4. <hi>An Inheritance Incorruptible, and Vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, and which fadeth not away, reserved in Heaven for us.</hi> 1 Pet. 5.4. <hi>A Crown of Righteousness, which fadeth not away.</hi> 2 Tim. 4.8. <hi>A Crown of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, laid up for us; which God the Righteous Judge shall give us in that day.</hi> Mat. 25.34. <hi>A Kingdome
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101939:6"/>
prepared for us from the beginning of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By <hi>the Kingdome of God,</hi> therefore, we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that Glory, that Happiness, that Blessed Condition, (whatever it is) which the Children of God, (those that are <hi>born again,)</hi> do seek after, and shall enjoy: Partly in this life, where it is called the <hi>Kingdome of Grace</hi>; and partly hereafter, which is the <hi>Kingdome of Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus we are to understand it in <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.33. <hi>Seek first the Kingdome of God and his righteousness.</hi> And 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the Kingdome of God?</hi> Gal. 5.19—21. <hi>The works of the flesh are manifest, adultery, fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, uncleanness,</hi> &amp;c. (with a large Catalogue of such others; which concludes with this) <hi>They which doe such things shall not inherit the Kingdome of God.</hi> But, <hi>Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God: Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake, for theirs is the Kingdome of God,</hi> Mat. 5.3, 10.</p>
            <p>Now, this Blessedness of the Children of God, (here and hereafter,) is called by the name of a <hi>Kingdome:</hi> Not as if this did fully express the nature of it: But because (as the saying is) <hi>Nihil est in intellectu, quod non fuit prius in sensu</hi>; We cannot easily apprehend <hi>Intellectual</hi> objects, otherwise than by some resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of things to <hi>Sense.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore, there being a want of Words, and of Notions too, which might adequately express the nature of this <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Heavenly</hi> Happiness: we are fain to make use of <hi>sensible</hi> things, some way to <hi>Resemble</hi> them, though not perfectly to <hi>Express</hi> them by.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:101939:6"/>And all those things, which are looked upon here, as the most Excellent, the most Desirable, in any kind; are made use of to this purpose.</p>
            <p>'Tis called <hi>Life</hi>; and Life <hi>Eternal.</hi> 'Tis called a <hi>Treasure,</hi> laid up in Heaven; and <hi>Durable Riches.</hi> 'Tis called <hi>Fulness of Joy and Pleasures for evermore.</hi> 'Tis called a <hi>Royal Feast</hi>; a <hi>Marriage Supper</hi>; a <hi>Feast of fat things.</hi> 'Tis called <hi>a Reward; a glorious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance; Everlasting Mansions; an House not made with hands</hi>; and the like. 'Tis called, <hi>a Crown of Glory; a Crown of Righteousness; a Heavenly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; the Kingdome of Heaven</hi>; and (as here) <hi>the Kingdome of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not as if any, or all of those, did adequately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press its worth: But, these being the great Desirable things of the World; and which our Senses are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with: They are all made use of, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent a Condition, which hath as much, and more, of Happiness, than all that of <hi>Riches and Honours, Profits and Pleasures, Gladness and Feasting, Houses and Lands, Treasures and Inheritances, Crowns and Kingdoms,</hi> yea and <hi>Life</hi> it self.</p>
            <p>And, when we have fancy'd all that is Great and Glorious, in all these Sensible Objects; we must then conceive, there is somewhat yet more Excellent, than all that we can fancy. 1 Cor. 2.9. <hi>For Eye hath not seen, nor hath Ear heard, nor hath it entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heart of man to conceive, what God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them that love him.</hi> And such is that <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God,</hi> which the Text speaks of.</p>
            <p>Now, what it is to <hi>see</hi> this Kingdome of God; is not hard to understand.</p>
            <p>It is not, <hi>to see it afar off,</hi> so as to have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment in it; as the <hi>Rich Glutton,</hi> Luk. 16.23. in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101939:7"/>
the Parable, might <hi>See Lazarus in Abrahams bosome</hi>; but without any possibility of coming there.</p>
            <p>But so <hi>to see,</hi> as to <hi>Enjoy</hi> it, and bear a part in it. So to <hi>see,</hi> as when Christ saith <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</hi> Or as Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. So <hi>to see the Glory of God,</hi> as to be <hi>changed into the same image, from glory to glory.</hi> Or as St. <hi>John,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.2. <hi>Behold we are now the Sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be:</hi> But, when he <hi>shall appear,</hi> (or, as the words may as well be rendered, <hi>when it shall appear,) we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.</hi> An Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative sight, not meerly Speculative.</p>
            <p>So here <hi>To see it,</hi> is <hi>To enjoy it:</hi> or (as <hi>Christ</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains himself <hi>ver.</hi> 5.) <hi>To enter into it.</hi> For, what is here said, <hi>He cannot See the Kingdome of God</hi>; is there, <hi>He cannot Enter into the Kingdome of God.</hi> Or to Inherit it: As 1 Cor. 15.50. <hi>Flesh and bloud can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Inherit the Kingdome of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To See the Kingdome of God,</hi> therefore, is to <hi>Enjoy,</hi> to <hi>Enter into,</hi> and to <hi>Inherit,</hi> that <hi>Glory,</hi> that <hi>Happy and Blessed Condition,</hi> which God hath designed for those that he makes <hi>his Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But those who are to Enjoy this Happiness, must first be <hi>Born again.</hi> For so we heard but now, <hi>Flesh and Bloud cannot inherit the Kingdome of God.</hi> And, as the Text hath it, <hi>Except a man be born again he cannot see the Kingdome of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are therefore, in the second place to consider, what it is, To be <hi>Born again;</hi> or, as the Margin reads it, To be <hi>Born from Above.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is not much material which way we read it.</p>

               </gap>.) The meaning will be still the same: Save that, here will be further imported, the <hi>Principle</hi> whence this <hi>New Birth</hi> proceeds.</p>
            <p>The former of these seems to be favoured in the 4<hi>th. verse,</hi> where it is explained by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (and so, it seems, <hi>Nicodemus</hi> understood it,) <hi>can a man enter a second time into his Mothers Womb, and be Born?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Latter in 5<hi>th. verse</hi>; where what was before said <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is now expressed by <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>; <hi>Except a man be born of Water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdome of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, either way, the thing will be the same. For there must be <hi>a Second Birth:</hi> and it must be, <hi>by a Power from Above.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the better understanding of which, we are to consider, that what was before said of the word <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> is here applicable to this, of being <hi>Born again:</hi> That is, that <hi>Spiritual</hi> things are, Figuratively, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101939:8"/>
by words importing things <hi>Natural.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for as much as, our <hi>first Birth</hi> or <hi>Generation,</hi> is the Rise or Origine of our <hi>Natural</hi> Being; as <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Creatures,</hi> and the <hi>Children of Men:</hi> That therefore which gives us our <hi>Spiritual</hi> Being; as <hi>New Creatures,</hi> and the <hi>Children of God,</hi> is, by Analogy thereunto, stiled <hi>Regeneration,</hi> our <hi>second Birth,</hi> or being <hi>Born again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any would be so nice, as to object, That a Child, <hi>before it be Born,</hi> is indued with a <hi>Reasonable Soul</hi>; and therefore his <hi>Birth,</hi> not the <hi>first Origine</hi> of his Rational Nature:</p>
            <p>This alters not the case at all. For we are not here to take the word <hi>Birth</hi> so strictly, as respecting that Moment only of <hi>coming into the world,</hi> (as we use to speak:) But with a Retrospection as far backward as to the first Conception; as being of the same import with <hi>Generation,</hi> (and might have been so rendered,) answering to the <hi>Greek</hi> words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. As in <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>The Book of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Jesus Christ.</hi> And <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which we render, <hi>Abraham begat Isaac.</hi> And (in <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5.) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is as well rendered by <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,</hi> as if it had been rendered <hi>a New Birth,</hi> or being <hi>Born again.</hi> And 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is rendered, <hi>Who hath begotten us again unto a lively hope.</hi> Yet of the same import with that of the Text, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which we here render, <hi>Born again</hi>; but may as fitly be rendered by <hi>Regenitus</hi> as by <hi>Rena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi> And both words are indifferently used, as rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the whole time from the Conception to the Birth.</p>
            <p>To be <hi>Regenerated</hi> therefore or <hi>Born again,</hi> (take which word you please,) is; to have a <hi>New Nature</hi> wrought in us; whereby we become <hi>New Creatures,</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:101939:8"/>
and have a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Being; as, by our <hi>Generation</hi> or <hi>first Birth,</hi> we become <hi>Reasonable Creatures</hi>; and have our <hi>Natural</hi> Being. This being called <hi>Flesh</hi>; and that, <hi>Spirit</hi>; in the following Explication, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>That which is born of the Flesh, is Flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit, is Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is; Like as by our <hi>Fleshly,</hi> Carnal, or Natural <hi>Generation,</hi> (or first Birth,) from our <hi>Natural Parents</hi>; we are made <hi>Flesh and Bloud,</hi> (indued with a Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Soul, and <hi>Natural Life,</hi> as <hi>Humane Creatures,</hi> and the <hi>Children of Men:)</hi> So, by our <hi>Regeneration,</hi> (or being Born again,) by the <hi>Spirit</hi>; we become <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,</hi> or <hi>New Creatures</hi>; endued with a <hi>Spiritual Life</hi> and Vigour; are made <hi>Partakers of the Divine Nature,</hi> and become the <hi>Sons of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4.</p>
            <p>But (as to this Antithesis of <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Spirit)</hi> we are to consider further, That the term <hi>Flesh</hi> (as it is here called,) or <hi>Flesh and Bloud</hi> (as elsewhere,) are words of a middle Signification; but <hi>Sonantia in malum:</hi> Words not evil in themselves; but most frequently used in the worst sense.</p>
            <p>And therefore though <hi>Flesh and Bloud,</hi> as it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth only <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> and what appertains to Man as Man, imply nothing Evil in it self: Yet, since the Pollution of our Nature by the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> there is, not only a Guilt derived to us from him; But a Depravation of Nature; which I will not take upon me to describe otherwise, than in the words of our Church, in her ninth <hi>Art.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This our Church there calls <hi>Original Sin</hi>; and declares it to be, <hi>the Fault and Corruption of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of every man, that naturally is engendred of the Off-spring of Adam; Whereby man is far gone from Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Righteousness, and is of his own nature inclined
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101939:9"/>
to evil; So that the Flesh lusteth always contrary to the Spirit. And therefore, in every person born into this world, it deserveth God's Wrath and Damnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though this <hi>Infection of Nature</hi> (as our Church calls it) be indeed <hi>Proeternatural,</hi> as to the Essentials of Humane Nature: Yet, being so far spread over all, as to become Universal; we now, by <hi>Nature,</hi> do commonly mean, <hi>Corrupt Nature</hi>; (not as God made it, but as we have made it;) And, by <hi>Flesh,</hi> or <hi>Flesh and Bloud,</hi> (especially when contradistinguished to the <hi>Spirit,)</hi> is commonly meant, not <hi>humane Nature simply considered</hi>; but <hi>Humane Nature thus Corrupted,</hi> or <hi>sinfull Flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in this sense it is, that <hi>flesh and bloud cannot inherit the Kingdome of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.50. That is; not while it remains <hi>Sinfull</hi> Flesh and Bloud. But when it shall be purged from Sin; Flesh and Bloud, thus purged from Corruption, (the Essentials of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature remaining,) shall (after the Resurrection of the Body) inherit this Kingdome of God.</p>
            <p>The meaning therefore, of the Text and Doctrine, is this: The nature of Man, though at first made Pure and Righteous, (and thereby fitted for commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God;) is, by the Fall so depraved, as that he is now become <hi>naturally prone to Sin, and averse to Righteousness</hi>; and this <hi>natural Propension,</hi> is further improved by <hi>Sinfull Practices</hi>; (and so more and more daily, while this Propension lasts;) which doth unfit us for such Communion: So that, before we can be in a capacity to <hi>inherit the Kingdome of God</hi>; there must be a New Nature wrought in us, and those Propensions changed for better; a new Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple must be instilled, which shall render us inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Righteousness, as before we were to Sin. And
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101939:9"/>
this is that which the Text calls, <hi>A being born again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is this so harsh a Trope, or uncouth Form of Speech, as at first view it may seem to be: But very usual (with some little alteration) in all Languages.</p>
            <p>For <hi>denuo nasci,</hi> or <hi>de novo nasci,</hi> (to be born again, or born anew,) is all one as, to have <hi>novam naturam,</hi> a new nature; <hi>(Natura,</hi> being but a Verbal of <hi>Nas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor</hi>; Like as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.) And we know 'tis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry usual, to speak of <hi>Good natures, Better natures, New natures, &amp;c.</hi> when we intend only different <hi>Qualities,</hi> or habitual <hi>Propensions</hi> and <hi>Inclinations</hi>; though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Essential diversity.</p>
            <p>'Tis not indeed so obvious, to observe that Equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, in our own Language; because the Noun and Verb are not <hi>Conjugates,</hi> as in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine.</hi> The word <hi>Nature</hi> coming by a <hi>French</hi> Extraction from <hi>Nascor</hi>: But, <hi>to Bear,</hi> and <hi>to be Born,</hi> by a <hi>Saxon,</hi> from <hi>Pario.</hi> But both are words of the same import. For <hi>Nascor</hi> doth but supply the Passive voice of <hi>Pario:</hi> And they are so rendered in <hi>English: Pario,</hi> to <hi>Bear</hi>; and <hi>Nascor,</hi> to <hi>be Born.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that, to be <hi>born again,</hi> or <hi>born anew,</hi> is the same as to have <hi>another nature; a new nature</hi>; to become (as we use to say) <hi>another Kind of Man,</hi> (for <hi>kind</hi> or <hi>kin,</hi> is from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and that from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Nascor</hi>;) to become a better natur'd Man: And, <hi>to be born of God,</hi> is but what we say in another Phrase, <hi>to be made partakers of the Divine Nature</hi>; (which the <hi>Greeks</hi> would not scruple to express by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) So, to <hi>be born of the Spirit,</hi> is, to <hi>have a spiritual Nature:</hi> Born of the Flesh; <hi>a fleshly Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the difference is this; That what, according to the common Idioms, is expressed by <hi>Natura</hi>; is, according to the Idiom of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> expressed by
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101939:10"/>
               <hi>Natus</hi>; (a Son, a Child, or being Born) which Idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om, the Writers of the <hi>New Testament</hi> do frequently follow; as being much conversant with the <hi>Jews</hi>; and accustomed to their forms of Speech.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>John</hi> 8.39. <hi>If ye were the Children of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, ye would doe the works of Abraham</hi>; is as much as to say, If ye had <hi>Abraham</hi>'s nature, ye would doe <hi>Abraham</hi>'s works. And again <hi>ver.</hi> 42, 45. <hi>If God were your Father, ye would love me; because I came from God: But ye are of your Father the Devil; and the lusts of your Father ye will doe.</hi> That is; If ye were of a Godly nature, ye would love him that comes from God; But because your nature is Devilish, your designs are so too.</p>
            <p>Thus, Mat. 12.34. <hi>Sons of Belial; a generation of Vipers</hi>; Isa. 1.4. <hi>A seed of Evil-doers</hi>; 1 Sam. 20.30. <hi>Thou Son of the Perverse Woman</hi>; Ezek. 16.3. <hi>Thy Father was an Amorite, and thy Mother an Hittite</hi>; (with the like expressions;) import, such a Nature, such a Disposition, as that of those whose Children they are said to be.</p>
            <p>And all, upon that general Notion, That the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring or Progeny are frequently observed, to Imitate those from whom they proceed.</p>
            <p>Whence that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Ephes. 5.1. <hi>Be ye follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of God as dear Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, for the better understanding of this Phrase, We are to consider further, That we are, in Scripture, called the <hi>Children of God,</hi> or <hi>Sons of God,</hi> in at least a twofold acceptation. Sons of God by <hi>Adoption:</hi> And, Sons of God by <hi>Regeneration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which, though they both belong to the same Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, yet in a very different Notion. The one im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports a <hi>Relative</hi> change: The other, a <hi>Real.</hi> That
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101939:10"/>
relates to the business of <hi>Justification:</hi> This, to that of <hi>Sanctification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Adoption is a <hi>Forensick</hi> word; and implies an act of Grace, or Favour; by which those that by nature <hi>are not</hi> Sons, come to be so Reputed, and are put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a like condition, as if <hi>they were</hi> Sons; and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by intituled to the Inheritance.</p>
            <p>It implies therefore a <hi>change of State,</hi> not a <hi>change of Nature</hi>; a <hi>Relative,</hi> not a <hi>Real,</hi> change: It doth, without conferring a <hi>new Nature,</hi> create at least a <hi>new Relation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But a Son by <hi>Birth,</hi> receives from his Parent, not a <hi>Relation</hi> only, but his very <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Being.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Scripture, in calling us <hi>the Sons</hi> of God, hath respect to both these notions.</p>
            <p>That of <hi>Adoption,</hi> we have in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4, 5, 7. <hi>In the fulness of time, God sent his Son made of a Woman, made under the Law , to redeem them that were under the Law, that we might receive the Adoption of Sons; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou art no more a servant, but a Son: And, if a Son, then an Heir,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Having proedestinated us to the adoption of Children.</hi> And, <hi>if Children, then heirs; heirs of God; and joint-heirs with Christ</hi>; as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17.</p>
            <p>And this, (I take it) is the same which by some Divines is called <hi>Positive Justification</hi>; relating to what they call Christ's <hi>Active Obedience:</hi> Which they do contradistinguish, to what they call <hi>Negative Justification</hi>; which they refer to the <hi>Passive Obedience</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What <hi>Christ</hi> hath done and suffered for us, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a <hi>satisfaction</hi> to Divine Justice, (which they call his <hi>Passive Obedience,)</hi> doth Ransome us from the Curse of the Law done to us for Sin; and puts us in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101939:11"/>
a condition of <hi>Not guilty</hi>; (which they call <hi>Negative Justification,</hi> or <hi>Absolution.</hi>) And by this we are <hi>excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what he hath done or suffered, by way of <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase</hi>; Meriting a Reward for us; (which they call, his <hi>Active Obedience,)</hi> gives us a <hi>title to Heaven,</hi> or as it is called <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.14.) <hi>the Inheritance, of that Purchased Possession.</hi> And this they call <hi>Possitive Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification</hi>; and is in Scripture language, called <hi>Adoption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which yet need not be so understood, as if some parts of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Obedience, were only <hi>Satisfactory,</hi> and not <hi>Meritorious</hi>; others, <hi>Meritorious</hi> only, and not <hi>Satisfactory:</hi> But the same obedience, may sustain both Considerations. Considered as <hi>Satisfactory,</hi> it Frees us from <hi>Hell:</hi> Considered as <hi>Meritorious,</hi> it Entitles us to <hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now 'tis one thing, for a Prince to <hi>Acquit</hi> a Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, of all Crimes, as well of Omission, as of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission; which Absolves him from <hi>Punishment:</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to <hi>Adopt</hi> him moreover as a Prince, and entitle him to a <hi>Crown.</hi> And though both be coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on the same Person; yet under a different notion: The one, as an act of <hi>Pardon</hi>; the other, of <hi>Bounty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if a third person, by what he doth or suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, procure Both for him: 'Tis as to the one, a <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi>; as to the other, a <hi>Purchase.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, Whether we call That, <hi>Negative Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; and This <hi>Possitive Justification:</hi> Or call That, <hi>Justification</hi>; and This, <hi>Adoption:</hi> Is but a difference of <hi>Words,</hi> the <hi>Notions</hi> are still the same.</p>
            <p>But neither of these, (whether that of <hi>Justification,</hi> or that of <hi>Adoption,</hi>) do properly import, in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, a <hi>Real</hi> Change, but only a <hi>Relative.</hi> For the Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, thus <hi>Pardoned,</hi> and thus <hi>Advanced</hi>; may yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101939:11"/>
a Wicked Person, and as very an Enemy to his Soveraign as he was before; if there be not a change wrought in his <hi>Mind,</hi> as well as in his <hi>Relative state.</hi> Nor is this the <hi>Sonship,</hi> which the Text speaks of.</p>
            <p>But, beside this <hi>Sonship by Adoption</hi>; there is also a <hi>Sonship by Regeneration</hi>; which the Text mentions, as <hi>Necessary</hi> to those who shall <hi>See the Kingdome of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this implies, (as was said before,) not so much a <hi>Relative</hi> change, of the <hi>State</hi>; as a <hi>Real</hi> change, of the <hi>Person.</hi> Except a man be <hi>born again,</hi> (and thereby have a New <hi>Nature,</hi> as well as a New <hi>Relation,</hi>) he cannot See the Kingdome of God.</p>
            <p>'Tis vain, to think of being the Sons of God by <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption;</hi> unless we be his Sons by <hi>Regeneration</hi> also. The one never goes without the other.</p>
            <p>For, like as 'tis a Vain thing, to talk of <hi>Saving Faith,</hi> which is not (as occasion serves) attended with <hi>Good Works:</hi> And a Vain thing to talk of being <hi>Justified,</hi> without being <hi>Sanctified</hi> also: So 'tis a Vain thing to talk of <hi>Adoption,</hi> without <hi>Regeneration.</hi> For, though the <hi>Notions</hi> be Different; the <hi>Things</hi> alwaies go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And are commonly so mentioned in Scripture.</p>
            <p>Thus; 1 <hi>Joh.</hi>12, 13. <hi>To as many as Received him,</hi> that is, <hi>to as many as believed on his name,</hi> (as it is there explained,) <hi>he gave Power, (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) a Right or Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege,</hi> (as the Margin renders it,) to be the <hi>Sons of God,</hi> to wit, by Adoption: But it then follows); <hi>which were Born,</hi> (to wit, by Regeneration) <hi>not of the will of Man but of God.</hi> Those that are the <hi>Sons of God,</hi> by Adoption; must be <hi>Born again,</hi> by Regeneration.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Gal.</hi> 4, 5, 6. When he had said, <hi>God sent his Son,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that we might receive the Adoption of Sons</hi>; he adds, <hi>And because ye are Sons, God hath sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba Father:</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:101939:12"/>
That is, the Spirit of Regeneration; the same Spirit by which the Text says, we must be Born again. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a man be born of Water and of the Spirit,</hi> (ver. 5.) <hi>he cannot enter into the Kingdome of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And again <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15, 16. <hi>We have not received the spirit of Bondage again, to Fear; but we have received the spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father: The Spirit it self bearing witness with our Spirits, that we are the Sons of God.</hi> But how doth he thus bear witness to our Adoption? He tells us (ver. 14.) <hi>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God:</hi> By being a Spirit of Regeneration, it bears witness of our Adoption.</p>
            <p>For, like as no man can know, that he is <hi>Elected</hi>; till he know, that he is <hi>Justified and Sanctified:</hi> So neither can we know, that we are <hi>Adopted</hi>; till we first know that we are <hi>Regenerate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whom he did Fore-know,</hi> (saith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 8.28.) <hi>he did also Predestinate to be conformed to the Image of his Son</hi>; that is, whom he designed to be Happy, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to be Holy: And <hi>whom he did thus Predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; them he Called; them he Justified; and them he Glorified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, till we find by the Effect, we were designed to be <hi>Holy</hi>; we can never know, that we are designed to be <hi>Happy.</hi> And, in like manner, Till we find that <hi>we are led by the Spirit,</hi> of Regeneration; we can never know that <hi>we are the Sons of God,</hi> by Adoption.</p>
            <p>And our Text, says the same, though in other words: <hi>Except a man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdome of God</hi>; that is, Except he be <hi>born again,</hi> by <hi>Regeneration</hi>; he cannot pretend a title <hi>to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God,</hi> by <hi>Adoption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Till they be <hi>born again</hi>; they cannot be <hi>Children
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101939:12"/>
of the Kingdome</hi>; as the Phrase is, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.38.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adoption,</hi> and <hi>Regeneration,</hi> alwaies go together.</p>
            <p>Now as, <hi>being the Sons of God by Adoption,</hi> is the Completing of our <hi>Justification:</hi> So, <hi>To become the Sons of God by Regeneration,</hi> is the Beginning of our <hi>Sanctification.</hi> For what, in the <hi>Origine</hi> or <hi>Beginning,</hi> we call <hi>Regeneration,</hi> or a <hi>New Birth</hi>; that, in the <hi>Progress,</hi> we call <hi>Sanctification</hi> or a <hi>New Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And 'tis called, in Scripture, by many other Names, to the same purpose.</p>
            <p>'Tis called, <hi>A dying to Sin, and being alive to God,</hi> Rom. 6.4, 11. that we may thenceforth <hi>Walk in new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis called <hi>Conversion</hi>; or, a <hi>turning from darkness, to light; from the power of Sathan unto God,</hi> Act. 26.18. <hi>That they may receive forgiveness of Sins, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance among those that are Sanctified.</hi> Where you see <hi>Conversion,</hi> attended with <hi>Justification</hi> (or the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness of Sins,)</hi> and <hi>Adoption,</hi> to the <hi>Inheritanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>; but 'tis, amongst those that are <hi>sanctified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And again, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.3. <hi>Except ye be Converted, and become as little children; ye shall not enter into the Kingdome of Heaven.</hi> Where, <hi>being Converted,</hi> is the same with what the Text calls, being <hi>Born again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis, becoming <hi>a new Creature,</hi> Gal. 5.17. <hi>If any man be in Christ he is a new Creature: Old things are passed away, and all things are become new,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A new Heart; a new Spirit</hi>; Ezek. 36.26. that is, A new Frame and Temper of Mind; new Principles, new Propensions and Inclinations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To be renewed in the spirit of our Minds</hi>; Eph. 4.23.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To be created in Christ Jesus unto good works,</hi> (Eph. 2.10.) <hi>which God hath before ordained that we should walk therein:</hi> that is (according to our present Idiom,)
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101939:13"/>
               <hi>wherein God hath before appointed that we should walk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis a repairing of <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Image,</hi> in us; which, by the Fall was Obliterated and Defaced.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A putting off the Old man with his deeds; and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the New man, which is renewed after the Image of him that created him,</hi> Col. 3.9, 10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A putting off the Old man, which is corrupt accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the deceitfull Lusts; and putting on the New man which after God is created in Righteousness and true Holiness,</hi> Eph. 4.22, 24.</p>
            <p>With many other Expressions of like import. For, in expressing Spiritual things by Metaphors taken from things Sensible: 'tis frequent in Scripture, (because no one can adequately reach it,) to make use of many, some-way to Resemble the thing intended.</p>
            <p>The Result of all tends to this: That there must be a <hi>Change of Nature</hi> wrought; in those who are to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdome of God.</hi> Not, as to the <hi>Essentials of humane Nature</hi>; but, as to the <hi>perverse inclinations of corrupt Nature.</hi> Whence those who by Nature, (as now Corrupted,) are prone to Evil; may, from a new Principle, become in Love with God. And that, in order thereunto, we must have, not only a <hi>Principle of Reason,</hi> (from our First Birth) to act as <hi>Men</hi>; but a <hi>Principle of Grace</hi> also (from our new Birth) to act as <hi>Good Men.</hi> For an <hi>Evil Tree,</hi> Heb. 12.15. or <hi>(a Root of Bitterness,) will never,</hi> Mat. 7.17. <hi>bring forth good Fruit:</hi> But <hi>the Tree must be made good,</hi> Mat. 12.33. that the <hi>Fruit</hi> may be so also. There must be a <hi>New Nature,</hi> to bring forth a <hi>New Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have now done with the Explication of the Text and Doctrine.</p>
            <p>There be two things yet remaining; which (if
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101939:13"/>
there had been time for it) were proper enough to have been here discussed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From whence it is, that this necessity of a New Birth proceeds.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By what Power it must be wrought.</p>
            <p>The first of them we have touched by the way, in shewing, It is not <hi>Humane Nature</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as God made it; but <hi>Corrupt Nature,</hi> that makes this work necessary. For if we had not <hi>Degenerated</hi> from what God at first made us; there would not have been that need of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Regenerated,</hi> which now there is.</p>
            <p>The latter, is intimated, partly by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the Text; and partly in <hi>Christ</hi>'s further Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation <hi>(ver.</hi> 5.) <hi>Except a man be born of Water, and of the Spirit.</hi> For <hi>that which is born of the Flesh,</hi> is but <hi>Flesh:</hi> 'Tis <hi>that which is born of the Spirit, is Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But these (the time not permitting) I must either Omit altogether; or at least reserve till another season.</p>

            <p>I Have heretofore begun the handling of this Text; and (through God's assistance) hope now to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:101939:15"/>By <hi>the Kingdome of God,</hi> is meant, all that happy estate which the Children of God (those that are born of him) do enjoy, as well here, as hereafter.</p>
            <p>This the Scripture doth usually set forth by Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors taken from all those things which, amongst men, are accounted excellent, or desirable; either as Necessary, as Pleasant, as Profitable, as Glorious, or on what other consideration soever, (as being much more desirable than all these put together) and, amongst the rest, by that of <hi>a Kingdome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis called here the Kingdome <hi>of God,</hi> and the Kingdome <hi>of Heaven,</hi> elsewhere; by way of Eminence, and of Contradistinction, to those on Earth, those of Men; as much surpassing them <hi>as Heaven is high above the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Kingdome,</hi> is commonly distinguished into that <hi>of Grace,</hi> and that <hi>of Glory.</hi> And they are both here intended in the word Kingdome. But especially the latter: Those of Grace, being included in the former words, <hi>Except a man be born again</hi>; except he do here attain the Kingdome of Grace, he cannot hope here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to see that of Glory.</p>
            <p>To <hi>see</hi> this Kingdome, is not, so to see it as the Rich Glutton <hi>saw Lazarus in Abraham</hi>'s <hi>bosome,</hi> Luke 16.23. (to see it <hi>a far off,</hi> without being the better for it:) But, so as when Christ says, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God</hi>; and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Heb. 12.14. <hi>Without Holiness no man shall see the Lord:</hi> That is, to <hi>see</hi> it, as to <hi>Enjoy it,</hi> and have a share in it.</p>
            <p>And he that would thus <hi>See the Kingdome of God,</hi> must (the Text tells us) <hi>be born again:</hi> That is, he must have a <hi>New Nature,</hi> a new Nativity. He must by Regeneration, or his First Birth, or a Second Birth,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101939:15"/>
become a Child of God, a Child of Grace, as, by Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or his First Birth, he is a Child of Man, a Child of Sin.</p>
            <p>Now we are, in Scripture, called <hi>the Children of God,</hi> in a double sense: Children of God <hi>by Adoption,</hi> and Children of God <hi>by Regeneration.</hi> Which, though they both belong to the same Persons; yet in a very different Notion.</p>
            <p>The one implies a change of <hi>State</hi> or <hi>Condition:</hi> As when a Person who, by nature, is not a Son; is, by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption put into such a condition as if he were a Son; and intituled to the Inheritance.</p>
            <p>The other implies a change of <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Disposition:</hi> As when a Lion becomes as a Lamb; when a Fierce na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture becomes Meek and Gentle; when a Wicked man becomes Holy.</p>
            <p>Like as, 'tis one thing for a Prince to Pardon a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factour (and put him into a condition of Not-guilty:) Another thing, to make him an Honest man, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to the like offence again.</p>
            <p>The former of these, relates to Justification; the other, to Sanctification. Adoption, being the compleating of Justification; as Regeneration, is the beginning of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification. And 'tis the latter of these, that the Text means in <hi>being born again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, though the Notions be different; the Things do alway go both together. And so the Text tells us, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a man be Born again, he cannot See the Kingdome of God.</hi> We cannot expect to be the <hi>Sons of God by Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and so intituled to the <hi>Kingdome of God</hi>; unless we be first the <hi>Sons of God by Regeneration,</hi> and so made partakers of the <hi>Divine Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is the Result of what we discoursed more fully the last time: To shew the necessity of this Change of Nature, in those who shall see the Kingdome of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:101939:16"/>There remain yet two things to be (as we then said) considered. 1. From whence it is that this Necessity of a new Birth proceeds. And 2. By what Power it must be wrought. And, after that, to make <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the First of these; the Ground of this Necessity: We are to consider of Man, in a double capacity: First as God made him; and secondly, as he made himself. <hi>God made man upright</hi> (saith <hi>Solomon) but he hath found out many Inventions,</hi> Eccles. 7.29.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God,</hi> at first, <hi>created man after his own Image,</hi> Gen. 1.26, 27. <hi>In Knowledge, Righteousness and true Holiness,</hi> Eph. 4.24. Col. 3.10. Void of all Sin, Habitual, or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual. And, had we continued in such a state as wherein God made us; there would have been no necessity of this change of Nature. We had then, without it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Holy, and Happy. Had there been no Sin, there had been no need of a New-birth. Had there not been a Degeneration, from what God made us at first, there had been no need of a Regeneration, to reestate us in it.</p>
            <p>But Man, by Sin, having lost his Holyness; lost his Happiness also. As by One man Sin came upon All: So, Death, or Misery, the Effect of Sin.</p>
            <p>Rom. 5.12. <hi>By one man Sin entered into the World; and Death by Sin: And Death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:</hi> Or (as the Margin reads it) <hi>in whom all have sinned.</hi> (And so <hi>Grotius</hi> renders it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>per quem; By whom.</hi>) Ver. 14. <hi>Even upon them who had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression:</hi> That is, (as it is commonly understood,) even on Children, who had not sinned by imitation, or as <hi>Adam</hi> did. And so <hi>Grotius, etiam pueros nullius commissi reos,</hi> v. 13. From whence St. <hi>Paul</hi> there infers, that there is Sin, even in such: As without which they would not been subject to Death.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:101939:16"/>And <hi>David</hi> tells us of himself, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.5. <hi>I was sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And St. <hi>Paul</hi> likewise <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. <hi>I know that in me, (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing.</hi> Ver. 19. <hi>The Good that I would do, I do not; but the Evil which I would not do, that I do.</hi> Ver. 22. <hi>I delight in the Law of God after the Inward man:</hi> Ver. 23. <hi>But I see another Law in my Members, warring against the Law of my Mind; and bringing me into captivity to the Law of Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor need we here dispute the point, whether St. <hi>Paul</hi> speak this of himself as in his Regenerate condition; or, in his Unregenerate: For, either way, it serves our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose well enough; That there is in man, at least before his Regeneration, such Habitual Corruption, as makes him thus Prone to Sin, and Averse to Good. How much of it remains afterward, (because that we are Sanctified but in part,) is, to our present purpose, not necessary. But, that there is too much of it, even those that are the most Sanctified, find cause to bewail.</p>
            <p>This Depravation of Nature, or, as our Church calls it, <hi>Infection of Nature,</hi> she hath so well described in her 9<hi>th.</hi> Article, that I will not take upon me to mend it. She calls it, there, <hi>Original Sin</hi>; and declares it to be <hi>The Fault and Corruption of the Nature of every man, that naturally is engendred of the Off-spring of Adam: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by man is far gone from Original Righteousness; and is, of his own Nature, Inclined to Evil: So that the Flesh lust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth alwaies against the Spirit. And therefore, in every person born into this world, it deserveth God's Wrath and Damnation.</hi> With more to the same purpose.</p>
            <p>I do not intend here, to enter into a nice discourse of Original Sin; What it is, or By what means it comes to be derived upon us. It is enough, for our present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, which our Church saith explicitely; That such a thing there is; That by this we are Inclined to Evil; That
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101939:17"/>
it is Universal to all naturally descended from <hi>Adam</hi>; That it sticks so close to us as to be called Our own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and That it deserves God's Wrath and Damnation.</p>
            <p>Now, this being our Nature, as we proceed from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>; there will be need of another Nature, before we can be accepted of God.</p>
            <p>Which I do not mean, of a Physical change; as to the Essentials of Humane Nature: But, of a Moral change; as to the Propensions and Inclinations of it.</p>
            <p>And this Change of Nature is that which the Text means by <hi>being Born again.</hi> For (though our <hi>English</hi>-Tongue do not so much favour it) <hi>Nova Natura,</hi> and <hi>de novo Nasci,</hi> are all one. A new <hi>Nativity,</hi> is, a new <hi>Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is the <hi>Hebrews</hi> common form of Speech, (which the <hi>Greek</hi> in the New Testament doth use to follow,) to call men <hi>the Sons</hi> of such, whose Natures they imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate. (Upon a common presumption, that Animals are of the same nature with those from which they des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend.)</p>
            <p>Thus, <hi>A Generation of Vipers; A seed of Evil doers; Children of Belial; Ye are of your Father the Devil</hi>; and the like; imply as much, as a Viperous, Wicked and Devilish Nature. And, contrariwise, <hi>to be Born of God,</hi> on the <hi>Child of God,</hi> is, to be like God, to be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of a Divine Nature. And <hi>Christ</hi> to the <hi>Pharisees</hi> Joh. 8.39. <hi>If ye were the Children of Abraham, ye would do the works of Abraham:</hi> v. 44. <hi>But ye are of your Father the Devil, and the Lusts of your Father ye will do.</hi> That is; If you had <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Nature, you would Act like <hi>Abraham:</hi> But, being of a Devilish Nature, you Act accordingly.</p>
            <p>And thus much for the Ground or Reason of this Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity. It is the Corruption of <hi>our own</hi> Nature, that makes it necessary to have a <hi>new</hi> Nature; before we can
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101939:17"/>
see the Kingdome of God; where no unclean thing may enter; Eph. 4.22. <hi>We must put off the Old man, which is Corrupt according to the deceitfull lusts</hi>: v. 23. <hi>And be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in the spirit of our Minds:</hi> v. 24. <hi>And put on the New man, which after God is created in Righteousness and true Holyness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are next to consider, By what Power it is, that this Change of Nature must be wrought.</p>
            <p>And this, <hi>Christ</hi> tells, <hi>(Joh.</hi> 3.5) must be <hi>by the Spirit.</hi> Except a man be born of Water and <hi>of the Spirit.</hi> 'Tis not enough that a man be washed with Water, (such as were many of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Cleansings, and Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations; but insufficient to wash away Sin:) He must be born of the Spirit also; and by that be cleansed from the pollutions of Nature; if ever he see the Kingdome of God. Ver. 6. <hi>For that which is born of the Flesh is but Flesh</hi>; 'tis <hi>that which is born of the Spirit, that is Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To be born of the Flesh, is enough to give us a Flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Nature; that of a Reasonable creature, or a Sinfull creature: And to be washed with Water, may take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Filth of the Body; But it must be a Spiritual birth, that gives us a Spiritual nature: and it must be the <hi>Laver of Regeneration, and the Renewing of the holy Ghost,</hi> Tit. 3.5. that washeth away the Filth of Sin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>No man comes to me,</hi> saith <hi>Christ,</hi> Joh. 6.44. <hi>except the Father who sent me draw him.</hi> 'Tis <hi>according to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power</hi> (saith <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.3.) that we are <hi>made partakers of the Divine Nature,</hi> v. 4. 'Tis by <hi>the spirit of his Son,</hi> (saith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 4.6.) which <hi>God sends in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our hearts,</hi> whereby we are inabled to <hi>cry Abba Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Those to whom <hi>there is no condemnation,</hi> (Rom. 8.1.) are they who <hi>walk not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit:</hi> Those who have another principle of Life, and Action, by Spiritual Regeneration; than that of the

                  </gap>) is Death; but (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) to be Spiritually minded, is Life and Peace:</hi> v. 7. <hi>Because the carnal mind (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) is Enmity against God; for it is not subject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi> Ver. 8. <hi>So then, they that are in the Flesh, cannot Please God.</hi> V. 9. <hi>But ye are not in the Flesh, but in the Spirit; if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now, if any have not the Spirit of Christ; he is none of his.</hi> Ver. 13. <hi>For, if ye live after the Flesh; ye shall dye: but if ye, through the Spirit, do mortifie the deeds of the Body; ye shall Live.</hi> Ver. 14. <hi>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God; they are the Sons of God.</hi> With much more there to the same purpose.</p>
            <p>I know very well, that the name of <hi>the Spirit,</hi> in this loose age, is made matter of Burlesk and Drollery. But so are all the sacred things of God: His Being, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; Heaven, and Hell: and the day of Judgment. Yet we must not therefore be Drolled out of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Truths of God, will still be the Truths of God, notwithstanding the Follies of men.</p>
            <p>Those Admonitions of <hi>Quench not the Spirit,</hi> 1 Thes. 4.19. <hi>Grieve not the Spirit,</hi> Eph. 4.30. <hi>Walk in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and ye shall not fulfill the lusts of the Flesh,</hi> Gal. 5.16. were intended for serious Advice. And why should we Grieve that Spirit; which is to be <hi>our Comforter, Joh.</hi> 14.26. and 15.26. by whom we are <hi>sealed to the day of Redemption?</hi> Eph. 1.13. and 4.30.</p>
            <p>And <hi>David</hi> prays, in good earnest, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.10. <hi>Create in me a clean Heart, O God, and renew a right Spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me:</hi> v. 11. <hi>Take not thy holy Spirit from me:</hi> v. 12. <hi>Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold me with thy free Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:101939:18"/>Nor did God mock us, when he promised to <hi>pour his Spirit upon all flesh,</hi> Joel 2.28. Nor Christ, when he says <hi>His Father will give his holy Spirit to them that ask,</hi> Luke 11.13.</p>
            <p>And the Threatnings of God are very severe, against those that <hi>do despite to the Spirit of Grace,</hi> Heb. 10.29. and who <hi>Blaspheme or speak against the holy Spirit,</hi> Mat. 12.31, 32.</p>
            <p>Nor will the Follies of some, (who may pretend to what they have not,) Excuse the Malice of others, who make a Mock of Holy things.</p>
            <p>But, to return: This Change of Nature must, I say, be wrought by the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>Not but that we must be Active also; in a diligent use of the Means of Grace, whereby God's Spirit doth ordinarily work Grace in us; as Praying, Hearing and Reading the Word of God, keeping his Sabbaths; and other of his Ordinances. For God hath appointed them for that very end: that the Spirit of God may, by them, work Grace in us.</p>
            <p>But we are so to use them, as yet to look beyond them; and wait for a work of God by his Spirit upon our hearts, in concurrence with them, to make them effectual to us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I have Planted</hi> (saith <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.6.) <hi>and Apollo Watered; but God gave the Increase.</hi> Ver. 7. <hi>So then, neither is he that Planteth any thing, neither he that Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth</hi>; (that is, nothing in comparison:) <hi>But God that giveth the Increase.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence it is, that under the same Means of Grace, and the same Arguments used to perswade us, <hi>one is taken and another left,</hi> Mat. 24.40, 41. (as <hi>Christ</hi> speaks in a like case:) one converted, and another remains obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate: And, to the same person, there be some <hi>Mollia tempora fandi</hi>; those Arguments at one time prevail,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:101939:19"/>
which at another time do not. And, when they do, it is not without a special concurrence of God with them; and not meerly from other Circumstantials, or a power of our own without it.</p>
            <p>And our Church saith the same, (in her Tenth Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,) in the words: <hi>The Condition of Man, after the Fall of</hi> Adam, <hi>is such, that he cannot turn or prepare himself, by his own natural strength and good works, to Faith and Calling upon God: Wherefore we have no power to do good works pleasant and acceptable to God, without the Grace of God by Christ, Preventing us, that we may have a good will; and Working with us, when we have that good will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any shall yet inquire, as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> here, <hi>How can these things be?</hi> Joh. 3.10. How is it, that God, or his Spirit, can thus work upon our hearts, Man being a free Agent; or How this is consistent with the Freedome of Man's will; or the like:</p>
            <p>I do not know, that we are obliged to trouble our selves with those nice Inquiries. Sure it is, that, when we act, we act Freely; not against our wills, <hi>Certum est,</hi>
               <note rend="inter">August.</note> 
               <hi>nos velle cum volumus; sed Deus facit ut velimus:</hi> is a known saying in the case. <hi>When we will, 'tis voluntary; but 'tis God makes us thus to will.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> long before, <hi>It is God which worketh in us, both to Will and to Do, of his good pleasure,</hi> Phil. 2.13.</p>
            <p>As to the Manner of it; If we say, God works we know not how; it doth not therefore follow, that he doth not work. If <hi>we do not know, How the bones grow in the womb of her that is with child,</hi> Eccles. 11.5. (which yet, we know, do grow;) we may, as likely, be ignorant, How God works in the New-birth.</p>
            <p>We have in <hi>Job</hi> 38. a great many hard Questions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Natural things, which <hi>God</hi> himself puts to <hi>Job,</hi> (to check his curiosity in higher matters,) which would trouble any of us to answer, as to the particular manner;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:101939:19"/>
and yet, in general, that the things be so, we cannot deny.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 9.19 to such captious Questions, <hi>Why doth he yet complain? for who hath resisted his will?</hi> makes this grave Reply, v. 20. <hi>Nay but, O Man, who art thou that disputest against God?</hi> 'Tis hard for us to set bounds to the Almighty; to say, what he doth; or what he may doe. Modesty becomes us herein. <hi>Vain man</hi> (saith <hi>Zophar</hi> in <hi>Job,</hi> Job 11.12.) <hi>would needs be wise: though man be born like a wild Asses Colt.</hi> Nor is it for us to give Law to the Almighty, or <hi>say unto him, What doest thou?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here, if ever, that counsel of <hi>Solomon</hi> is season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be hasty, to utter any thing before God; for God is in heaven and thou upon earth; therefore let thy words be few.</hi>

            <p>And our <hi>Saviour</hi> here to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> from our Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in Earthly things, pleads for a modest Submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in things of a higher nature: <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8. <hi>The Wind blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth where it listeth; thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: So is every one that is born of the Spirit.</hi> Ver. 12. And, <hi>if in Earthly things,</hi> we are at a loss, how much more <hi>in Heavenly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Solomon,</hi> to the same purpose (in the place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cited,) <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11.5. <hi>As thou knowest not what is the way of the Spirit, nor how the bones grow in the womb of her that is with child: Even so thou knowest not the works of God, who maketh all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis commonly, either from a vain Curiosity, or proud Arrogance, that makes men over Confident in such things.</p>
            <p>I find, the Church of God, in the first Ages of the World, did for a long time (for ought we see) rest satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:101939:20"/>
with that first general promise, That <hi>the Seed of the Woman should break the Serpents head,</hi> Gen. 3.25. That God would, by some born of a Woman, find a way (they knew not how) to deliver us from that wretched condition, which by the Serpents malice and subtilty was brought upon us: Without being over inquisitive, When, or How, or By whom it should be brought about: Till God saw fit, in his own time, upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> to declare it more plainly and fully.</p>
            <p>And in like manner, when God promises, to <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise our heart,</hi> Deut. 6.30. to <hi>give us a new heart, and put a new spirit within us,</hi> Ezek. 36.26. to <hi>take away the heart of stone and give us a heart of flesh,</hi> Ezek. 11.19. to <hi>put his Law in our inward parts, and write it in our hearts,</hi> Jer. 31.33. to <hi>put his fear in our hearts, that we shall not depart from him,</hi> Jer. 32.40. We may well rest satisfied, that he who hath said it, can doe it; without cavilling, or nice inquiring, <hi>How can these things be?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the like, when God threatens to <hi>harden Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>'s <hi>heart,</hi> Exod. 4.21. and 7.3. or, to <hi>make the heart of the people fat; that hearing they may hear, but not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,</hi> Isai. 6.9, 10. <hi>and seeing they may see, but not perceive,</hi> Mat. 13.14, 15. To wit, by leaving them to their natural hardness and blindness; without correcting it by his Spirit. Now that which hereby we prove, is this, Not, that God forces us to will against our wills; (for that <hi>in sensu composito</hi> as to the Elicite Act, is impossible, as implying a contradiction in the terms; for, as to what we will, we are so far willing:) But, that, by the Spirit we are born again; that is, that God, by his Spirit, works in us a new Nativity, a new Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; that is, a new Habit of Grace; whereby we are inclined to Love and Delight in Good, as, by the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual Corruption of our Nature, we are inclined to Evil.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:101939:20"/>And this is the concurrent doctrine of the Schools; Who (I think) do generally allow, that our Souls are capable of Infused Habits, as well as acquired.</p>
            <p>And if, by derivation from our first parents, we be capable of habitual Corruption; I see not why we should doubt, but that we are alike capable of habitual Grace.</p>
            <p>And of this, for ought I know, as early as of that. For like as there may be habitual Corruption, before we be in a capacity (for want of the use of Reason, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Actual Sin: So may God, as early, put into our hearts the Seeds of Grace; which may afterwards, when occasion shall serve, bring forth the Fruits of good living. He <hi>may,</hi> I say, when he please; not, that he alwaies so doth.</p>
            <p>We reade of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> that <hi>he was called from the womb,</hi> Isai. 49.1. and of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Jer. 1.5. <hi>Before thou camest out of the womb, I Sanctified thee:</hi> and of <hi>John</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist, that he should be <hi>filled with the holy Ghost, even from his mothers womb,</hi> Luk. 1.15.</p>

               <hi>by the inspiration of his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; that we may perfectly love him, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily magnify his holy Name.</hi> With much more, in the Prayers of our Church, to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
            <p>All which implies, that there is a power in God, to work in our Souls, by his Spirit, such a gracious frame and temper of Heart, (inclining it to Good, as before it was to Evil,) as, without it, would not have been.</p>
            <p>And truly if we do allow, that the Wisdome of man, by moral Arguments and rational Discourse, may (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing violence to his Will) perswade another to Think otherwise, than before he did; and to Doe, what otherwise he would not have done; (which yet, when he doth, he doth Freely:) Nay more, if a Glass of Wine, (though taken moderately, and without excess,) may give a man that Life, Vigour and Alacrity, as to make him almost another man; to Speak, Think, and Doe, what else he would not, or at least not in such a Manner and to such a Degree: Surely we may allow the Wisdome of God, and the Efficacy of his Spirit, (without intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:101939:22"/>
upon our Freedome,) to doe as much, or more than so: And, either without, or in concurrence with, such moral Swasions, to put that Warmth into our hearts, as to act beyond what, without it, we should have done.</p>
            <p>Nor is there any reason to fear, that such Inclination to Good, from the Spirit of God, should prejudice the Freedome of our Will; any more, if so much, as the Inclination to Evil from our own Corruption, or the Temptations of Sathan.</p>
            <p>Especially, since that the Blessed Angels, and the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Saints in Heaven (where Sorrow and Sin shall be no more) shall, as Freely, Love God, and Praise him, as we on Earth can do: Notwithstanding that they shall be then, not only Inclined to, but Confirmed in Good, and not in a capacity to Sin: Not, for want of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; but, as having no Inclination to Evil.</p>
            <p>All which is not said, to incourage any man in Sloth or Idleness (in doing what is his Duty,) upon pretence of waiting on the Spirit of God to doe all for him: But rather, to a diligent use of all the Means of Grace, in hope of his concurrence; and to Implore withall the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Goodness, to <hi>Assist us mercifully</hi>; To <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent us in all our doings,</hi>
               <note rend="inter">Communion Collects.</note> 
               <hi>with his most gracious Favour, and further us with his continual help; that in all our Works Begun, Continued and Ended in him,</hi> we may have his blessing on them. According to <hi>Solomon</hi>'s advice in a like case, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11.6. <hi>In the Morning sow thy Seed, and in Evening withold not thy hand: For thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this, or that; or whether they shall both be alike Good.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes the like Inference from the same Premises, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12, 13. <hi>Work out your own salvation with Fear and Trembling; For it is God that worketh in you both to Will and to Doe, of his good pleasure.</hi> And, if we be not fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on our part; we have great incouragement to believe,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:101939:22"/>
that God (though a Free Agent) will not be wanting to <hi>give his holy Spirit to those that ask him,</hi> Luk. 11.13.</p>
            <p>Now (for Application) this Doctrine (concerning <hi>the Necessity of Regeneration,</hi> in those who shall see the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God) doth vindicate our Church (whose Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine it is) from the Reproach and Calumny cast upon her Doctrine: As if, when she says, <hi>that we are Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Faith only,</hi> she taught a Loose and Easy way of coming to Heaven, without Regeneration, Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or, Good Works, the Effect of both.</p>
            <p>'Tis very true, she saith in her 11<hi>th.</hi> Article, <hi>We are accounted Righteous before God, only for the Merit of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ by Faith; and not for our own Good Works or Deservings. Wherefore, That we are Justified by Faith only, is a most Wholesome Doctrine and very Comfortable.</hi> (And more, to the same purpose in the Homily to which that Article refers.)</p>
            <p>But, though she say <hi>We are Justified by Faith only</hi>; she doth not say, there is nothing more, requisite to <hi>Salvation.</hi> For we must be <hi>Sanctified,</hi> as well as <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> if ever we be Saved.</p>
            <p>And therefore, that we may not possibly mistake her Doctrine (unless wilfully) she adds in the Next words (which are her Twelfth Article) <hi>Albeit that Good Works, which are the fruits of Faith, and follow after Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, cannot put away our Sins, and indure the severity of God's Judgment: Yet are they pleasing and acceptable to God in Christ; and do spring out necessarily of a true and lively Faith: In so much as, by them, a lively Faith may be evidently known, as a Tree discerned by the Fruit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But (which is her Tirteenth Article) <hi>Works done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Grace of Christ, and the Inspiration of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, are not pleasant to God: Forasmuch as they spring not from Faith in Jesus Christ. Neither do they make man
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:101939:23"/>
Meet to receive Grace, or (as the School Authors say) Deserve Grace of Congruity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Church therefore, in teaching <hi>Justification by Faith only</hi>; doth not teach us, That we need no more to carry us to Heaven, but only a Sanguine Belief that we shall come there; and may thenceforth live as we list, without Holiness, or a <hi>Godly, Righteous and sober Life.</hi> For she makes this Necessary to bring us to Heaven, as well as Faith, or Justification it self. And a pretence of Faith without this, she doth not own for Faith, but Presumption. She owns none for <hi>a true and lively Faith,</hi> but what is attended herewith, as the <hi>Necessary Fruit</hi> thereof, only she doth distinguish, what of this belongs to Justification, and what to Sanctification: Which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers labour studiously to Confound.</p>
            <p>If any please to Cavil, That, if we be Justified by Faith only, then there need no more to Save us; because God Saves all that he Justifies:</p>
            <p>I say, This Cavil, might seem to have some weight in it; if God did Justify any, whom he doth not Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify also.</p>
            <p>A Prince, I confess, may sometimes Pardon a Male-factour, (and so Justify him, or put him in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o a Condition of <hi>Not-guilty,)</hi> without making him an Honest Man: But God never Justifies any, whom he doth not also Sanctify. And therefore 'tis, here, the same thing to infer, That a man may be <hi>Sanctified without Holiness</hi>; as, That he may be Saved without it; if Justified by Faith only.</p>
            <p>But if any indeed there be (I confess I know none, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the <hi>Papist,)</hi> that hold, a man may be Justified and Saved; without being Sanctified: I have nothing to say in the defence of such. Nor is this the Doctrine of our Church, when she says, <hi>We are Justified by Faith only.</hi> And, for any to load her Doctrine, with such Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:101939:23"/>
is great Ignorance; or, somewhat Worse. But I proceed.</p>
            <p>The two great Enemies to the Doctrine before us (the necessity of Regeneration and Sanctification, in order to Salvation, and, consequently, of Good Works, the effect thereof;) are, the Atheist, and the Papist: With whom we may join those who Symbolise with either, so far as they so do.</p>
            <p>With the Atheist (who thinks there is no God,) I join the Profane Debauched Person, who so lives as if there were none: Such as <hi>Profess that they know God; but, in Works, Deny him: being Abominable, and Disobedient, and, to every good Work, Reprobate,</hi> Tit. 1, 16.</p>
            <p>These men have as little veneration for Heaven and Holiness; as the Papists have for <hi>the Word of God:</hi> Which they can make use of, as a <hi>Nose of Wax</hi> (as they Phrase it) to serve a present turn; so far as it makes for them: but, as to much of it,<note rend="inter">
                  <hi>Albertus Pighius.</hi>
               </note> they had rather it were not at all: And, therefore, care not how little it be known: And, when it is, they would have it Truckle under their Churches Interpretation, as if Insignificant without it.</p>
            <p>And, in like manner, the Profane Atheist, as to a Holy Life, and a Future State. He could wish perhaps, with <hi>Balaam, to Dye the Death of the Righteous; and that his latter end might be like his,</hi> Num. 32.10. But, finding so little Hopes of that, doth rather Wish, there were no such thing: And Thinks it his great Unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, That he is not a Beast: That, since he Lives like a Beast, he cannot Dye like a Beast too; without Hopes or Fears of Heaven or Hell. For, since he so Lives as to have Little hopes of Heaven; he heartily Wisheth there were no fear of Hell.</p>
            <p>With such as these, if any man presseth for Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Sanctification, and a holy Life: He was to pass,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:101939:24"/>
heretofore, for a Puritan; then, a Roundhead; and, now, for a Damn'd Fanatick.</p>
            <p>Nor shall he scape this Censure, though never so great a Church-man, and do exactly Conform to the Church as now Established. For 'tis Holiness they hate, more than Non-conformity.</p>
            <p>To these men, I shall say little more at present, than to Repeat these words of Christ, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3, 5. <hi>Except a man be born again, of Water and of the Spirit; He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter into the Kingdome of God:</hi> And that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Without Holiness no man shall see the Lord.</hi> (A Wicked Life, will never bring us to Heaven.) And then, what is like to be their condition, themselves may judge.</p>
            <p>The other Enemy to this Doctrine, is the Papist. For though they talk much of <hi>Good Works,</hi> yea <hi>Works of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererogation,</hi> (Works better than they need to be:) Yet are they no friends to the doctrine of Sanctification, and a holy Life.</p>
            <p>Their first Artifice, is, to confound Justification, and Sanctification. For so they doe when they tell us, we are Justified by <hi>Inherent Righteousness.</hi> Now, what is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Righteousness, but Holiness and a Good Life.</p>
            <p>Next; this Holiness, or Inherent Righteousness, doth silently pass into the term of <hi>Good Works.</hi> And, here, the <hi>Opus operatum</hi> (as they call it) shall serve the turn, without much troubling themselves about the Habite of Grace or Holiness, from whence these Good Works should proceed; and, without which (our Church tells us) <hi>Good Works</hi> (Works materially good) cannot be acceptable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God.</p>
            <p>And 'tis craftily done, to annex Justification to Good Works: Else there would be no need, for those who have no Good Works of their own, to purchase out of the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:101939:24"/>
Churches treasury, the Good Works of other men: and so the Market of Indulgences would fail.</p>
            <p>Next, these Good Works are Signally (though not only) to be understood of Alms-deeds: And these, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to the Church; that is, to their Priests or other Ecclesiasticks (as they be contradistinguished from the Laicks) or to some of their Religious Orders. For Alms-deeds will hardly pass for meritorious; unless to some of these.</p>
            <p>Then; these Good Works, are to be commuted, for Penance, and the Priests Absolution. For though they have nothing of Good Works at all; nay, though they be guilty of very great Immoralities: Yet if they Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess to a Priest, and receive Absolution (which may be had at an easy rate,) they are then declared as Innocent as the Child that is New-born.</p>
            <p>Especially, if they perform the Penance imposed; that is (for the most part) if they say so many <hi>Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosters,</hi> and so many <hi>Ave-Maries,</hi> or (if it be for a great Offence) say over the seven Penetential Psalms, (for that is a great Penance) or at least get some body to say it for them.</p>
            <p>Nor is it necessary, to this Absolution, that they should be Contrite, or heartily sorry; For Attrition, with Auricular Confession, shall pass in stead of Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: That is, in effect, if they be but sorry for the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, though they be not sorry for the Sin.</p>
            <p>Or, if all this should fail; it is but being at the charge of an Indulgence, or Popes Pardon: That is, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase so many penyworth of other mens Merits (having none of their own) out of that Surplusage which those others have had to spare (more than to serve their own turn) which remain Stored up in the Churches Treasury, to be dispensed at the Popes pleasure, to those who will give so much Money for them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:101939:25"/>Or lastly, if they leave a Legacy at their Death, or their Friends will be at that Charge when they are gone, to purchase so many Masses to be said for them, as shall be thought necessary to deliver their Souls out of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory. And, in case they purchase more than are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for that occasion; the Surplusage shall remain in the Churches Treasury, for the Benefit of others; to be dispensed, as was aforesaid.</p>
            <p>And this is what they require, by way of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, in stead of Regeneration, Sanctification, Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and a Godly Life.</p>
            <p>But I shall leave them. And Exhort those of our Own Communion, (who desire truly to please God,) to seek after real Holiness in their Hearts, and the Practice of it in their Lives.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> I say, Real Holiness in the Heart.</p>
            <p>Mat. 7.16. <hi>Men do not gather Grapes of Thorns, or Figs of Thistles.</hi> Ver. 18. <hi>A good Tree cannot bring forth Evil fruit; nor a corrupt Tree, Good fruit.</hi> Mat. 12.33. <hi>Therefore make the Tree good, that the Fruit may be good also.</hi> Ver. 34. <hi>O generation of Vipers</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>how can ye, being Evil, speak Good things? For out of the abundance of the Heart, the Mouth speaketh.</hi> 'Tis not enough to lop off some of the Branches in practice, so long as there remains a <hi>Root of Bitterness</hi> in the Heart, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Son, give me thy Heart,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Pro. 23.26. And 'tis <hi>out of the good treasure of the Heart, that the Good man bringeth forth Good things,</hi> Mat. 12.35. 'Twas <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s great Comfort, that he had <hi>walked before God in Truth and with a perfect Heart,</hi> 2 King. 20.3. And, contrariwise, a Blemish on <hi>Amaziah</hi>'s Good Actions; that <hi>he did what was Right in the sight of the Lord, but not with a perfect Heart,</hi> 2 Chron. 25.2. Without
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:101939:25"/>
which, <hi>Bodily exercise profiteth little,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.8.</p>
            <p>'Twas for want of this, that God complains of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Services of his own people: Isai. 1.11. <hi>To what purpose is the multitude of your Sacrifices? I am full of your Burnt-offerings of Rams; and the Fat of fed Beasts. I delight not in the bloud of Bullocks, or of Lambs, or of Hee goats.</hi> Ver. 13. <hi>Bring no more vain Oblations: Incense is an Abomination to me.</hi> Ver. 14. <hi>Your New Moons, and your appointed Feasts, my Soul hateth: They are a Trouble to me: I am Weary to bear them.</hi> Because, though these were Good Things, they were Ill done. And God will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Outward Services, in lieu of Holiness.</p>
            <p>I know, 'tis a Fancy that some have taken up; That, of those before <hi>Christ,</hi> God required only Outward Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; And therefore promised only Temporal Rewards: Whereas, say they, if he had required Spiritual Services, the Rewards promised would have been sutable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p>But sure, as to the Services, <hi>David</hi> was of another mind. Psal. 51.16. <hi>Thou delightest not in Sacrifice, else would I give it: Thou delightest not in Burnt-Offerings,</hi> (that is, comparatively:) Ver. 17. <hi>But the Sacrifices of God, are a Broken Spirit: A Broken and a Contrite Heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.</hi> Ver. 19. <hi>Then shalt thou be pleased with Sacrifices of Righteousness; with Burnt-Offering, and whole Burnt-Offering:</hi> But not till then.</p>
            <p>And, as to the Rewards promised; our Church is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive, (in her Seventh Article:) <hi>The Old Testament is not contrary to the New: For, both in the Old and New Testament, Everlasting Life is offered to Mankind by Christ: who is the onely Mediator between God and Man; being both God, and Man. Wherefore they are not to be heard, who feign, that the Old Fathers looked only for Transitory Promises.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:101939:26"/>And truely they might as well say; That, when God Threatens, <hi>In the day that thou Eatest thereof, thou shalt Dye the Death,</hi> Gen. 2.17. 'twas meant only of a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Death; (and how comes he then to Punish with Hell?) As, That, when he Promiseth, <hi>The man that doth them,</hi>
               <note rend="inter">
                  <hi>Lev.</hi> 18.5. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.12.</note> 
               <hi>shall Live in them</hi>; 'tis meant only of Temporal Life. If the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses be but of things Temporal; how come the Threatnings to be, of things Eternal?</p>
            <p>But they are indeed, Both of them, of things Eternal, as well as Temporal: And the Services required, are Spiritual as well as Bodily: And that of the Spirit prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally and in the first place.</p>
            <p>Yet it is not of the Heart only; but <hi>Secondly,</hi> of the Life also, that God requires. 'Tis in vain to talk of a Good Heart towards God; with a Wicked Life, in the face of the World. Mat. 7.17. <hi>If the Tree be Good; the Fruit will be so too.</hi> A Wicked Life, is a certain sign of a Naughty Heart.</p>
            <p>And this Obedience, must be Uniform, and Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal. Psal. 119.6. <hi>Then shall I not be ashamed,</hi> saith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, when I have respect to all thy Commandments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are not to Pick and Choose, what to Obey, and what not. As if a double Diligence in some One parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, (wherein our own Interest prompts us,) would Expiate for a supine Negligence in all the rest.</p>
