            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Certaine Motives, Provocations and Reaſons to encite to the preſent Speedy taking and applying the Medicine to cure <hi>Englands</hi> Inſenſible conſumption by Farthing Tokens.</head>
            <p>The Medicine it ſelfe followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>N exhortation to all them that doe approve of my way, to eaſe the grievance by Farthing Tokens; to be both certaine, eaſie, and cheape, and in every Trades owne power amongſt your ſelves to effect it, without troubling the Parliament, diſobeying his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Proclamation, harming your neighbours, or hindring the poore; but much conducing to the good of you all. in ſhewing your ſelves obedient to his Majeſties Proclamations: I doe now entreat your help in the proſecution hereof. And for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her enciting you hereunto, I entreat you to conſider the unthought on loſſe that is upon the Subjects by Tokens, againſt his Majeſties intent in his Proclamation, wherein he onely deſires your eaſe and benefit by Tokens. Secondly, How every one that takes or payes them under 21 for 20, is guilty of doing much more wrong to his Majeſty, the Kingdome, to poſterity, and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours then either the Patentees or Token-houſe doe: For indeed, they having a Leaſe for which they pay yearely Rent, doe but as others doe, making the moſt of their Commodities; and when men ſpeake to them of the wrong by Tokens, they ſay men may let them alone, for they deſire none to fetch them out but for their neceſſary exchange: but the fault indeed is in almoſt all Subjects in generall, but moſt eſpecially in all Trades-men; for indeed I know not how they can cleare themſelves from being either willingly or ignorantly Theeves to the Kingdome, or at leſt Receivers; and we uſe to ſay, <hi>The Receiver is as bad as the Thief:</hi> but herein they are worſe (although honeſter men in themſelves) then the Theeves, for the Theeves gaine by the evill of their practice, and make themſelves more able to lend to the King and Parliament, and give to the poore, but the receivers and diſperſers to others make themſelves and others more unable for all theſe. Againe, whereas other Theeves rob particular perſons, theſe rob the King and all good Subjects; for the wealth of a King is in the wealth and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of his Subjects. And for a further motive, conſider how much this practice tends to the ruine of the Kingdome, til (if not some way prevented) your Silver will be turned into Copper, or into nothing; but the moſt of it will be conſumed into nothing: for if you did but conſider it, you ſhould finde that ſo many Tokens as you take in one weeke, ſo many you loſe outright every one and twenty weeks, or elſe you wrong your neighbours, by cauſing them againſt their wills, and his Majeſties Proclamation, to take them, and ſo you doe not as you would be done unto, which ſhould be our Rule. Conſider againe, how that they which let them lye by them, and doe not weekly exchange them, doe cauſe the greater loſſe at laſt; for the poore Patentees are loth (againſt their gaine) to let any goe away without Tokens for their money, and therefore your not ſupplying them with your ſtore weekly cauſeth them ſtill to make more, which will encreaſe your loſſe in generall when they fall, which of neceſsity they muſt one day doe. Conſider, by relation there are now abroad about two hundred thouſand pounds in Tokens, doe any thinke they can change them all? yet your keeping ſo many by you cauſe them to have cuſtome yet for more; and by relation they doe make after the rate of 26000 pounds a yeare: if but 20, conſider firſt the two hundred thouſand pounds worth made, will by a weekly exchange be twice ſo much loſſe, and upwards, every yeare, and yet the ſame Tokens remaine for the like loſſe the next yeare, which is above foure hundred thouſand pounds loſſe in the yeare, beſide the twenty thouſand a yeare made, which adde forty thouſand a yeare to the loſſe, beſide the loſſe of all at laſt, when they fall, for then they will be but Copper ſhruf. Againe conſider, the longer you drive off the preventing of this loſſe, the greater the loſſe will bee, ſeeing every yeare doth adde to the encreaſe of your loſſe forty thouſand pounds, ſo that if this yeare the loſſe be foure hundred thouſand pounds, the next will bee foure hundred and forty thouſands; the next, four hundred and eighty thouſands; the next, five hundred and 20 thouſands, till all your Silver be conſumed and become Copper ſhruf. Againe, conſider that the poore Trades-men that loſe but twelve pence a weeke, it is more to them then twenty ſhillings a weeke to rich men; and fifty ſhillings a yeare would pay a poore mans houſe rent, and they eſpecially are they that are conſtrained to take Tokens. I heard one ſay, ſeeming to have good ſtore of money in her bag that it was all Tokens: Another, that his Wife took but ten ſhillings, and 7 of it was Tokens: All which this courſe will ſoon prevent or put an end to, if you ſet upon it, and will make that there will never any deſire a Token Patent more, and the Tokens now made will be neceſſary change for you and poſterity after you; and ſo howſoever. theſe will be no loſſe to any, and any Neighbour or Trades-man may let any countrey body have Tokens as cheap as the Token-houſe, although they buy but five penny worth at once, and be no loſers, and who then will goe to the Token-houſe for any; and the poore, that ſell them to Gentlemen, may have them of Brewers, and other great Tradeſmen, as cheape as at the Token-houſe, and yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loſſe to the Trades-men or themſelves. By this courſe how ſoone will our grievance be our benefit, for the Countrey throughout will have them for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary exchange, when they koow the future loſſe, as alſo the encreaſe of them is prevented. And whereas now the Token-houſe will change them but one part of the day, they will then have more leiſure then lift to take them in both forenoone and afternoone. And further conſider, if you doe not eaſe this grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, having this light into the way of it, and power in your hands to doe it, ſeeing it is good to all, if afterward the poore bee undone with the downfall of them, which will of neceſsity be either ſooner or later, how ſhall you have beſides your owne loſſe the juſt curſe of the poore, that will be quite undone there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, becauſe you would not prevent their ruine at ſo cheap a rate; eſpecially ſeeing they that take Tokens as they are now taken, do wrong themſelves, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey the King; and they that pay them ſo, doe wrong their Neighbours, and cauſe them to wrong others by their example. Conſider how that ignorantly we have been worſe theeves then the Token-houſe, for they by putting out more then they take in get out of the Kingdome but eighteen or nineteene ſhillings in the pound, for which they doe the Kingdome ſervice, and never get more out of the ſame Tokens though they exchange them never ſo often; but we in an ordinary courſe as we have taken them, if we returne them weekly (as we ought to doe) doe inſenſibly rob the Kingdome by every twenty ſhillings about eight or nine and forty ſhillings a yeare, and as much by the ſame the next yeare, and every yeare as long as they laſt as much: for ſo many as a man takes in one week ſo many he loſes outright in 21 weeks, and as many more in 21 weeks more.</p>
            <p>But ſome rich men and others may ſay, they never loſt by Tokens, therefore they will not meddle in this worke to have ought to doe with it.</p>
            <p>Conſider (I beſeech you) if it be not all one as if London ſhould ſay the Cavaleers never plundered us, therfore we will not prevent their entring the City:or ſeeing ſome Neighbours houſes burned downe, and others on fire, ſhould ſay, becauſe it hath not burned their houſes they will not endevour the quenching thereof. But whereas rich men, that trade not in ſmall things, thinke they loſe nothing. I thinke they eſpecially are like to loſe the moſt, although they feele it leaſt; for when thouſands of poore Trades-men are undone quite, no one of them can loſe much, becauſe they have very little of their owne to loſe, but the ſpeciall loſſe will be their Landlords and Creditors, whoſe houſes and goods are in their poſſeſsion; who alſo after this muſt help to relieve thoſe poore and their families.</p>
            <p>But ſome may ſay, the Token-houſe will deliver 22 for 20 if we take this courſe, for they ſtand them in little.</p>
            <p>I anſwere, ſo they would ſoone undoe themſelves, for then they would ſoone have ſtore of Cuſtomers that would take out 22 for 20, and preſently take out twelve pence and ſend them againe, and enforce them (as they are bound by their Patent) to give them twenty ſhillings in ſilver for 21 of the 22 ſhillings they had of them. But farther, to the end the benefit of Tokens might redound to the good of the whole Kingdome, it were deſirable that the Souldiers had a good part of their pay of them, twenty one for twenty, I conceive they would be profitable for them, and alſo for thoſe-parts of the Kingdome that having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been abuſed with Tokens, doe now refuſe to take them for exchange, who if they heare of this courſe taken, to eaſe the grievance, and prevent the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of them, they will be glad of them for exchange; and ſo they ſhall have exchange, and the City ſhall be eaſed of her burden.</p>
            <p>And whereas ſome ſay, they like the practice well, and it is a certaine good way, but they are loth to have a hand in it becauſe the Parliament takes the rent of the Token-houſe for the Kingdomes occaſion.</p>
            <p>I anſwere, ſhall we have ſuch meane low thoughts of that honourable Aſſembly, to conceive that they ſhould not make their bargaine ſure for their rent: but if not, that they ſhould in the leaſt deſire that the Token-houſe rent of three or foure thouſand pounds a yeere ſhould be paid with the Kingdomes loſſe of as many hundred thouſands a yeare and upwards and meane Trades-men to be deepeſt ſharers therein.</p>
            <p>Other things I could mind you of concerning the Tokens, which are not convenient at preſent; but with the help of God I hope I ſhall thankfully and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorily anſwere any mans objection againſt any thing in this paper or heretofore written by me concerning Tokens. Thus intreating your acceptation and furtherance I reſt.</p>
