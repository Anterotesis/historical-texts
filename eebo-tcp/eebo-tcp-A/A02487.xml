            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hese dayes of <hi>Purim</hi> or of Lots me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned in the ninth chapter of the booke of <hi>Ester</hi> were the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth and the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth dayes of the moneth <hi>Adar</hi> answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in parte to our <hi>February</hi> inioyned to be kept Festiuall of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3796:3"/>
               <hi>Iewes,</hi> first by <hi>Mordecayes</hi> letter, and then by Queene <hi>Esters</hi> decree in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of there wonderfull deliuerance from <hi>Hamans</hi> bloudy designe for their vtter extirpatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at that time.</p>
            <p>These daies (the like being scarcely to be found againe in holy Scripture) I purpose to compare with our day of the <hi>Powder plott,</hi> together with the Authority, the Causes and Reasons of the institution of both, that from thence it may appeare that the mercy of God was more cleerely manifested in our Deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance then in theirs, and that consequently we haue greater cause religiously &amp; with thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full acknowledgement to obserue our day then they theires. In the opening whereof I will compare <hi>plott</hi> with plott, <hi>persons</hi> with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, <hi>motiue</hi> with motiue, <hi>assurance</hi> With assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, <hi>preuention</hi> with preuention, <hi>issue</hi> with issue, <hi>moneth</hi> with moneth, <hi>day</hi> with day.</p>
            <p>First then for <hi>Hamans plot</hi> vpon the <hi>Iewes,</hi> it<note place="margin">Plot.</note> was vndoubtedly a very cruel one, thinking it too little, too small a satisfaction to hishonor &amp; reuenge, to lay hands vpon <hi>Mordecai,</hi> he purposed in one day to haue put them all to the sword (as the <hi>Sicilians</hi> did the <hi>French</hi> in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3796:3"/>
one night) young and old, women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, without distinction of age or sexe, throughout all the large dominions of <hi>Ahaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huerosh,</hi> reaching from <hi>India</hi> to <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and comprising an hundred &amp; 7 &amp; twenty Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; yet putting to the sword is not so cruell as blowing vp with powder, in as much as in the former some hope is left by teares or prayers, or guifts to staie the executioners hand; but in the latter none at all. For as men are presumed to haue more mercie then beasts, and beasts then insensible Creatures, Which are altogether inexorable: so among them all, the two elements of fire and water haue the least mercy, and of the two, fire (specially if it be enraged with store of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) least of all.</p>
            <p>Againe <hi>Hamans</hi> project vpon the <hi>Iewes</hi> was not so suddainly to be acted but that they had leasure giuen them to appease the fury of their Aduersary, or to procure the Kings fauour, as afterwards they did; they had oportunity to stand for their liues, or to saue themselues by flight, or if it came to the worst, they had respite to cast
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3796:4"/>
vp their accounts and make all things leuell betweene God and their owne Consciences: But this proiect of our conspiratours should haue beene acted in a moment, in the tourne of an hand, in the twinckling of an eye, the parties aimed at should neither haue had time to flie nor to fight, to intreat nor to threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, to let fall a teare or castvp a sigh for their sinnes, or so much as to say or to thinke <hi>in manus tuas Domine.</hi> The cruelty of <hi>Haman</hi> then extended onely to mens bodies, but this of our Conspiratours to their soules, they held the maine body of that assembly to be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, and that for an heretique so depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this life there is no possibility of salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and consequently they could not but make account to send all so affected quicke to hell. And for the bodyes of the <hi>Iewes</hi> though after the shedding of their bloud &amp; the loosing of their liues they could not haue promised to themselues any decent kind of buriall, yet was their case better then to bee torne in a thousand peeces, and to haue the shiuers of their bones, the sprinkling of their bloud, and gobbets of their flesh (if
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3796:4"/>
any such remained) to be cast into far distant places, and exposed as a prey to dogs and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens. Besides, the cruelty of <hi>Haman</hi> extended not to insensible creatures, as this did, to the vtter demolishing of that famous Senate house, in which the Ancestors of the Conspiratours themselues had often met to consult about the making of whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some lawes for the suppressing of vice and the advancing of the honour of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> name. We count it but madnesse in a dog to snarle at a stone, and can we count it lesse in men to fight with stones and timber? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if wee should haue held our peace, these verie beames &amp; stones would haue cried for vengeance, and the rather being to haue bin stained with the bloud of so many right no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and worthy personages, which is the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond point of Comparison.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iewes</hi> though at that time the Church<note place="margin">Persons</note> of God was in a manner impaled within their nation, yet liued they but as strangers; nay as vassals &amp; Captiues among the <hi>Persians,</hi> as at this day for the greatest part they doe, aswell among the <hi>Turkes</hi> as the <hi>Christians.</hi> It
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3796:5"/>
was true, though by <hi>Haman</hi> malitiously vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that their lawes were diuers from all people, neither did they obserue the Kings lawes. <hi>Haman</hi> himselfe the chiefe plotter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them was not onely an <hi>Infidel,</hi> but an <hi>Amalakite</hi> a mortall enemy to their religion, and moreouer being of great place and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, he had gotten both the King and the whole state to countenance his designe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. But in this of our Conspiratours the case vvas contrary; There, <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, Persians</hi> &amp; <hi>Amalakites</hi> conspired against the <hi>Israelites:</hi> heere natiue <hi>English</hi> &amp; professed Christians, (though in truth most vnvvorthy the name of either) conspired against their ovvne Countreymen baptized, and reioyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the glorious name of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> nay I make no doubt but that some of their ovvne neere kinsmen, and of their ovvne ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish profession at leastvvise in heart and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection should for company haue perished by that blovve: There, superiours &amp; those of Eminent note and ranke conspired against their inferiours and those of the lovvest and meanest degree in that state: Here inferiours
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3796:5"/>
against their superiours, subiects against their liege Lord and lawfull Soueraigne, seruants against their masters, for so was one of them at least, and that in honourable place, and as if it had beene too little to lay hands vpon the King alone, they all conspired against that venerable Court, the highest in the Land, consisting of their lawfull and compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Iudges, the murthering of the least of which in that place being legally called thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his Maiesties writ, iudicially there to sitt, had beene treason, which is the highest offence the law takes notice of: What then could wee haue called that act, by which they should haue beene all murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and mangled at one clap? Surely as wee want an example to paralell it, so doe wee a name to expresse it. Touch not mine annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted saith God: but these intended to haue blowne vp at one blast the King &amp; Queene, both annointed with sacred oile, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their eldest sonne the Prince then liuing, and with them the great Officers of the kingdome, the prudent Counsellours of Estate, the Honorable Peeres of the Realme,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3796:6"/>
the Reuerend Bishops, the Graue Iudges and Sages of the law, the choyce Knights and Burgesses being indeede the very flower of the land, all the Clarkes of the Crowne, Counsell, Signet, and Seales, the greatest part of the learned Lawyers, together With a number of the Kings and Queenes &amp; Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces neerest and deerest seruants. I will doe a thing in <hi>Israel</hi> saith God, that whosoeuer shall heare, it shall make both his eares to tingle: but surely the very relation of this, had it taken effect, had beene enough not only to make a mans haire stand an end, &amp; his eares to tingle, but his very heart to quake and tremble: and I am perswaded as no Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an euer wrote, or Poet faind, or Painter coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited, or Tragedian acted the like: so if all the damned Spirits of hell, and the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Crew on the earth should ioyne in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and sett the vtmost of their wits aworke, they could neuer find out the like cursed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice againe. It was the vtmost point of all villanie, beyond which is <hi>Terra incognita,</hi> no man can diuise what should bee betweene hell and it, and looke by how much the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:3796:6"/>
more diuelish was the inuention, by so much more diuine, was the Preseruation. It were then worth the inquiring what should moue these men to so brutish and barbarous a plott which is my third point of Comparison. The Motiues.</p>
            <p>That which <hi>Haman</hi> pretended against the<note place="margin">Motiues.</note> 
               <hi>Iewes</hi> was that they were not subiect to the Kings Lawes, neither was it for the Kings honour or profit to suffer them in his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: but intruth that which stuck in his stomake was <hi>Mordecaies</hi> stiffenes, he would not creepe and crooch vnto him as others did, and as the King had commanded, they should, he would not prostrate himselfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Idoll of Court, and giue him diuine adoration, the thing as it seemes which <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> in the pride of his heart expected, and <hi>Mordecai</hi> denied, for I cannot beleeue that he denied ciuill reuerence; and was not this the motiue of our Conspiratours that wee would not bow to their Idolls, their triple crowned Idoll of Rome and their breadden Idoll in the consecrated host, pretending that it was not for the profitt nor the honour of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3796:7"/>
Church any longer to suffer vs: but was this the meanes by which Christ founded and his Apostles reared vp, &amp; their successours inlarged &amp; repaired his Church? no, no, they founded and built, and inlarged and repaired it with the powring out of their owne bloud not with the shedding of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Tantaene animis caelestibus irae?</q>
            </p>
            <p>What is it possible that Catholiques the best Christians nay the onely Christians should conceaue such a sauage enterprise? <hi>Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum?</hi> Is it cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible that matter of religion should induce men to so damnable an attempt? It was the speech of <hi>Lucretius</hi> the <hi>Epicure</hi> touching <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon</hi> induring and assisting at his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters sacrifice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but what if he had knowne the Massacre of <hi>France,</hi> or the powder plott of <hi>England?</hi> Surely it would haue made him tentymes more Epicure &amp; <hi>Atheist</hi> then hee was: There is not such a sinne against the person of the Holy Ghost, to take it litterally, as insteed of the likenesse of a doue, to bring him downe in the shape of a rauen or a vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur

Here were all things now so fast, so sure, as a man would haue thought there had beene no meanes possible left to vndoe them, there seemed to want nothing but the very execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the plott. The like assurance, if not greater, was there in our Powder plotters, they relied too vpon their wit, and vpon the wealth and strength of their faction both at home and abroad. Some of them offering horses and armour, others to contribute mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, to the summe of two thousand or three thousand pound a peece.

Lastly, they had Wrought the Mine, and when that would not serue the turne they had hired a sellar, the powder was laid in to the quantity of thirty sixe bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rells, great barrs of iron and massy stones, and billets being layd on the topp of the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rells, thereby to make the noise more hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and the breachthe more dangerous, the day of execution was now come, the howre approched, the match was ready, so that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting but the presence of that Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable assembly, and the setting of fire to the powder.

And herein was the constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction thereof made by his Maiesty not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle strange, as himselfe to the honour of God ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly confessed, that holding suspition to be the sicknesse of a tyrant, and being for the most so bent vpon the other extreame, as hee rather contemned all other advertisements and apprehentions of practises then any way entertained them, he at this time was so farr contrary to himselfe, as vpon the first view of the letter he did presently interpret some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure phrases therein, contrary to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Grammar construction of them, to be
