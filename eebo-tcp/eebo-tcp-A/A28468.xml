            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ome will perhaps wonder, why I took ſo much pains to write this <hi>Book;</hi> and object, that we have two good <hi>Ones</hi> of this kind extant; <hi>Cowels Interpreter,</hi> and <hi>Terms of the Law,</hi> nay haply thruſt in <hi>Leighs Phylolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Commentary,</hi> as a third: I anſwer, though it is not my deſign to raiſe the reputation of <hi>this Work,</hi> by diſvaluing <hi>Thoſe,</hi> yet it may be allowable modeſtly to declare <hi>their</hi> Defects, that my undertaking <hi>this</hi> may not appear unneceſſary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doctor Cowel</hi> was certainly a Learned Man, and his Enterpriſe very commendable, but his Profeſſion the Civil Law; and, that he did not ſingly intend his <hi>Interpreter</hi> for us, appears by his often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing what each word ſignifies in the <hi>Common Law,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from the <hi>Civil;</hi> in which learning he beſtowes a conſiderable part of his Book. He ingenuouſly ſays, <hi>His deſign is the advancement of knowledge, and to incite others to finiſh his model, and ſupply his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,</hi> which in truth are not a few; For, he directly miſtakes the meaning of ſome Words, and derivation of others, as <hi>Ordel, Mindbruch, Brodehalpeny, Furlong, Aviſhering, Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with-hawanman,</hi> &amp;c. He confounds <hi>Realty</hi> with <hi>Royalty,</hi> and <hi>Commote</hi> with <hi>Comorth,</hi> which are diſtinct words. In the word <hi>Honor,</hi> he ſayes, that in reading he has obſerv'd <hi>thus many</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors <hi>in England,</hi> and ſets down 25; wherein, either his Reading was ſhort, or his obſervations defective; for, I have collected above twice that number out of approved Authors and Records, in being when he wrote. He is ſometimes too prolix in the derivation of a Word, ſetting down ſeveral Authors Opinions, without categori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally determining which is the true; as in <hi>Exchequer, Wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam, Herald, Earle, Juſtices of Trailbaſton, Pawnage, Purlieu,</hi> &amp;c. And laſtly, gives us divers bare Words without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, as <hi>Cone</hi> &amp; <hi>Key, Calendring, Coggs, Duch, Lance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gay, Palingman, Bread of treet,</hi> &amp;c. which I have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd; Not but that I have leſt ſome <hi>quaere's</hi> too but thoſe in Words of greater difficulty.</p>
            <p>The Author of the <hi>Law-Terms</hi> was without doubt not leſs learned; but, wrote ſo long ſince, that his very Language and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb facs="tcp:57644:4"/>
of expreſſion was almoſt antiquated, till help'd by the late cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of it; He has added to divers <hi>Words</hi> ſeveral Caſes in Law, relating thereto in general, not tending much to their explication; which I have declin'd, leſt the bulk ſhould ſwell too big, and the principal Deſign be wav'd: He omits the <hi>Etymons</hi> for the moſt part, and is much more copious in the firſt part of the <hi>Alphabet,</hi> then in the later, which argues, the Author had not time, or perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to finiſh it. They are both much wanting in the number of Words, eſpecially the later; For <hi>Cowel</hi> glean'd many after the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> of the <hi>Law-Terms</hi> had inn'd his Harveſt: yet, both have much uſeleſs and repealed Law in them; as in reference to <hi>Tenures</hi> by <hi>Knights-ſervice</hi> and their Appendi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s, <hi>Wardſhip, Villenage, Purvey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, Star-chamber, Knighthood,</hi> &amp;c. For, thus ſayes the learned Author of the <hi>Preface</hi> to <hi>Roll's Abridgment—As time, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and uſe, and ſome Acts of Parliament have abridg'd ſome, and antiquided other Titles, ſo they have ſubſtituted and enlarged others. Cowel</hi> alſo, eſpecially in the <hi>Folio Edition,</hi> (beſides the misalphabeting) is extreamly miſprinted; yet the <hi>Terms of the Law</hi> will ſtill deservedly retain an uſefulneſs <hi>pro tanto,</hi> and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly for the <hi>Law-French,</hi> to inſtruct the young Student therein.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leigh</hi> affords not the leaſt Objection againſt my Undertaking; for, he is a <hi>Commentator,</hi> not an <hi>Expoſitor;</hi> his Title ſpeaks it, though ſometimes he acts a little in both capacities.</p>
            <p>Having found, theſe, among other, as I judg'd, important defects in thoſe <hi>Authors,</hi> conſider'd the uſefulneſs of Books of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and reflected on theſe Expreſſions of the <note n="*" place="margin">Coke on Litt. fo. 325, <hi>a &amp; 106. b.</hi>

               <hi>Oracle</hi> of our Law—<hi>Here, as in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other places it appears, how neceſſary it is to know the ſignification of Words.</hi> And again, <hi>That the explanation of ancient Words, and the true ſence of them is requiſite to be underſtood, per verba notiora:</hi> I was encourag'd to beſtow my endeavour herein. And, it will abate the wonder, that I, who <hi>inter doctos me non effero,</hi> ſhould yet not onely aſſume the liberty in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to correct thoſe learned <hi>Authors,</hi> but alſo make an additional collection of above a thouſand <hi>Words;</hi> if it be conſider'd, That they wanted thoſe Helps I have had, <hi>viz.</hi> That incomparable <hi>Gloſſarium Arohaiologicum</hi> of Sir <hi>Henry Spelman;</hi> The elaborate <hi>Inſtitutes</hi> of Sir <hi>Edward Coke;</hi> That excellent <hi>Dictionarium Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nico-Latino-Anglicum</hi> of Mr. <hi>Somner;</hi> The Learned Works of Mr. <hi>William Dugdale,</hi> Mr. <hi>Fabian Philips,</hi> and others, publiſh'd ſince

thoſe <hi>Authors</hi> wrote. My <hi>Genius</hi> has alſo led me (though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times diverted) to this kind of ſearch theſe thirty years, as my <hi>Gloſſographia</hi> will in ſome meaſure witneſs; For, whil'ſt my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries ſtudied the Law it ſelf, and gain'd Riches; I was hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting after the difficult and uncuth <hi>Terms</hi> of it, and got nothing, but my own ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>Nor can I otherwiſe judge, but a <hi>No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I have briefly inſerted all the old Writs out of the <hi>Regiſters,</hi> though many of them are worn out of uſe; and have not omitted even the <hi>Mechanick Words,</hi> mentioned in our <hi>Statutes;</hi> ſince there may be uſe of ſuch knowledge in <hi>Pleadings:</hi> And <hi>Lawyers</hi> (as <hi>Cowel</hi> well obſerves) profeſſing true Philoſophy, ſhould not be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of ſuch, nor even of Trees, from the <hi>Cedar of Lebanon</hi> to the <hi>Hyſop</hi> that ſprings out of the Wall.</p>
            <p>Though, to gratify the young Student, I have inſerted ſome <hi>Words,</hi> which will ſeem very common to the more Learned, yet I have rejected divers I found in <hi>Cowel,</hi> as too mean, and indeed not

            <p>If I have ſometimes committed a <hi>Jeofaile,</hi> or hunted Counter in any explication or Etymology, in ſo large a field of words, and ſtor'd with ſuch variety of Game, it will be no wonder, and, I hope, will draw no cenſure upon me from the Ingenuous: <hi>Quis enim mortalium in argumento tam vario &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſo;</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Such alſo of the</hi> Saxon <hi>Characters, as are different from the Common; ſince, through the want of ſome knowledge in that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, Authors have committed many Errors; The word <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuma</hi> being by ſome miſwritten</hi> Greſſume, <hi>by others</hi> Groſſome, <hi>and by ſome</hi> Greſſame. <hi>Grithbreche <hi>occurs in ſome,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Before the Conqueſt Charters were uſually dated; ſometimes by</hi> Olympiads, <hi>ſometimes by</hi> Calends, Nones <hi>&amp;</hi> Ides, <hi>but most frequently by the year of our Lord. After the Conqueſt, Dates were commonly omitted, eſpecially in the Deeds of Subjects, till King</hi> Edward the Second, <hi>and</hi> Edward the Thirds <hi>dayes, and thenceforth the year of the Kings Reign, or that of our Lord was conſtantly inſerted: So that Deeds, made ſince the Conqueſt, and found without date, may be preſumed to be in time before thoſe Kings Reigns.</hi>

               <hi>Witneſſes names were added in the body of the Deed, and with the ſame Hand the Deed was written, till and in King</hi> Henry the Eighths <hi>time; but now changed into</hi> Endorſements, <hi>where the Witneſses ſubſcribe their own Names.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>
               <hi>I need not Apologize the Latin, where it occurs, ſince both in ancient, as well as the modern times, our Law-pleadings, Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Records were alwayes expreſſed</hi> forenſi latinitate, <hi>which is acknowlodged not to be of the purer ſort; And ae Dipthongs of old ſeldome uſed, though I have moſtly ſupply'd them.</hi>

He who counſels or commands any evil, ſhall be judged <hi>acceſſary</hi> to all that follows upon it, but not to another diſtinct thing. As, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand one to beat another, and he beats him ſo, that the other dies of it, I ſhall be <hi>acceſſary</hi> to this murder. But, if I command one to ſteal a White Horſe, and he ſteals a Black one; or to burn ſuch a Houſe, which he well knows, and he burns another, I ſhall not be <hi>acceſſary.</hi> If I command one to kill <hi>I. S.</hi> in the Field, and he kills him in the City or Church, or to kill him at ſuch a day, and he kill him on another, I ſhall be <hi>acceſſary</hi> nothwithſtanding: For the killing is the ſubſtance, and the day, place, or weapon, is but circumſtance. But if I command one to kill <hi>I. S.</hi> and before he hath killed him, I come and ſay, I am penitent for my malice, and charge him not to kill him, and yet he kills him, I ſhall not be <hi>acceſſary.</hi> Where the <hi>Principal</hi> is pardoned or hath his Clergy, the <hi>Acceſſary</hi> cannot be arraigned; there being a Maxim in the Law, <hi>Ubi non eſt principalis non poteſt eſſe acceſſorius:</hi> For, it appears not by the Judgment of Law, that he was <hi>Principal;</hi> but if the <hi>Principal,</hi> after Attainder, be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned or hath his Clergy allowed him, there the <hi>Acceſſary</hi> ſhall be arraigned. See Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Cokes, 2 Part Inſtitutes, fol.</hi> 183. In the loweſt and higheſt offences, there are no <hi>Acceſſaries,</hi> but all are <hi>Principals;</hi> as in Riots, forcible Entries, and other tranſgreſſions, <hi>Vi &amp; armis,</hi> which are the loweſt offences.

                  <hi>Acquietandis plegiis,</hi> Is a Writ lying for a Surety againſt the Creditor that refuſeth to acquit him, after the Debt is paid. <hi>Reg. of Writs, fol.</hi> 158. Where it appears, that this is a <hi>Juſticies.</hi>

                  <hi>Acquital</hi> (from the Fr. <hi>acquiter,</hi> to free, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit, or diſcharge) moſt commonly ſignifies a Deliverance, diſcharge, and ſetting free from the ſuſpition or guilt of an offence; and is twofold, <hi>Acquittal in Law,</hi> and <hi>Acquittal in Fact.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Acquital in Law,</hi> Is when, two are appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or endited of Felony, one as Principal, the other as Acceſſary; the Principal being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, the Acceſſary is by conſequence alſo freed. And in this caſe, as the Acceſſary is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted by Law, ſo is the Principal in Fact. <hi>Stamf. Pl. Cor. fol. 168. Acquital</hi> is alſo where there is a Lord, Meſn, and Tenant; and the Tenant holds Lands of the Meſn, and the Meſn holds over of the Lord Paramount: Now the Meſn ought to <hi>acquit</hi> the Tenant of all ſervices claimed by any other for the ſame Lands; for the Tenant muſt do his ſervice to the Meſn onely, and not to divers Lords for one parcel

                  </hi> Is a parcel of Land, containing in length forty Perches, and four in bredth, or to that quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, be the length more or leſs. And, if a Man erect any new Cottage, he muſt lay four <hi>Acres</hi> of Land to it, after this meaſure. <hi>Anno 31 E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz. cap.</hi> 7. With this meaſure agrees <hi>Crompt in his Jur. of Courts, fol.</hi> 222. Though he ſays, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Cuſtom of divers Countreys, the Pearch differs, being in ſome places, and moſt ordinarily but ſixteen foot and a half; but in <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> twenty four foot, as was adjudged in the Caſe between Sir <hi>Edward Aſton,</hi> and Sir <hi>John B.</hi> in the <hi>Exchequer.</hi> In the Statute concerning ſowing Flax, (24 <hi>Hen. 8. cap.</hi> 4.) eightſcore Perches make an <hi>Acre,</hi> which is forty multiplied by four: See alſo the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Meaſuring Land, 31 <hi>Edw. 1.

               <p>
                  <hi>Action <hi>(actio)</hi>
                  </hi> is thus defined by <hi>Bracton, lib. 3. cap. 1. &amp; 3. Actio nihil aliud eſt quam jus proſequendi in judicio quod alicui debetur;</hi> and is divided into <hi>perſonal, real,</hi> and <hi>mixt.</hi> See <hi>Cokes 2 Inſt. fol.</hi> 40.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Action perſonal,</hi> is that which one Man hath againſt another, by reaſon of any Contract for Money or Goods, or for offence done by him, or ſome other perſon, for whoſe Fact he is by Law anſwerable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Action real,</hi> is that whereby the Demandant claims title to any Lands or Tenements, Rents, or Commons, in Fee-ſimple, Fee-tail, or for life. And every <hi>Action real,</hi> is either <hi>Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory,</hi> that is, of his own Poſſeſſion or Seiſin; or <hi>anceſtrel,</hi> of the Seiſin or Poſſeſſion of his Anceſtor. <hi>Coke, lib. 6. fol.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Real Actions,</hi> as <hi>Writs of Right, Writs of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, &amp;c.</hi> And their ſeveral Appendixes, as <hi>Grand Cape, Petit Cape, Receit, View, Aid-Prayer, Voucher, Counter-plea of Voucher, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-plea of Warrantry, Recovery in value,</hi> were ſeveral great Titles in our <hi>Year-Books,</hi> but now much out of uſe. <hi>Preface to Rolls Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Action mixt,</hi> is that which lies indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the thing detained, or againſt the perſon of the Detainer; and is ſo called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath a <hi>mixt</hi> reſpect, both to the thing and the perſon: Or (as others define it) is Sute given by the Law to recover the thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and damages for wrong done: As in Aſſize of <hi>Novel Diſſeiſin,</hi> which Writ (if the Diſſeiſſor make a Feoffment to another) the Diſſeiſee ſhall have againſt the Diſſeiſor; and the Feoffee, or other Ter-Tenant to recover not onely the Land, but damages alſo. And ſo is an Action of <hi>Waſt</hi> and <hi>Quare impedit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Actions</hi> are alſo divided into <hi>Civil, Penal,</hi> and <hi>Mixt. Coke, Vol. 6. fol. 61. a. Action Civil</hi> is that which tends onely to the recovery of that which by reaſon of any Contract, or other like cauſe, is due to us: As if a Man by Action ſeek to recover a ſum of Money formerly lent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Action Penal</hi> aims at ſome penalty, or puniſhment in the party ſued, be it corporal or pecuniary: As in the Action <hi>Legis Aquiliae</hi> in the Civil Law; and with us, the next friends of a Man feloniouſly ſlain or wounded, ſhall purſue the Law againſt the offender, and bring him to condign puniſhment. <hi>Bracton, lib. 3. cap.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Action Mixt,</hi> is that which ſeeks both the thing, whereof we are deprived, and a penalty for the unjuſt detaining it: As in an Action for Tythe upon the Statute 2 &amp; 3 <hi>Edw. 6. cap. 13. Item eſt alia</hi> Actio Mixta, <hi>quae dicitur</hi> Actio Hirciſcundae, &amp; <hi>locum habet inter eos qni com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munem habent haereditatem, &amp;c.</hi> See <hi>Coke on Littl. fol. 262. b.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Action</hi> is alſo (according to the Form of the Writ) divided into ſuch as are conceived to recover, either the ſimple value of the thing chalenged, or the double, trebble, or quadruple. As a <hi>Decies tantum</hi> lies againſt <hi>Embracers. Fitz. Nat. Br. fol.</hi> 171. And againſt Jurors that take Money for their Verdict of either or both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: And to be ſhort, any other Action upon a Statute, that puniſhes any offence by Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution or Fine, proportionable to the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Action</hi> is <hi>Pre-judicial</hi> (otherwiſe termed <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory)</hi> or elſe <hi>Principal. Pre-judicial</hi> is that which grows from ſome queſtion, or doubt in the <hi>Principal:</hi> As if a Man ſue his younger Brother for Land deſcended from his Father, and it is objected, he is a Baſtard. <hi>Bracton, lib 3. cap. 4. Numb.</hi> 6. This point of Baſtardy muſt be tryed, before the cauſe can further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; and therefore is termed <hi>Pre-judicialis, quia prius judicanda.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Action</hi> is either <hi>Anceſtrel</hi> or <hi>Perſonal, Stamf. Pl. Cor. 59. Anceſtrel</hi> ſeems to be that, which we have by ſome right deſcending from our <hi>Anceſtor;</hi> and <hi>Perſonal,</hi> which has begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in, and from our ſelves. There is alſo <hi>Action Anceſtrel Droiturel,</hi> and <hi>Action An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtrel Poſſeſſary;</hi> which ſee in <hi>Cokes 2 Inſt. fol.</hi> 291.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Action upon the Caſe (actio ſuper caſum)</hi> is a general Action given for redreſs of wrongs done to any Man without force, and by Law not eſpecially provided for, and is now moſt in uſe. For, where you have any occaſion of Suite, that neither has a fit name, nor certain Form already preſcribed; there the Clerks of the <hi>Chancery,</hi> in ancient time, conceived a ſit Form of Action for the thing in queſtion, which the <hi>Civilians</hi> call <hi>Actionem in Factum,</hi> and we, <hi>Action upon the Caſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Action upon the Statute (actio ſuper Statutum)</hi> is an Action brought againſt a Man, upon an offence againſt a Statute, whereby an Action is
<pb facs="tcp:57644:10"/>
given, and lay not before. As, where one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits Perjury, to the prejudice of another, he, who is endamaged, ſhall have a Writ upon the Statute, and his Cauſe. And, the difference between an <hi>Action upon the Statute,</hi> and <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Popular,</hi> is, Where the Statute gives the Suite or Action to the party grieved, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to one perſon certain, that is called <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the Statute.</hi> But where Authority is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the Statute to every one that will ſo ſue, that is termed <hi>Action Popular.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Action</hi> is Perpetual or Temporal <hi>(Perpetua vel Temporalis)</hi> and that is called <hi>Perpetual,</hi> whoſe force is by no time determined. Of which ſort were all Civil Actions among the Ancient <hi>Romans, viz.</hi> Such as grew from Laws, Decrees of the Senate, or Conſtitutions of the Emperors; whereas Actions granted by the <hi>Pretor,</hi> died within the year. So we have in <hi>England, Perpetual</hi> and <hi>Temporary Actions,</hi> and I think all may be called <hi>Perpetual,</hi> that are not expreſly limited. As divers Statutes give Actions, ſo they be purſued within the time by them preſcribed; namely, the Statute of 1 <hi>Edw. 6. cap.</hi> 1. gives Action for three years after the offences committed, and no longer. And the Statute of 7 <hi>Hen. 8. cap.</hi> 3. doth the like for four years, and that of 31 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 5. for one year, and no more. But, as by the Civil Law, no Actions were at the laſt ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual, but that by time they might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed againſt: So in our Law, though Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be called <hi>Perpetual,</hi> in compariſon of thoſe that are expreſly limited by Statute, yet is there a means to preſcribe againſt Real Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons after five years, by a Fine levied, or a Recovery ſuffered; as you may ſee in the words, <hi>Fine, Recovery,</hi> and <hi>Limitation of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſize.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Action of a Writ,</hi> is a term uſed, when one pleads ſome matter, by which he ſhews the Plaintiff had no cauſe to have the Writ he brought; yet it may be, he might have another Writ or Action for the ſame matter. Such a Plea is called, <hi>A Plea to the Action of the Writ.</hi> Whereas, if by the Plea it ſhould appear, That the Plaintiff has no cauſe to have an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the thing demanded; then it is called <hi>A Plea to the Action.</hi> Cowel.</p>

                  <hi>Addition <hi>(additio)</hi>
                  </hi> ſignifies, A Title given to a Man over and above his Chriſtian and Sirname, ſhewing his Eſtate, Degree, Myſtery, Trade, Place of dwelling, <hi>&amp;c. Additions of Eſtate,</hi> are theſe, <hi>Yeoman, Gentleman, Eſquire,</hi> and ſuch like. <hi>Additions of Degree</hi> are thoſe we call names of Dignity, as <hi>Knight, Lord, Earl, Marqueſs,</hi> and <hi>Duke. Additions of Myſtery,</hi> are, <hi>Scrivener, Painter, Maſon, &amp;c. Addition of Town,</hi> as <hi>Dale, Thorp,</hi> and ſuch like. And, where a Man hath houſhold in two places, he ſhall be ſaid to dwell in both of them;. ſo that his <hi>Addition</hi> in either may ſuffice.</p>
               <p>By the Statute of 1 <hi>Hen 5. cap.</hi> 5. It was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, That in Suits or Actions where Proces of Outlary lies, ſuch <hi>Additions</hi> ſhould be to the name of the Defendant, to ſhew his Eſtate, Myſtery, and place where he dwells, and that the Writs, not having ſuch <hi>Additions,</hi> ſhall abate, if the Defendant take exception there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; but not, by the Office of the Court. And this was ordained, to the intent, that one Man might not be vexed, or troubled by the Outlary of another; but by reaſon of the certain <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> every perſon may bear his own burden.

                  <hi>Ad quod damnum,</hi> Is a Writ that lies to the Sheriff to enquire what hurt it may be for the King, to grant a Fair or Market in any Town, or place; or for the King, or any other perſon to grant any Lands in Fee-ſimple to any Houſe of Religion, or other Body Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.

For a Body Politick dies not, nor can perform perſonal ſervice to the King, or their Meſn Lords, as ſingle perſons may do.

Which <hi>Bracton</hi> does notwithſtanding limit unto Twelve years. Thirdly, At Twelve years ſhe is able finally, to ratifie and confirm her former conſent to Matrimony. Fourthly, At Fourteen ſhe is enabled to receive her Lands into her own hands, and ſhould be out of Ward, if ſhe were of this Age at her Anceſtors death. Fifthly, At Sixteen years ſhe ſhould be out of Ward, though at the death of her Anceſtor ſhe was under Fourteen. The reaſon is, Becauſe then ſhe might take a Husband able to perform Knights ſervice. Sixthly, At Twenty one years ſhe is able to alienate her Lands and Tenements. Alſo at the Age of Fourteen, a Man is enabled to chuſe his own Guardian, and to claim his Land holden in Soccage. <hi>Dyer, fol.</hi> 162. Which <hi>Bracton (Lib.</hi> 2.) limits at Fifteen years, with whom <hi>Glanvile</hi> alſo agrees. And at Fourteen a Man may conſent to Marriage, as a Woman at Twelve.

                  <hi>Agreement <hi>(Agreamentum, Plowden, fol.</hi>

An <hi>Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> executed at the beginning. 2. An <hi>Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> after an Act done by another, and is exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted alſo. 3. An <hi>Agreement</hi> executory, or to be done.

Doctor and Student, Dial. 1. cap.</hi> 3. Shews ſeveral dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences between a Rent, and an <hi>Annuity,</hi> whereof the firſt is, That every Rent, be it Rent-charge, Rent-ſervice, or Rent-ſeek, is iſſuing out of Land; but an <hi>Annuity</hi> chargeth the perſon onely, that is to ſay, The Grantor or his Heirs that have Aſſets by deſcent. The ſecond is, That for the recovery of an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity,</hi> no Action lies, but onely the Writ of <hi>Annuity</hi> againſt the Grantor, his Heirs, or Succeſſors; but of a Rent, the ſame Actions lie as do of Land, as the Caſe requires. The third difference is, That an <hi>Annuity</hi> is never taken for Aſſets, becauſe it is no Free-hold in Law, nor ſhall it be put in Execution upon a Statute Merchant, Statute Staple or <hi>Elegit,</hi> as a Rent may. <hi>Dyer, fol. 345. numb. 2.

                  <hi>Apportionment <hi>(apportionamentum)</hi>
                  </hi> Is a dividing of a Rent into parts, according as the Land (whence the whole Rent iſſues) is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided among two or more. As if a Man have a Rent-ſervice iſſuing out of Land, and he purchaſeth part of the Land, the Rent ſhall be <hi>apportioned,</hi> according to the value of the Land. So if a Man let Lands for years, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Rent, and after a ſtranger recovers part of the Land, the Rent ſhall be <hi>apporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.</hi> But a Rent-charge cannot be <hi>apportioned,</hi> nor things that are entire; As if one hold Land by ſervice, to pay to his Lord yearly at ſuch a Feaſt, a Horſe, or Roſe; there, if the Lord purchaſe part of the Land, this ſervice is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally extinct; becauſe ſuch things cannot be divided without hurt to the whole. Yet in ſome Caſes a Rent-charge ſhall be <hi>apportioned,</hi> as if a Man hath a Rent-charge iſſuing out of Land, and his Father purchaſeth part of the Land charged in Fee, and dies, and this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel deſcends to his Son, who hath the Rent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge; there this Charge ſhall be <hi>apportioned,</hi> according to the value of the Land; becauſe ſuch portion of the Land, purchaſed by the Father, comes not to the Son by his own Act, but by deſcent and courſe of Law. Common Appendant is of common right, and ſeverable; and though the Commoner, in ſuch caſe, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe parcel of the Land, wherein the Common is Appendant, yet the Common ſhall be <hi>appor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</hi> But in this caſe, Common Appurtenant, and not Appendant, by ſuch Purchaſe is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct. <hi>Coke, lib. 8. fol.</hi> 79.</p>

Firſt, becauſe they ſettle the Poſſeſſion, and ſo an outward right in him that obtains by them. Secondly, They were originally executed at a certain time and place formerly appointed. For by the <hi>Norman</hi> Law, the time and place muſt be known forty days before the Juſtices ſit on them: And by our Law there muſt be likewiſe fifteen days of preparation, except they be tried in the ſtanding Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> as appears by <hi>Fitz. Nat. Br. fol. 177. d, e.</hi> Laſtly, They may be called <hi>Aſſiſes,</hi> becauſe they are tried moſt commonly by eſpecial Courts, ſet and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the purpoſe, as may be well proved, not onely out of the <hi>Cuſtomary</hi> of <hi>Normandy,</hi> but our Books alſo: Which ſhew, That in ancient times Juſtices were appointed by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Commiſſion, to diſpatch Controverſies of Poſſeſſion, one or more, in this or that onely County, as occaſion fell out, or Diſſeiſins were offered, and that as well in Term time, as out of Term: Whereas of later days, we ſee that all theſe Commiſſions of <hi>Aſſiſes,</hi> of <hi>Eyr,</hi> of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> of <hi>Goal-delivery,</hi> and of <hi>Niſi prius,</hi> are diſpatched all at one time, by two ſeveral Circuits in the year, out of term, and by ſuch as have the greateſt ſway of Juſtice, being all of them the Kings Juſtices of either Bench, <hi>Barons</hi> of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> or <hi>Serjeants</hi> at Law.</p>

                  <hi>Aſſiſe,</hi> in this ſignification, thus. Aſſiſa <hi>in jure poſſeſſorio, eſt quaedam recognitio duodecim hominum juratorum, per quam Juſticiarii certiorantur de articulis in brevi contentis.</hi> And <hi>Aſſiſe</hi> alſo, thus ſignifying, is ſaid ſometime to paſs <hi>(per modum aſſiſae)</hi> and ſometime <hi>in modum juratae;</hi> in manner of an Aſſiſe, when onely the Diſſeiſin in queſtion, is put to the tryal of the Twelve; in manner of a Jury, when any exception is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to diſable the intereſt of the Diſſeiſee, and is put to be tryed by the Twelve, before the Aſſiſe can paſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſſiſe</hi> in this ſignification, is taken four ways, <hi>Old Nat. Br. fol.</hi> 105. The firſt is <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſe at large,</hi> which is taken as well upon other Points, as upon the Diſſeiſin. For example, where an Infant brings an Aſſiſe, and the Deed of his Anceſtor is pleaded, whereby he claims his Right or founds his Title; then the <hi>Aſſiſe</hi> ſhall be taken at large: That is, the Jury ſhall enquire not onely whether the Plaintiff were diſſeiſed, or not, by the Tenant, but alſo of theſe Points, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether his Anceſtor were of full age, of good memory, and out of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, when he made the Deed, pleaded. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other example, You may read in <hi>Littleton, cap. Eſtates upon Condition.</hi> The ſecond manner is, when the Tenant, as it were, ſetting foot to foot with the Demandant, without farther circumſtance, pleads directly contrary to the Writ, <hi>no wrong, no diſſeiſin.</hi> The third is, When the Tenant alleageth ſomething by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception that muſt be tried by a Jury, before the principal cauſe can proceed: As if he plead Forein Releaſe, or Forein Matter tryable in another County. For, in this caſe, the Juſtices refer the Record to the Court of <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> for tryal of the Forein Pleas, before the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſin can come to be decuſſed. Of this ſort read divers other examples in <hi>Bracton, lib. 4. part. 1. cap</hi> 34. For there are of them (as he ſaith, and <hi>Britton</hi> alſo, <hi>cap.</hi> 52.) both dilatory and peremptory. The fourth and laſt manner is, <hi>Aſſiſe of Right of Damages;</hi> that is, when the Tenant, confeſſing an <hi>Ouſter,</hi> and referring it to a Demurrer in Law, whether it were right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done or not, is adjudged to have done wrong. For then ſhall the Demandant have a Writ to recover damages, called an <hi>Aſſiſe to recover damages,</hi> as alſo the whole Proceſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſſiſe,</hi> is further taken for the Court, place, or time, when and where the Writs and Proceſſes of the <hi>Aſsiſe</hi> are handled or taken: And in this ſignification <hi>Aſſiſe</hi> is general; as when the Juſtices go their ſeveral Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuits, with their Commiſſion, to take all <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſes</hi> twice in the year, that is called the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſſiſe.</hi> It may likewiſe, in this ſignification, be <hi>ſpecial;</hi> as if an eſpecial Commiſſion be granted to certain perſons (as was often done in ancient time, <hi>Bracton, lib. 3. cap.</hi> 11.) for taking an <hi>Aſſiſe</hi> upon one Diſſeiſin or two; this would be called a <hi>Special Aſſiſe.</hi> And in this very ſignification, <hi>Glanvile</hi> uſes it, <hi>Lib. 9. cap</hi> 12.

There is another difference, in that an Arreſt lies onely upon the Body of a Man, and an <hi>Attachment</hi> ſometimes on his Goods; which makes it in that particular differ from a <hi>Capias,</hi> in being more general: For, a man may be <hi>attached</hi> by an hundred Sheep <hi>(Kitchin, fol.</hi> 263.) but the <hi>Capias</hi> takes hold of the Body onely.

                  <hi>Attachment by Writ,</hi> differs from a Diſtreſs or <hi>Diſtringas</hi> in this, That an <hi>Attachment</hi> reacheth not to Lands, as a Diſtreſs doth, and that a Diſtreſs toucheth not the Body (if it be properly taken) as an <hi>Attachment</hi> doth, yet are they divers times confounded, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by <hi>Glanvil, lib. 10. cap.</hi> 3. and <hi>Fleta, lib. 2. cap.</hi> 66. Howbeit, in the moſt common uſe, an <hi>Attachment</hi> is an apprehenſion of a Man by his Body, to bring him to anſwer the Action of the Plaintiff. A <hi>Diſtreſs,</hi> without a Writ, is the taking of a Mans Goods for ſome real cauſe, as Rent, Service, or the like, whereby to force him to Replevy, and ſo to be Plaintuff in an Action of <hi>Trespaſs</hi> againſt him that diſtrained him.

What the Form of the Writ is, and how in uſe, is expreſſed in <hi>Fitz. Nat. Br. fol.</hi> 105. and <hi>New Book of Entries, fol.</hi> 84.

Pl. Cor. fol. 44. Attainder</hi> by Appearance is by Confeſſion, by Battle, or by Verdict. <hi>Confeſſion</hi> (whereof <hi>Attaint</hi> grows) is twofold; one at the Bar before the Judges, when the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, upon his Indictment read, being asked <hi>guilty</hi> or <hi>not guilty,</hi> anſwers <hi>guilty,</hi> never put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf upon the Jury; the other is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Coroner in Sanctuary, where he upon his Confeſſion, was, in former times conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to abjure the Realm, which kinde alſo, of the effect, is called <hi>Attainder by Abjuration, Stanf. fol. 182. Attainder by Battle,</hi> is when the party, appealed by another, and chuſing to try the truth by Combat, rather then by Jury, is vanquiſhed. <hi>Attainder by Verdict,</hi> is when the Priſoner at the Bar, anſwering <hi>not guilty</hi> to the Indictment, hath an Enqueſt of Life and Death paſſing upon him, and is, by their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, pronounced guilty. <hi>Idem, f. 108 &amp; 192. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder by Proceſs,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Attainder by Default,</hi> or <hi>Attainder by Outlary,</hi> is where a party flies, or doth not appear, until he hath been five times called publickly in the County Court, and at laſt upon his default is pronounced or returned <hi>Outlawed.</hi> The ſame Author <hi>(fol.</hi> 108.) makes a difference between <hi>Attainder</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction;</hi> with whom agrees the Statute, <hi>Anno 34 &amp; 35 Hen. 8. cap.</hi> 14. and <hi>Anno 1 Edw. 6. cap.</hi> 12. in theſe words, <hi>That then every ſuch Offender, being duly thereof convicted or attainted by the Laws of this Realm, &amp;c.</hi> And I finde by <hi>Stanf.

That a Man by our ancient Laws, was ſaid to be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed</hi> preſently upon the Verdict <hi>(guilty,)</hi> but not to be <hi>attainted,</hi> until it appeared he was no Clerk, or being a Clerk, and demanded by his Ordinary, could not purge himſelf. And in one word it appears, That <hi>Attainder</hi> is larger then <hi>Conviction; Conviction</hi> being onely by the Jury: And <hi>Attainder</hi> is not before Judgment. <hi>Perkins, Grants, num.</hi> 27, 29. Yet it appears by <hi>Stanf. fol.</hi> 9. that <hi>Conviction</hi> is ſometimes called <hi>Attainder:</hi> For there he ſays, the Verdict of the Jury does either acquit or <hi>attaint</hi> a Man. And ſo it is, <hi>Weſtm. 1. cap.</hi> 14. This ancient Law touching the Conviction and Purgation of Clerks is altered by 23 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 2. as you may read in <hi>Clergy.</hi>

The Children of a perſon <hi>Attainted</hi> of Treaſon cannot be Heirs to him, or any other Anceſtor.

The reaſon why it is called <hi>Bail,</hi> is, Becauſe by this means the party Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, is <hi>delivered</hi> into the hands of thoſe that bind themſelves for his forth-coming. There is both <hi>common</hi> and <hi>ſpecial Bail; Common Bail</hi> is in Actions of ſmall prejudice or concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being called <hi>Common,</hi> becauſe any Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in that caſe, are taken; whereas in Cauſes of greater weight, as Actions upon Bond or Specialty, <hi>Special Bail</hi> or Surety muſt be taken, as Subſidy Men at leaſt, and they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the value. <hi>Manwood,</hi> in his firſt part of <hi>Foreſt Laws, pag.</hi> 167. ſays, there is a great diverſity between <hi>Bail</hi> and <hi>Mainpriſe:</hi> For he that is <hi>Mainpriſed,</hi> is always ſaid to be at large, and to go at his own Liberty out of Ward, from the time he is <hi>Mainpriſed,</hi> till the day of his appearance: But otherwiſe it is, where a Man is let to <hi>Bail</hi> by four or two Men, by the Lord Chief Juſtice in <hi>Eyre,</hi> until a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain day; for there he is always accounted by the Law, to be in their Ward, and cuſtody for the time: And they may, if they will, keep him in Ward or Priſon. So that he who is ſo <hi>bailed,</hi> ſhall not be ſaid by the Law, to be at large, or at his own liberty. See <hi>Lamb. Eiren lib. 3. cap. 2. pag. 330.

                  <hi>Bailiff <hi>(Balivus)</hi>
                  </hi> As the name, ſo the Office it ſelf in ancient time was anſwerable to that of <hi>France,</hi> where there are Eight Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are high Courts, whence lies no Appeal; and within the Precincts of thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of that Kingdom, which belong to each Parliament, there are ſeveral Provinces, to which Juſtice is miniſtred by certain Officers called <hi>Bailiffs.</hi> So in <hi>England</hi> we ſee many ſeveral Counties, in which, Juſtice hath been miniſtred to the Inhabitants by the Officer, whom we now call <hi>Sheriff</hi> or <hi>Vicount</hi> (the one name deſcending from the <hi>Saxons,</hi> the other from the <hi>Normans.)</hi> And though I cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly prove, That this <hi>Sheriff</hi> was ever called a <hi>Bailiff,</hi> yet it is probable <hi>that</hi> was one of his names alſo; becauſe the <hi>County</hi> is often called <hi>Baliva,</hi> a <hi>Bailywick.</hi> As namely, in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of a Writ, <hi>Non eſt inventus in Baliva mea, &amp;c. Kitchin Returna Brevium, fol.</hi> 285. And in the Sheriffs Oath, the County is called his <hi>Bailiwick.</hi> I think the word <hi>Bailiff</hi> uſed in <hi>Magna Chart. cap.</hi> 28. and 14 <hi>Edw. 3. Stat. 1. cap.</hi> 9. compriſeth as well <hi>Sheriffs</hi> as <hi>Bailiffs</hi> of Hundreds. But as the Realin is divided into Counties, ſo every County is again divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hundreds; within which, it is manifeſt, that in ancient time the Kings Subjects had juſtice miniſtred to them by the ſeveral Officers of every Hundred, which were called <hi>Bailiffs,</hi> as thoſe Officers do in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Normandy,</hi> being cheif Officers of Juſtice within every Province. <hi>Grand Cuſtomary of Norm. cap.</hi> 1. And it appears by <hi>Bracton (lib. 3. tract. 2 cap. 34. num.</hi> 5.) that <hi>Bailiffs of Hundreds</hi> might hold Plea of Appeal and Approvers. But ſince that time theſe Hundred Courts (certain Franchiſes excepted) are by the ſaid Statute of 14 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. ſwallowed into the County Courts, as you may read in <hi>County</hi> and <hi>Hundred.</hi> And now the <hi>Bailiffs</hi> name and office is grown into ſuch contempt, at leaſt theſe <hi>Bailiffs</hi> of Hundreds, that they are now but bare Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers and Mandataries within their Liberties, to ſerve Writs, and ſuch vile Offices; for which ſee <hi>Crompt. Juſt. of Peace, fol. 49. a.</hi> Yet is the name otherwiſe ſtill in good eſteem; for the chief Magiſtrates in divers Corporate Towns, are called <hi>Bailiffs,</hi> as of <hi>Ludlow, Leominſter, &amp;c.</hi> And again, there are certain perſons to whom the Kings Caſtles are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, who are called <hi>Bailiffs,</hi> as the <hi>Bailiff</hi> of <hi>Dover</hi> Caſtle.</p>
               <p>Theſe ordinary <hi>Bailiffs</hi> are of two ſorts, <hi>Bailiffs Errant,</hi> and <hi>Bailiffs of Franchiſes. Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffs
<pb facs="tcp:57644:22"/>
Errant (Balivi Itinerantes)</hi> are thoſe whom the Sheriff appoints to go up and down the County to ſerve Writs, Summon the County Seſſions, Aſſiſes, and ſuch like. <hi>Bailiffs of Franchiſes (Balivi Francheſiarum aut Liberta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum)</hi> are thoſe who are appointed by every Lord within his Liberty, to do ſuch Offices therein, as the <hi>Bailiff Errant</hi> does at large in the County. Of theſe read Sir <hi>Tho. Smith de Repub. Angl. lib. 2. cap.</hi> 16. There are alſo <hi>Bailiffs of the Foreſt (Manwood, part. 1. pag.</hi> 113.) and <hi>Bailiffs of Husbandry,</hi> belonging to private Men of good Eſtates, who are ſo called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they diſpoſe of the under ſervants, every Man to his labor and task, check them for miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing their buſineſs, gather the profits to their Lord and Maſters uſe, and deliver an account thereof at the years end, or otherwiſe as it ſhall be called for.</p>

Yet it is probable, that of old here in <hi>England,</hi> all thoſe were called <hi>Barons</hi> that had ſuch Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niories or Lordſhips, as we now call <hi>Court Barons,</hi> who are at this day called <hi>Seigneurs</hi> in <hi>France:</hi> And the Learned in our Antiquities, have informed us, That not long after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, all ſuch came to the Parliament, and ſate as <hi>Peers</hi> in the Lords Houſe. But when by experience it appeared, that the Parliament was too much thronged with ſuch multitudes, it was in the Reign of King <hi>John</hi> ordained, That none but the <hi>Barones Majores</hi> ſhould for their extraordinary wiſdom, intereſt, or quality, be ſummoned to Parliament. After that, again Men ſeeing this eſtate of Nobility to be but caſual, and depend meerly upon the Princes pleaſure, they ſought a more certain hold, and obtained of the King Letters Patent of this Dignity, to them, and their Heirs-male; who were called <hi>Barons by Letters Patent,</hi> or by Creation, whoſe poſterity are now by inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and true deſcent of Nobility, thoſe <hi>Barons</hi> that are called Lords of the Parliament, of which kinde, the King may create at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Baron</hi> in the next ſignification, is an Officer, as <hi>Barons of the Exchequer,</hi> of whom, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal is called <hi>Lord chief Baron (Capitalis Baro,)</hi> and the three other are his Aſſiſtants in Cauſes of Juſtice, between the King and his Subjects, touching matters appertaining to the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and the Kings Revenue. The <hi>Lord Cheif Baron,</hi> is the cheif Judge of the Court, and in Matter of Law, Information and Plea anſwers the Bar, and gives order for Judgment thereupon. He alone in the Term time ſits upon <hi>Niſi prius,</hi> that come out of the <hi>Kings Remembrancers</hi> Office, or out of the Office of the Clerk of the Pleas, which cannot be diſpatched in the mornings for want of time. He takes Recognizances for the Kings Debts, for appearances and obſerving orders. He takes the preſentation of all the Officers in Court under himſelf, and of the Lord Major of <hi>London,</hi> and ſees the <hi>Kings Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancer</hi> give them their Oaths. He takes the Declaration of certain Receivers accompts of the Lands of the late Augmentation made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, by the Auditors.

               <p>The <hi>ſecond Baron,</hi> in the abſence of the Lord cheif Baron, anſwers the Bar and takes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizances as aforeſaid. He gives yearly the Oath to the late Major of <hi>London,</hi> for the true accompt of the profits of his Office. He takes certain Receivers accompts, and examines the Letters and Sums of ſuch Sheriffs Forein Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts; as alſo the Accompts of Eſcheators and Collectors of Subſidies and Taxes, as are brought him by the Auditor of the Court.</p>
               <p>The <hi>third Baron,</hi> in the abſence of the other two, anſwers the Bar and takes Recognizances as aforeſaid. He gives yearly the Oath to the late Major and Gawger of <hi>London</hi> for his true accompting. He alſo takes certain Receivers Accompts, and examines the Letters and Sums of ſuch of the former Accomptants, as are brought unto him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>fourth Baron,</hi> is always a Curſitor of the Court; at the days prefixed, he takes Oath of all High Sheriffs, and their Under Sheriffs, Bailiffs, and other Accomptants, for their true accompting. He takes the Oath of all Collectors, Comptrollers, Surveyors, and Searchers of the Cuſtom-houſes, that they have made true En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trances in their Books. He appoſeth all Sheriffs upon their Summons of the Pipe in open Court; and informs the reſt of the <hi>Barons</hi> of the Courſe of the Court, in any Matter that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the Kings Prerogative. He likewiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amines ſuch Accompts as are brought to him.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Barons of the Exchequer</hi> are ancient Officers; for I finde them named in <hi>Weſtm. 2. cap. 11. Anno 13 Edw.</hi> 1. and they are called <hi>Barons,</hi> becauſe <hi>Barons</hi> of the Realm were wont to be employed in that Office. <hi>Fleta, lib. 2. cap.</hi> 24. Their Office is to look to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts of the Prince, and to that end, they have <hi>Auditors</hi> under them; as alſo to decide all Cauſes appertaining to the Kings Revenue, coming into the <hi>Exchequer</hi> by any means; as in part is proved by the Statutes of 20 <hi>Edw. 3. cap</hi> 2. and 27 <hi>ejuſdem, Stat. 2. cap. 18. 5 Rich. 2.

                  <hi>Cape</hi> (Lat.) Is a Writ Judicial touching Plea of Land or Tenements; ſo termed (as moſt Writs are) of that word, which carries the eſpecial eſt intention, or end of it. And this Writ is divided into <hi>Cape Magnum</hi> and <hi>Cape Parvum:</hi> Both which (as is before ſaid in <hi>Attachment)</hi> take hold of things immoveable, and ſeem to differ in theſe points. Firſt, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Cape Magnum</hi> or the <hi>Grand Cape</hi> lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore appearance, and <hi>(Cape Parvum)</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Secondly, The <hi>(Cape Magnum)</hi> ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons the Tenant to anſwer to the Default, and over to the Demandant. <hi>Cape Parvum</hi> Summons the Tenant to anſwer to the Default onely; and therefore is called <hi>Cape Parvum</hi> or <hi>Petit Cape. Old Nat. Br. fol.</hi> 161, 162. Yet <hi>Ingham</hi> ſaith, it is called <hi>Petit Cape,</hi> not becauſe it is of ſmall force, but that it conſiſts of few words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cape Magnum</hi> in the <hi>Old. Nat. Br.</hi> is thus defined; Where a Man hath brought a <hi>Praecipe quod Reddat</hi> of a thing that touches Plea of Land, and the Tenant makes default at the day to him given in the Original Writ, then this Writ ſhall go for the King, to take the Land into His hands; and if the Tenant come not at the day given him thereby, he loſeth his Land, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A Form of this Writ, you may ſee in the <hi>Reg. Judicial, fol. 1. b.</hi> Of this Writ, and the Explication of its true force and effect, read <hi>Bracton, lib 3. tract. 3. cap. 1. num. 4, 5, &amp;</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cape Parvum</hi> or <hi>Petit Cape</hi> (in <hi>Old. Nat. Br. fol.</hi> 162.) Is thus defined; Where the Tenant is ſummoned in Plea of Land, and comes at the Summons, and his appearance is of Record; and at the day given him, prays the View, and having it granted, makes default, then ſhall Iſſue this Writ for the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The difference betwixt the <hi>Grand Cape</hi> and <hi>Petit Cape</hi> (which in effect or conſequence, are alike) is, that the <hi>Grand Cape</hi> is Awarded upon the Defendant or Tenants not appearing or demanding the View in ſuch Real Actions, where the Original Writ does not mention the parcels or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars demanded: And the <hi>Petit Cape,</hi> after Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parence or View granted.

Where I am impleaded of Lands, and I vouch to warrant another, againſt whom the Summons <hi>Ad Warrantizandum</hi> hath been Awarded, and the Sheriff comes not at the day given; then, if the Demandant recover againſt me, I ſhall have this Writ againſt the Vouchee, and ſhall recover ſo much <hi>in value</hi> of the Lands of the Vouchee, if he hath ſo much, if not, then I ſhall have execution of ſuch Lands and Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as deſcend to him in Fee; or, if he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe afterwards, I ſhall have againſt him a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummons; and if he can ſay nothing, I ſhall recover the <hi>value.</hi> This Writ lies before Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parence.

                  <hi>Capias,</hi> is a Writ of two ſorts, one before Judgment, called <hi>Capias ad Respondendum,</hi> where the Sheriff, upon Original, or other Writ in a Perſonal Action returns <hi>Nihil habet in Baliva noſtra.</hi> The other is a Writ of Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on after Judgment, being alſo of divers kindes; as <hi>Capias ad Satisfaciendum, Capias pro Fine, Capias Utlagatum,</hi> after Judgment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Capias ad Satisfaciendum,</hi> Is a Writ of Execution after Judgment, lying where a Man recovers in an Action Perſonal; as for Debt, Damages, Detinue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Kings Court: In which caſe, this Writ Iſſues to the Sheriff, commanding him to take the body of him, againſt whom the Debt is recovered, who ſhall be put in priſon, till he make ſatisfaction.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:57644:30"/>
                  <hi>Capias pro Fine,</hi> Is where one, being by Judgment fined to the King, upon ſome offence committed againſt a Statute, does not diſcharge it, according to the Judgment: By this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is his body to be taken and committed to priſon, until he pay the Fine. <hi>Coke, lib. 3. fol.</hi> 12. Or where, upon a <hi>Non eſt factum</hi> pleaded, his Plea is, by evidence or his own after-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, not made out or verified, and the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Capias Utlagatum,</hi> Is a Writ which lies againſt him, who is outlawed upon any Action Perſonal or Criminal, by which the Sheriff apprehends the party outlawed, for not appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the <hi>Exigend,</hi> and keeps him in ſafe cuſtody till the day of return, and then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents him to the Court, there farther to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered for his contempt; which (if in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Pleas) was in former times to be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Fleet, there to remain till he had ſued out the Kings Charter of Pardon, and appeared to the Action. At preſent, in the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> the <hi>Outlary</hi> cannot be reverſed, unleſs the Defendant appear in perſon, and by a preſent of Gloves to the Judges, implore and obtain their ſavor to reverſe it. And in the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> the Defendant (not being an Executor or Adminiſtrator) is now to give good Bail (which he is allow'd to do by Atturny) to anſwer the Action, if the Debt or Damage demanded be 20 l. or above, and to pay the Plaintiffs charges, before the <hi>outlary</hi> be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed. And, by a ſpecial <hi>Capias Utlagatum</hi> in the ſame Writ, the Sheriff is commanded, and may ſeize all the Defendants Lands, Goods, and Chattels for the contempt to the King; and the Plaintiff may (after an Inquiſition taken thereupon, and returned into the <hi>Exchequer)</hi> obtain a Leaſe of the Lands extended, and a grant of the Goods, whereby to compel the Defendant to appear; which, when he ſhall do and reverſe the Utlary, are to be reſtored to him.

                  </hi> This Officer in late times is greatly advanced, not onely in our, but in other Kingdoms: For he is the chief Adminiſtrator of Juſtice, next to the Soveraign. All other Juſtices in this Kingdom are tied to the Law, and may not ſwerve from it in Judgment; but the <hi>Chancellor</hi> hath the Kings abſolute power to moderate the Written Law, governing his Judgment by the Law of Nature and Conſcience, and ordering all things <hi>juxta aequum &amp; bonum.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Stanford</hi> (in his <hi>Praerog. cap. 20. fol.</hi> 65.) ſays, The <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor</hi> hath two powers, one abſolute, the other ordinary; meaning, that, though by his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary power in ſome caſes, he muſt obſerve the form of proceeding, as other Inferior Judges, yet in his abſolute power, he is not limitted by the Written Law, but by Conſcience and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, according the Circumſtances of Matter.

               <p>He that bears this Magiſtracy, is called <hi>The Lord Chancellor of England,</hi> and is made ſo <hi>Per traditionem magni Sigilli ſibi per Dominum Regem,</hi> and by taking his Oath.

Secondly, it is a place of Receipt for Deer, and Wilde Beaſts, of a middle nature between a Foreſt and a Park, being commonly leſs then a Foreſt, and not endued with ſo many Liberties, as the Courts of <hi>Attachment, Swain-mote,</hi> and <hi>Juſtice-ſeat;</hi> and yet of a larger compaſs, and ſtored with greater diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, both of Keepers and Wilde Beaſts, or Game, then a Park. <hi>Crompton</hi> in his <hi>Juriſd. fol.</hi> 148. ſays, A <hi>Foreſt</hi> cannot be in the hands of a Subject, but it forthwith loſeth its name, and becomes a <hi>Chaſe;</hi> and yet <hi>fol.</hi> 197. he ſays, A Subject may be Lord and owner of a Foreſt, which though it ſeems a contradiction, yet both ſayings are in ſome ſort true. For the King may give or alienate a Foreſt to a Subject, yet ſo, as, when it is once in the Subject, it loſeth the true property of a Foreſt; becauſe the Courts called the <hi>Juſtice-ſeat, Swain-mote,</hi> and <hi>Attachment,</hi> do forthwith vaniſh; none being able to make a Lord Chief Juſtice in <hi>Fyr</hi> of the Foreſt, but the King; as <hi>Manwood</hi> well obſerves <hi>Par. 2. cap. 3. &amp;</hi> 4. Yet it may be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſo large a manner, as there may be <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment, Swain-mote,</hi> and a Court equivalent to a Juſtice Seat, as appears by him in the ſame Chapter, <hi>num.</hi> 3. So that a <hi>Chaſe</hi> differs from a Foreſt in this, becauſe it may be in the hands of a Subject, which a Foreſt, in his proper and true nature, cannot; and from a Park, in that it is not encloſed, and hath not onely a larger compaſs, and more variety of Game; but of Keepers alſo, and Officers.

                  <hi>Confirmation <hi>(Confirmatio)</hi>
                  </hi> Is a ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or confirming an eſtate to one, who hath the poſſeſſion, by a voidable Title, though not at preſent void. As, a Biſhop grants his Chancellorſhip by Patent for term of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentees life: This is no void grant, but void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by the Biſhops death, except it be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Dean and Chapters Confirmation.

As, if a Man be indited for feloniouſly ſtealing the Goods of another, where in truth they are the proper Goods of him indited, and they are brought in Court againſt him; who, being asked what he ſaith to the ſaid Goods, diſclaims them. By this Diſclaimer he ſhall loſe the Goods, though he be afterwards ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted of the Felony, and the King ſhall have them as <hi>Confiſcate;</hi> but otherwiſe, if he had not diſclaimed them. So where Goods are found in the Felons poſſeſſion, which he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avows, and afterwards is attainted of other Goods, and not of them, there the Goods which he diſavows, are <hi>Confiſcate</hi> to the King; but had he been attainted of the ſame Goods, they ſhould have been ſaid forfeited, not <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcate,</hi> notwithſtanding his diſavowment.

                  <hi>Copihold <hi>(Tenura per Copiam Rotuli Curiae)</hi>
                  </hi> Is a Tenure for which the Tenant hath nothing to ſhew, but the <hi>Copy</hi> of the Rolls made by the Steward of his Lords Court. For, as the Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward enrols and makes Remembrances of all other things done in the Lords Court; ſo he does alſo of ſuch Tenants as are admitted in the Court, to any parcel of Land or Tenement belonging to the Mannor, and the Tranſcript of this, is called the <hi>Court-Roll,</hi> the <hi>Copy</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Tenant keeps, as his onely evidence. <hi>Coke, lib. 4. fol. 25. b.</hi> This is called a <hi>Baſe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure,</hi> becauſe it holds at the Will of the Lord. <hi>Kitchin, fol. 80. cap. Copiholds. Fitzh. (Nat. Br. fol.</hi> 12.) ſays, It was wont to be called <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure in Villenage,</hi> and that <hi>Copihold</hi> is but a new name; and yet it is not ſimply at the Will of the Lord, but according to the Cuſtom of the Mannor. So that if a <hi>Copiholder</hi> break not the Cuſtom of the Mannor, and thereby forfeit his Tenure, he ſeems not ſo much to ſtand at the Lords curteſie for his right, that he may be diſplaced at his pleaſure. Theſe Cuſtoms are infinite, varying in one point, or other, almoſt in every ſeveral Mannor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Copiholders</hi> do upon their Admittances, pay a Fine to the Lord of the Mannor, of whom the Lands are holden, which Fines are in ſome Mannors certain, in others incertain: Thoſe which are incertain, the Lord rates at what Fine he pleaſeth; but if it exceeds two years value, the Courts of <hi>Chancery, Kings Bench, Common Pleas,</hi> or <hi>Exchequer,</hi> have in their ſeveral Juriſdictions, power to reduce the Fine unto two years value.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Copiholds,</hi> are a kinde of Inheritance, and called in many places <hi>Cuſtomary;</hi> becauſe the Tenant dying, and the <hi>hold</hi> being void, the next of the Blood, paying the Cuſtomary Fine, as Two ſhillings for an Acre, or ſuch like, may not be denied his admiſſion. Secondly, ſome <hi>Copiholders</hi> have by Cuſtom, the Wood grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon their own Land, which by Law they could not have. Thirdly, Others hold? by the Verge in ancient Demeſns, and though they hold by <hi>Copy,</hi> yet are they in account a kinde of Freeholder; for if ſuch a one commit Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, the King hath <hi>Annum, diem &amp; vaſtum,</hi> as in caſe of Freehold; ſome others hold by Common Tenure, called <hi>Meer Copihold,</hi> whoſe Land, upon Felony committed, Eſcheats to the Lord of the Mannor. <hi>Kitchin, fol. 81.

                  <hi>Deodand <hi>(Deodandum)</hi>
                  </hi> Is a thing given or forfeited, as it were to God for the pacification of his Wrath, in a Caſe of Miſadventure, whereby a Chriſtian Soul comes to a violent end, without the fault of any reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. As, if a Horſe ſtrike his Keeper and kill him: If a Man, in driving a Cart, falls ſo, as the Cart-wheel runs over him, and preſſes him to death: If one be felling a Tree, and gives warning to the ſtanders by, to look to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet a Man is killed by the fall of it. In the firſt of theſe Caſes, the Horſe; in the ſecond, the Cart-wheel, Cart, and Horſes; and in the third, the Tree is to be <hi>given to God,</hi> that is, to be ſold and diſtributed to the Poor, by the Kings Almoner, for expiation of this dreadful event, though effected by unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, yea, ſenſleſs and dead creatures. <hi>Stamf.

                  <hi>Deoneranda pro rata portionis,</hi> Is a Writ that lies where one is diſtrained for a Rent, that ought to be paid by others propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably with him. For example, a Man holds ten Oxgangs of Land, by Fealty, and ten ſhillings Rent of the King, and aliens one Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gang thereof to one, and another to another in Fee: Afterward, the Sheriff or other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer diſtrains onely one of them for the Rent, he that is ſo diſtrained, may have this Writ for his relief. <hi>Fitz.

                  <hi>Enterplede</hi> (Fr. <hi>Entreplaider)</hi> Signifies to diſcuſs or try a Point incidently falling out, before the Principal Cauſe can be determined. For example, Two perſons being found Heirs to Land by two ſeveral Offices in one County, the King is brought in doubt, to which of them, Livery ought to be made; therefore before Livery be made to either, they muſt <hi>Enterplede,</hi> that is formally try between themſelves, who is the right heir. <hi>Stamf.

                  <hi>Entrie</hi> (Fr. <hi>Entree, i. Introitus, ingneſſus)</hi> Properly ſignifies the taking poſſeſſion of Lands or Tenements. See <hi>Plowden, Aſſize of Freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force in London, fol. 93. b.</hi> It is alſo uſed for a Writ of Poſſeſſion, for which ſee <hi>Ingreſſu;</hi> and read <hi>Weſt, pa. 2. Symbol. tit. Recoveries, ſect.</hi> 2, 3. who there ſhews for what it lies, and for what not. Of this <hi>Britton</hi> in his 114 Chapter writes to this effect. The Writs of Entry ſavor much of the Right of Property. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſome are to recover Cuſtoms and Services, in which are contained theſe two words <hi>(ſolet &amp; debet)</hi> as the Writs <hi>Quo Jure, Rationabilibus Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſis, Rationabili Eſtoverio,</hi> with ſuch like. And in this Plee of <hi>Entry</hi> there are three degrees: The firſt is, where a Man demands Lands or Tenements of his own Seiſin, after the term expired; the ſecond is, where one demands Lands or Tenements, let by another, after the Term expired; the third, where one demands Lands or Tenements of that Tenant, who had Entry by one, to whom ſome Anceſtor of the Plaintiff did let it for a Term now expired. According to which degrees, the Writs, for more fit remedy, are varied. And there is yet a fourth form, which is without degrees, and in caſe of a more remote Seiſin, whereunto the other three degrees do not extend. The Writ in the ſecond degree is called a Writ of Entry <hi>In le Per;</hi> in the third degree, a Writ of Entry <hi>In le per &amp; cui;</hi> and in the fourth form without theſe degrees, it is called a Writ of Entry <hi>In le poſt;</hi> that is, <hi>after</hi> the Diſſeiſin, which ſuch a one made to ſuch a one. And if any Writ of Entry be conceived out of the Right Caſe, ſo that one form be brought for another, it is abateable.</p>
               <p>In theſe four degrees, are comprehended all manner of Writs of Entry, which are without certainty and number. Thus far <hi>Britton,</hi> by whom you may perceive, that thoſe words <hi>Solet &amp; debet,</hi> and thoſe other, <hi>In le per, in le per &amp; cui,</hi> and <hi>In le Poſt,</hi> which we meet with many times in Books ſhortly and obſcurely mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſignifie nothing elſe but divers Forms of this Writ, applied to the Caſe, whereupon it is brought, and each Form taking its name from the words contained in the Writ. And of this read <hi>Fitz. Nat. Br. fol.</hi> 193.</p>
               <p>This Writ of <hi>Entry</hi> differs from an <hi>Aſſize,</hi> becauſe it lies for the moſt part againſt him, who entred lawfully, but holds againſt Law; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as an <hi>Aſſize</hi> lies againſt him that unlawfully diſſeiſed; yet ſometimes a Writ of <hi>Entry</hi> lies upon an Entruſion. <hi>Reg. of Writs, fol. 233. b.</hi> See the <hi>New Book of Entries, verbo Entre Br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> Is applied to all thoſe Lands and Tenements, which we hold by perpetual right, and by an acknowledgment of any ſuperiority to a higher Lord. Thoſe that write of this ſubject, divide all Lands and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nements, wherein a Man hath a perpetual eſtate to him, and his heirs, into <hi>Allodium</hi> and <hi>Feudum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Allodium</hi> is defined to be every Mans own Land, &amp;c. which he poſſeſſeth meerly in his own right, without acknowledgment of any ſervice or payment of any Rent to any other, and this is a property in the higheſt degree.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Feudum,</hi> is that which we hold by the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of another, and in the name whereof we ow Service, or pay Rent, or both, to a Superior Lord. And all our Land here in <hi>England</hi> (the Crown Land, which is in the Kings own hands, in right of His Crown excepted) is in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Feudum,</hi> or Fee: For though many have Land by deſcent from their Anceſtors, and others have dearly bought Land for their Money, yet is it of ſuch nature, that it cannot come to any, either by deſcent or purchaſe, but with the burthen that was laid upon him,

who had <hi>Novel Fee,</hi> or firſt of all received it, as a benefit from his Lord, to him, and to all ſuch, to whom it might deſcend, or any way be conveyed. So that there is no Man that hath <hi>Directum Dominium, i.</hi> The very Property or Demain in any Land, but the Prince, in right of His Crown. <hi>Camd. Britan. pag.</hi> 93. For, though he that hath Fee, hath <hi>Jus perpetuum &amp; utile Dominium,</hi> yet he ows a duty for it, and therefore it is not ſimply his own; which thing, I take thoſe words, we uſe for the expreſſing our deepeſt Rights in any Lands or Tenements, to import; for he that can ſay moſt for his eſtate, ſaith thus, <hi>I am ſeiſed of this, or that Land, or Tenement, in my Demain, as of Fee;</hi> and that is as much, as if he had ſaid, it is my Demain or Proper Land after a ſort, becauſe it is to me and my heirs for ever, yet not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply mine, becauſe I hold it in the nature of a benefit from another; yet the Stat. 37 <hi>Hen. 8. cap.</hi> 16. uſeth the word <hi>(Fee)</hi> of Lands inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Crown, but it proceeds from an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the nature of the word; for <hi>Fee</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without <hi>Fealty</hi> ſworn to a Superior, as you may read partly in the word <hi>Fealty,</hi> but more at large in thoſe that write <hi>De Feudis;</hi> and namely <hi>Hotoman,</hi> both in his <hi>Commentaries</hi> and <hi>Disputations;</hi> ſince no Man may grant, that our King or Crown oweth <hi>Fealty</hi> to any Superior, but God onely.

               <p>
                  <hi>Fee</hi> is divided into <hi>Fee abſolute,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Fee-ſimple,</hi> and <hi>Fee-conditional,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe termed <hi>Fee-tail. Fee-ſimple (Feudum ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex)</hi> is that whereof we are ſeiſed <hi>To us and our heirs for ever.

                  </hi> (Fr. <hi>Felonnie.)</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> ſayes, <hi>Ideo dicta eſt</hi> Felonia, <hi>quia fieri de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet felleo animo, lib. 4. fol. 124. b.</hi> We account any offence <hi>Felony</hi> that is in degree next <hi>Petit Treaſon,</hi> and compriſeth divers particulars, as <hi>Murder, Theft, Killing ones ſelf, Sodomy, Rape, Willful burning of Houſes,</hi> and divers ſuch like, which are to be gathered eſpecially out of the Statutes, whereby many offences are daily made <hi>Felony,</hi> which were not ſo before. <hi>Felony</hi> is diſcerned from lighter offences, in that the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment thereof is death: yet not alwayes; For <hi>petit Larceny,</hi> (which is the ſtealing any thing under the value of twelve pence) is <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony,</hi> as appears by <hi>Broke tit.

<pb facs="tcp:57644:61"/>
his reaſon is, becauſe the Inditement againſt ſuch a one muſt run with theſe words, <hi>Felonice cepit,</hi> yet not puniſhed by Death, though it be loſs of Goods. Other exception I know not, but that a Man may call that <hi>Felony,</hi> which is under Petit-Treaſon, and puniſhed by death: Of this there are two ſorts, one lighter, which, for the firſt time, may be relieved by <hi>Clergy,</hi> another that may not; which, may alſo be known by the Statutes; for, <hi>Clergy</hi> is allowed where it is not expreſly taken away.

See the <hi>New Book of Entries, verbo, Fines.</hi> And 27 <hi>Edw. 1. ſtat. 1. cap.</hi> 1. So that this <hi>Fine</hi> appears to be a Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition or <hi>Concord,</hi> acknowledged and recorded before a Competent Judge, touching ſome Hereditament, or thing immovable, that was in controverſie between the parties to the ſame <hi>Concord;</hi> and that, for the better credit of the tranſaction, it is by imputation made in the preſence of the King, becauſe levied in his Court; and therefore it bindes Women-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, being parties, and others whom ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Law diſables to tranſact, onely for this reaſon, That all preſumption of deceit or evil meaning is excluded, where the King and His Court of Juſtice are ſuppoſed to be privy to the Act.</p>
               <p>Originally the uſe of this <hi>Final Concord</hi> was inſtituted and allowed, in regard that, by the Law and ancient courſe of Proceedings, no Plaintiff (giving Real Security or Sureties, <hi>De clamore ſuo proſequendo,</hi> and being to be Fined or Amerced by the Judges, if he failed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, which, as appeareth by the Records of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt, were duly Eſtreated and certified into the <hi>Exchequer)</hi> could agree without Licenſe of the Court: So as <hi>Fines</hi> have been anciently levied in Perſonal Actions, and for no greater a ſum of Money then xi l. But ſubtilty of Wit and Reaſon, hath in time wrought other uſes of it, <hi>viz.</hi> To cut off <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails;</hi> and with more certainty to paſs the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt or title of any Land or Tenement, though not controverted, to whom we think good, either for years or in Fee. In ſo much as the paſſing a <hi>Fine,</hi> in moſt Caſes now, is but <hi>Mera fictio Juris,</hi> alluding to the uſe for which it was invented, and ſuppoſing an Action or Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, where in truth none is, and ſo not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly operating a preſent Bar, and Concluſion againſt the parties to the <hi>Fine,</hi> and their Heirs; but at five years end, againſt all others, not expreſly excepted (if it be levied upon good conſideration and without Covin) as Women<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covert, Perſons under Twenty one years, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, or ſuch as are out of the Realm, at the time of its acknowledging.

               <p>This <hi>Fine</hi> hath in it <hi>five</hi> eſſential Parts, 1. The <hi>Original Writ</hi> taken out againſt the Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizor. 2.

               <p>Touching the form of theſe <hi>Fines,</hi> it is to be conſidered, upon what Writ or Action the <hi>Concord</hi> is to be made, and that is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, upon a Writ of Covenant, and then there muſt firſt paſs a pair of Indentures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Cognizor and Cognizee, whereby the Cognizor Covenants with the Cognizee, to paſs a <hi>Fine</hi> to him, of ſuch and ſuch things, by a day limited: As theſe Indentures are firſt in this proceeding, ſo are they ſaid to lead the <hi>Fine.</hi> Upon this Covenant, the <hi>Writ of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> is brought by the Cognizee againſt the Cognizo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If the Writ, whereon the <hi>Fine</hi> is grounded, be not a Writ of Covenant, but of <hi>Warrantia Chartae,</hi> or a Writ of Right, or of Meſn, or of Cuſtoms and Services (for of all theſe <hi>Fines</hi> may alſo be founded, <hi>Weſt, ſect.</hi> 23.) then this Form is obſerved; the Writ is ſerved upon the party that is to acknowledge the <hi>Fine,</hi> and then he appearing, doth accordingly.

Manwood</hi> in his ſecond Part of <hi>Foreſt Laws, cap.</hi> 1. defines it thus. <hi>A</hi> Foreſt <hi>is a certain Territory of Woody Grounds, and Fruitful Paſtures, priviledged for Wilde Beaſts and Fowls of Foreſt, Chaſe, and Warren, to reſt in and abide, in the ſafe Protection of the King, for His Princely delight; meered and bounded with unremove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Marks, Meers and Boundaries, either known by Matter of Record or Preſcription; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with Wilde Beaſts of Venary or Chaſe, and with great Coverts of Vert, for ſuccor of the ſaid Beaſts. For preſervation and continuance of which place, with the Vert and Veniſon, there are certain particular Laws, Priviledges, and Officers, belonging onely thereto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Its properties are theſe: Firſt, A <hi>Foreſt,</hi> as it is truly and ſtrictly taken, cannot be in the hands of any, but the King; becauſe none hath power to grant Commiſſion to be a Juſtice in Eyre of the Foreſt, but the King. (Yet the Abbot of <hi>Whitby</hi> had a Foreſt by Grant of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, and King <hi>John,</hi> with all Officers incident thereto. 4 <hi>Inſt. fol. 305. &amp;</hi> 314.) The ſecond property is the Courts, as the <hi>Juſtice Seat,</hi> every three years; the <hi>Swain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote</hi> thrice every year, and the <hi>Attachment,</hi> once every forty days. The third, may be the Officers belonging to it, for preſervation of the Vert and Veniſon: As firſt, the <hi>Juſtices</hi> of the Foreſt, the <hi>Warden</hi> or Keeper, the <hi>Verderers,</hi> the <hi>Foreſters, Agiſtors, Regarders, Bailiffs, Bedels,</hi> and ſuch like, which ſee in their places.

This cuſtom was ſo kept, that the Sheriffs, at every County Court, did from time to time take the Oaths of young ones, as they grew to Fourteen years of age, and ſee, that they were ſetled in one <hi>Dozein,</hi> or another; whereupon this Branch of the Sheriffs Authority was called <hi>Viſus Franci-plegii,</hi> View of Frank-pledge.

                  <hi>Homage,</hi> (Fr.) Is derived from <hi>Homo,</hi> and is called <hi>Homage,</hi> becauſe when the Tenant does this ſervice, he ſays, <hi>I become your Man;</hi> It is alſo called <hi>Manhood,</hi> as the <hi>Manhood</hi> of his Tenant and the <hi>Homage</hi> of his Tenant is all one. <hi>Coke on Litt. fo.</hi> 64. In the Original Grants of Lands and Tenements by way of Fee, the Lord did not onely tye his Tenants to certain Services, but alſo took a ſubmiſſion with Promiſe and Oath to be true and loyal to him, as their Lord and Benefactor. This ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is called <hi>Homage,</hi> the form whereof you have in 17 <hi>Edw.</hi> 2. Stat. 2. in theſe words. <hi>When a freeman ſhall do Homage to his Lord, of whom he holds in chief, he ſhall hold his hands together between the hands of his Lord, and ſhall ſay thus,</hi> I become your man from this day forth for life, for mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and for worldly honour, and ſhall owe you my faith, for the Land I hold of you, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Faith that I owe unto our Soveraign Lord the King, and to mine other Lords. And in this manner the Lord of the Fee, for which <hi>Homage</hi> is due, takes <hi>Homage</hi> of every Tenant, as he comes to the Land or Fee. <hi>Glanv. lib. 9. ca.</hi> 1. except women, who perform not <hi>Homage,</hi> but by their Husbands (yet <hi>Fitz.</hi> in his <hi>Nat. Br. fol.</hi> 157. ſayes the contrary) becauſe <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi> ſpecially relates to ſervice in War. He ſays alſo, That Conſecrated Biſhops do no <hi>Homage,</hi> but onely fealty; the reaſon may be all one; yet the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> does <hi>Homage</hi> on his knees to our Kings at their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation; and, I have read, that the Biſhop of the Iſle of <hi>Man</hi> is Homager to the Earl of <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. Fulbec</hi> reconciles this, <hi>fol.</hi> 20. in theſe words; By our Law a Religious Man may do <hi>Homage,</hi> but may not ſay to his Lord, <hi>Ego de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venio homo veſter,</hi> becauſe he has profeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb facs="tcp:57644:75"/>
to be onely Gods Man; but, he may ſay, <hi>I do unto you homage, and to you ſhall be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and loyal.</hi> See <hi>Britton, ca.</hi> 68.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Homage</hi> is either new with the Fee, or <hi>ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrel. Homage</hi> is alſo uſed for the Jury in a Court Baron, becauſe it commonly conſiſts of ſuch as owe <hi>Homage</hi> to the Lord of the Fee. This <hi>Homage</hi> is uſed in other Countreys as well as ours, and was wont to be called <hi>Hominium.</hi> See <hi>Hotoman de verbis feud. verbo</hi> Homo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Homage aunceſtrel,</hi> Is, where a Tenant holds his Land of his Lord by <hi>Homage,</hi> and the ſame Tenant and his <hi>Anceſtors,</hi> (whoſe heir he is) have holden the ſame Land of the ſame Lord and his Anceſtors, whoſe heir the Lord is, time out of memory of man, by <hi>Homage,</hi> and have done them <hi>Homage;</hi> ſuch ſervice draws to it warrantry from the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus <hi>Littleton. In this example here put</hi> (ſays Sir <hi>Edward Coke) There muſt be a double preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, both in the blood of the Lord and of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and therefore, I think there is little or no land at all at this day holden by</hi> Homage ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrel: Yet, I have been credibly informed, that in the Mannor of <hi>Whitney,</hi> in <hi>Herefordſhire,</hi> whoſe Lord is of the ſame name, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily has been ſeated and continued there for many ages; is one <hi>Weſt</hi> a Tenant, who can perfectly preſcribe to hold his Land of <hi>Tho.

                  </hi> Is a delivery of poſſeſſion of Lands, Tenements, or other corporeal thing, (for, of things incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal no <hi>Livery of ſeiſin</hi> may be) to one that has right, or a probability of right thereto.

Traditio debet eſſe veſtita, &amp; non nuda.</hi> It is a Ceremony uſed in conveyance of Lands or Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nements, where an eſtate in Feeſimple, Feetayl, or a Freehold paſſeth; And, it is a teſtimonial of the willing departure of him, who makes the <hi>Livery,</hi> from the thing whereof <hi>Livery</hi> is made. And the receiving of the <hi>Livery</hi> is a willing acceptance by the other party of all that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the other hath deveſted himſelf. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon manner of delivery of Seiſin, is thus: If it be in the open Field, where is no Houſe, nor building, and if the eſtate paſs by Deed, one openly reads it or declares the effect of it, and after that is fealed, the Vendor takes it in his hands, with a clod of Earth upon a twig or bough, which he delivers to the Vendee, in the name of Poſſeſſion or Seiſin, according to the effect of the Deed: But if there be a Houſe or Building upon the Land, then this is to be done at the door of it, (none being left at that time within the houſe) and the Ring of the door delivered to the Vendee, who enters alone, ſhuts the door, and preſently opens it again. If it be a Houſe, without Land or Ground, the Livery is made, and Poſſeſſion taken by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of the Ring of the door, and Deed onely. And where it is without Deed, either of Lands or Tenements, there the party de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares by word of Mouth, before witneſſes, the eſtate he parts with, and then delivers Seiſin or Poſſeſſion in manner aſoreſaid: And ſo the Land or Tenement paſſeth as well as by Deed, and that by force of the <hi>Livery of Seiſin.</hi> See <hi>Weſt. par. 1.

After him, King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, in like manner aggrieved at other abuſes, not fully met with in the former Statutes, in the ſecond year of His Reign, <hi>cap. 3. &amp;</hi> 4. adds certain new Caſes, and lays upon the Offenders in them, the ſame puniſhment; whereto I refer you, as likewiſe to <hi>Anno 9 Ejuſdem, cap.</hi> 8. and 3 <hi>Hen. 5. cap.</hi> 4. and <hi>Smith de Repub. Angl. lib. 3. cap.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>Some later Statutes do caſt this puniſhment upon other Offenders, as namely the Statute of 1 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 1. upon him that denies the Kings Supremacy the ſecond time; and the Stat. 13 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 2. upon him that affirms the Authority of the Pope; or refuſeth to take the Oath of Supremacy; and the Stat. 13 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 1. upon ſuch as are Seditious talkers of the inheritance of the Crown, or affirm the Queen to be an Heretick. And the Stat. 13 <hi>Car. 2. cap.</hi> 1. upon ſuch as affirm the Parliament begun at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, 3 Nov.</hi> 1640. is not yet diſſolved, or that there is any obligation by any Oath, Covenant, or Engagement whatſoever, to endeavor a change of Government, either in Church or State, or that both or either Houſe of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have, or hath a Legiſlative Power with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the King. And the word is applied moſt commonly to the puniſhment firſt ordained by the Statutes before mentioned, for ſuch as tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed them: For where it is ſaid, that any Man for an offence committed, ſhall incur a <hi>Praemunire,</hi> it is meant, That he ſhall incur the ſame puniſhment, as is inflicted on thoſe that tranſgreſs the Stat. 16 <hi>Rich. 2. cap.</hi> 5. commonly called the Statute of <hi>Praemunire,</hi> which kinde of Reference or Application is not unuſual in our Statutes. As to the Etymology of the word, ſome think it proceeds from the <hi>ſtrength</hi> given to the Crown, by the former Statutes, againſt the uſurpation of forein power; which opinion may receive ſome ground from the Stat. 25 <hi>Edw. 3. ſtat. 6. cap.</hi> 1. But others think it grows from the Verb <hi>Praemonere,</hi> being bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly turned into <hi>Praemunire,</hi> to forewarn or bid the offender take keed; or from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity or grievouſneſs of the Puniſhment. Of which, a Reaſon may be gathered from the Form of the Writ, in <hi>Old Nat. Br. fol. 143. Praemunire facias praefatum praepoſitum &amp; J. R. procuratorem, &amp;c.
