         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <list>
               <item>I. WHether the <hi>Tories</hi> debauching the Sacrament to ſuch baſe and low ends, as to procure Licenſes for Ale-houſes, be any part of our Religion eſtabliſhed by Law?</item>
               <item>II. Whether the <hi>Tories</hi> by forcing the Diſſenters to come to Church, do make them any jot the more for the Church of <hi>England</hi> than they were before? and if not,</item>
               <item>III. Whether any man ever ſaw ſuch a deal of fooling for nothing? and yet,</item>
               <item>IIII. Whether Diſſenters ought not in Prudence (to prevent their own and the Nations ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine) rather play the fool with their Neighbours, and Conform, and truſt God with their Souls, than ſuch K—s with their Rights, Liberties and Eſtates, as gape after them.</item>
               <item>V. Whether the <hi>Tories</hi> are not more mad with Diſſenters for coming to Church, than they were for their going to Conventicles? and therefore,</item>
               <item>VI. The Diſſenters cannot go to Church out of Piety, yet whether they ought not to go out of ſpight?</item>
               <item>VII. Whether the Jews at <hi>Dukes-place,</hi> and the Papiſts all the Land over, are of the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on eſtabliſhed by Law, or it for them, for not one man of them ſuffers for their Diſſenting? and then,</item>
               <item>VIII. Whether it be not a notable <hi>Tory</hi>-Proteſtant-Religion eſtabliſhed by Law, that can be ſo kind to Jews and Papiſts, and ſo curſt only to Diſſenting-Proteſtants?</item>
               <item>IX. Whether any thing but a <hi>Tory</hi> Underſtanding could ever have thought that the only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to keep out Popery was to fall upon and ruine Proteſtants, and the beſt way to ſecure the Proteſtant Religion to make ſure of a Popiſh Prince?</item>
               <item>X. Whether the tender-hearted <hi>Tories</hi> (that cry out, God forbid that the <hi>D.</hi> of <hi>Y.</hi> ſhould ſuffer becauſe he differs in his Religion) are not the Engines that ſo barbarouſly Proſecute Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting-Proteſtants, becauſe they differ only in Religion?</item>
               <item>XI. Whether while the Prohibiting Act is in force, and our Church takes the Communion in Claret, we are of the Religion eſtabliſhed by Law?</item>
               <item>XII. Whether poor Parſon <hi>Duffee</hi> be not rather to be pittyed as a Fool than Puniſhed as a Knave, for his ſo unſeaſonable going to Maſs, juſt as the Maſs was coming to him.</item>
               <item>XIII. Whether the ſevere uſage of that Fop ought not to be a Warning to all his Tantive Brethren not to go before their Betters, nor like ill entered Whelps to yelp and open before their time?</item>
               <item>XIIII. Whether <hi>Roger Leſtrange</hi> did well con over his Politicks in ſnarling ſo horribly againſt the <hi>Trimmers?</hi>
               </item>
               <item>XV. Whether it be not enough to make a prudent man ſpew, to hear <hi>Hodge</hi> and his <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> tattle gravely of Policy and Religion?</item>
               <item>XVI. Whether any <hi>Tory</hi> in <hi>England</hi> be of any other Religion than the <hi>Tories</hi> in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>XVII. Whether any man ever truſted one <hi>Tory</hi> that did not betray him? and therefore,</item>
               <item>XVIII. Whether all true Engliſh-men do not now ſee (God be thanked) that <hi>Tories</hi> and Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors are terms Synonimous, and that the Divel is as ſoon to be truſted as they?</item>
               <item>XIX. Whether ever any <hi>Tory</hi> deſired any truſt from the People, for any other end than that by Betraying them he might make up his Market, and purchaſe to himſelf ſome place of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment?</item>
               <item>XX. Whether a <hi>Tory</hi> talks ſence of any other thing but of Drink and a Whore? and if not,</item>
               <item>XXI. Whether he were not better to keep to his own Tallent the Whore and the Bottle, than to make ſuch a bawling about Religion and Government, which he underſtands not?</item>
               <item>XXII. Whether it be not more than an equal Wager that our <hi>Tories</hi> are plum at a ſtand, and at ſuch an utter loſs, that the wiſeſt amongſt them cannot tell what ſtep to take next? and if ſo.</item>
               <item>XXIII. Whether the Government will not be finely brought to Bed, and handed down to Poſterity under a brave Reputation, that ſhall yield it ſelf up to the conduct of ſuch Bruits?</item>
