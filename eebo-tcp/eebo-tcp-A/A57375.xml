         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This 13. <hi>verse</hi> falls under the <hi>second branch,</hi> viz.
the <hi>Exhortation.</hi> The Psalmist <hi>exhorts</hi> to the Praises
of God, from two sorts of Motives especially, <hi>viz.</hi>
I. <hi>From</hi> Gods more General and Common <hi>Acts</hi> of
Providence, 1. To the Fatherless. 2. To the widows.
3. To the solitary. 4. To the Captives. <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5, 6.
II. <hi>From</hi> Gods more Special and Peculiar Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
towards his own People <hi>Israel:</hi> and this chiefly in
four observable intervalls of Time that came over
them, <hi>viz. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>to</hi> 19. In this last Particular note two things, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(1) <hi>The Preface</hi> to this matter of Praise and
Thankfulness for Gods Providential goodness which
should be to <hi>Israel</hi> in the daies of <hi>David,</hi> more then in
former times: <hi>Though ye have lien among the Pots,</hi> yet
shall ye be <hi>as the wings of a Dove covered with silver,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>ver.</hi> 13. That is: In the three former times, in <hi>Egypt</hi>
and the Wilderness, In <hi>Canaan,</hi> and Under the Iudges,
<hi>ye have lain as among the Pots,</hi> low, debased, blacked,
deformed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with many, and sore afflictions: But
now under <hi>Davids</hi> Dominion, especially under
Christs, <hi>ye shall be as Doves wings and feathers of sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
and golden colour:</hi> ye shall escape and be delivered,
ye shall be advanced to a more joyous, prosperous and
happy condition, and have better times then ever
formerly. Ye shall be taken from <hi>among the Pots,</hi> and
adorned with opposite Beauty and Glory.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The Particular Arguments</hi> inciting <hi>Israel</hi> to Praise
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50495:9"/>
and Thankfulness hereupon, are drawn, 1. <hi>From</hi> Gods
victoriousness over his enemies, to his Peoples pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity,
<hi>ver. 14. 2. From</hi> the Eminency and Fertility
of Gods Hill, <hi>Sion:</hi> especially of the Church of God
shadowed out by it, <hi>ver. 15. 3. From</hi> the Lords
constant Residence in, and Al-sufficient Protection
of, his own Hill, his Church and people, <hi>ver. 16, 17.
4. From</hi> Gods Triumph over all his, and his Peoples
enemies: which was to have its chief<note n="t" place="margin">Eph. 4. 8, &amp;c.</note> accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in <hi>IESUS CHRIST Ascending up into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,

stands the <hi>coherence:</hi> by which you may receive much
satisfaction touching the right <hi>meaning</hi> of the
words.</p>

out of their dark and black condition, and be made

and afflicted People shall not alwaies lie among the Pots, but

            </p>
            <p>Let me speak a little briefly to both these <hi>Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi>
which notably set forth the Diversity of Gods
dispensations towards his own people. As it were
the <hi>Checquer-work of Gods Providence</hi> to them, Their
<hi>Black</hi> and <hi>White</hi> conditions: God one while <hi>abasing</hi>
them by sullying Tribulations, and after <hi>advancing</hi>

               <p>That, Sometimes Gods Israel, Gods own
endeared People, may lie, as it were among the
Pots, in deepest Distresses and Afflictions.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Doctrinal Lesson</hi> is evidently fluent from the
<hi>first Branch</hi> of the <hi>Text.</hi> For Unfolding and Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

People being in deep Distresse and Afflictions, is like</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
among the Pots. 2. <hi>Why God suffers his Church and
dearest People sometimes thus to</hi> lie as among the Pots, <hi>in
deepest distresses and tribulations. 3. What Inferences may
readily result here upon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I. That, <hi>The lying of Gods endeared People in deepest
Distresses and Afflictions, is like</hi> lying among the Pots.
For,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>They that lie among the Pots are in a very low,
mean and abject condition;</hi> Scullions, of the meanest
rank, are wont in the Camp or Leaguer to lie among
the Pots: So they, that are in deep Distresses and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50495:12"/>
are in a very low, mean, and abject state, in
the eye of the world. <hi>Israel,</hi> in affliction, was in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

2. <hi>They that lie among the Pots are apt to be spotted,
fullyed, fouled, blacked with the Pots:</hi> So they that are
in deep affliction and distress are rendred in the eyes
of others, deformed, sullied, black, tanned, Sun-burnt,

                  <hi>Look not upon me because I am black, because
the Sun hath looked upon me.</hi> Great afflictions make the
very Church her self <hi>black,</hi> or <hi>blackish,</hi> and <hi>Sun-burnt;</hi>
how much more her particular members. Thus <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi>
lamented; <hi>Our skin was black like an Oven, because
of the terrible famine, Lam. 5. 10. The Nazarites visage
is blacker then a coal,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Lam.</hi> 4. 7, 8. yea our bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Saviour <hi>IESUS CHRIST</hi> himself was in his

his sore afflictions and sufferings;<note n="b" place="margin">Isa. 52. 14. &amp; 53. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>His visage was

               </p>
               <p>3. <hi>They that lie among the Pots, being deformed, sully<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and blacked, are wont to be slighted, despised, abhorred,
men look strange at them, are ashamed of their company,
cannot abide to come near them:</hi> So they that lie in deep
distress and misery, are usually neglected, despised and
rejected of others; yea oft-times their very kindred,
friends and familiar acquaintance are estranged from
them, and stand aloof from their calamity. Thus <hi>Job</hi>
in his extream afflictions complained;<note n="c" place="margin">Iob 19. 13. to 22.</note>—<hi>He
hath put my Brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance
are verily estranged from me. My kinsfolk have failed,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50495:13"/>
and my familiar friends have forgotten me. They that
dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
I am an alien in their sight. I called my servant,
and he gave me no Answer; I entreated him with my
mouth. My breath is strange to my wife: though I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
for the childrens sake of mine own body. Yea
young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against
me. All mine inward friends abhorred me: and they whom
I loved are turned against me.</hi> Thus <hi>Heman</hi> the <hi>Ezra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hite</hi>
in his sad afflictions lamenteth;<note n="d" place="margin">Psal. 88. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Lover and
friend hast thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance
into darkness.</hi> And, though our blessed Saviour <hi>bear,</hi>
not his own, but <hi>our griefs and our sorrows,</hi> yet even
for them he was exposed to extream contempt;<note n="e" place="margin">Isa. 53. 3, 4, 5, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>He
is despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with grief; and we hid as it were our faces from
him: he was despised, and we esteemed him not.</hi> Oh how
hard a thing is it for the dearest of Gods Saints to be
<hi>deeply distressed,</hi> and not to be <hi>greatly despised!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>II. But,</hi> Why is it, that the LORD suffers his
Church and his own endeared People, thus to lie sometimes,
<hi>as among the Pots,</hi> in deepest distresses and tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</p>
               <p>The <hi>LORD</hi> Permits, Orders, Directs and Over-powers
the sharp afflictions and distresses of his own
dear people for their Manifold Benefit. He lets them
<hi>lie among the Pots,</hi> then even this may turn to their
<note n="f" place="margin">Heb. 12. 10. Phil. 1. 19.</note> and<note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 8. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>co-operate for their good,</hi> for their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
good. For,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>By these,</hi> The sins and failings of Gods people
are more clearly detected. <hi>He with-draweth not his
eyes from the righteous:</hi>
                  <note n="h" place="margin">Iob 36. 7, 8, 9.</note>—<hi>And if they be bound
in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction: Then he
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50495:14"/>
sheweth them their work, and their transgressions, that
they have exceeded.</hi> The distress of<note n="i" place="margin">Gen. 41. 21, 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Josephs</hi> Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
in <hi>Egypt,</hi> revived afresh upon their consciences,
their old offences against <hi>Joseph;</hi> Afflictions awaken
their sleepy souls and drowsie consciences. As the
<hi>Suns Ecclipse</hi> is best discerned in water: Or as <hi>Blots</hi>
run most abroad in wet paper: so their sinful blots
and ecclipses are most evidently discovered in their
waters of affliction.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>By these,</hi> They are more throughly melted and
humbled for their sinful failings discovered. The
<hi>fire</hi> melts the mettle in the furnace, that it will run
into any mould. When<note n="k" place="margin">2 Chron. 32. 24, 25, 26.</note> 
                  <hi>wrath was upon</hi> good

of God! That Phoenix King<note n="l" place="margin">2 Chron 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Judgements of God but hanging over their
heads for sin, in the clouds of the threatnings.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>By these,</hi> their spots, stains and sins, Detected and
Lamented, are very notably cleansed, rubbed out, and
purged away,<note n="m" place="margin">Isa. 27. 8, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>By this shall the iniquity of</hi> Jacob <hi>be

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God Promised deliverance to</hi> Abrahams <hi>seed out of

                  <note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 15. 13, 14, 16.</note>—Know of a
Surety, that thy seed shall be a stranger in a Land that is

four hundred years. And also that Nation, whom they
shall serve, will I judge: and afterwards shall they come
out with great substance.—But in the fourth Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they shall come hither again, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the daies of</hi> Asaph <hi>and</hi> David <hi>God Promised to
his people:</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Psalm 50. 15.</note> — Call upon me in the day of
trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorifie

known my name. He shall call upon me, and I will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
him: I will be with him in trouble, I will deliver him
and honour him. <hi>How sweet also is the Promise in my
present Text,</hi> Psal. 68. 13. <hi>In the daies of</hi> Isaiah;
<note n="e" place="margin">Isa. 54. 6. to the end.</note>—The LORD hath called thee as a woman
forsaken and grieved in Spirit, and a wife of youth, when
thou wast refused, saith thy God. For a small moment
have I forsaken thee, but with great mercies will I gather
thee. In a little wrath I hid my face from thee, for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50495:20"/>
on thee, saith the LORD thy Redeemer.—Oh,
thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
I will lay they stones with fair colours, and lay thy foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
with Saphires, and I will make thy windows of
Agats, and thy Gates of Carbuncles, and all thy borders
of pleasant stones, <hi>&amp;c. Oh</hi> what manner of stones <hi>are
here promised for raising of this building! What
manner of expressions are here to set forth this delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and restauration! Thus their escape,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>is
certain by Gods faithful</hi> Promises.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>By Gods Peoples frequent Experiences in all Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,</hi>
this their escape out of all their blacking
troubles, is also very evident. We read much of their

               <p>III. How, and in what way doth God take his People
from the Pots, deliver them from their distresses and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The Lord effects and brings this about, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously,
and sometimes very mysteriously. As,</p>
               <p>1. Oft-times by Transmutations of his Peoples conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>How oft doth he literally in this life Turn, their</hi>
darkness <hi>into</hi> light, <hi>their</hi> sorrow <hi>into</hi> joy, <hi>their</hi> sickness
into health, <hi>their</hi> pain <hi>into</hi> ease, <hi>their</hi> poverty <hi>into</hi> riches,
<hi>their</hi> bondage <hi>into</hi> liberty, <hi>their</hi> adversity <hi>into</hi> prosperity,
<hi>their</hi> trouble <hi>into</hi> triumph, <hi>their</hi> miseries <hi>into</hi> mercies!
&amp;c. <hi>As</hi> Iosephs <hi>bondage into Lordship;</hi> Iobs <hi>Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

health, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Sometimes by disarming their afflictions and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi>
This is an excellent way: when the sting, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom,
mischief, malignity, &amp;c. of affliction is taken
out and suspended. In such case, Gods people may be
visibly in a state of affliction, and yet un-afflicted.

                  <hi>Daniel</hi> was in the Lyons Den, but had no hurt by

                  <note n="r" place="margin">Dan. 3. 25, 27.</note> The <hi>three Jews</hi> were in the fiery

                  <hi>Behold ye

of their sting, venom and malignity.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Sometimes, by Remedying of one Affliction or

to deliver his people out of one affliction by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

He had been buried, if he had not been bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.
The bottom of the Sea had been his grave, if

the Pots of darkest fullying miseries, most patiently bear
their present pressures, and hopefully wait for their desired
Deliverance.</hi> They shall be taken from <hi>among the Pots,</hi>
they<note n="p" place="margin">Psal. 68. 13.</note> shall be <hi>as the wings of a Dove covered with

that believes makes not haste. The Lords time of
Relaxation will come: and his Time is the best time.
He doth all things <hi>in number, weight and measure.</hi>
Theres no Contradicting, Diverting or Directing of
him in his proceedings. He knows best when, where
and how to deliver his distressed ones. Be their suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings

escape, either <hi>from</hi> death, or <hi>by</hi> death: either
<hi>in this world,</hi> to partake sweet temporany felicity; or
<hi>in the world to come,</hi> to enjoy sweetest everlasting glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
Therefore patiently bear and<note n="q" place="margin">Habak. 2. 3, 4. Heb. 10. 35. to 39.</note>

               <p>3. <hi>Hence, Finally,</hi> This may much calm and quiet
their Spirits whose near Relations lie among the Pots: and
also may excite their hearts to unfeigned thankfulness,
whose endeared friends are released from distress and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
to enjoy the contrary felicity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Are your dear Allies in deep Afflictions, much blacked
and disfigured as among the Pots?</hi> You bleed in their
sufferings, and are exceedingly distressed upon their
Extremities. Yet compose your selves, <hi>Theres hope in
Israel concerning this.</hi> Such as belong to God, one way
or other shall have deliverance: either <hi>from</hi> death, or
<hi>by</hi> death. Remember this and like Promises, and
quiet your hearts;<note n="r" place="margin">Psalm 68. 13. Gen. 15. 13, 14, 16 Psal. 50. 15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 91. 14, 15. Isa. 54 6. to the end.</note>

pains and miseries then many others; Yet now she
hath obtained a full Release. And, so holy was her
Life, so constant her Faith, so stedfast her Patience to
the end, and so great her interest in God; that we
have no cause to doubt, of her coelestial Felicity,
or of her present Triumphs in Glory. It is true, Our
<hi>loss</hi> is great: But her <hi>gain</hi> is incomparably greater.
Her <hi>Husband</hi> hath lost a Dear, a Sweet, a Comfortable
Yoke-fellow; Her <hi>Children</hi> have lost, a Tender, a
Careful, and Compassionating Mother; Her <hi>Allyes</hi>
have lost a Faithful and Sincere-hearted Friend; The

among all these losses, she hath lost all her Diseases,
all her Pains, all her Sighs and Groans, all her Tears,
all her Sorrows and Sufferings, all her Troubles and
Temptations, and all her sins. But Oh how much
