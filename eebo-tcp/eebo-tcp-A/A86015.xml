         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He mind of man deſtitute of Gods Grace,
doth (like untilled ground) luxuriate into
wickedneſſe and vanity, being very prone
to cloſe with the ſuggeſtions of the grand
adverſary of his ſoul: yea, though he hath
had ſome taſte of the things that are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
yet ſuch is his courteſie, that he will be
ſeeking after novelties. Old truths (like the <hi>Manna</hi> to the
<hi>Iſraelites</hi> after a conſtant and continued falling of it) become
nauſeous: the truth hereof hath been found in all ages by la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
experience, but eſpecially in theſe our dayes, which
have been as fruitfull of new opinions in matters of Religion, as
<hi>Africa</hi> it ſelf of Monſters.</p>
            <p>Some (though few in compariſon) God is pleaſed to recall,
who have gone aſtray in this kind, and to bring them to a
clear ſight of their folly, of which number I (by Gods Grace
towards me) am one: I deſire to acknowledge him in it, and
to give him the praiſe of it, and think my ſelf bound in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
as a teſtimony of my thankfulneſſe to God for my delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
to declare it to the World, that ſo others may hear and
fear, and take warning by my example. They who have been
lately in the Northern parts of <hi>England,</hi> cannot be ignorant how
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:150070:3"/>
prevalent the impoſture of Quaking hath been for theſe nine or
ten Moneths laſt paſt, in which ſnare I my ſelf (among many
poor deluded ſouls) was taken in <hi>May</hi> laſt 1653, though by
Gods goodneſs tovvards me the ſnare is broken, and I am eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
a true account vvhereof take as follovveth.</p>
            <p>I being deſirous to aſſociate my ſelf vvith this Faction at their
Meeting, and to hear ſome of them ſpeak (to uſe their ovvn ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion)
acquainted one of their ovvn vvith it, <hi>viz. George Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>
of <hi>Kendale,</hi> vvho gave me great encouragement herein from
his ovvn experience, of much advantage received by him in that
vvay: Whereupon I vvent ſoon after to their Meeting at <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
Newby's</hi> houſe, where I ſtaid about two hours (<hi>viz.</hi> from
eight til ten at night) where <hi>Chriſtopher Atkinſon</hi> was Speaker,
whoſe drift was to deny all Miniſteriall teaching and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
together with all notionall knowledge formerly gained
by uſe of ſuch means, to become as though we had never learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any thing thereby ſavingly, and to lay a new ground work,
<hi>viz.</hi> to be taught of God within our ſelves by vvaiting upon an
invvard light, vvhich (as they aſſert) lies lovv hidden under
the earth, <hi>viz.</hi> the old man vvhich is of the earth, earthy.
Hereupon I reſolved to cloſe vvith them, after vvhich time I
vvas afraid to read any good Books, or hear any preaching Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,
or call to remembrance any thing vvhich I had formerly
learned out of Gods Word concerning God or Chriſt, or mine
ovvn eſtate, or any other ſubject contained in Scripture: for I
vvas perſvvaded by their teaching, that vvhatſoever I had lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
out of Gods Word by hearing, reading, catechifing, &amp;c. vvas
but notionall, carnall, and hanging upon the Tree of Knovvledg:
in vvhich condition vvhilſt I abode, they affirmed me to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Curſe, applying this expreſſion, though very impertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Curſed is every one that hangeth on the Tree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, going a ſecond time to one of their Meetings at
<hi>Edmond Newbyes,</hi> I had ſome conference by the vvay vvith
ſome of themſelves vvhich vvent vvith me, amongſt other blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies
one <hi>Robert Colliſon</hi> affirmed, that Chriſt vvas as man,
had his failings, for he diſtruſted God (quoth he) upon the croſs,
vvhen he cryed out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi>
to vvhom I anſvvered, that then he ſuffred as as an evil doer, &amp; ſo
could not purchaſe redemption for us: after this coming home, he
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:150070:3"/>
who then was Speaker, urged us to take up the Groſſe daily, and
to abide under it; ſaying, <hi>Carry the Croſſe all day, and it will
keep thee at night:</hi> that this would keep us low and humble,
and kill and make alive: further he endeavoured to perſwade his
Auditors to hearken to a voice within them, teaching that Gods
voice was a ſtill voice; after which I reſolved in my thoughts
to wait for the manifeſtation of theſe things within my ſelf.</p>
            <p>After a while, going a third time to their meeting, as I went I
was ſomewhat troubled in my thoughts at the remembrance of
that hideous blaſphemy uttered by the party before named,
whereupon I ſpake publickly to them at their meeting concerning
it, telling them that I would not any further joyn with them if
they were all of that mind, to which ſom of them (after much
whiſpering) anſwered negatively, wiſhing me not to let it trouble
me; for he which ſpake ſo to me was not rightly called; with
which anſwer I was at preſent ſatisfied, and did adhere to my
former reſolution. Not long after I went to another Meeting
upon a Lords Day, at <hi>Robert Colliſons</hi> houſe in <hi>Kendale,</hi> where
the aforeſaid <hi>Atkinſon</hi> was Speaker, who beginning about nine
a clock in the forenoon, continued till three in the afternoon,
in which time he ſpake much (according to his uſuall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner)
of the great experience which he had of God from the
light within him, which light I not finding to be in my ſelf,
was very much troubled, apprehending my condition to be very
bad, finding nothing but blindneſſe and hardneſſe, yet I ſtill
expected the appearance of that light within me, and earneſtly
deſired that I might fall into quaking and trembling, apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that I ſhould thereby attain to the immediate diſcoveries
of God unto me. Upon my departure from thence, I peruſed
a Pamphlet ſet forth by ſome of the ſame Faction being in <hi>York</hi>
Caſtle, the main ſcope of it vvas againſt the Miniſtry; immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
after vvalking in my Bed-chamber, I began (as I have
formerly deſired) to tremble and quake ſo extreamly, that I
could not ſtand upon my feet, but vvas conſtrained to fall dovvn
upon my bed, vvhere I hovvled and cryed (as it is uſuall vvith
them) in a terrible and hideous manner, to the great aſtoniſhment
of my Family: Nevertheleſſe I my ſelf vvas not at all affected
with fear, becauſe it was a ſatisfaction to my former deſires, and I
looked upon it as the beginning of the pangs of the nevv birth,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:150070:4"/>
and expected that the iſſue of it would be good; when I had
continued about half an hour in that condition, I ceaſed from
howling and crying gradually; after which I roſe up again
beginning to rejoyce, thinking with my ſelf that now I could
bear witneſſe againſt the Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> as falſe Prophets
and Prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi> becauſe I never found ſuch affects and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
upon me by ſo long continuance under their Miniſtery:
After this, going to bed, I was much troubled all that night fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
in my ſleep with dreams concerning my condition, and
had a diſcovery of my ſins in particular, eſpecially of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſſe,
the Devill working ſtrongly upon my imagination;
I apprehended that all ſin was about to be hewed down, and
rooted up in me, and (to my apprehenſion) the ſin of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſſe
had great long roots which did viſibly appear to
me when it was rooted up: Afterwards lying awake, and
thinking upon the dreams and viſions <hi>I</hi> had formerly been trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with <hi>I</hi> ſenſibly perceived ſome thing (as <hi>I</hi> imagined) light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on my neck, giving me a great ſtroak which cauſed much
pain to me, and after that another which was leſſe then the
firſt, and ſo a third and fourth, each ſtroak being leſſe then the
former, and each ſtroke deſcending lower down, till it came to
the middle of my back, and then <hi>I</hi> thought ſomething entered
into my body, which <hi>I</hi> perſwaded my ſelf (from Satans inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
to be the Spirit of God decending upon me like a Dove
and entring into me, whereupon <hi>I</hi> heard (in my conceit) a voice
within me ſaying, <hi>It is day;</hi> whereupon, looking up and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
it to be light, <hi>I</hi> anſwered, <hi>Yes:</hi> the voice replyed twice
over to me, and ſaid, <hi>as certain as it is light, ſo certainly ſhall
Chriſt give thee light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this <hi>I</hi> continued two or three dayes waiting for further
diſcoveries of light within me, being rapt up into an extaſie of
exceſſive joy, and ſometimes again exceedingly dejected with
fears and doubts of my condition, whether it were really good,
or <hi>I</hi> were under Satans deluſions: yet ſtill <hi>I</hi> waited for further
manifeſtations, and walking into the Garden, lying down upon
the ground with my face towards the earth, my right hand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
extreamly to ſhake, ſo as I could not hold it ſtill, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whereof whilſt I was wondring what it ſhould be, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
my ſelf as being ſhaken by the hand, I was brought
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:150070:4"/>
into another rapture of great joy, imagining it to be a figure of
my ſpirituall Marriage and Union with Chriſt. Then preſently
I was by the power within me raiſed, and ſet upon my feet, and
by the ſame power turned and laid upon my back, with my face
towards the skie; at which time all my ſins particularly were
again brought into my memory, and at the remembrance of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſin, my hand was carried round about with giving a little pat
upon the ground, and then I imagined I heard a voice ſaying,
<hi>Now ſuch a ſin is mortified:</hi> after which I being perſwaded by
it, that all my ſins were mortified by it one by one, the power
that I was then acted by, permitted me to ariſe up again of my
ſelf, ſaying unto me, <hi>Ask whatſoever thou wilt of the Father in
my Name, and he wil give it thee:</hi> I replied, I know not what
to ask, and therefore deſired that power to teach me what I
ſhould ask: He anſwered me again, and bid me ask <hi>Wiſdome
in the firſt place:</hi> Whereupon I deſired alſo that God would
give me ſuch things as were moſt for his glory and the good of
others: whereunto the power anſwered, <hi>that my request was
granted, and that I ſhould alſo be indued with the gift of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
and ſinging praiſes to God:</hi> Wherewith being ſatisfied, I
went to another Meeting within an hour after, at <hi>William Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings</hi>
houſe in <hi>Kendale,</hi> which was the fifth and laſt Meeting
that I was at with them, where <hi>Chriſtopher Atkinſon</hi> being
Speaker, I was much more affected with what he ſpake then
formerly, as being able more inwardly to witnes in part what he
ſpoke. After he had done, and a litle pauſe had, the company roſe
up, as if they had been ready to depart, I my ſelf was ready to go
away with the firſt, but the Wife of the houſe (<hi>Iſa. Didding</hi>)
took me by the hand, and wringing it very hard, bade me ſit
down again, which I did, and preſently after one <hi>John Audland</hi>
ſtood up, and began to ſpeak, ſaying, <hi>Cannot you watch one hour?</hi>
and ſo proceeded after the uſuall manner. In the time of his
ſpeaking, I was by the power within me, drawn from the chair
upon which I ſat, and throwne upon the ground in the midſt
of the Company, where Play all night: all which time my
body and all the members of it were ſtill in motion, I being
turned from my back to my belly, and ſo back again ſeverall
times, and making croſſes continually with my legs one
over the other, my hands alſo were carried to and fro upon the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:150070:5"/>
ground by a compulſive power, as if <hi>I</hi> had been writing upon the
ground: in all which actions and motions, <hi>I</hi> acted not in the
leaſt meaſure by a naturall power of mine own, neither did <hi>I</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,
or could <hi>I</hi> reſiſt that power which acted me, but was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
paſſive; <hi>I</hi> was perſwaded that it was the immediat pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Chriſt, and heard to my thinking a voice ſpeaking to me
and ſaying, <hi>that that writing with my hand upon the ground, did
ſignifie the writing of the Law within my heart.</hi> Having layn
all night upon the ground in the manner aforeſaid, the power
(as before in other actions) moved my hands to my head, and
laid them upon the top thereof faſt cloſed together, whereupon
<hi>I</hi> heard a voice ſaying, <hi>Chriſt in God, and God in Chriſt, and
Chriſt in thee:</hi> which words <hi>I</hi> was compelled to ſing forth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Company in a ſtrange manner, and with ſuch a voice as
was not naturally mine own: <hi>I</hi> ſung alſo divers phraſes of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
which were given into me: after which <hi>I</hi> was raiſed from
the ground, and ſet upon my feet by the power within me, which
bade me be humble, and brought me down again upon my knees,
and with a whiſpering voice ſaid to me, <hi>ſtoop low, low:</hi> and
having ſtooped neer the ground with my face, it ſaid to me,
<hi>Take up thy croſſe and follow me:</hi> Whereupon ariſing I was led
out of the houſe (by the back door) down to the River, and
back again from thence into the Town another way, where I
was ſenſibly drawn down the ſtreet, and cauſed ſuddenly to turn
aſide to a door of an houſe (my ſelf not knowing who lived in
it) two of the ſaid Company following me all the time, <hi>viz.</hi>
William <hi>Dodding,</hi> and <hi>John Audland,</hi> and ſeeing me to go to
that door, ſaid, <hi>Whither wilt thou go? this is the fidlers houſe:</hi>
I anſwered, <hi>whoſe houſe ſoever it be, Chriſt leads me hither, and
hither I muſt go:</hi> whereupon my hand was carried to knock at
the door, and commanded by a voice to ſay; <hi>Behold, Chriſt
ſtands at the door and knocks:</hi> after a while the Fidler ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and I was led into the houſe, not ſpeaking any thing unto
him, where my hand was carried to a Bace-violl hanging up in
the houſe: I took it down and began to play upon it with
my fingers, and was immediately compelled to fall a-dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
which I ſeldome or never in all my life did before:
Whereupon I queſtioned what power it ſhould be that carried
me forth to ſuch actions, to which the voice within me replied,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:150070:5"/>
               <hi>This is not becauſe I love muſick, for I hate it, but to ſignifie unto
thee what joy there is in heaven at thy converſion; as alſo what ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
melody thou ſhalt have hereafter:</hi> then I was led out of the
houſe into the ſtreet, and ſo carried along through the Town, being
moved to proclaim as I went, <hi>I am the way the truth and the life,</hi>
with other expreſſions to like purpoſe; after which I was brought to
mine own houſe, the aforeſaid <hi>William Dodding</hi> going along with
me, acknowledged that he had no power to leave me all this time;
being come home, the ſame power would not ſuffer me to reſt, but
caſt me upon the ground, and cauſed me to make circles round about
the houſe with my hand, with many the like actions, telling me,
<hi>that I was putting off the old man:</hi> my hand alſo was carried to
take up a ſtone which lay upon the floor (which in my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
was in the form of a mans heart (the voice within me
telling me, <hi>that Chriſt had taken that ſtone out of mine heart,
and given me an heart of fleſh,</hi> and my hand was moved to
hold it forth to the ſpectators, and my tongue to utter this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
<hi>except you ſee ſignes and wonders you will not beleeve;</hi>
and throwing the aforeſaid ſtone amongſt them, I ſaid; <hi>Lo here
is my heart of ſtone;</hi> afterwards, being caſt upon the ground
upon my back, the voice ſpeake to me, ſaying, <hi>thou ſhalt have
two Angels to keep thee,</hi> whereupon immediately two Swallows
deſcended down the Chimney, and ſat upon a ſhelf over againſt
the place where I lay: this others in the houſe beſides my ſelf
beheld, and I cried to them, <hi>my Angels, my Angels,</hi> being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
that they were Angels from Heaven, and that it was a
fulfilling the promiſe; I held out my hand towards them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
they ſhould have come to me, but they did not, but aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
up the Chimney, though both the door and the window
were open.</p>
            <p>I was alſo by the ſame power carried out of doores upon my
hands and knees into the ſtreet, which my Wife and others ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
endeavoured to hinder me, but I told them I would not be
hindered, but leave Wife, Children, and all to follow Chriſt: in
this manner I went up the ſtreet, thinking that I bore a Croſſe
upon my neck, and continued in this motion till ſome pulled me
out of the mire and dirt, and by force carried me into the houſe
again; whereupon I was moved to point to one of them which
brought me in, and to ſay to her, <hi>Chriſt points at thee, thou
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:150070:6"/>
art a wicked woman, and haſt hindered the work of the Lord;</hi> then
the voice asked me where my Croſſe was, telling me I had ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
it, whereupon I was moved to make a Croſſe with my finger
upon the floor, and forced to ſet my head upon it, playing topſie
turvie, or bull necks thinking then I had re-taken up my Croſſe: in
theſe actions I was kept a long while, having many Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
given in, to the admiration of all that heard me; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
I was forced to leap and dance, this expreſſion being given
in to me, <hi>Now I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me
to do,</hi> thinking then my Redemption fully accompliſhed; but
my joy continued not, for I was caſt down again, and the voice
told me, <hi>I had offended God, in attributing that to my ſelf
which was proper to Chriſt;</hi> whereupon I was caſt upon the ground,
and lying upon my belly, I was forced to lick the duſt, and my
hand carried to ſtrike extraordinarly upon my head, having a
voice given me, <hi>that no ſin muſt go unpuniſhed;</hi> ſo creeping up
and down the houſe, I heard a voice, ſaying, <hi>where is thy Croſſe?</hi>
upon which looking aſide, I thought I ſaw a viſible Croſſe hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a thread, which with my hand I put behind my neck; I was
kept in theſe poſtures all that day till evening, when many Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
came in to me, who ſpake nothing but thus, <hi>Be lowly, mind
thy condition, and hearken to the voice within,</hi> not giving any
words of comfort or reproof, or putting up any Petition at all for
me, but departed, leaving me in this condition; my ſtrength being
almoſt ſpent, and my body much conſumed by continuall reſtleſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
Two of them offered to watch with me that night, but I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed,
telling them I was well, whereupon they departed. After
this, my Wife and Family being gone to bed, I being alone in the
houſe, began to re-collect my ſelf, and to queſtion whether that
power by which I had been ſo ſtrangly acted, were Divine or Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall?
whereupon I was immediately ſtruck with a pannick
fear, and my hand was carried to take up a Knife which lay upon
the Table, which being done, my hand was carried with it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
my throat, and the voice ſaid to me, <hi>open a hole there, and I
will give thee the words of eternall life;</hi> whereupon I anſwered,
<hi>what with a Knife?</hi> and ſo threw the Knif away, being confident it
was a temptation, from which I deſire God to deliver me: My
Wife being in bed in the next room, and hearing me ſpeak when
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:150070:6"/>
none was with me, came out, and deſired me to go to bed, which
I did at her entreaty: all the night following I was fully reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that it was the Devils power that had acted me all along for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
and was perſwaded that I was really poſſeſt with a Devill,
which muſt be ejected; and in the morning I verily thought that
a Devill went out of me, at which inſtant I roared very hideouſly,
crying, <hi>now is the Devil gone out of me,</hi> at which inſtant I and my
Family heard it thunder, (though none in the Town beſides heard
it) which made me think it was the Devill, <hi>he being the Prince
of the power of the air;</hi> ſoon after the ſame power came under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
notion, and told me, <hi>that it was Satan that had poſſeſt and led
me heretofore, but now Chriſt was come, and he by his power had
caſt out Satan, and convinced me, that what ever I had done the
day before was in obedience to Satan, and that as I had ſerved the
Divell all the day before in my clothes, ſo that day I muſt undo all
that I had formerly done, onely in my ſhirt in Obedience to Chriſt:</hi>
which immediately I endeavoured, riſing out of my bed, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the ſtreet with my ſhirt onely; but my Wife and others
ſoon laid hold upon me, and ſtopt me: whereupon the power
within me told me, <hi>that I muſt be carried into the houſe with four
Women, as I had been the day before, or elſe I ſhould perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
ſtand there like a pillar of Salt, as</hi> Lots <hi>Wife did:</hi> So I
was born in by four Women, who carried me again into my bed,
which being done, I told them, <hi>I had been doing the Devils work
the day before, but to day I muſt do the work of Chriſt,</hi> and pointing
at a Woman whom I had pointed at the day before, ſaid theſe
words, <hi>the Devil told me yeſterday that you were a wicked woman,
but now Chriſt tels me that you are Gods ſervant;</hi> the woman being
departed, I fell to acting in my ſhirt only, upon the bed, as I had
done formerly upon the houſe floor, playing topſie turvie from one
bed to another, whereby I might have undon my ſelf; but the power
which acted me, bid me not fear, <hi>for I will give thee ſtrength.</hi> After
this the power told me, <hi>that the devil had the other day commanded
me to bear my croſſe, but now Chriſt commands thee to lay aſide thy
Croſſe, for Chriſt takes no pleaſure in Croſſes, nor will he have me
worſhip them, as yeſterday I had done:</hi> Further, the power ſaid
to me, <hi>the devill made thee yeſterday to ly all day upon the ground,
but now I have provided a bed for thee,</hi> giving in this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to me, <hi>My yoke is eaſie;</hi> promiſing alſo, <hi>to give me bread
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:150070:7"/>
of life to eat, and water of life to drink, and that out of my bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhould flow Rivers of living water;</hi> whereupon my teeth
were cauſed to move, as if I had been eating; and I thought I felt
in my belly, a flowing up and down as of waters, I was alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,
that yeſterday the Devils Angels had waited on me, but
now Chriſts Angels ſhould guard me; whereupon I ſaw two
Butter-flies in the window, to which my hand was carried, and
having taken one of them in my hand, I was moved by the
power within me to put it into my mouth, and did ſwallow it
down into my body, which having done, I took the other in my
hand, and was moved to put it to my throat, the power telling
me, <hi>it ſhould enter in there,</hi> ſaying, <hi>nothing is impoſſible to them
that beleeve.</hi> After this I was cauſed to make circles upon the
bed, as I had done formerly upon the ground; whereupon I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to think that this was not of God, and ſo began to reſiſt the
power by which I was acted, and thereupon fell into great fear
and doubting, crying out, <hi>Lord what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> but
the power told me, <hi>that it was too late to cry unto God, for ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
was already pronounced againſt me;</hi> whereupon I lay down
in my bed much deſpairing, and was then convict, that it was
the devill which had again deluded me; in which condition ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
laien a ſhort ſpace, I was again aſſaulted by a power the third
time, which told me, <hi>that it was a white devill that had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
me the latter time, but now Chriſt was come indeed, and
he would cast him out,</hi> whereupon I apprehended that Devill alſo
to be ejected; after which, as I lay in my bed, all the members of
my body fell a working, as if the pangs of death had been upon me,
the power telling me, <hi>that it was the pangs of the new birth, and that
Chriſt was new born in me,</hi> with which I was ſomewhat ſatisfied,
lying in that condition a whole day; in which time the power per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
me, <hi>that I ſhould work wonders, and caſt out devils in his
name:</hi> ſoon after two Quakers came to me, <hi>viz. Geo. Bayley</hi> and <hi>J.
Braham,</hi> whom I told that I had two devils caſt out of me, but now
Chriſt was in me for a truth; then the power (pretending to be Chriſt)
ſaid theſe words, <hi>I was crowned with a Crown of thornes, but I will
crown thee with a crown of glory,</hi> and bad me (as a figure thereof) <hi>to
ſet my fiſt upon my head, and it ſhould appear to the ſtanders by as a
glorious crown, though I ſaw nothing my ſelf,</hi> which having done, I
ſpake to the ſtanders by, ſaying, <hi>what do you ſee?</hi> whereunto they
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:150070:7"/>
gave me no anſwer (being Quakers) but turned their eyes another
way, the power telling me, <hi>that they ſaw the crown upon my head;
but were ſo ſtrucken with admiration, that they could not expreſſe
what they ſaw;</hi> immediately the power bad me tell one of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
then preſent, <hi>that he had a devil in him, and that I ſhould have
power to caſt him out;</hi> whereupon I ſaid to him, <hi>G. thou haſt a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
within thee,</hi> the power told me he ſhould <hi>quake and tremble,</hi>
which immediately he did; the power bad me ſpeak to him <hi>to fall
flat upon the ground,</hi> which he did, and after a little ſpace roſe again,
and I asked him whether <hi>the devil were gone out of him</hi> (having
been before perſwaded by the power that I ſhould caſt him out) to
which he gave me no anſwer, but the power told me <hi>that the
Devil was ejected.</hi> I was told alſo by the ſame power who (of
thoſe that came to ſee me) <hi>had devils and who not; and that my
Wife, and my Mother had devils in them, but I had power given
me to caſt them out.</hi> After this, beginning again to queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this were Chriſt or not, I fell into great fear and doubting, as
formerly; whereupon the devill diſcovered himſelf to be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
and told me, <hi>that all this while I had been ſerving him,
and blaſpheming God, and that it was now too late to repent,</hi>
whereupon I was brought into deſpair for a time, thinking every
thing which I either heard or ſaw, to be the Devill come to fetch
me away: one while I thought that I ſhould be taken away in a
flame of fire, or elſe that the earth would ſwallow me up quick;
whereupon I called my Wife, and deſired her to bring up my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
in the fear of God, for the devill would fetch me away, my
ſelf ſtill thinking that he was drawing me out of the bed; thus
I apprehended my ſelf wholly under the power of the devill, and
had no power to recover my ſelf out of that ſad condition. At laſt
I began (having been ſo long deluded) to deſiſt from hearkning to
the voice within me, and apply my ſelf unto God, in and through
Chriſt, for deliverance from the power of Satan, knowing that
God was able to deliver me, though I were ſo farre involved in
the ſnare of the devill; thereupon my faith was in ſome meaſure
raiſed to beleeve that God would deliver me: whereupon I was
preſently in a great agonie, and did ſweat extreamly, in which
condition I continued all night, but was ſomewhat more chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in the morning, eſteeming my ſelf in ſome meaſure reſcued
from the power of the Devill: yet having not reſolved, as yet
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:150070:8"/>
finally to deſert that way, I was ſoon again aſſaulted by the ſame
power, telling me, <hi>that now the devil was finally caſt out of me,
and that the room within me muſt not be left empty, but that
Chriſt muſt come and have the whole, and ſole poſſeſſion, or elſe
Satan would return and re-enter with ſeven other Devils worſe
then himſelf,</hi> telling me withall, <hi>that he was</hi> CHRIST, and
ſolliciting me to entertain and imbrace him as he had done former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
I reſiſted the ſuggeſtions of this power for a time, having bin
ſo often deluded: whereupon as a motive to perſwade me to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
it, he repreſented to my memory all, or moſt of the remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
paſſages of my life, both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> told me how
long I ſhould live, <hi>viz.</hi> ten years, and where I ſhould die, <hi>viz.</hi> at
<hi>London,</hi> and that I had a weak body, but he would ſtrengthen it,
and thereupon cauſed me to rub my body all over with my hands, at
which inſtant I conceived my body to receive ſtrength, and the
members thereof to be more in ſubſtance then before: with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
other paſſages, promiſing me proſperity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the World, and
ſpeaking theſe words to me. <hi>John 4. 29. Behold a man that
hath told thee all things that ever thou didſt, is not this Chriſt?</hi>
whereupon I was at laſt perſwaded to imbrace this power, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that it was Chriſt indeed; whereupon I was preſently ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of a working throughout my whole body, which ſoon ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and then I thought that my condition was good, and Chriſt
to be really in me: afterwards this power told me, that I had high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
offended God in all my former paſſages, in giving way to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
and that I was guilty of all ſins except that againſt the holy
Ghoſt, but told me, that I did it ignorantly, and therefore he had
pity on me: I was further perſwaded by the ſame power, that I
ſhould ly (ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>emingly) dead, which I did, not daring to ſtirre, till
the power moved me. Lying thus a while, the power began firſt to
move one of my legs, and then the other, after that my hands, &amp; then
my head, and at laſt my whole body: cauſing me to ſit up in my bed,
and telling me, <hi>that thus ſhould my body be quickned and raiſed up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
at the laſt day:</hi> then the power told me, <hi>that I muſt pull off my
ſhirt, and my cap, and the napkin which</hi> I <hi>had about my neck,</hi> ſaying,
<hi>that whatſoever was about me was pollutted, &amp; that he hated the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſpotted with the fleſh;</hi> whereupon I pull'd them off, and threw
them on the ground, uttering the ſame words, <hi>that I hated the
garments ſpotted with the fleſh;</hi> the power alſo told me, <hi>that all my
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:150070:8"/>
bonds were broken, and my cords looſened, and that Chriſt had
ſet me free:</hi> whereupon calling for a clean ſhirt, and other lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen,
I aroſe, concinding my ſelf to be in a good condition; yet
finding my ſelf being up no better, nor my body more ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
but rather weakned, I began to ſee that I had been deluded
in this laſt buſineſſe as formerly: whereupon I was ſtrucken with
fear, and walking into the Garden, I thought one while that the
Devill would pull me into the earth, and another while that he
would pull me into the air, ſo that I was afraid to continue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
and came again into the houſe, and ſuſpected every thing
that I heard to be the Devill waiting to fetch me away; being in
this perplexity of ſoul, I began to conſider how grievouſly I had
offended God in rejecting the uſe of all externall means, as read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
hearing, prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the uſe wherof God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
us to wait upon him, and therefore that it was moſt juſt
with him to leave me to my ſelf, and to give me over to ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion,
that I ſhould beleeve lies, which was my condition for a
time, by the juſt judgement of God upon me, as for other provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
ſo eſpecially for rejecting the revealed will of God in his
Word, and hearkning only to a voice within me; becauſe what
was ſpoken by it, was ſeconded by lying Wonders, of which
God hath given notice in his Word, that ſo his people might not
give credit to them, nor be deluded by them. I hope the Reader
will ſo far give heed to what I have related concerning my ſelf, as
to learn thereby to take heed of being impoſed upon by the Devil,
though he doth transform himſelf into an angell of light: which
advantage if any reap by it, I have my end: it hath been no ſmall
burthen to my conſcience (ſince Gods gracious deliverance of
me from this ſnare) that I ſhould ſo farre gratifie the grand Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſarie,
as not onely to liſten to his ſugeſtions, and imbrace his
voice for the voice of Chriſt, but alſo wholly to neglect thoſe
means, in the conſtant and conſcientious uſe whereof God hath
promiſed to reveal himſelf unto his people, and to give in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to them, which becauſe I found not (though through my
own default) I did in effect ſay, <hi>why ſhould I wait for the Lord
any longer?</hi> and ſo turned unto lying vanities. Oh, that all who
affect novelties, would ſeriouſly conſider of it, and take warning
by it: for <hi>Turpius ejicitur quam non admittitur.</hi> It is eaſier to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the devill at his firſt aſſault, then to expell him being once
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:150070:9"/>
admitted: Many beſides my ſelf, have bin, and are in the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
but few or none to whom the Lord hath manifeſted his
Grace in ſuch a manner as to my ſelf: I had before this made this
known to the world, had I had tranquillity of Conſcience, and
compoſure of ſpirit, which bleſſing the Lord having in his grace
reſtored to me, I deſire the Chriſtian Reader to joyn with me in
returning praiſes unto the Lord for his goodneſſe towards me: I
reſt fully perſwaded, and I think it doth evidently appear (by what
is mentioned in this Relation) to perſons unprejudiced, that my
Quaking and Trembling was of the devill, that I was acted wholly
and ſolely by him whilſt in this condition, and I do really beleeve
that others in the like condition which I was then in, would be of
the ſame mind with me, upon ſerious tryall of their condition by the
principles of Chriſtian Religion, and ſanctified Reaſon; leaſt the
ſtrangeneſſe of ſome paſſages in this Relation, ſhould put the faith
of any one upon the rack, or make them queſtion the truth thereof;
I have not onely given teſtimony my ſelf of it, by ſubſcribing my
Name, but alſo procured ſeverall perſons of known fidelity living
in, or neer <hi>Kendale,</hi> (whoſe Names are under written) to teſtifie the
probability, (if not the certainty) of the truth of it, by what they
have ſeen, and heard.</p>
