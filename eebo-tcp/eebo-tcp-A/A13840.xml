            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

neglect it. <hi>Charlemont</hi> lyes in prison for a thousand Crownes.
And here I haue a thousand Crownes. Honestie tels meet'were
well done to release <hi>Charlemont.</hi> But discretion sayes I had
much a doe to come by this; and when this shall be gone I
know not where to singer any more: especially if I employ it
to this vse, which is like to endanger mee into my Fathers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
displeasure. And then I may goe hang my selfe, or be
forc'd to doe that, will make another saue mee the labour. No

Arrant knaues! for vsing him so discourtcously; may the sins
o'the poore people be so few, that you sha'not be able to spare
so much out o'your gettings, as will pay for the hyre of a lame
staru'd hackney to ride to an execution. But goe a foote to the
gallowes, and be hang'd. May elder brothers turne good hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
and younger brothers get good wiues; that there be no
neede of debt-bookes, nor vse of Serieants. May there be all
peace but i'the warre, and all charitie but i'the Diuell; so that
prisons may be turn'd to Hospitals, though the Officers liue
othe beneuolence. If this curse might come to passe, the world
would say, <hi>Blessed be he that curseth.</hi>

the Snaile o'th'tother side, should ha'beene wrought with

it were) from the lazie Snaile, and enclining towards the pert
Batchelers-button; their branches spreading and winding one
within another as if they did embrace. But heere's a morall.
A poppring Peare-tree growing vpon the banke of a Riuer;
seeming continually to looke downewards into the water, as if
it were enamour'd of it; and euer as the fruit ripens, lets it fall
for loue (as it were) into her lap. Which the wanton Streame,
like a Strumpet, no sooner receiues, but she carries it away, and
bestowes it vpon some other creature she maintaines: still see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to play and dally vnder the Poppring, so long, that it
has almost wash'd away the earth from the roote; and now the

whereon it spent all the substance it had.</p>
