            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>OF PREACHING, AS Anciently uſed.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince the late <hi>Directions</hi> to Miniſters, ſent by his Grace of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes; a Queſtion was put to me by a Friend, a Pious Orthodox Miniſter, and well affected to the Government, what ground there was for thoſe words in the ſaid <hi>Directions; That Preaching was not anciently the work of every Prieſt, but was reſtrained to the choicest perſons for gravity, prudence, and learning:</hi> Not that he ſo much doubted, as I ſuppoſe, the truth of what was alledged, or ſcrupled at the obedience and ſubmiſsion, but that his obedience and ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (for to that purpoſe he expreſſed himſelf) upon fuller information and evidence, might be more rational; or rationally juſtifiable before God and men, if there ſhould be occaſion. I cannot ſay I uſe his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry words, but to this effect I am ſure, as I apprehended him. His Queſtion came to me by a Letter, and by a Letter Anſwer was made. In my Anſwer, I was forced to contract my ſelf as much as I could, being then wholly taken up by ſome other more preſsing duties of my place. But afterwards when I was more at leiſure, conſulting with my <hi>Adverſaria,</hi> and finding, that as many (known to me) as had treated of that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95247:3"/>
Argument, had not only done it very ſlightly, as I thought, but alſo committed divers miſtakes in ſetting down the practice of Antiquity; and that it might be the caſe of more then this one, who had addreſſed himſelf to me for further ſatisfaction: I thought it would not be unſeaſonable ſervice, if I publiſhed what by diligent reading was come to my obſervation upon this Argument. I ſhall not keep my ſelf ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely to the words of the Queſtion, but take the liberty of any thing that offers it ſelf by the way, having ſome reference to it, and may be uſeful and fit to be known of its ſelf.</p>
            <p>And firſt of all, that there may be no miſtake about the word, wherein ſome men of no ſmall account, for want of a right underſtanding, have been miſled in their judgements and opinions; it will be very requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, that we conſider and agree, what <hi>Preaching</hi> is in general; and what is that <hi>Preaching</hi> particularly, and by what names known unto the Ancients, which is the ſubject of this diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>I will not inſiſt upon the Latitude of the words, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in Greek; or of <hi>concio,</hi> or <hi>ſermo,</hi> and ſuch others, whether in Greek or Latin. Though <hi>Optatus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Milevis</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> was once put to it, when he wrote, <hi>Epiſcopalis tractatus, probatur ab omnibus ſanctitate veſtitus: ſalutatione ſcilicet geminata:</hi> yet I think there is no man ſo ignorant in theſe dayes, but can diſtinguiſh between a ſet Speech or <hi>Oration</hi> in general, of any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſubject, ordinary or extraordinary, publick or private, but publickly delivered, or fitted, at leaſt, for
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95247:3"/>
publick audience, (beſides the difference, either of places, or perſons;) and that which we uſually call a <hi>Sermon,</hi> though both go often under one title in ancient Books. But whether any ſet Speech publickly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered (ſetting aſide the conſideration of the Speaker at preſent) tending to reformation of life; as, a ſerious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to vertue, and contempt of the world, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion from vice, and all ſenſuality, and the like, may be called <hi>Preaching,</hi> may be ſome queſtion, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of it of ſome conſequence. It is very certain, that long before and ſince Chriſt, both among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> and <hi>Graecians</hi> (not to ſpeak of other Nations leſs known in thoſe dayes) ſuch a practice was, anſwerable in many reſpects, to what we now call <hi>Preaching.</hi> Certainly, if the viſible fruits of what we call <hi>mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and renouncing of the world, if outward abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence and ſobriety in life and converſation, if liberal diſtributing to the neceſsities of others, if ſtricteſt bonds of mutual love and amity be the proper effects and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of powerful <hi>Preaching,</hi> it cannot be denied, but ſuch have been the effects often of that kind of <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> which hath been in uſe among Heathens; for which we have not the authority of the Heathens on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but of Chriſtians alſo, Fathers and others, who bear witneſs and tell us of particular examples. And though it is not improbable, that many ſuch things might be done for oſtentation only, or ſome other worldly end, as among Chriſtians but too often: yet there is more ground to believe, that more frequently Speakers dealt with all ſimplicity, aiming at the edification (as we
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95247:4"/>
now ſpeak) of their hearers, as may appear by that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent paſſage of <hi>Muſonius</hi> the Philoſopher (who lived under <hi>Nero</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour) recorded by <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi> l. V<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. c. 1. and by ſundry Epiſtles of <hi>Seneca,</hi> as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the 52. and 108. well worth the reading. Whence it is, that the Greek Fathers uſe the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (eſpecially St. <hi>Chryſoſtome)</hi> ſo frequently, for <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>godlineſs</hi> And this may be ſome reaſon too, which made ſome of the Greek Fathers (as underſtood by many, at leaſt) to extend the power <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in general, ſo far as to maintain, that even before the true and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (or <hi>Word)</hi> the ſecond Perſon of the Trinity was fully revealed unto the world; the natural <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>(reaſon,</hi> or <hi>speech,</hi> though natural, yet the gift of God, that too) well managed and improved with care and induſtry, was able to ſave; of which aſſertion, for it, and againſt it, much hath been written by ſome late writers.</p>
            <p>But though for the matter of their moral diſcourſes and exhortations, they might have much affinity, thoſe that were made by Heathens, with thoſe that were made by Chriſtians, called <hi>Sermons;</hi> yea, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell too for the moſt part in pregnancy of wit, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of ſpeech; yet one main difference is this, that their grounds and motives related unto this life only, as having no knowledge, much leſs aſſurance of another life after this: which will much aggravate the caſe of Chriſtians at the day of Judgement, who having ſo much more to ground upon, as promiſes of Eternity, and <hi>being partakers of the Divine Nature,</hi> have
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95247:4"/>
therefore the more to anſwer for; if exhortations do not work more potently upon them, then they did up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Heathens, among whom nevertheleſs they did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch wonderful effects.</p>
            <p>Now if we look into the property of the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, uſually tranſlated into Latin, <hi>praedicare;</hi> from whence our Engliſh, <hi>to preach,</hi> is derived; it doth import a ſolemn <hi>proclaiming,</hi> or <hi>announcing</hi> of ſomewhat of publick concernment which was not known be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; ſo doth <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> too: both which words have particular relation unto Chriſt his bleſſed <hi>Incarnation</hi> for the Redemption of the world. His coming into the world, who was the ſubject of ſo many Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies before, and the <hi>expectation</hi> (as both the Greek and Latin tranſlation render it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 10.) and the <hi>deſire of all Nations,</hi> Hag. 2. 7. as it was ſolemnly proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or <hi>Preached</hi> by Angels at the firſt, ſo it is ſtill the proper ſubject of all <hi>Preaching;</hi> and though moral diſcourſes and exhortations be alſo neceſſary, as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of Chriſt his coming into the world; yet are they not properly <hi>Preaching,</hi> ſuch as the Church may challenge as peculiar unto it ſelf, except they be grounded upon Chriſt, whether as a Prieſt, or a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, or a King, in the authority of his commands, the obligation of his example and ſufferings, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of his rewards. For the truth is, the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of Chriſt laid aſide, though good language and excellency of wit may go far with ſome men to perſwade, and with all, or moſt, to pleaſe, and delight; yet bare vertue of it ſelf, all things ſoberly conſidered,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95247:5"/>
will prove generally but a weak Plea; and as <hi>Brutus</hi> at his death is ſaid to have bemoaned himſelf; rather words, then reality. We conclude therefore, Firſt, That moral diſcourſes and exhortations by ſet ſpeeches and elaborate elocution are not properly <hi>Preaching,</hi> but as grounded, not implicitly only, (which may be ſaid of the ſpeeches of Philoſophers in ſome ſenſe) but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly and expreſly upon Chriſt, and the ends of his coming unto the world.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That all publick performances (by ſpeech, or word of mouth) tending to the manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, and his coming unto the world, and the ends of his coming, (to which end, <hi>holy dayes</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted and are of ſpecial uſe,) may truly and properly be called <hi>Preaching.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſay <hi>publick,</hi> becauſe indeed the original word <gap reason="foreign">

beſides, whoſe peculiar office it was to read the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to the people generally; yet at certain times, as peculiarly at the time of the adminiſtration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Chriſts body, the Deacons read the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels: ſo that as the <hi>Lectores</hi> were properly ſaid <hi>praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care,</hi> when they read in the Church, audibly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, both the myſteries of our Faith, thoſe eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that concern Chriſt revealed, and the inſtructions and exhortations contained in the Word of God; <hi>Decret.</hi> 1. <hi>diſt.</hi> 21. c. 1. ſo for the ſame reaſon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect were the <hi>Deacons</hi> too when they read the Goſpels.

            <p>After ſo much of <hi>Preaching</hi> in general, and different notions of the word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, and <hi>praedicare:</hi> which are the moſt ordinary words, by which <hi>Preaching</hi> in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Books is expreſſed; to make ſome application of what hath been ſaid to the Queſtion propoſed, and ſo to a poſitive deciſion, or determination of it:</p>
            <p>I ſay, firſt: That <hi>Preaching</hi> at large; by way of <hi>Catechiſme,</hi> or by way of familiar, but ſolid and ſober reaſoning; tending, not only to the publiſhing or ſpreading of the Goſpel of Chriſt, and converſion of Infidels; but alſo to the confirmation, and further edification of them that were already converted; did alwayes belong, as unto all devout Chriſtians in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, as opportunity did offer, and ability did afford; ſo particularly unto all Prieſts, as part of their charge and Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:95247:7"/>
I ſay ſecondly, that at the very beginning of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, it is the opinion of ſome, that all things or moſt things at leaſt, were common to all men. So the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Comment upon the Epiſtles, aſcribed unto St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> who upon the fourth Chapter of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> hath theſe words: <hi>Tamen poſtquam omnibus locis Eccleſiae ſunt conſtitutae, &amp; officia ordinata; ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter compoſita res eſt, quàm coeperat. Primùm enim, omnes do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cebant, &amp; omnes baptizabant, quibuſcunque diebus vel tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus fuiſſet occaſio. Nec enim Philippus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Vt ergo creſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret Eccleſia, &amp; multiplicaretur, omnibus inter initia conceſſum eſt, &amp; evangelizare, &amp; baptizare, &amp; Scripturas in Eccleſia explanare. At ubi omnta loca circumplexa eſt Eccleſia, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticula</hi> (in a good ſenſe, as frequently in ancient Books) <hi>conſtituta ſunt, &amp; rectores; &amp; caetera officia in Eccleſiis ſunt ordinata, ut nullus de clero auderet, qui ordinatus</hi> (appointed, licenſed) <hi>non eſſet, praeſumere officium, quod ſciret non ſibi creditum, vel conceſſum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Hinc ergo eſt, quod neque diaconi in populo praedicant;</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, here) <hi>neque Clerici vel Laici baptizant</hi> (ſo all editions I have ſeen; and ſo quoted by learned men: but I know not what ſenſe can be made of the words, except we read: <hi>neque ubi Clerici, Laici baptizant:</hi> or to that effect; which is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to what <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and others witneſs of thoſe times: that where a Clergy-man was not to be had; that is, in caſe of neceſsity; it was lawful for any to baptize. Except <hi>Clerici</hi> be here intended properly the <hi>inferioris gradus Clerici:</hi> that is, all under the order of a Deacon. For <hi>Epiſcopi, Presbyteri,</hi> and <hi>Diaconi,</hi> were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten joyned under the title of <hi>Sacerdotes,</hi> in general) <hi>neque</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:95247:7"/>
               <hi>quocunque die credentes tinguntur, niſi aegri.</hi> But it was not ſo long; nor then neither, generally, ſo: but at extraordinary times, and occaſions only.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I ſay: That as ſoon as matters of the Church came to ſome regulation; and a certain Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Biſhops within their own Dioceſs, had the ſole power of holy functions: Prieſts and Deacons were added to them, to help them, and to be employed by them, according to their degree and abilities, as they ſhould ſee occaſion. So that a Prieſt might not <hi>baptize,</hi> nor <hi>adminiſter</hi> the Communion, nor <hi>teach,</hi> or interpret the Scriptures <hi>de loco ſuperiore ſedis Eccleſiae,</hi> as St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> calls it, or <hi>de cathedrâ,</hi> as St. <hi>Ambroſe:</hi> as a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or a <hi>Doctor:</hi> (for ſo they were then called, that did it, either by their own authority as Biſhops; or were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it, as <hi>Prieſts:</hi> which is the <hi>preaching</hi> now in uſe) without peculiar allowance of the Biſhop of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. In many places Prieſts generally were not allowed it: it was not then thought to belong unto them, but unto Biſhops only.</p>
            <p>For baptizing, and the adminiſtration of the Lords Supper, we have <hi>Ignatius</hi> his teſtimony, in thoſe words which are found in the ancient Copies, &amp; are warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the old Interpreter, to be genuine; the words are theſe, <gap reason="foreign">

Sed ſi fortè uſus exegerit,</hi> &amp;c. We might add to thoſe, the ſuppoſed <hi>Dionyſius Areopagita;</hi> whom though we do not acknowledge under that name; and could give ſome reaſons, if need were, that have not yet been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to prove him counterfeit: yet we acknowledge him, and all men muſt, ancient enough to bear teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in this cauſe. He ſpeaks as peremptorily, as any doth; and aſcribes all power, both of baptizing, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95247:8"/>
of conſecrating, and teaching, to the Biſhop: but he is not eaſily to be underſtood, but by them that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his ſtyle; and worſe in a tranſlation, except a man take the liberty of a Paraphraſe, then in his own original language. But it may ſuffice to have named him; there is no need of his words, which have ſo much of affected obſcurity.</p>
            <p>Now, though it might eaſily be granted perchance, that thoſe who were not allowed to <hi>baptize,</hi> or to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate,</hi> without permiſſion; were much leſs allowed to <hi>Preach:</hi> yet there is much to be ſaid in that behalf, of <hi>Preaching</hi> particularly, which is our particular under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking here; and therefore, not to be omitted. But I will firſt inquire into the reaſons, or grounds, why it was ſo ordered; and produce my teſtimonies, in their orders.</p>
            <p>The firſt ground, or reaſon was, becauſe the Biſhop, repreſenting more immediately Chriſt himſelf, in his office; he was looked upon, as the well-ſpring, from whom all holy duties were derived: which made him ſo abſolute in his Dioceſs, that it was accounted great uſurpation for any man, to challenge any power in the Church <hi>(in ſpiritualibus)</hi> but under him; and by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. This is well expreſſed, by the forenamed Author, who goes under the name of <hi>Dionyſius Areop.</hi> where he doth tell us: that the ſupream order in the Eccleſiaſtical <hi>hierarchie,</hi> is both ſupream, and loweſt too: as comprehending all others within its ſelf. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſaith he, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <note place="margin">Dion. Areop. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Which is yet more fully ſet out by <hi>Maximus,</hi> the Greek Scholiaſt. St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> alſo, ſpeaks much to the ſame effect, where he ſaith, <note place="margin">Ambroſ. ubiſ. p. 355.</note> 
               <hi>Nam in Epiſcopo omnes ordines ſunt, quia primus eſt ſacerdos, &amp; princeps &amp; propheta, &amp; Evangeliſta, &amp; caetera, ad im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenda officia Eccleſiae in miniſterio fidelium.</hi> And ſo ſtrict were they in thoſe times, to preſerve this abſoluteneſs of a Biſhop in his Dioceſs, that by ſome Canons of the Church, no leſs then <hi>depoſition</hi> was the mulct, if one Biſhop had preſumed to preach in anothers Dioceſs, without his leave firſt obtained: and this too, in thoſe times; when Biſhops, whereever they were, at home (within their own Dioceſs) or abroad, if no lawful impediment, as age, or other accidental indiſpoſition of body; or ſome other more advantagious imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to publick concernments did hinder; thought themſelves bound, and by ſome Canons of Councils in ſome places, were bound to preach every Sunday. I have heard, when young my ſelf, from ſome ancient Divines, that it was ſo in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time; which among the common people could not but add much to that veneration, which is due from all men unto their place.</p>
            <p>A ſecond ground, or reaſon, was, the inſufficiency of many Prieſts, in thoſe dayes (and when was it not ſo?) for ſo great an employment. What <hi>Seneca</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſaith of his <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> is very applyable here: <hi>Damnum quidem feciſſe Philoſophiam, non erit dubium, poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam proſtituta eſt: ſed poteſt in penetralibus ſuis oſtendi, ſi</hi>

               <hi>modo non inſtitorem, ſed antiſtitem nacta est.</hi> And this he ſpeaks upon occaſion of the many <hi>Philoſophers</hi> of his <note place="margin">Sen. ep. 53. p. 240.</note> time, who thought themſelves brave fellows, becauſe people did run after them to hear them, and with loud cries &amp; acclamations teſtified their great eſteem, &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of their performances. This made them to applaud themſelves, becauſe applauſe was the thing they ſought after, &amp; chiefly propoſed to themſelves: but whether their admirers were really the better in their lives, and converſation, for what they heard, was no part, or the leaſt part, at leaſt, of their care: it being generally obſerved, that they profited (or edified) leaſt, who were moſt ready to applaud, and by outward ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, ſhewed greateſt pleaſure. Theſe he calls <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitores,</hi> and ſaith, that Philoſophy was proſtituted by them. And St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath much to that purpoſe too: and ſo divers other Fathers. But this is not my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. When that is done, we may think of it again in the end.</p>
            <p>That <hi>inſufficiency</hi> was a great reaſon, and that <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> (ſuch Pulpit <hi>Preaching,</hi> or <hi>teaching</hi> by way of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which gave them the title of <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. he doth add, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That ſuch alſo <hi>(teachers) Prieſts, ought to be, as they that have the priviledge of higher ſeats,</hi> (in the Quire, or Church) <hi>next unto the Biſhop.</hi> But in effect, there is no repugnancy; neither in the words of <hi>Balſamon,</hi> nor in the words of the Canon. For <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (which is the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Canon) <hi>to inſtruct to godlineſs,</hi> in general: there is no queſtion, but Prieſts alſo are bound by their office, as <hi>Prieſts:</hi> and in caſe they be allowed by the Biſhop, as <hi>Doctors,</hi> to <hi>teach,</hi> or to <hi>preach</hi> out of the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, and neglect it, (which is all that can be made of <hi>Balſamons</hi> interpretation of the Canon, compared with other places) they are lyable to cenſure. Indeed upon the twentieth Canon of the <hi>Synodus Trull.</hi> we find ſomewhat, that hath much more appearance of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy: in thoſe words: <hi>Sacerdotis autem munus; accipe etiam de docendi munere; &amp; non de ſola ſacrificii cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bratione. Sacerdotes enim antiquitùs, neceſſe habebant etiam docere.</hi> But whoſe words theſe are, I know not: for I find no Greek in the Text, to anſwer to this Latin.</p>
            <p>Now for the Latin Church: Of the Churches of <hi>Africa,</hi> ſo numerous in thoſe dayes; we have good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, atteſted by the moſt eminent of the Latin Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as St. <hi>Ierome,</hi> and St. <hi>Auguſtin:</hi> that till <hi>Valerius</hi> his time (by whom St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> was conſecrated)
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95247:11"/>
Prieſts were not allowed <hi>to preach;</hi> or to ſpeak more properly, that the <hi>Pulpit</hi> was one of the Biſhops pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar priviledges. <hi>Valerius,</hi> they all ſay, was the firſt, that did alter the cuſtom in his Church: whoſe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, was ſoon followed by others: as peculiarly by <hi>Aurelius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Carthage;</hi> for which he was much commended by St <hi>Auguſtin:</hi> as may appear by thoſe congratulatorie Letters of his unto the ſaid <hi>Aurelius,</hi> upon that occaſion. <hi>Baronius</hi> hath it at large out of <hi>Poſsidonius, Ierom,</hi> and St. <hi>Auguſtin. Tentavit S. Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> (ſaith <hi>Baronius) quod ante nullus Epiſcoporum Africano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum attigerat; nempe ut Presbyter Evangelium praedicaret, cum non niſi Epiſcopi id obirent muneris.</hi> Which alſo is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted by <hi>Optatus Milevitanus,</hi> a Biſhop of thoſe dayes, in his books againſt the Donatiſts, who doth not argue <note place="margin">Opt. l. 3. contra Don.</note> it, but delivers it upon occaſion, as a thing notoriouſly known, that <hi>tractare, est Epiſcoporum.</hi> However, thoſe teſtimonies in <hi>Baronius,</hi> deliver it not ſo generally; that it was not lawful, abſolutely: but not lawful, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, that they ſhould do it, <hi>praeſente Epiſcopo.</hi> But to our purpoſe, it comes all to one, whether they might not abſolutely, before, till <hi>Valerius</hi> had broken the ice, and others followed his example: or, whether it was <hi>praeſente Epiſcopo</hi> only, that it was not lawful; certain it is, that all did not; and none did, but thoſe that were licenſed by the Biſhops. And certainly, that was the practice over all Churches in thoſe dayes: neither do I believe, that one Prieſt of a hundred, was allowed it, or ever did it.</p>
            <p>But we muſt diſtinguiſh of times too. For there
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95247:11"/>
was a time, when all Prieſts had their maintenance from the Biſhop immediately; and were called <hi>spor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulantes Presbyteri;</hi> and were employed by him, as he ſaw occaſion. Then, after the increaſe of Chriſtianiſm, Pariſhes came to be divided; and upon that diviſion, particular Pariſhes aſsigned to particular Prieſts. Since which time, it is apparent by ſome Canons of later Councils, that Prieſts (now <hi>Perſons)</hi> were not only al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; but alſo, called upon, and enjoyned to preach in their Pariſhes; to which end Pulpits were erected in moſt Pariſhes.</p>
            <p>But of all things I have read upon this Argument, I have alwayes moſt wondred at the relation of <hi>Sozo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens,</hi> the Greek Hiſtorian; who, where he treats of different cuſtoms, in different places, doth atteſt, that as in <hi>Alexandria</hi> (which is alſo atteſted by <hi>Socrates)</hi> the Biſhop only did <hi>preach,</hi> or <hi>teach:</hi> ſo in <hi>Rome,</hi> neither Biſhop, nor any body elſe: his words are, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. It is tranſlated by <hi>Caſsiodorus,</hi> in his, <hi>Hiſtoria, Tripartita, Apud Romanos in unoquoque anno, ſemel pſallunt alleluja; primo die Paſchae, it a ut Romani velut pro juramento habeant</hi> (a ridiculous miſtake: he found it in his Copy, as we have it to this day, <gap reason="foreign">

In qua Eccleſia, neque Epiſcopus, neque alter quiſquam coram populo docet.</hi> There is ſo much to be ſaid againſt this, as that I muſt needs miſtruſt a miſtake. And yet it were as hard to believe, that <hi>Sozomen,</hi> either (wittingly
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95247:12"/>
or willingly) would miſinform, where he could be ſo eaſily convinced: or could be miſinformed himſelf, in a thing of ſo publick obſervation. I conceive the miſtake may lye in thoſe words, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which may import (being tranſlated, <hi>in Eccleſia)</hi> that it was not the faſhion in <hi>Rome,</hi> for any body to preach in the <hi>mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Church:</hi> but in the <hi>Quire</hi> only; or from the <hi>ſtaires,</hi> or <hi>aſcent,</hi> tending to the Quire, as in divers other places. Hiſtory Records tell us, that <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> by reaſon of the multitude of people, that flocked from all places to hear him, was forced to change his place. <hi>Baronius</hi> ſaith, he did, <hi>ſuggeſtum in medio Eccleſiae collocare;</hi> but I think he is miſtaken. For his Authors, though he name them not, were no other, certainly, then <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zomen,</hi> and <hi>Nicephorus:</hi> both which ſay, that he did it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: <hi>ex lectorum ambone, ſeu pulpito:</hi> from the readers Pulpit, ſeated in thoſe dayes, in the middle of the body of the Church. Now it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that others, both before, and ſince <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> did the ſame. <hi>Socrates</hi> alſo, ſpeaking of <hi>Origens</hi> preaching, hath the ſame words, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. It ſeems therefore, that it was uſual enough, in thoſe places: but not ſo at <hi>Rome.</hi> If ſo, then <hi>Caſsiodore</hi> was much miſtaken, in rendring thoſe words, in this place (for otherwiſe the words will bear it very well; and of the two, it is the moſt warrantable tranſlation, as to the words) <hi>coram populo:</hi> where it was intended, <hi>in Eccleſia;</hi> of the place, preciſely. Or it may be, becauſe Sermons were in the Quire, not in the body of the Church, as elſewhere: though the people might come and hear; yet not ſo
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95247:12"/>
many as when, or where, in the body of the Church: therefore not thought ſo properly to preach <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, <hi>populo.</hi> If any man can deviſe any thing more probable, I ſhall be glad; for I have no great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in this. But I have not yet met with it, I am ſure.</p>
            <p>However, this occaſion being given me, I cannot but profeſs my great diſlike, that <hi>Service,</hi> and <hi>Sermon,</hi> ſhould be parted any where; the one, in one place; the other, in another; if it may poſsibly be avoided. Eſpecially at ſuch a diſtance, as it is here with us, in the Cathedral and Metrapolitical Church of Chriſt in <hi>Canterbury.</hi> I conceive it to be one main reaſon, that ſo few are acquainted, and by conſequent, not more in love, with the Service: which if better known unto them, and the many benefits they might reap, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving diligently every part of it (which the ancient Fathers of the Church, do often refer their auditors unto) would certainly be in far greater requeſt; that I ſay not, admiration: which yet I profeſs to believe, that it doth highly deſerve, at the hands of all both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and wiſe. That the place is not ſo convenient for many to hear (though I believe there be but few Quires in <hi>England,</hi> either more ſpacious, or more ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) is but a weak plea, againſt ſuch apparent miſchief, by contempt of the Service, and therein of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; of his holy Word eſpecially, which makes a great part of the Service. But this by the way only; out of a deep ſenſe of the abuſe, and earneſt deſire of redreſs.</p>

We will now conſider, what can out of antiquity (for that is all we have to do) be objected to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; in oppoſition, I mean, to that aſſertion, (the ſubject of our diſcourſe) <hi>that Preaching was not anciently the work of every Prieſt. Franciſcus Bernardinus Ferrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſis,</hi> (to begin with him firſt) one of the Doctors of the Colledge of <hi>Milan,</hi> in his book, <hi>De ritu Concionum,</hi> Printed at <hi>Milan,</hi> a. d. 1600. takes upon him to prove, <hi>jam inde à primis Eccleſiae temporibus, concionandi munus eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Fran. Bern. Fer. l. 11. c. 1</note> 
               <hi>presbyterorum fuiſſe:</hi> That it belonged unto Biſhops principally; <hi>(Epiſcoporum maximè proprium fuiſſe)</hi> he doth not deny. But he adds, <hi>Sed &amp; presbyteros, ijſdem primis Eccleſiae temporibus, publicè concionari ſolitos, quoniam quidem non ſatis notum ijs videtur, qui multa in hanc rem collegerunt, Nos ex Apoſtolicarum Conſtitutionum autore,</hi> &amp;c. It ſhould ſeem by him, ſome that had undertaken the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, had performed it but very ſlenderly, as he thought; and therefore did expect he ſhould do them no ſmall pleaſure. His chief, and as I may ſay, only Author (for the reſt prove nothing of <hi>ancient times;</hi> much leſs, <hi>de primis Eccleſiae temporibus)</hi> is the compiler of the <hi>Apoſtolical Conſtitutions;</hi> ſo intituled. What ſome Proteſtants, great pretenders to the knowledge of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, have made bold to affirm, concerning theſe <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions,</hi> I know well enough. But great undertakers, are not alwayes the ſureſt men, either to perform, or to be truſted too. The moſt learned Papiſts, have given them over long ago, as <hi>Bellarmin, Baronius</hi> and others, as not juſtifiable: and he that deſireth further ſatisfaction, let him read the <hi>Prolegomena</hi> of that truly
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95247:13"/>
pious and learned Prelate, <hi>James Vſher,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Armach,</hi> to his edition of <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Epiſtles: who is of opinion, that the book, as now interpolated, was not known to the world, till the ſixth age after Chriſt. And in caſe it had been known before, ſome part of it; yet being a counterfeit book, at the firſt; what credit his teſtimony, or, a teſtimony rather (if it be the work of many hands) taken out of him, may deſerve; let the reader judge. The other teſtimonies, which he doth produce, they concern later times, and import no more then this, that power is given unto Prieſts: or, that for the time to come, they are appointed and commanded to <hi>preach</hi> in their Pariſhes; or laſtly, that Biſhops were to take care, that thoſe whom they knew able, ſhould be employed: which rather ſhews, that anciently it was not ſo ordinary for Prieſts to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed; but not at all, that till licenſed, or appointed by the Biſhop of the Dioceſs, they did ever preſume (or might legally) to do it. It is not doubted, but that all Prieſts, by vertue of their ordination, have a legal capacity to <hi>preach,</hi> as now underſtood: but their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation doth neither confer ability of performance, in point of parts: nor giveth power of actual execution at pleaſure, for time, or place: the tryal of the one, and the allowance of the other, altogether depending of the Biſhop, in thoſe times. So that in effect, all that <hi>Ferrarius</hi> doth bring to prove his aſſertion, for which he did expect thanks, it ſeems, from ſome, who had attempted it before, but with little ſucceſs; is no more then what we grant, and may grant, without prejudice
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95247:14"/>
to our aſſertion, and preſent undertaking. The reader may take notice, that the words of the <hi>Constitutions,</hi> quoted by <hi>Ferrarius</hi> out of <hi>Turrianus</hi> his tranſlation; are by <hi>Bovius (Epiſcopo Oſtunenſi)</hi> very differently tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, quite to another ſenſe, which hath nothing of <note place="margin">Turr. p. 40. Bovi. ed. p. 44.</note> 
               <hi>preaching</hi> in it. I had not at this time (I once had, I am ſure) the Original Greek to conſult. But I gueſs, that <hi>Turrianus</hi> was in the right; and <hi>Bovius</hi> miſtaken.</p>
            <p>But again: <hi>Poſsidonius</hi> in the life of St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> where he ſpeaks of the cuſtom of the <hi>African</hi> Churches, that no Prieſt, abſolutely, ſaith <hi>Baronius;</hi> no Prieſt before his Biſhop, ſaith <hi>Poſsidonius;</hi> might preach; and how that cuſtom was altered by <hi>Valerius; Et eidem presbytero (Auguſtino ſcil.) poteſtatem dedit coram ſe in Eccleſia Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelium praedicandi; ac frequentiſsimè tractandi, contra uſum quidem, &amp; conſuetudinem Africanarum Eccleſiarum. Vnde etiam ei nonnulli Epiſcopi detrahebant.</hi> Then follows, <hi>Sed ille vir venerabilis ac providus, in Orientalibus id ex more fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri, ſciens, utiliter Eccleſiae conſulens,</hi> &amp;c. What can we infer upon this? This, as I conceive: Not that a Prieſt, by the cuſtom of the Place might preach in the Eaſtern Church, without a licenſe from the Biſhop: but that, once licenſed and allowed, he might without offence preach before his Biſhop, as well as in his abſence.</p>
            <p>Again, ſome ground of objection againſt what we here maintain, may be taken from the words of the Epiſtle, adſcribed unto S. <hi>Ierome</hi> (which, as I intimated before, hath much of St. <hi>Ierome</hi> his ſenſe and ſpirit in it, though for ſome other reaſons it is very likely that it is not his) <hi>ad Ruſticum Narbonenſem Epiſcopum, de ſeptem</hi>

               <hi>Diabolicae tentationis inflatus, iraſcatur in templo, ſi presbyteri interdum exhortentur plebem; ſi in Eccleſia praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; ſi plebibus, ut ſcriptum eſt, benedicant,</hi> &amp;c. and then tells us, that <hi>Romae,</hi> and <hi>in Oriente, in Italia, in Creta, in Cypro, in Africa, in Illyrico, in Hispania, in Britannia,</hi> and, <hi>ex parte, per Gallias:</hi> it was ſo. If this be true, then <hi>France</hi> was the only place at that time, where Prieſts were not allowed, or licenſed to preach at all. Or at leaſt, not to preach, <hi>praeſente Epiſcopo:</hi> which thoſe words, <hi>iraſcatur in templo,</hi> may ſeem to import. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in this whole Chapter, he doth alwayes ſpeak, abſolutely, without any ſuch limitation, or intimation, as <hi>praeſente Epiſcopo:</hi> I rather ſuſpect a <hi>transpoſition;</hi> (not by any fault of the Copy; but from the Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; which is ordinary enough to beſt writers) and that thoſe words, <hi>in templo,</hi> belong not to <hi>nemo Epiſcopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum;</hi> but to, <hi>ſi presbyteri exhortentur,</hi> &amp;c. What then ſhall we, or can we make of this teſtimony? This, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, and no more: That Prieſts who for learning and other parts, were found fit, which formerly in many places, whether fit, or not fit, would not be granted; were then in moſt places, allowed, or licenſed to preach: or, being allowed, and licenſed; might do it <hi>praeſente Epiſcopo;</hi> as well as when he was out of the way.</p>
            <p>But when all is done, or ſaid, that can be ſaid upon this ſubject; we muſt acknowledge, that according to difference of times, and places; great variety may be obſerved; as in other things, obſerved by Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95247:15"/>
writers; ſo in this particular. We do not therefore undertake to prove, that alwayes, and in all places of Chriſtianity, it hath been ſo: but that in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times, and moſt generally, Prieſts did not <hi>preach</hi> (in that ſenſe as <hi>preaching</hi> is now generally underſtood) except they were called, and licenſed to it, by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop. I know well enough, that upon ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary occaſions, ſome <hi>Deacons:</hi> and ſome, who were neither <hi>Priests,</hi> nor <hi>Deacons,</hi> have been allowed, and employed: but this proves nothing againſt what we maintain: and I hope there hath been enough ſaid, to ſatisfie, that it is ſo indeed.</p>
            <p>Now from the conſideration of all that hath been ſaid: if without offence I may, I would by way of <hi>Corollarie,</hi> propoſe it to the conſideration of all, truly ſober, and impartially judicious; whether thoſe <hi>men</hi> that have reduced, or endeavoured to reduce, all holy duties, or functions, belonging to a Prieſt, or Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to Pulpit preaching; leaving men to the liberty, not of moral diſcourſes, at large, only, (in which kind I dare undertake, that ſome diſcourſes of ancient Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, judiciouſly ſelected, may paſs for good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons) but alſo of Politick ſpeculations, and paſſages of the time (witneſs many, if not moſt Sermons under the late Rebellion and Tyranny:) and thoſe <hi>Churches,</hi> (we will call them ſo) where Pulpit preaching is, or hath been the only publick exerciſe of Religion: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſtanding Liturgy; any adminiſtration of the Sacraments, (as many were in thoſe dayes) any obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of holy dayes, properly relating to Chriſt; (for
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95247:15"/>
the obſervation of the Sunday, or Lords day, as preſſed by many; is rather Jewiſh, then Chriſtian; if not Antichriſtian: contrary to the judgement and practice of pureſt antiquity:) Whether I ſay, thoſe <hi>men,</hi> in the judgement of antiquity, ſo far as may be gathered by the premiſes; would have been: or ſhould any of thoſe ancient Fathers of the Church, whom for their labours and their ſufferings, for Chriſt and his Church, all true Chriſtians ſo much honour, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence; now revive; would be accounted right Prieſts, worthy of that name and title: or thoſe <hi>Churches,</hi> true Chriſtian Churches. I leave all men to the liberty of their judgements: let them conſider of it ſoberly. But this muſt be underſtood as propoſed of Prieſts and Churches, in times of peace and liberty, not of perſecution: which in many particulars may alter the caſe. And ſince we have ſaid ſo much of <hi>preaching</hi> in general; I think it will not be amiſs, before we end, to enquire a little further into the nature of that we call <hi>Pulpit preaching;</hi> and wherein the true ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and excellency of it, lyeth.</p>
            <p>The end, as I conceive, of all <hi>preaching,</hi> tending to <hi>edification;</hi> (which all preaching doth pretend unto) is, either to <hi>inform,</hi> or to <hi>reform:</hi> that is, to <hi>teach,</hi> or to <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade.</hi> Where both thoſe may effectually be attained, whether out of the Pulpit, or without: it will be granted I hope, that that may be called <hi>preaching.</hi> Of teaching, there will be leſs queſtion, or difficulty: <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion</hi> is the thing that publick preaching doth eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally aim at. Some men are of opinion, that no preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95247:16"/>
is effectual to <hi>perſwade;</hi> that is not ſet out with ſome <hi>ardor,</hi> and vehemency of ſpeech, and action: which they call, <hi>the life of preaching:</hi> and upon that account ſpeak ſcornfully of <hi>Homilies,</hi> or reading of <hi>Homilies,</hi> as deſtitute of that life, which they require. Indeed <hi>flectere,</hi> or <hi>perſuadere,</hi> is by Rhetoricians ordinarily made the proper effect of that which they call, <hi>grandis oratio.</hi> And St. <hi>Augustin</hi> in thoſe elaborate books <hi>De Doctrina Chriſtiana,</hi> (for the moſt elaborate part where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he was much beholding to <hi>Tully)</hi> he ſeems to be of that opinion too; he is very copious in the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of it. However, upon better conſideration, both of the nature of things, and of the nature of men, it will eaſily appear, that there be more wayes to <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade;</hi> and ſome perchance not leſs powerful, then that ſo much extolled faculty. It is a noble queſtion in the Schools, and in the ſpeculation of nature, <hi>Vtrum voluntas neceſſariò determinetur ab intellectu?</hi> For my part, notwithſtanding that ordinary objection from the Poet,</p>

I do not deny, but ardent and vehement ſpeech, is generally moſt plauſible and powerful: yet I find that ſome accounted learned and judicious, have avoided it, as having too much affinity, with madneſs and diſtraction. Wiſe men are apt to ſuſpect any thing that is accompanied
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95247:17"/>
with paſſion; as knowing that paſſion and reaſon ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom go together; and that a calm temper of the mind, is the beſt temper, for the diſcovery of the truth. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is that, which is moſt popular, and plauſible, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies moſt profitable. Vehement language, with voice and action ſuitable, is moſt apt to ſtir up the affections, we grant it: but as the wind upon the water, whileſt it bloweth; ſo that, whileſt it is heard, or read: when the ſound is out of the ear, and the impreſsions out of the fancy, which will ſoon be: the ſtir of the affections is abated, and men for the moſt part, are the ſame as before.</p>
            <p>But when by ſtrength of reaſon and ratiocinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the judgement is convicted; and a mans reaſon fully ſatisfied, that it is ſo, and ſo; and in point of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice ought to be ſo; the fruits and effects of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, are uſually more durable, and of greater opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the ſoul and affections. If to perſwade, be the chiefeſt and nobleſt work of Rhetorick, or elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; and which gives the <hi>grandis oratio,</hi> the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence above the two other kinds; as we are taught by the Maſters of that Art: I do not doubt, but we may find the power of <hi>perſwaſion</hi> in ſome other faculties and wayes, as eminent, as in vehement language. How ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably did <hi>Socrates</hi> work upon the affections of men, even to aſtoniſhment, if we conſider the effects; meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by familiar <hi>interrogations?</hi> Or, if not only ſo; yet chiefly ſo, I am ſure, as by beſt records of thoſe times may appear. The ancients had a way; it was much uſed in ancient times; and it hath much affinity with
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95247:17"/>
Chriſt his way, by parables; to perſwade men by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>apologues,</hi> and <hi>fables;</hi> which made <hi>Aeſop</hi> ſo famous in his dayes. And do not we read of wonderful things atchieved this way, when no other oratory would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail? Did not <hi>Menenius Agrippa,</hi> when the common people of <hi>Rome,</hi> provoked by the cruelty of uſurers, were gathered together in a ſeditious manner, and had taken arms, to the great terror of the Senate, and whole City; pacifie them, and to the admiration of all men, by that famous <hi>apologue,</hi> of the members of the body (St. <hi>Paul, Romans</hi> the twelfth, hath much of it) reduce them to obedience? So <hi>Arſinoe</hi> the Queen, as we read in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> when nothing could allay her immoderate weeping and lamentation for the death of her ſon; one of the Philoſophers of thoſe times, found a way by ſuch an <hi>apologue</hi> of his own deviſing, to perſwade her to patience. And what uſe did <hi>Nathan,</hi> the Prophet, make of ſuch a device or made ſtory, to make <hi>David</hi> his King, who perchance would not have endured it ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way; ſenſible of his great unthankfulneſs towards his God, who had done ſo much for him; in that in deſpight of Gods Commandement, <hi>Thou ſhalt not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit adultery,</hi> he had ſeized upon another mans wife; and becauſe his plot would not take, which he had plotted, to ſave his credit, (as one ſin doth often beget another) was provoked to plot the death of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band? If therefore, the chief end of <hi>preaching,</hi> be to teach, or to perſwade: converſion, or reformation; how it can be ſaid, that eloquence, or ſtudied oratory, is the only way, I leave it to the judgement of men, who are
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95247:18"/>
more led (which few are) by reaſon, then prejudice, or prejudicate opinions. For my part, I think, <hi>catechiſing,</hi> if rightly uſed, hath much the advantage of it. There is another way too, which with men who are more for reaſon, then words, is of great force; and that is, by ſhort <hi>aphoriſmes.</hi> My opinion is, that the frequent read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Epictetus</hi> (eſpecially, as fitted anciently for the uſe of Chriſtians) may go much further to perſwade a man, that is rational; then many Sermons, ſuch as he may hear in many Churches. And ſo may <hi>Ludovicus Vives</hi> his <hi>Introduction to wiſdome;</hi> digeſted and compiled by certain ſhort rational <hi>aphoriſmes.</hi> It is true, that much good may be done by Rhetorick: but, as much good; ſo, much evil alſo; for which reaſon it hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden formerly in ſome judicatories.</p>
            <p>But ſince ſpeech and oratory (as once among the <hi>Athenians,</hi> when it ruled all there; and ſince that, among the <hi>Romans)</hi> is now become in ſo much requeſt, among both great and ſmall; that nothing almoſt is account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Religion, or learning, but what cometh out of the Pulpit: and that this is the very way, which the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes of the Churches peace, and government, ſince the Reformation of Religon, have ever gone in <hi>England,</hi> to gain credit with the people: this way, this popular way of preaching, though perchance, leſs of it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, might ſerve in ſome places, if all other things were duly performed; ought to be in great requeſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all, unto whom, the peace and proſperity of the Church is dear and precious: ſo that ſtill care be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, ſo far forth, as by good means it may be prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95247:18"/>
that none be allowed, or licenſed to preach, but ſuch as are true ſons of the Church.</p>
            <p>However, though for divers reſpects, we maintain the neceſsity of this way; yet it were very requiſite, I think, that people ſhould be made to underſtand every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, how much, and how dangerouſly they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded, when they are made to believe, that there is no other <hi>preaching</hi> effectual to the converſion of ſouls; and that this is the Word of God, that which is uttered out of Pulpits; ſo much commended, and ſo neceſſary to ſalvation. Which conceit, when men are once prepoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with; it makes them to deſpiſe the <hi>true Word of God</hi> (the infallible <hi>true Word of God,</hi> I mean; for <hi>Sermons</hi> alſo, if <hi>Orthodox,</hi> may be called the Word of God at large) when it is read in the Church, out of the Old, and New Teſtament: and this contempt of it, bereaves them of the benefit, which they might reap by it. I am perſwaded, that all the blaſphemies, which ſome Papiſts have belched out againſt the Scriptures, being put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; will ſcarce make one half, of what the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans and Preciſians of <hi>England</hi> have done, to advance the honour of Pulpit Preaching, wherein they did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive (and they were right in that) their advantage to lie. Let them be beaten off from that advantage, which may eaſily be done, if care be taken (and God be praiſed, care hath been taken in <hi>London</hi> of late, the chiefeſt City: might it be ſo too in all other places) it is to be hoped, that the quarrel will ſoon be at an end.</p>
            <p>But ſee (I pray the Reader to give me leave) the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudency of ſome of thoſe men; far be it from me, to

Which alſo they will often call <hi>the Gospel,</hi>

            <p>Another great and dangerous error, in this buſineſs of <hi>Preaching,</hi> which would be looked into, is, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, becauſe they hear Sermons with joy; and are eager after them; through ignorance of the nature of ſpeech, in general; and of former times, withall: without
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95247:19"/>
any further examination, what operation it hath upon their lives; they are ready to flatter themſelves, that this love they bear unto the <hi>Word,</hi> muſt needs be an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of grace; and an effect of the ſpirit of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and in this confidence, they live ſecure, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of any thing elſe, by which they might edifie: and not only ſo, but become proud, inſolent, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious; many of them. Whereas there is nothing more certain, then that it is the nature of ſpeech, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the argument be, if it be fitted to the ears of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, to be winning, and be witching: not only to delight, but even to raviſh: to cauſe admiration, and aſtoniſhment: in brief; to have the ſame effects as muſick, even the beſt muſick and melody can have upon the minds of men. It is a ſecret of nature, which every body doth not underſtand: but I have argued it elſewhere at large; and clearly by evidence of reaſon, evinced it, that there is muſick in words, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of words; in the ordering; in the pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation: in the tone, and action of the ſpeaker: briefly, in all that belongs unto Oratory. And ſuch hath been the power of ſpeech and Oratory, in former ages among Heathens, that whole towns and villages have been forſaken (for a time) of inhabitants; whileſt men both rich and poor, did run after ſome Sophiſt, or Philoſopher, who would entertain them, it may be, with ſome moral diſcourſe; it may be with ſomewhat elſe, that had no reference at all to life, and manners; much leſs, to godlineſs and piety: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, indeed; <hi>amazement</hi> and <hi>aſtoniſhment,</hi> was the very thing, that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſts
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95247:20"/>
did affect, and propoſe to themſelves; and he that could not attain unto it (great indeed was the labour they did undergo to bring this to paſs) was accounted to have miſcarried in his profeſſion. What operation the moral diſcourſes of ancient Philoſophers, have had upon ſome men, as not only to produce plentiful tears at preſent, but alſo a ſudden change of life; yea ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times an abſolute forſaking of the world, and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of this life: hath been touched before. But it is as certain, and examples of it have been produced elſewhere, that many, notoriouſly wicked and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, yet were very ſtudious to hear ſuch diſcourſes, as pleaſant and delightful for the excellency of ſpeech. To which may be added, that anciently many profeſt Heathens, enemies to the Chriſtian Religion; did ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly repair to the Sermons, and Homilies of ſome learned, and eloquent Biſhops; not to edifie by their doctrine: but to partake to the pleaſure of good lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
            <p>Some perchance, for what I have ſaid (for I cannot expect it ſhould pleaſe all men) will be ready to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, or to traduce me, for one that is no friend to Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. Truly, I ſhould be ſorry to give juſt cauſe: I wiſh, where there is one, there might be two; ſo the Miniſters be Orthodox, and that it be not to the prejudice of Gods holy Word. I think the better of them, becauſe I doubt much, when they come to be diſuſed, or leſs uſed, learning in general (for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempory pratlings of illiterate Phanaticks, and Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſts, I do not call <hi>Sermons)</hi> will ſuffer; as at this day,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95247:20"/>
in <hi>Moſcovia,</hi> and divers other places. But I muſt ſuſpect his ſincerity to Religion, that is not ſenſible of the wrong done unto Gods holy Word, by thoſe, who ſeem (but for their own ends, I doubt) to be moſt zealous for Sermons.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> what he was for a Preacher, his very name or ſurname rather, (<gap reason="foreign">

It grieved his pious ſoul, when he obſerved, that there was no ſuch crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when the Word of God was read in time of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service, as when he preached. In one place, he doth expoſtulate the matter with his auditors: and among other things, ſticks not to tell them, that <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> (Pulpit Preaching) was not abſolutely neceſſary, but only for the daintineſs of men: the bare Word of God, that was read in the Church, being ſufficient to ſalvation: <gap reason="foreign">

But becauſe you muſt hear with pleaſure, that is it, that makes you to require this way of Preaching alſo.</hi> And
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95247:21"/>
then he meets with another objection; that it is tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and unpleaſing, to hear the ſame thing (though it be the Scripture) over and over, often: which they muſt needs do, if they did conſtantly, as was required, attend the Service. It is excellently well anſwered by him. O, that all popular Preachers (I intend it not as a reproach; for I look upon it, as a great bleſſing, if it be well uſed) would imitate this pious mans zeal, for God and his holy Word! who are ſo far from it, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, that it is their endeavour and main deſign (it is for their honour and reputation: but for their profit too; and to the advantage of their cauſe, moſt of all) to maintain the people in that conceit, that <hi>Sermons</hi> are the only <hi>Word of God;</hi> that there is no Preaching of the Word, but that: that to love <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> and to run after <hi>Sermons,</hi> is a certain ſign of grace and regeneration; that God loves them, and they love God: and in that conceit, though their lives and their actions ſhew nothing of the <hi>power of godlineſs;</hi> how many live and dye!</p>
            <p>This was the zeal of this holy Father, for Gods holy Word, read in the Church publickly, in time of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service. Who nevertheleſs himſelf, was a zealous conſtant Preacher of the Word, as any age (though moſt Biſhops, great Preachers, then) hath known: and as much followed, and admired, by all ſorts of people. Some part of the year, he preached every day; and yet could not preach often enough, to ſatisfie the longings of the people: a man indeed endowed with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary parts, for that holy function. And leaſt any
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95247:21"/>
man for want of piety and induſtry (though piety in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if true and real, will make a man induſtrious) ſhould be ready to take the advantage of theſe words of St. <hi>Chryſostome,</hi> that Sermons are not needful: let them know, that though juſt indignation, and a holy zeal, for Gods holy Word, and the Church Service, made him ſay ſo here: yet that it was not his opinion, abſolutely and poſitively; as may appear, not only by his practice (the beſt evidence) but alſo by what he writes elſewhere; as particularly upon 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. <gap reason="foreign">
