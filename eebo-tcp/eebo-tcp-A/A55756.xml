            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not unknowne unto all our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on how often our God hath delivered us even from the jawes of Death, as heretofore from the <hi>Powder plot,</hi> and the <hi>Spanish Invasion,</hi> so now also from the <hi>Soldan</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> whose greatest pride would be to make our CHRIST give place to idolatrous <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet;</hi> I mean to change our Religion which is now extant among us, thinking by force to overthrow the All-seeing and all-creating God; and thus it lately happened.</p>
            <p>The great <hi>Soldan</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> hearing of this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which lately happened between us and our neighbours the <hi>Scots,</hi> thinkes by policy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares to surprize this Land, and make himselfe the King of that sweet and plenteous Westerne Island, sends for the chief Governours of his Countrey, and thus he bespake them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Most loyall Governours, for I have no other occasion to give a worse Title unto you, by reason I never found you any way disloyall unto me. The occasion that we have sent for you at this time is, to give you intelligence of what we would have to be done, which are these things which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, Bashaw</hi> Rackby, <hi>I make you our chief Generall.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95045:3"/>
of our royall Navy, which I would have with all speed as possibly you can to be rigged and hoisted towards</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>for I hunger and thirst for that little Island, which floweth with milke and honey; make all speed as possibly you now can, for I protest my thoughts will never rest till I shall hear some good newes from you concerning this Voyage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, I desire Bashaw</hi> Ofti, <hi>our near Cousin to undertake that great charge, which rested on thy shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, I request our Master of</hi> Malta <hi>to settle the valiant</hi> Bernardo <hi>in his room, and to accompany Bashaw</hi> Rackby, <hi>our chief Generall in these imployments.</hi> Thus he made his minde knowne, but he had no sooner ended his speech, but Bashaw <hi>Rackby</hi> made him this reply.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My most Soveraigne Lord, I am proud that you will honour meso farre as to put me into such a noble service, for such honourable imployment best befits my nature to accomplish, and either I will bring</hi> England <hi>in subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or else I will spend the dearest blood I have in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and thus much I will promise, either to accomplish what you desire, or else never to see your face again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am glad,</hi> (replied the <hi>Soldan) to see that you are so forward to go when I shall desire, and my propheticke heart divines, that sure your journey will be prosperous.</hi> And so they took their leaves, and departed to their Ships, and made every thing ready for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95045:3"/>
the next morning being come they boorded their Ships, and hoised up sailes, and the windes blew very fitly for <hi>England,</hi> there was such a serene calme upon the seas, that the sailer had no need to use the oares, but they lie sleeping upon the deckes, which mildenesse of the Seas made the fool-hardy <hi>Babylonians,</hi> to thinke that God was surely on their side, praising their great Prophet <hi>Mahomet</hi> in songs and hymnes, and such like merry glee; nay, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade my selfe, they thought the Deed they went about to be meritorious; but they perceived their folly in an instant, for upon a suddain, the Windes began to turne and beat them backe very vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Skies were mantled with clouds, and they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver expected to see another day, insomuch that they cast all their riches into the Seas, never thinking to survive to enjoy any thing, at last the Windes cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and the clouds began to cast themselves in heapes to give way to the light, insomuch that they percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved themselves to be cast upon the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> shore: well, there they sold some part of their jewels, which were left them, for those necessaries, which were fitting for their journey, and now although they perceived the angry Heavens to repell them, and were unwilling of their journey, yet they would shew themselves to be obstinately impudent, and forwards they, came for <hi>England</hi> with all might and main: but they had not gone above the space of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty leagues, when there was another accident which befell them, as bad, or rather worse than the first; and thus it hapened:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:95045:4"/>
As their proud Ships came dancing and capering upon the foaming waves, they perceived a Navy of Ships from far, as great in number, or greater than theirs; well, in an instant, they came within ken, that they knew one another, and the <hi>Babylonians</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them to be of the <hi>Dunkirks,</hi> which were as it were Outlawes, and lived by robbing upon the Seas. They no sooner came together, but the <hi>Dunkirks</hi> let fly at them, and wished them to yield, the proud Bashaw <hi>Rackby</hi> out of the haughtinesse of his sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke told them, <hi>That they should win it and wear it, for he would not yield upon such easie tearmes.</hi> Well, to it they went, incontinently there began a great sea-fight between them, Cannons were roaring, and bullets were flying, and every man there stood in danger of dying: at last, the Fight grew so hot, that it was impossible to last long, it was so dangerous, for Death seated himselfe upon the hatches, colouring the Seas with a bloudy dye, and to make short of our story, the <hi>Dunkirks</hi> had the better of it, for the <hi>Babylonians</hi> and all their Ships but one were buried in the Sea; there might you have seen broken plankes to swim upon the top of the water, and shipwrackt goods in abundance; but now you must understand, that this Ship which escaped gained its freedom by flight, and posted with all speed towards the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and so to the <hi>Soldans</hi> Court, where when they came, one <hi>Silvinus Muckshaw</hi> a Captain undertook to tell the newes first, which when he came, and the <hi>Soldan</hi> understood the losse of his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95045:4"/>
Worthies, and his goods, he strook the Captain such a blow under the ear, that he never rose again. But his passion so much prevailed over him that he knew not what he did, for he fell starke mad upon an instant, and much ado they had to hinder him for working mischief upon himselfe and others; yet at length what by perswasions and force they got him to his chamber, and so to bed; but now when he perceived himselfe to be restrained from doing open mischief, he began to plot with himselfe how he might end his owne miserable dayes, also ending others with him, for he desired company with him, and thus he acted it; It was when the Sun had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook the Horoscope, and <hi>Luna</hi> had graced the Zenith with her lightsom favours, all persons being at rest, and nothing waking of man, or bird, or beast, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the dolefull <hi>Nightingall,</hi> who kept her selfe awake against a Thorne, or the Owle, whose greatest delight is in solitarinesse, and flying abroad in the night-times; it was then, I say, that he arose, espy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no body stirring, and having a tapour burning at his beds head, that he took and fired the Palace about his owne eares and others, after he had locked the doores that none could escape, but it would have made a flinty heart to dissolve into teares to hear what piteous moan was made by men, women, and children, which were locked up there, as also to see how the aspiring fire did ascend, throwing downe such stately buildings: there might you have seen brave Architectures tumbled topsie turvy, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95045:5"/>
at last consumed to nothing. Thus Readers may you see and hear daily how those do speed, who are set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themselves against our God, who is the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the Beginning and the End.</p>
