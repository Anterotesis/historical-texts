         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THeſe Papers are not proſtrate at your Royal Feet for
Patrociny; they beg nothing of your Majeſties, but
Pardon and Acceptance: They need no Shelter; the
Winds never hurt ſuch Shrubs as theſe: but if they
<hi>need</hi> it, they <hi>deſerve</hi> none. This Addreſs therefore is pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Reſult of a certain rapturous Exceſs of Joy and
Gratitude, for that late wonderful Deliverance of this
Church and Nation, which it has pleas'd Almighty God to
give us by your Sacred Majeſties unparallel'd Vertue and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.
Such elevated Affections will be offering ſomething,
even tho they have nothing fit to offer. I only ſay, that my
<hi>Deſign</hi> is good; which is to make it evident to your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties,
and to all the World, in my way (that is, by Scripture-Prophecy)
what a <hi>Heavenly</hi> Church, even in the Eſteem of God
himſelf, your Majeſties have ſav'd from Ruin. May your Reign
be made as glorious and as proſperous in protecting it. And
let it not be imputed to me as a Crime, if in my Zeal for my
Holy Mother, I aſſume the Freedom for this once, to declare
to your Majeſties what I ſeem to have learn'd from the Word
of God, That in covering the eſtabliſh'd Church, your Reign
will be truly glorious and proſperous.</p>
            <p>Your Majeſties may alſo have the ſatisfaction here to ſee
how highly God has own'd your Royal Proteſtant-Predeceſſors
<pb facs="tcp:61686:3"/>
and Progenitors. And as my Method leads me to it, I doubt
not but, by God's Aſſiſtance, to ſhew as great Things of your
Majeſties, when once I have prepar'd the way for it. In the
mean time the whole World is Witneſs, that You are the
choſen Servants of Jeſus Chriſt. Choſen, I mean, not by
Man, but by God only. For how can that Act of Man be
call'd a Choice, that was ſo apparently over-rul'd by an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Hand, juſtified by ſo unqueſtionable a Right, extorted
by ſo irreſiſtible a Merit?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I conclude with my hearty Prayers for the beſt of Princes
in the beſt of words, which are thoſe of our Common-Prayer-Books
(ſo <hi>We</hi> call them, but <hi>God</hi> calls them</hi>

<hi>That the</hi>

            <head>An ESSAY upon the Fourth and Fifth Chapters of
the Revelation, ſhewing from the principal Characters
of the Viſion, that the Church of ENGLAND B.
L. E. is particularly deſcribed therein.</head>
            <p>MY Deſign at preſent is not to give an Explication of this
Viſion, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (as they call it) but only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
the main Strokes of it. And becauſe I intend to
be very ſhort, I ſhall forbear all prefacing, and content
my ſelf with only minding the Reader, That in a late Book, entitled,
<hi>A Reſolution of three Queſtions,</hi> &amp;c. I have clearly prov'd (for ought
I find to the contrary,) 1. <hi>That the fourth and fifth Chapters of the</hi>
Revelation, <hi>are properly a Prophecy of things to come to paſs after
St.</hi> John<hi>'s receiving the Viſion of them. 2. That by</hi> Opening <hi>the
ſealed Book,</hi> Rev. v. <hi>is meant, or prefigur'd the</hi> Explaining <hi>of it.</hi>
3. <hi>That by the</hi> Throne <hi>in both thoſe Chapters is meant a Throne of
God on</hi> Earth, <hi>and not his Throne in the higheſt Heaven.</hi> From theſe
Principles, which I take to be evidently and demonſtrably certain (for
which I refer my ſelf to the afore-ſaid Book,) I now come to give
ſome general Account of the meaning of the Viſion.</p>
            <p>And ſince it appears, that the ſaid Chapters are a continued order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Relation of Things ſeen by St. <hi>John,</hi> as Types of Things to come
to paſs <hi>after,</hi> and which were not in being at the time of his recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Viſion: if in looking forward from that time, we could but
pitch upon any one remarkable Paſſage in the Viſion, and apply it
certainly to its proper Event, we ſhould be in a very fair way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
the whole Prophecy, ſo far as it is fulfilled; it being no
very hard matter for thoſe that have any skill in the Prophetic Stile,
to apply Prophecy to Hiſtory, when they know whereabouts to ſeek
for it. Now, if I be not very much miſtaken, the ſecond Verſe of
<hi>Rev.</hi> v. is of that Nature; I mean, ſuch as may certainly and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragably
be applied to its proper Event. Here therefore we muſt
fix our Engine, (to wit, upon the Point of Time referr'd to in that
Paſſage) if e're we hope to move this dark Prophetic World (which,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61686:4"/>
like the Natural one, conſiſts of Heaven, Earth, Sea, and Creatures
in them) into ſome better Light, than it has yet been view'd in.</p>
            <p>The words of <hi>Rev.</hi> v. 2. are theſe, <hi>And I ſaw a ſtrong Angel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
with a loud Voice, Who is worthy to open the Book, and to
looſe the Seals of it?</hi> That by <hi>Angels</hi> in the Viſion, are meant <hi>Men</hi>
in the Completion, there needs no other proof than the unanimous
Conſent of all Interpreters whatſoever, who thus expound the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
of the ſeven Churches.</hi> But I have more particularly<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> Reſol. of three Queſtions, <hi>pag.</hi> 15, 16, 17, &amp;c.</note> prov'd,
as to the Prophecy we are now upon, that it concerns only things
that were to come to paſs on <hi>Earth;</hi> and conſequently this Angel
muſt be ſome mortal Man. But it cannot be any Man of an <hi>ordinary</hi>
Character; foraſmuch as he is ſet forth to be a <hi>ſtrong</hi> Angel, and
ſaid to have proclaim'd with a <hi>loud</hi> Voice. The Subſtance of his
Proclamation we have in theſe words, <hi>Who is worthy to open the Book,
and to looſe the Seals of it?</hi> The Book is the ſame which the Lamb
takes out of the Hand of the Sitter on the Throne, <hi>Rev.</hi> v. 7. and
opens, <hi>Rev.</hi> vi. 2, &amp;c. where alſo we have the Contents of each Seal
ſet down in order. By <hi>Opening</hi> its Seals, is meant <hi>Explaining</hi> it;
and, by being <hi>worthy</hi> to open them, is meant being <hi>able</hi> to do it;
as it is expounded in the very next Verſe, <hi>viz. Rev.</hi> v. 3.</p>
            <p>Let us ſee now if we can find, in all the time from St. <hi>John</hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
this Viſion downwards, any ſuch Perſon, being a Man of
extraordinary Quality, to have made a publick and ſolemn Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
in the hearing of the whole World (as it were) to the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
purpoſe, and we may certainly perſwade our ſelves, that He
is that very Perſon referr'd to in the Prophecy.</p>
            <p>One I know, that fully anſwers every one of theſe Particulars;
and I believe the whole Series of Hiſtory from St. <hi>John</hi>'s time to
ours, affords no other Inſtance. I mean King <hi>James</hi> of famous Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
in his Preface to his <hi>Apology for the Oath of Allegiance,
pag. 108. lin.</hi> 1, 2, &amp;c. It cannot be denied but K. <hi>James</hi> was a
<hi>ſtrong Angel,</hi> as being Soveraign Monarch of three flouriſhing and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Kingdoms. And it is as evident, that he ſpake in that Preface
with a very <hi>loud Voice;</hi> for he inſcribes it himſelf expreſly, <hi>To all
Chriſtian Monarchs, Free Princes, and States.</hi> So that he muſt needs
have been heard far and near. If therefore his Proclamation be for
Subſtance the very ſame with that in the Prophecy, what doubt can
remain, but that the Prophecy is to be expounded of it; and that
its Author, the King, is that ſtrong Angel there ſpoken of?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We muſt know then, that this good King, after having given
his</hi> Conjectures <hi>(as himſelf calls them) upon ſeveral Paſſages in the</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:61686:4"/>
               <hi>SEALED-BOOK, </hi>endeavouring to find the Antichriſt in them (as
may be ſeen in<hi> pag. 84, 85, 6, 7, 8. &amp;c.) </hi>concludes that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
in theſe words (p. 108. lin. 1.) <hi>My only Wiſh ſhall be, That
if any Man ſhall have a fancy to refute this my Conjecture of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,
that he anſwer me orderly to every part of my Diſcourſe; not
contenting him to diſprove my Opinion; except he ſet down ſome other
Method after his Form, for Interpretation of that BOOK OF THE
APOCALYPS, which may not contradict no part of the Text, nor
contain no Abſurdities. Otherwiſe it is an eaſy thing for </hi>Momus<hi> to
pick quarrels in another Man's tale, and tell it worſe himſelf; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a more eaſy practice to find Faults, than to amend them. </hi>Theſe
are the King's own words; ſo plain and applicable of themſelves,
that without troubling the Reader with any Remarks upon them, I
appeal to his Judgment and Conſcience, whether he do not think
them to be the ſame for ſubſtance with the Proclamation in the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,<hi>Who is worthy to open the Book, and to looſe the Seals
thereof?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since therefore every Particular anſwers ſo exactly to the Viſion,
and the Caſe is ſo uncommon and extraordinary, that nothing like
it can be produc'd from the beginning of the World to this Time,
we muſt never hope to attain the ſenſe of any Prophecy, if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſee a Truth ſo manifeſt as this is, <hi>viz.</hi> That in our Gracious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
King <hi>James</hi> the firſt, was fulfilled that which is foretold
<hi>Rev.</hi> v. 2. of the ſtrong Angel proclaiming with a loud Voice,
<hi>Who is worthy to open the Book, and to looſe the Seals thereof?</hi> And
though this Truth (as many other things) may ſeem ſo ſtrange at
firſt, that we ſhall hardly truſt our very ſenſes in atteſting it: yet (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
grounded on ſo certain Evidence) I make no doubt but when a
little thinking ſhall have rendred it familiar, we ſhall eaſily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
it.</p>
            <p>Taking therefore this ſo unqueſtionable a Truth for our Key to the
whole Prophecy, let us try if we can penetrate any further into the
Receſſes of it; by taking a general view of ſome of the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
Paſſages that precede, and ſome others that ſuccede this of
the <hi>ſtrong Angel proclaiming.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we look backward, we find in the Verſe next before <hi>(viz. Rev.</hi>
v. 1.) The Sitter on the Throne repreſented with the <hi>ſealed Book</hi> in
his <hi>Right Hand.</hi> Can any thing be conceiv'd a more lively and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Reſemblance of <hi>THE DEFENDER OF THE FAITH</hi>
(the peculiar Title of our Kings) than this? Who knows not that
the <hi>right Hand</hi> is both the Inſtrument, and the Symbol, of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61686:5"/>
protection? And as for the Book, it is manifeſtly a part of
that Sacred Volume, wherein the whole Faith of a Chriſtian is
comprehended. And it is withal, ſuch a part of it, as perhaps no
King in the whole World has ever taken in hand to that purpoſe as
the King we ſpeak of did, who is as zealous in expounding it, as
any Interpreter we ſhall meet with. From hence therefore there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth
another great aſſurance to us, that the former part of <hi>Rev.</hi> v.
is a Prophecy relating to the Perſon of that excellent Monarch.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But how comes the King to be repreſented as <hi>God,</hi> fitting
in a Throne, <hi>Rev.</hi> v. 1. and in the very next <hi>Verſe,</hi> only as as a <hi>ſtrong
Angel, i. e.</hi> a <hi>Miniſter</hi> of God? I anſwer; Becauſe in <hi>DEFEND<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING
the FAITH</hi> of that Book with his right Hand, he did the
part of a King, or earthly God; but in ſhewing himſelf ſo ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
for the underſtanding of it, he appear'd but like a Miniſter, or
Divine, or (in the phraſe of the Apocalyps) an <hi>Angel</hi> of the Church.
It is the King's own diſtinction;<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 4. of the Preface before cited.</note> 
               <hi>I thought it</hi> (ſays he) <hi>not comely
for me being a King, to put my Name to Books concerning ſcholaſtic
Diſputations, whoſe Calling is to ſet forth Decrees in the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
Mood, &amp;c.</hi> Whence you ſee how fitly (even according to
the ſenſe of the King himſelf) he is ſet forth in the firſt Verſe as
<hi>God;</hi> in the next, but as an <hi>Angel.</hi> Tho even in that, his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
is obſerv'd in a great meaſure, he being repreſented, not as an
<hi>ordinary Angel,</hi> but as a <hi>ſtrong</hi> One, with a <hi>loud Voice.</hi> In like
manner, and for a like reaſon, the ſame Perſon who is call'd at
<hi>Verſ.</hi> 5. a <hi>LION,</hi> is in the very next exhibited as a <hi>LAMB.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence I ſhall deduce this Corollary (which alſo every Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
hereafter to be diſcuſs'd, will confirm) That by the <hi>Sitter on
the Throne</hi> is meant the <hi>Kings of ENGLAND;</hi> or elſe, how
comes King <hi>James</hi> to be found upon it? (For it is evident that he
wrote the Book afore-quoted, after he was come to the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Throne.) I muſt deſire it alſo to be obſerv'd, That in Scripture-Prophecy,
one King, or Sitter on a Throne, is ſet to ſignify a whole
Succeſſion of them. Which is ſo well known to all the Candidates
of Prophecy, that I muſt not waſte my time in the proof of it.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore look back to the <hi>IVth</hi> Chapter; where, from
what has been ſaid, any one would expect to find ſome mention of
the great Atchievements of the Glorious and Renowned Queen <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth;</hi>

find the Sitter on the Throne to be deſcrib'd there <hi>(verſ.</hi> 3.) as

the peculiar Ornament of Great Ladies. The <hi>Rainbow round
about her Throne, in ſight like an Emerald,</hi> is her excellent Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(the beſt Jewel in her Crown) by whoſe Concurrence the
Church deſcrib'd in the next Verſes, was eſtabliſh'd. For <hi>Waters</hi> in
this Prophecy are expreſly ſaid to ſignify <hi>People, Rev.</hi> xvii. 15. And
therefore the Waters that are above the Earth (in which the <hi>Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow</hi>
is always painted) muſt ſignify People of the <hi>higheſt Quality;</hi>
of which our Parliaments conſiſt. And it is further obſervable, that
a <hi>great many</hi> Witneſſes of the Truth (ſuch as the Parliament we
ſpeak of was) are remarkably call'd a <hi>Cloud, Heb.</hi> xii. 1. So that
the Rain-bow here, may very well be expounded of the Parliament
in the firſt of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> For that incomparable Princeſs,
coming after the Deluge of Popery that her Siſter had brought upon
the Church, and like the Sun in the Firmament, darting her bright
Beams of Goſpel-Light upon her Parliament, that attended on her
Throne; how could it more fitly be repreſented, than by a <hi>Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow?</hi>
Which alſo is a happy Omen, that our Church ſhould never
more be drown'd in Popiſh Superſtitions. The 24 <hi>Elders</hi> ſitting on
ſo many Thrones (or Seats) and crowned, are the inferior Clergy,
by whom the Reformation was begun, while the Biſhops (all of
them almoſt) adher'd to Popery. Theſe Elders therefore now, as
having obtain'd ſo ſignal a Victory, are repreſented with <hi>golden
Crowns,</hi> and <hi>white Robes,</hi> the conſtant Emblems of Succeſs to the
Evangelical Party. The <hi>Thunders, Lightnings, and Voices</hi> from the
Throne, are the <hi>Laws</hi> then made for diſpoſſeſſing the Romaniſts. The
<hi>ſeven Lamps of Fire,</hi> are a Type of the Church, divided (according
to the ſolemn<note n="*" place="margin">Thus the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Seals</hi> of the Book, <hi>Chap.

And this Seal is called ſeven Seals, only in reſpect of the Diviſion of the Book into ſeven Parts. For if the Spirit had been pleas'd to conſider the Book without reſpect to any diviſion, he would have mention'd but one Seal. And again, if he had pleas'd to divide the Book into ſeven times ſeven Parts, he would have made ſo many Seals.

only of the Holy Trinity (and not as formerly, of Saints and

that is given by the Church to the bleſſed Trinity. But I deſire it
may be conſider'd, that no account can be given in this way, of the

            <p>At length, to wit, <hi>Anno</hi> 1632, appears Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> being one of
the <hi>Elders</hi> of this Church, with an admirable Explication of the
Book. And he is the firſt that ever hit upon the way of it. Which,
as it is eaſily defended, and is actually done by Dr. <hi>H. More</hi> in a little
Treatiſe he calls <hi>Appendicula Apocalyptica;</hi> ſo is it openly confeſs'd
by<note n="†" place="margin">Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, <hi>Par.</hi> I. <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.</note> Mr. <hi>Jurieux,</hi> a learned Writer of the French Church, in theſe
words; <hi>Joſeph Mede, in my Opinion, is the firſt that underſtood any
thing of the Sealed Book.</hi> And it is evident that Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> has got
the Name of expounding the <hi>ſealed Book,</hi> from all Interpreters
whatſoever: there being no Man that has expounded any one Seal
to purpoſe, but he is a profeſſed Follower (that I may not ſay, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer)
of Mr. <hi>Mede.</hi> Inſomuch that even thoſe Judicious and
Learned Divines (for in this Stile their Title-page ſpeaks them)
the Continuators of Mr. <hi>Pool</hi>'s Work, tho they ſhew themſelves very
loth to follow him (as being perhaps of a different Communion)
yet are they forc'd to do it, almoſt all along, with frequent Elogies of
his Fame and Learning. And where they venture to diſſent from
him, they are very unhappy; of which this Paper will admit of but
one Inſtance, which is this. Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> expounds the firſt Seal
(containing a Viſion of a <hi>White Horſe,</hi> whoſe Rider <hi>went forth
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61686:7"/>
conquering and to conquer)</hi> of the wonderful ſucceſs of the Preachers
of the Goſpel. This the Divines think to mend, by expounding it
of the Victories of the Roman Heathen Emperors. But they conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
not, that <hi>Whiteneſs,</hi> tho it be uſed in the <hi>Revelation</hi> twenty times
(if I have rightly computed them) yet it is never applied but only
to the Saints. Beſides, particularly as to <hi>Horſes</hi> of a white Colour,

14. and he will be afraid to interpret them to any other purpoſe than
Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> has done. For it is a very dangerous thing to give away
the peculiar Badg and Livery of the Servants of Jeſus Chriſt to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,
tho Emperors. For indeed, the Colour of the Roman Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors
was not <hi>White,</hi> but <hi>Red</hi> (that is, bloody) and expreſly ſo
call'd, <hi>Rev.</hi> xii. 3. as the Divines aforeſaid own upon the place. But
if any Conqueſts were of a deep Crimſon, they were the Victories
they atchieved over the Saints; of which yet the Divines do not
bluſh to expound the White Horſe and his Rider, as the more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Opinion. Laſtly, it ought alſo to be conſider'd, that the Rider
in the firſt Seal went forth <hi>CONQ<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ERING AND TO CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Q<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ER;</hi>
which is no Tautology (tho the Divines are pleas'd to
over-look it) nor is the like Expreſſion us'd (that I remember)
any other where. But it is very appoſite to expreſs the going forth
of Jeſus Chriſt in his bleſſed Apoſtles, to eſtabliſh ſuch a Kingdom,
as ſhould never be deſtroy'd, but ſhould ſubdue<note n="†" place="margin">Dan. vii. 27. Rev. xi. 15.</note> all other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
to it ſelf for ever. Whereas if we apply it to the Roman
Emperors, it is both frivolous and falſe. The former, becauſe the
Conqueſts of <hi>Rome</hi> were in a manner finiſhed before the Times there
referr'd to. It was <hi>Senectus Imperii,</hi> the old-Age of the Empire, as
<note n="‖" place="margin">Proaem, ad <hi>lib.</hi> 1.</note> 
               <hi>Florus</hi> calls it. And the latter, becauſe <hi>Rome</hi> never could be ſaid
to go forth <hi>CONQ<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ERING AND TO CONQ<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ER</hi> (unleſs
we will make the Repetition to ſignify juſt nothing) but rather, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
for a while, that afterwards ſhe might tumble down, and
break in pieces with her own weight.</p>
            <p>Thus much I thought good to ſay upon this occaſion in Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> that it might not appear ſtrange, if we fix upon
him for the <hi>Elder</hi> predicted in <hi>Rev.</hi> v. 5. that gave the firſt notice to
the Church, of Chriſt's having prevail'd to expound the ſealed Book;
for Chriſt was pleas'd to uſe him as his Inſtrument in expounding it.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61686:7"/>
And this Expoſition was ſet forth<note n="*" place="margin">So the Author himſelf dates his Epiſte to the Reader.</note> 
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1632, that is, in the
Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, of bleſſed Memory; which is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
by that Elder's being here made to give Chriſt the Title of
<hi>the Lion of the Tribe of</hi> Juda, <hi>the Root of</hi> David: For Chriſt is

and followed his Fortunes. Theſe own'd him, when the reſt made
it their conſtant buſineſs to oppoſe him; and at laſt depriv'd him, not
of his Kingdom only, but his Life. Well therefore is he likened
to <hi>the Lion of the Tribe of</hi> Juda.</p>
            <p>And he is call'd <hi>the Root of</hi> David, as being (when Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>
put forth his Expoſition) the Father of that afterwards ſo Glorious
Monarch K. <hi>Charles</hi> the Second; who carried in his Life and Reign
ſo intimate a Reſemblance to the Patriarch <hi>David.</hi> For which it may
ſuffice to refer the Reader to the Service of the Church, ſet-forth
upon Occaſion of his Majeſty's moſt happy Reſtauration; for
there the Parallel is conſpicuous. Only one thing may yet further be
obſerved; that, as<note n="†" place="margin">2 Sam. vi. 17.</note> 
               <hi>David,</hi> ſo K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. alſo, <hi>brought in again

remarkable, that it might juſtly prejudice the whole Hypotheſis I

Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s Expoſition) there be no notice taken of the various for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes

of the Church, and killing of the King for ſtanding by it, and uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Son's throne for twelve Years time, on the one ſide; and
then, the wonderful Work of God in reſtoring both King and
Church in the Year 1660, on the other ſide, are things as worthy
to be made the ſubject of this Prophecy, as any thing that has, or

               <hi>had been ſent forth
tho now returned,) into all the Earth.</hi> That by this Lamb is meant
the Church, appears not only by his Horns (which conſtantly in
<hi>Daniel,</hi> and in this Prophecy, ſignify Kingdoms; and, we know,
the Kingdom of the Lamb is his Church;) and by his <hi>Eyes,</hi> which
are expounded <hi>the Spirits,</hi> Angels, or Miniſters of God, <hi>that had

               <note n="†" place="margin">They are the ſame <hi>Spirits, (i. e.</hi> Miniſters of the ſame Church, which was eſtabliſh'd by Qu. <hi>Eliz.</hi>) that are ſpoken of here, and in <hi>Rev. iv.</hi> 5. only here they are ſaid to have been <hi>ſent forth,</hi> or driven from their Reſidencies, in the Sectarian Perſecution; which had never happen'd before to the Church by her eſtabliſh'd. And note, that as the <hi>Lamb</hi> ſignifies Chriſt, or his Church; ſo the ſeven <hi>Spirits</hi> ſignify the Holy Ghoſt, or his Miniſters, indifferently as the Senſe requires.</note> 
               <hi>ſent forth into all the Earth,</hi> or expos'd (as we ſay) to the
wide World (during the King's exile,) but were now reſtor'd to
their rights again: but alſo from an unqueſtionable place in <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii.
14. where it is ſaid of Antichriſt, and his Complices, that they
ſhould <hi>make War with the Lamb, and the Lamb ſhould overcome
them; for he is Lord of Lords, and King of Kings, &amp;c.</hi> Now it
is evident, that Antichriſt neither did, nor could make War againſt
the <hi>Perſon</hi> of Chriſt, but only againſt his <hi>Church;</hi> whence it unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably
follows, that by the Lamb is meant the Church of Chriſt;
or rather, Chriſt victorious in his Church; for it could not elſe be
ſaid of the Lamb, that he is <hi>Lord of Lords, and King of Kings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us therefore, in the Verſe we are upon, underſtand by the <hi>Lamb
ſlain,</hi> Chriſt in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> naturally ſlain in the Perſon
of his Repreſentative, King <hi>Charles,</hi> I, and politically ſlain in the
King his Son, and in the Church, which ran the ſame fate with
them; and then, by the <hi>Lamb</hi> looking <hi>as if it had been ſlain</hi> (that is,
revived after Slaughter) <hi>and ſtanding in the midſt of the Throne,</hi> &amp;c.
muſt needs be ſignified the Reſtauration of the King and Church,
who <hi>came, and took the Book out of the right Hand of him that
ſat upon the Throne,</hi> ver. 7. that is, he came and took the Regal
Power (to which it peculiarly belongs to <hi>DEFEND the FAITH</hi>
of that Book) out of the Hand of him, or them, who at that time
were in Poſſeſſion of it.</p>
            <p>And it evidently appears yet further, that this Lamb cannot be
Chriſt in Perſon, taking any Book out of the Father's right Hand;
1. Becauſe St. <hi>John</hi> did not ſee him all the while till now. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is expreſly ſaid, that he <hi>CAME,</hi> and took the Book;
whereas, if he had been all the while at the Sitter's right Hand
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61686:8"/>
before, it could not have been ſaid, that he <hi>CAME</hi> and took
the Book out of it. 3. Becauſe upon the Lamb's taking the
Book, <hi>the Elders</hi> (who are certainly Mortals upon Earth; the
word never having been us'd to expreſs any other) <hi>ſung a new
Song,</hi> ver. 8, 9. which ſhews, that they ſaw the doing of it; and
conſequently, that it was done on Earth; and therefore not by
Chriſt in Perſon. All which I here offer, beſides eight Arguments
in my <hi>Reſolution,</hi> &amp;c. to prove the Throne to be an <hi>Earthly
Throne.</hi> It remains therefore that all theſe things were ſuffer'd
and done by Chriſt in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt and Second, and in
the Church in their times; ſince every thing agrees thereto ſo
exactly, and is not applicable to any other King and Church in the
whole World.</p>
            <p>I have here given only a taſte of my intended Expoſition; but
ſuch a one as is ſufficient to convince any Man, that is not hardned
againſt Conviction. For he that can think ſo many wonderful
things to have happen'd by chance; and in ſuch <hi>order</hi> too, as to
favour my Hypotheſis, but not at all reſpected by the Spirit in
the Prophecy, is in a very hopeful way of believing the World it
ſelf to have been made by a fortuitous concourſe of Atoms, and
that it is not rather the Contrivance of an Infinite Wiſdom, and
the Workmanſhip of an Almighty Hand. Altho (to note this
alſo by the by) the Hypotheſis I have here laid down, leads me
not only through the Chapters now before us; (as ſhall be ſeen
hereafter, if God will) but as eaſily, and as certainly, through the
whole Book of the <hi>Apocalyps.</hi> In fine, I crave no favour for this
Notion: if it be falſe, let it not want the Cenſure it deſerves; but
if true (as I am certainly perſwaded, and as he will find, that
gives himſelf the trouble to conſider it:) it muſt needs be joyful
News both to the Church of <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> and to all others
that ſhe holds Communion with.</p>
            <p>For, in a word, the Church and Kingdom deſcrib'd in the
fourth and fifth Chapters of the <hi>Revelation</hi> (ſince it is certain that
they are a Body, or Society of Believers Militant in this<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>See the</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſol. of three Queſt.</note> World,
and not Triumphant in the other) muſt needs be that Church (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
State of the Church) which was to ſucceed the fourth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
and is commonly known by the Name of the Fifth:
Becauſe the ſupream viſible Head of it, is likened to God, not
at large, or with reſpect only to his Power, Goodneſs, Wiſdom,
Majeſty, and the like; but with particular relation to his<note n="†" place="margin">Rev. iv. 9, 10. v. 14.</note> 
               <hi>living
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61686:9"/>
for ever and ever.</hi> And ſo likewiſe, when the King and Church
reſtor'd, are ſet forth by that glorious Type of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>a</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Rev. v. 6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>Lamb</hi> [looking] <hi>as if he had been ſlain,</hi> and were
reviv'd again, and exalted to the right Hand of the Throne of
the Majeſty on high; the very ſame thing is intimated, to wit,
that the Kingdom and Church ſignified by the revived Lamb,
ſhould never die, <hi>Death ſhould no more have Dominion over them:</hi>
like as it is noted of the true Lamb after his Reſurrection, <hi>Rom.</hi>
vi. 9. For this Reaſon, I ſay, the Kingdom of the fourth and
fifth Chapters of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> muſt needs be the fifth Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
becauſe the King thereof is likened to God and the Lamb,
with particular reſpect to their <hi>living for ever and ever.</hi> For
as every King reſembles God in his <hi>Power;</hi> ſo none reſembles God
in his <hi>Truth,</hi> but a Lover and Defender of the Truth; none in
his <hi>Mercy and Goodneſs,</hi> but a Merciful and Good King; none in
his <hi>Immortality,</hi> but a King, or (which is all one in Prophecy)
a Succeſſion of Kings, that ſhall never have an end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now there never was, nor ever will be any ſuch Succeſſion,
but only that of the fifth Monarchy. And this is call'd</hi> a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
which ſhall never be deſtroyed; neither ſhall it be left to other
People, but it ſhall break in pieces and conſume all the other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
and it ſhall ſtand for ever, <hi>Dan. ii. 44. The like is ſaid</hi>
Dan. <hi>vii.</hi> 27. And the Kingdom and Dominion, and the Greatneſs
of the Kingdom under the whole Heaven, ſhall be given to the
People of the Saints of the Moſt High, whoſe Kingdom is an
Everlaſting Kingdom, and all Dominions ſhall ſerve and obey
him.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, That the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> was deſtroy'd by
the Rebellious Parliament in Forty Eight; I anſwer, A King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is not ſaid in Scripture to be deſtroy'd, unleſs it be ſeiz'd
by <hi>another People.</hi> And this is abundantly evident in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Kingdom; which running through ſo many Changes of
Kings, Conſuls, Decemvirs, Tribunes, Dictators, Emperors and
Popes, is yet reckoned but as one and the ſame Kingdom, as will
not be denied by any Man.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Church</hi> indeed is not like a <hi>Kingdom</hi> in this reſpect; for
even Engliſh-Men, if of a different Communion may deſtroy the
Church of <hi>England.</hi> For in ſpiritual things there is as much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
and more, between an Orthodox Engliſh-man, and an
Engliſh-man that is an Heretick or a Schiſmatick; as there is in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61686:9"/>
Civil Matters, between a Native of <hi>England,</hi> and of another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
And as no Man would ſay, that the Church of <hi>England</hi>
was deſtroy'd, when only ſome Members of that Church are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd,
and others of the ſame Communion put in their places
(which yet I pray God may never be,) ſo the Scriptures do not
reckon a Kingdom to be deſtroy'd, no not altho the very Form of
Government be ſubverted (the Caſe of Kingdoms being not ſo
tender in this Point, as that of Churches, whoſe Government
ſeems to be unalterable, as being of Divine Appointment) while
it continuces in the hands of the ſame People. And therefore the
Perpetuity of the fifth Monarchy is remarkably deſcrib'd in theſe
words, amongſt others afore-quoted, that <hi>it ſhall not be left to other
People,</hi> as all the other Monarchies were to be.</p>
            <p>And then, as for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> tho that was to die,
together with the Perſon of the King that was then Head of it:
yet ſince the King (together with the Church) reſtor'd again in
1660, is compar'd to the Lamb ſlain, and riſen again, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
to the right Hand of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> v. 6, 7. there ſeems to be
no fear, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſhould ever be deſtroy'd ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time, ſince it is ſo remarkably ſaid of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf (who
in this is made a Figure of his Church) that <hi>being raiſed from
the Dead he dieth no more, Death hath no more Dominion over
him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, That the Church of <hi>England</hi> is too ſmall and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable
for the Accompliſhment of the things ſpoken of the
fifth Monarchy; I anſwer, the fifth Monarchy is compar'd but to
a <hi>Stone cut out of a Mountain,</hi> Dan. ii. 34, 45. and ſuch is the
<hi>Stone</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to the <hi>Mountain</hi> of the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> out of which it was cut, and that, <hi>without Hands</hi> too:
So that if the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the beginning of its Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
had been vaſt and mighty in Extent and Numbers, it could
not poſſibly have been the fifth Monarchy: but being but a <hi>Stone</hi>
to a <hi>Mountain,</hi> it may very well be it, which ſhall become it ſelf in
time <hi>a great Mountain, and ſhall fill the whole Earth,</hi> Dan. ii. 35.
The like is foretold of this State of the Church, <hi>Iſa.</hi> lx. 22. <hi>A
little one ſhall become a thouſand, and a ſmall one a ſtrong Nation:
I the Lord will haſten it in its time.</hi> Since therefore there is no
queſtion but the fifth Monarchy was to begin in a ſmall People;
and as little, that God can bring his Purpoſes to paſs whenever he
pleaſes: the Littleneſs, the Smallneſs, the Inconſiderableneſs of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61686:10"/>
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> can be no juſt Prejudice againſt its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the fifth Monarchy, but is rather an Argument to evince it.</p>
            <p>But enough of this, and perhaps too much: For what will it all
ſignify? I cannot believe it, ſays one; it is impoſſible, ſays ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
To theſe I ſay, I cannot help their not believing it; and
we know, <hi>with God nothing ſhall be impoſſible.</hi> But if any one of
them will give himſelf the trouble of a diligent and ſerious ſearch
into the Buſineſs; to ſuch a one I dare aver, that he will find it
a far more eaſy and compendious way to disbelieve, than to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it. May the God and <hi>Father of Lights,</hi> ſo illuminate all
our Minds, and ſanctify all our Hearts with his holy Spirit, that
both the erroneous may come over to the Communion of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Church, the wavering may be eſtabliſh'd in it, and the
ſtedfaſt may walk worthy of it. <hi>Amen.</hi>
