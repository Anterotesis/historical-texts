            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN Advertisement.</head>
            <p>THIS Discourse concerning the <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legality</hi> of the Late <hi>Ecclesiastical Commission,</hi> was written when the Author of it was summoned to appear before it; and was in continual Expectation of undergoing its Censure, for not Complying with the Orders of it. This put him upon an Enquiry into the Grounds on which it stood.</p>
            <p>From whence he proceeded to search into the True <hi>Notion</hi> of the <hi>Legal Supremacy;</hi> and finding it very imperfectly set down in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Fifth Report, De Jure Regis Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastico,</hi> he took the Pains to Examin it through every Reign, there mentioned; and upon the whole Matter he finds him and his Adversary <hi>F. P.</hi> equally mistaken. But in the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it he hath rather endeavoured to give Light to the Thing, than to discover any Mans Errors. And it is hardly possible to settle the
<pb facs="tcp:41236:3"/>
               <hi>Notion</hi> of it aright, without considering the <hi>Practice</hi> of other Countries, as well as our own: Of both which the Reader will find a short but impartial Account; which I believe the Author could more easily have inlarged, than have brought it into so narrow a Compass.</p>
            <p>By this, I hope, the World will see, That it was not <hi>Humor</hi> or <hi>Faction,</hi> but a real and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded <hi>Dissatisfaction,</hi> which made those of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> oppose the <hi>Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> of that Time; and that such have as great and real a Zeal for the <hi>Ancient</hi> and <hi>Legal Constitution</hi> of our Government, as those who make a greater <hi>Noise</hi> and <hi>Clamor</hi> about it; and that, not upon any new <hi>Notions</hi> or <hi>Phrases,</hi> but upon the very same Grounds which our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors made use of; and carry in them the true <hi>Basis</hi> of our <hi>English</hi> Government. It is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible some worthy Men may have carried some Notions beyond our <hi>Legal Constitution;</hi> but the more they search into it, the better Opinion they will have of it. Which, I think, is so well setled, that every <hi>Deviation</hi> from it tends to our Ruin.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Dispensing Power,</hi> the Author hath inlarged that Part, since some late Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses have been published, both for and against it. He hath neglected nothing which hath been most plausibly pleaded for it; but hath given a full Answer to the most material Instances which have been insisted on, in behalf of it. And after all,
<pb facs="tcp:41236:3"/>
I cannot but conclude, That the <hi>Dispensing Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> is a kind of <hi>Mental Reservation,</hi> which quite alters the Meaning and Design of a Law.</p>
            <p>When the Late <hi>Ecclesiastical Commission</hi> was <hi>superseded</hi> (if not <hi>dissolved)</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor laid by these Papers as Useless; but having communicated them to one Particular Friend, (whose <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> he had a great Regard to) he hath been prevailed with by him, to make them Publick at this Time: It being still necessary to shew, with what Justice and Reason, we refused to own the <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> of it. And it seems to me as hard to reconcile it to our Laws, as <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Conscience</hi> to the Principles of <hi>Popery,</hi> or the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> to the <hi>Second Commandment.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>The Case stands thus;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>BY the</hi> Act <hi>of 1</hi> Eliz. <hi>1. it was</hi> established and enacted, That such Jurisdictions, Priviledges, Superiorities and Prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies Spiritual and Ecclesiastical, as by any Spiritual or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Power or Authority, have heretofore been or may lawfully be exercised or used for the Visitation of the Ecclesiastical State and Persons, and for Reformation, Order and Correction of the same, and of all manner of Errors, Heresies, Schisms, Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Offences, Contempts and Enormities, shall for ever by this present Parliament be united and annexed to the Imperial Crown of this Realm.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:41236:6"/>
And that the Kings and Queens of this Realm shall have ful Power and Authority by virtue of this Act by Letters Patents un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der the great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> to assign, name and authorize, when and as often as they shall think meet and convenient, and for such and so long time as they shall think meet to exercise, use, occupy and execute all manner of Jurisdictions, Priviledges and Preheminences in any wise, touching or concerning any Spiritual or Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction within these Realms; and to visit, reform, redress, order, correct and amend all such Errors, Heresies, Schisms, Abuses, Offences, Contempts and Enormities what soever, which by any manner of Spiritual or Ecclesiastical Power, Authority or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction can or may lawfully be reformed, ordered, redressed, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, restrained or amended to the Pleasure of Almighty God, the increase of Virtue, and the conservation of the Peace and Unity of this Realm: And that such Person and Persons so to be named, authorized and appointed after the said Letters Patents to him or them made and delivered, shall have full Power and Authority, by virtue of this Act, and of the said Letters Patents to exercise, use and execute all the Premises, according to the Tenour and effect of the said Letters Patents, any Matter or Cause to the contrary, in any wise, notwithstanding.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But in the</hi> Act <hi>17</hi> Car. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>11. after the recital of this latter Clause, these words follow,</hi> And whereas by Colour of some Words in the aforesaid Branch of the said Act, whereby Commissioners areautho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized to execute their Commission, according to the Tenor and Effect of the King's Letters Patents, and by Letters Patents grounded thereupon, the said Commissioners have to the great and unsufferable Wrong and Oppression of the King's Subjects, used to fine and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son them, and to exercise Authority not belonging to Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction restored by that Act; and divers other great Mischiefs and Inconveniences have also ensued to the King's Subjects by occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the said Branch and Commissions issued thereupon, and the Executions thereof; therefore for the Repressing and Preventing of the aforesaid Abuses, Mischiefs and Inconveniences in time to come, Be it enacted by the King's Most Excellent Majesty and the Lords and Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That the aforesaid Branch, Clause, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle or Sentence shall from henceforth be repealed, annulled, revok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, annihilated and made void for ever, any thing in the said Act to the contrary, in any wise, notwithstanding.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then after a Clause relating to</hi> ordinary Jurisdiction, <hi>repealed 13</hi> Car. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>12. the Act concludes thus,</hi> And be it further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, That from and after the said first Day of August, no new Court shall be erected, ordained or appointed within this Realm of <hi>England</hi> or Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> which shall or may have the live Power, Jurisdiction or Authority as the said High-Commission-Court now hath or pretendeth to have, but that all and every such Letters Patents, Commissions and Grants made or to be made by his Majesty, his Heirs and Successors; and all Powers and Authorities granted or pretended, or mentioned to be granted thereby, and all Acts,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41236:6"/>
Sentences and Decrees to be made by virtue or colour thereof, shall be utterly void and of none effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By the</hi> Act, <hi>13</hi> Car. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>12. This Repeal stands good in the first Proviso; and in the second Clause, where that which concerns</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Jurisdictions, <hi>is repealed, an Exception is put in, in these Words,</hi> Excepting what concerns the High-Commission-Court, or the new erecting some such like Court by Commission.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Case which arises from hence, is, Whether these Acts of Parliament only take away the Power of</hi> Fining <hi>and</hi> Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>from any</hi> Ecclesiastical Commission, <hi>granted by the King; so that notwithstanding these Repeals, the King may still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute a</hi> Commission <hi>proceeding by</hi> Ecclesiastical Censures: <hi>And for the same Ends which are expresly mentioned in the Statu te repealed,</hi> viz. To exercise, use, occupy and execute all manner of Jurisdictions, Privileges and Preheminences in any wise touching or concerning any Spiritual or Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction within this Realm of <hi>England,</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> and to visit, reform, order, correct and amend all Abuses, Offences, Contempts and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normities whatsoever, which by the Spiritual and Ecclesiastical Laws of this Realm, can or may lawfully be reformed, ordered, redressed, corrected, restrained, or amended, to the Pleasure of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, the Increase of Vertue, and the Conservation of the Peace and Unity of this Realm. <hi>These are the</hi> Powers <hi>of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> Commission, <hi>and are the same which are mentioned in the Act of</hi> Repeal, <hi>17</hi> Car. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>11. only</hi> Errors, Heresies and Schisms, <hi>being left out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It cannot be denied, That the</hi> Power <hi>of</hi> Fining and Imprisoning, <hi>is most expresly taken away, and that is assigned as one Reason and Occasion of repealing the Clause of 1</hi> Eliz. <hi>1. which esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishes the Court; but I cannot be satisfied, that this was all that was intended by the Act 17</hi> Car. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>11. And that for these Reasons:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1. If no more had been intended, then it had been sufficient to have destroyed the</hi> Letters Patents <hi>by which the Power of</hi> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Imprisoning <hi>was granted, without mentioning the</hi> Act <hi>of</hi> Parliament, <hi>which gives no such Power. But the Act of</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, <hi>17</hi> Car. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>12. begins with the</hi> Act <hi>of</hi> Parliament: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in the Parliament holden in the first Year of Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> there was an Act made and established, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In which Act, among other things, there is contained one Clause, Branch, Article or Sentence, whereby it was Enacted to this effect, <hi>&amp;c. Then follows all the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actin; Clause; and after it, the</hi> Abuses <hi>of the Power, by the</hi> Letters Patents <hi>are reckoned up,</hi> viz.

                  <hi>It is plausibly argued by the Lord</hi> Coke, That the Power to Fine <note place="margin">

                  </note> and Imprison, was not agreeable to the Design of the Act. <hi>1.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Title of it is, An Act restoring to the Crown the Ancient Jurisdiction; but the Ancient Jurisdiction Ecclesiastical had not a Power to Fine and Imprison, but proceeded only by Ecclesiastical Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures. <hi>2.</hi> Because the Power to reform, order and correct all Errors, Heresies, &amp;c. was to be such as may be lawfully reformed, corrected, restrained, or amended by any manner of Spiritual, Ecclesiastical Power, Authority or Jurisdiction, which did not extend to Fine and Imprisonment. <hi>3.</hi> The Tenor of the Letters Patents was to exercise, use and execute all the Premises. Since therefore the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises go no further than Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, the Letters Patents could give no such Power, being in pursuance of the Act. But it is agreed, <hi>saith he,</hi> That before this Act no Man could be punished by Fine and Imprisonment by any Ecclesiastical Power, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it were by force of some Act of Parliament. <hi>But because the Act saith,</hi> They are to use and execute all the Premises according to the Tenor and Effect of the Letters Patents; <hi>Others have thought, That</hi> the Power to Fine and Imprison, <hi>being within the</hi> Letters Patents, <hi>the</hi> Act of Parliament <hi>did bear them out in pursuing what was in the Tenor of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But in my Opinion, this Matter ought to be a little further clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and therefore we must distinguish between the</hi> Original Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, <hi>and the</hi> Supplemental Power, <hi>added to enforce it. The</hi> Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Commission <hi>extended no farther than</hi> Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, <hi>as is plain from tho reading of the</hi> Statute; <hi>and that of it self could go no further than</hi> Ecclesiastical Censure. <hi>But because of the Circumstance of that Time, when (as the Lord</hi> Hobart, <hi>in a</hi> M.

                  </note> most concerned did slight the Ecclesiastical Censures; <hi>therefore it was thought necessary in the</hi> Letters Patents <hi>to grant them a new</hi> Commission <hi>to enforce the former, and that extended to</hi> Fine and Imprisonment: <hi>For in the</hi> High Commission <hi>for the Province of</hi> York, <hi>(which is preserved) distinct</hi> Powers <hi>are granted, which are not in the</hi> Act. <hi>For, whereas the</hi> Act <hi>goes no further than the</hi> Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, <hi>the</hi> Commission <hi>gives them Power to proceed after another manner than by</hi> Ecclesiastical Censures; <hi>for the Words are,</hi> Contumaces autem &amp; Rebelles, si quos invenerint, tam per Censuras Ecclesiasticas, quam Personarum apprehensionem, &amp; Incarcerationem, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ac quaecunque alia Juris Regni nostri Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia compescendum, <hi>&amp;c. Here we see plainly a Conjunction of the</hi> Power <hi>of</hi> Common Law, <hi>added to that of the</hi> High Commission, <hi>by virtue of the</hi> Act <hi>of</hi> Parliament, <hi>and so in all probability it was in the</hi> Letters Patents <hi>for the</hi> High Commission <hi>in this</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, <hi>which bore equal Date with the former.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And although the Date of the</hi> High Commission <hi>was before the</hi> Depriving of the Bishops, <hi>I</hi> Eliz. <hi>Yet I see no ground for my Lord</hi> Coke<hi>'s Assertion, which the Defendant takes for granted,</hi> p. <hi>13. That</hi> this Commission was first granted for depriving the Popish Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and that about Twenty were deprived by it; <hi>whereas in Fact,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41236:7"/>
there were but Fourteen deprived, and that for not doing what they had done before in</hi> Henry <hi>the 8th's Time,</hi> viz. for refusing to take the Oath of Supremacy, which they had all taken in the time of <hi>H. 8. And as far as I can learn, they were not deprived by the</hi> High Commission, <hi>but by a particular</hi> Commission <hi>for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; as appears by the best Account we have of it in the</hi> Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians <hi>who lived nearest the time.</hi> In the Month of <hi>July,</hi> says <hi>Stow,</hi> the old Bishops of <hi>England,</hi> then living, were called and examined by certain of the Queens Majesties Council, where the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of <hi>York, Ely</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> with others, to the Number of Thirteen or Fourteen for refusing to take the Oath touching the Queens Supremacy and other Articles, were deprived from their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks. <hi>What he means by the</hi> other Articles, <hi>I know not; for there seem to be no other at that time, for which they could be deprived by Law, but refusing</hi> the Oath of Supremacy <hi>(and so much</hi> Saunders <hi>himself owns) for the other faults were not punishable with deprivation.

                  <hi>a special</hi> Commission <hi>of the Council,</hi> then <hi>saith</hi> Stow, Commissioners were appointed for all <hi>England;</hi> For <hi>London</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile,</hi> Dr. <hi>Horn,</hi> Dr. <hi>Huick</hi> and Mr. <hi>Savage,</hi> who called before them divers Persons of every Parish, and swore them to enquire and present upon certain Injunctions. <hi>With him</hi> Hollingshead <hi>agrees, only adding</hi> that these Commissioners were sent according to an Act passed and confirmed last Parliament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This was the Act for the</hi> High-Commission, <hi>which then extended to particular Parishes, with such such Powers of the Common Law as are already mentioned, but are not of the</hi> Essence <hi>of the</hi> Commission <hi>according to the Act of Parliament, and therefore the taking away those additional Powers doth not destroy the</hi> High Commission; <hi>but the Repealing the</hi> Act of Parliament, <hi>on which it was built, takes away any such Court-Proceeding by Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Censures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To make this more plain by a Parallel Instance; The Court of</hi> Star-Chamber <hi>was taken away at the same time the</hi> High-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission <hi>was, and both determined the same day, 17</hi> Car. <hi>1.</hi> Aug. <hi>1.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Court was erected for</hi> extraordinary Civil Jurisdiction, <hi>as the</hi> High Commission <hi>was for</hi> Spiritual; <hi>but by the Act, 17</hi> Car. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>10. it was taken away much in the same manner with the Court of</hi> High-Commission: <hi>For there is a Recital of the</hi> Statutes <hi>on which it was grounded, 3</hi> Hen. <hi>7.</hi> c. <hi>1. 21</hi> Hen. <hi>8.</hi> c. <hi>20. And then it is alledged, That</hi> they had exceeded the Bounds which the Law had given them, <hi>in these Words;</hi> But the said Judges have not kept themselves to the Points limited by the said Statute, but have undertaken to punish where no Law doth warrant, and to make Decrees for things having no such Authority, and to inflict heavier punishments, than by any Law is warranted. <hi>And so, by this very same way of Reasoning which the</hi> Vindicator <hi>uses, another</hi> Court <hi>of</hi> Star-Chamber <hi>may be set up, if it keeps it self within the Bounds of the Statutes. But we are not to judge of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41236:8"/>
the force of a Law by the particular Reason assigned, but by the</hi> Enacting Clause: Be it Ordained and Enacted by the Authority of this present Parliament, That the said Court, commonly called the <hi>Star-Chamber,,</hi> and all Jurisdictions, Power and Authority be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing unto, or exercised in the same Court, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be from the first of <hi>August 1641.</hi> clearly and absolutely dissolved, taken away and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. <hi>If another</hi> Star-Chamber <hi>cannot be set up with some Limitations for</hi> Extraordinary Civil Jurisdictions, <hi>how can ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Ecclesiastical Court <hi>for</hi> extraordinary Spiritual Jurisdiction, <hi>which is taken away after the same manner? Only the</hi> Act <hi>against the</hi> High Commission, <hi>is more express in the Conclusion, against</hi> Setting up any other Court with like Power, Jurisdiction or Authority; <hi>for it was then foreseen, that some other Court might be set up, with some Alterations; and to prevent any thing of that Nature, the last Clause was annexed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2. The prohibiting Clause, 17</hi> Car. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>11. is very conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the purpose. For the Force of the former</hi> Act <hi>was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by the Repealing Clause; but that was not thought sufficient to prevent</hi> another Court <hi>rising up, which might be</hi> like to it. <hi>A Court may be like, although not altogether the same: It may be</hi> like <hi>in</hi> Jurisdiction, <hi>although not in a</hi> Power to Fine and imprison. <hi>But the Act saith, That</hi> no new Court shall be Erected which shall or may have the like Power, Jurisdiction, or Authority, as the said High-Commission now hath, or pretendeth to have; but that all and every such Letters Patents made or to be made by his Majesty or Successors, and all Powers and Authorities granted, or pretended, or mentioned to be granted thereby, ana all Asts, Sentences and Decrees to be made by vertue or colour thereof, shall be utterly void and of none effect. <hi>Was all this meant only of such a</hi> Court <hi>as should proceed to</hi> Fine and Imprison? <hi>Why was not this set down in as plain a manner as such a Law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? But we are to observe,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1. It not only voids the</hi> Letters Patents, <hi>but declares the</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution <hi>of the</hi> Court <hi>it self to be</hi> illegal; <hi>but that doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the</hi> Power to Fine and Imprison. <hi>If it had been said,</hi> No New Court shall be erected with a Power to Fine and Imprison, <hi>the Matter had been clear; for a New Court might have been erected proceeding by</hi> Ecclesiastical Censures, <hi>without a Power to Fine and Imprison. But the Act takes no notice here of any such Power, but absolutely forbids any</hi> Court <hi>with the</hi> like Power, Jurisdiction or Authority. <hi>Had the</hi> High-Commission <hi>no</hi> Power, Jurisdiction <hi>or</hi> Authority, <hi>but only</hi> to Fine and Imprison? <hi>Their</hi> Power and Authority <hi>by Act of Parliament was general,</hi> to reform Abuses, <hi>&amp;c. In case there had been no such Clause as</hi> Fining and Imprisoning <hi>in the</hi> Letters Patents, <hi>had there been</hi> no Court, no Power, Jurisdiction <hi>or</hi> Authority <hi>belonging to it? If then there be a</hi> Power, Jurisdiction <hi>or</hi> Authority <hi>of a</hi> High Commission Court, <hi>without a</hi> Power <hi>to</hi> Fine and Imprison, <hi>then all such</hi> Power <hi>and</hi> Authority <hi>is taken away by the Prohibiting Clause.</hi>

                  <hi>2. It forbids the</hi> Jurisdiction <hi>of such a Court: But</hi> Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>is quite another thing from a</hi> Power to Fine and Imprison.

                  </note> judicandi. <hi>From hence it appears, That the Power and Authority of medling in Ecclesiastical Causes, is that which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in the</hi> Jurisdiction <hi>of the</hi> Court; <hi>if it hath no</hi> Jurisdiction <hi>it is no Court; if it have</hi> Jurisdiction, <hi>it is void in Law; for the Act of Parliament takes away all</hi> Power, Jurisdiction <hi>and</hi> Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity <hi>from any such Court.</hi>

                  <hi>3. The Explanatory Act 13</hi> Car. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>12. makes this more evident; for there being a Clause inserted 17</hi> Car. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>11. which seemed to take away the</hi> Ordinary Jurisdiction <hi>of the</hi> Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Courts, <hi>it was thought fit to make that</hi> Act <hi>on purpose to clear that Matter, by repealing that Clause. But that Clause being part of the Act which took away the</hi> High-Commission Court, <hi>lest by such a Repeal the Act it self should be thought re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed, therefore there is only an Exception put in, not barely as to the Old</hi> High-Commission, <hi>but as to the new</hi> erecting <hi>some such</hi> like Court <hi>by</hi> Commission: <hi>And a particular</hi> Proviso <hi>is added,</hi> That neither this Act, nor any thing herein contained shall extend or be construed to revive or give force to the said Branch of the said Statute, made in the said first Year of the Reign of the said late Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> mentioned in the said Act of Parliament, made in the seventeenth Year of the Reign of the said King <hi>Charles;</hi> but that the said Branch of the said Statute made in the said first Year of the Reign of the said late Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> shall stand and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed in such sort, as if this Act had never been made. <hi>Now it ought to be considered, That even this Parliament doth not fix upon the</hi> Power to Fine and Imprison, <hi>to take that away; but upon the</hi> Original Clause <hi>in the</hi> Act, <hi>which gave Power to erect such a Court. And this Parliament was zealous to assert the</hi> Ordinary Jurisdiction, <hi>and as zealous to prevent any such extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Jurisdictions, as was in the</hi> High-Commission; <hi>which it shewed by continuing the Repeal of that Power by which it was established.</hi>

                     <hi>F. Parsons</hi> saith, <hi>All this was by Commission from the Pope, such as the Kings of</hi> Sicily <hi>had.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in my Opinion, this is a very bad Answer: For it supposes <note place="margin">Ans. to <hi>Coke</hi>'s 5th <hi>Rep.</hi> c. 5. <hi>n.</hi> 20.</note> Persons otherwise uncapable, to be made capable of the same Jurisdiction, which follows Orders; provided they have a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation from the Pope: Which is in effect, to confound all Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Jurisdiction in any, but the <hi>Pope</hi> himself, and those to whom he commits it. But those who assert the <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction</hi> to follow the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Order,</hi> must first suppose a Person duly qualified, before he can receive from the <hi>Pope</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the Power of <hi>Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction.</hi> If therefore a Prince hath not an inherent Right to it, he cannot receive it by <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> from the <hi>Pope.</hi> And the Powers which the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily</hi> challenges, relating to Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, are either such as other Princes have an equal Right to; or else they must imply such proper <hi>Eclesiastical Jurisdiction</hi> as follows the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Order;</hi> and then, how can the <hi>Pope</hi> give the one without the other? Such a Gift is like <hi>an Appropriation of a Benefice with a Cure to a Nunnery,</hi> which the Lord <hi>Hobart</hi> saith is <hi>void in Law,</hi> by reason of the incapacity of the Persons. But the <hi>Supremacy</hi>

                        <hi>Hob.</hi> Rep. f. 148.</note> which our Law gives, is not any proper <hi>immediate spiritual Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction,</hi> like that of Bishops, but an <hi>Authoritative and Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Supremacy without any foreign Appeals,</hi> as will appear after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. But the <hi>Rights</hi> which the Kings of <hi>Sicily</hi> challenge, are these. 1. That <hi>they have the same Powers which Legates</hi> a Latere <hi>have, and may judge of the same Causes, and proceed in the same manner with Ecclesiastical Censures.</hi> 2. That <hi>no Appeal lies from the King's Commissioner, even to</hi> Rome <hi>it self;</hi> and it is common to appeal from the Censure of the Bishop to him. The former is a <hi>Power,</hi> which our Kings never pretended to, by vertue of their <hi>Supremacy;</hi> for it is a <hi>Delegation</hi> of the <hi>Power of the Keys;</hi> which the Legates <hi>à Latere</hi> exercise by vertue of their <hi>Function,</hi> as well as their <hi>Commission:</hi> But the <hi>Legal Supremacy</hi> with us, is a <hi>Right to govern all sorts of Men by our own Laws, without any foreign Jurisdiction, and that with respect to Ecclesiastical Matters as well as Temporal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to prevent Mistakes and Cavils about this Matter, it will be necessary to clear the <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>Supremacy;</hi> as it hath been owned and received in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:41236:11"/>
And for this we have two <hi>Authentic</hi> Declarations of it to rely upon.</p>
                  <p>The first is mentioned, 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> c. 1. §. 14. Where the <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy</hi> is declared to be taken and expounded in such form as is set forth in the <hi>Admonition</hi> annexed to the <hi>Queens Injunctions</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished in the first year of her Reign. And the Words there are, That <hi>the Queen neither doth nor will challenge any Authority, but such as was of ancient time due to the Imperial Crown of this Realm, that is, under God to have the Sovereignty and Rule over all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Persons, born within these her Realms, Dominions and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, of what Estates, either Ecclesiastical or Temporal soever they be, so as no other foreign Power shall or ought to have any superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Second is in the 37th Article, wherein it is declared, That <hi>by the Supremacy is meant, that only Prerogative which we see to have been always given to all Godly Princes in Holy Scriptures by God himself, that is, that they should rule all Estates and Degrees committed to their Charge by God, whether they be Ecclesiastical or Temporal, and restrain with the Civil Sword, the stubborn and evil doers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that <hi>granting</hi> a <hi>Commission</hi> for proceeding by <hi>Ecclesiastical Censures,</hi> is no part of that <hi>Supremacy</hi> which our Church owns. And thus the Divines of our Church have understood it. By <hi>the Supremacy,</hi> saith Bishop <hi>Andrews, we do not attribute to the King the Power of the Keys, or Ecclesiastical Censures.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">p. 22. P. 244.</note> and not as though it belonged to the Supremacy to give an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Power to proceed by Ecclesiastical Censures; which was not supposed to belong to it, but a supreme Right of governing all sorts of Persons by our Laws.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The King's Supremacy in Ecclesiastical Matters, doth not,</hi> saith, <hi>Mason, imply the Power of the Keys, which the King hath not;</hi>

                     <hi>but he may command those who have them, to use them rightly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All these wrote in King <hi>James</hi> I. his Reign, when the Point of <hi>Supremacy</hi> was throughly sifted on both sides. And the King himself, who very well understood these Matters, saith, That <note place="margin">

                     <hi>the Oath of Supremacy only extended to the King's Power of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, over all Persons as well Civil as Ecclesiastical; excluding all foreign Powers and Potentates to be Judges within his Dominions.</hi>

Not as though the King hereby challenged to himself a Power of inflicting <hi>Ecclesiastical Censures</hi> on Persons; but leaving the <hi>Spiritual Jurisdiction</hi> to those who have <hi>the Power of the Keys,</hi> it belonged to him to exercise his <hi>Supreme Authority</hi> over Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Persons and Causes, as he did over Temporal. <hi>For,</hi> saith Archbishop <hi>Bramhal, our Laws never invested the King with</hi>

                     <note place="margin">p. 63.</note> 
                     <hi>of the Monarchy, hath plenary Power, without the Licence or Help, or Concurrence of any Foreign Prelate or Potentate, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der final Justice, that is, to receive the last Appeals of his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, without any Fear of any Review from</hi> Rome, <hi>or at</hi> Rome, <hi>for all Matters Ecclesiastical and Temporal; Ecclesiastical by his Bishops, Temporal by his Judges.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And thus our Laws were in the Right, when they called the Act of Supremacy, Restoring the Rights of the Crown; for if we take away all the Papal Usurpations as to Appeals, Exemptions of Persons, Dispensations, Provisions, making Canons, sending Legates to hold Courts, to call Convocations,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>we may easily understand what the Supremacy is,</hi> viz. <hi>a Power of Governing all Sorts of Men, according to the Laws Ecclesiastical and Temporal, without any Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Jurisdiction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as in Temporal Matters the King's Supreme Authority is exercised in his Ordinary Courts. so likewise in Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal: Which deriving their Jurisdiction from the King as Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, his Supremacy is preserved in the ordinary Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Courts; but as to extraordinary <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> that deper ds on the Legislative Power; And whether that be not now taken away by it, is the thing in Question.</p>
                  <p>Having endeavoured to set this Matter in as clear a Light as I could, I now return to the Instance of <hi>Edward the Confessor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And those Words of his, as they are in <hi>Hoveden,</hi> signifie no more than a <hi>General Right of Protecting</hi> and <hi>Defending the Church,</hi> which is not denied to belong to Kings, where the Pope's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is the most owned.</p>
                  <p>I cannot but take notice of a different Reading in the Lord <hi>Cokes</hi> Copy, from all that I have seen; for where he hath it, <hi>Sanctam Ecclesiam regat &amp; defendat; Lambard, veneretur &amp; reg<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

the King, to defend the Church both from <hi>Injuries</hi> and <hi>Abuses.</hi> And as to the Church it self, it is fully expressed in the Writ <hi>de</hi>

                  <p>But it is most considerable that King <hi>Edward</hi> saith, <hi>He is God's Vicar, and therefore could not look on himself as acting by Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from the Pope.</hi> It is true, that in the third Charter of <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi> there is a <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Second, wherein he <hi>gives to the King and his Successors the Protection and Defence of that Place, and of all the Churches of</hi> England, <hi>and a Power, in his stead to make good Laws, with the Advice of the Bishops and Abbots:</hi> But I do not find that King <hi>Edward</hi> owned that he acted in these Matters by any <hi>Commission</hi> from the <hi>Pope,</hi> but from <hi>God</hi> himself:</p>
                  <p>And this Law, in <hi>Hoveden</hi> and others overthrows any such pretended <hi>Commission;</hi> And yet the <hi>Pope</hi> himself doth not give him a Power to <hi>delegate</hi> his Authority to others, but to act in it himself, and that <hi>only with the Advice of Bishops and Abbots.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Point then which was to be proved, was not that the King had a Right to protect the Church from Injuries; but such an <hi>Inherent Right</hi> of <hi>Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction,</hi> which he might <hi>delegate</hi> to others, whether <hi>Bishops or not,</hi> and impower them to proceed by <hi>Ecclesiastical Censures</hi> against Offenders, summoned to appear before them. And the Question now is not, Whether by the <hi>Supreme Legislative Power of the Nation</hi> such an <hi>Authority</hi> might not in an extraordinary Case be Committed to particular Persons <hi>by Act of Parliament;</hi> but Whether such an <hi>Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> being granted to be taken away, the <hi>King</hi> by the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Law of the Realm</hi> may appoint such <hi>Commissioners,</hi> as he thinks fit, Laymen or Bishops, to proceed against the King's Subjects by <hi>Ecclesiastical Censures?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this very stating of the Case, as it ought to be, shews how impertinent the remainder of his Examples are. But to proceed.</p>

                     <hi>In the Reign of King</hi> William <hi>the First.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>In the time of <hi>William the Conqueror,</hi> he only mentions a Case out of <hi>Fitz-Herbert, That he made an Appropriation of Churches with Cure to Ecclesiastical Persons,</hi> viz. <hi>to a Prebend of the Church of</hi> York; <hi>now this,</hi> saith he, <hi>was agreed by all could not be done without Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is too common a Fault in some great Lawyers, that what they find once setled for Law in their Books, they imagine was never otherwise. Thus <hi>Appropriations</hi> after <hi>Diocesses</hi> were set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, being looked on, as chiefly the <hi>Act</hi> of the <hi>Ordinary,</hi> who is to take Care of the whole Diocess; From hence they infer, That in all Times an <hi>Appropriation</hi> must argue <hi>Ecclesiastical Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:41236:13"/>
But before the <hi>Parochial Rights</hi> were established, there were many <hi>Volantary Appropriations</hi> made by particular Persons, who thought there was no more Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction in the <hi>Appropriation</hi> of Churches, than in the <hi>Endowments</hi> of them, and in the <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Patronage;</hi> only the one is setled on a <hi>Spiritual Corporation,</hi> as <hi>perpetual Incumbent;</hi> and the other on <hi>particular Persons in Succession.</hi> Its true, since the Acts for restoring <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction</hi> to the Crown, the Power of <hi>making Appropriations</hi> in the King, is said to be from his <hi>Supreme Ecclesiastical Authority, Grindon</hi>'s Case, in <hi>Pl. f.</hi> 448. But then we are told, <hi>It was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Pope, as Supreme Ordinary, had such a Power without the Bishops;</hi> which Reason will not hold as to such Times when the <hi>Pope</hi> was not owned to be <hi>Supreme Ordinary,</hi> as he was not in the <hi>Conqueror</hi>'s Time, the <hi>Canon-Law</hi> not being then received in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what a mean Proof is this in such a busie Time as that of <hi>William the Frst,</hi> when so many great Churchmen were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of their Bishopricks, being <hi>English,</hi> and the <hi>Normans</hi> put in their Places? Was this done by any <hi>Commission</hi> from <hi>William</hi> to his Great <hi>Lords</hi> and others, to proceed against them by <hi>Ecclesiastical Censures?</hi> nothing like it. <hi>Stigand,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> (if <hi>Spot</hi>'s Story be true) was too great a Friend to the <hi>English Liberties</hi> to be endured by him: But he was too great a Dissembler to seem to have any thing to do in it himself; and therefore knowing he was of the opposite Party to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Pope, he privatly sends to him, To send a <hi>Legate</hi> for that Purpose (wherein the Pope and He had their several Ends); and then in <hi>Parliament Time,</hi> the King keeping his <hi>Easter</hi> at <hi>Winchester, Stigand</hi> was deposed, and <hi>Agilmarus,</hi> Bishop of the <hi>East Angles,</hi> and several others, <hi>without any evident Reason,</hi> saith <hi>Hoveden, but only to make way for the Normans:</hi> This was in <hi>Concilio Magno,</hi> saith he and the rest, for <hi>Easter</hi> was one of <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hoveden. f.</hi> 259. 2.</note> the three Seasons, for the <hi>Parliamentary Meeting,</hi> in the Year; which <hi>William</hi> kept up, in Imitation of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> who at <hi>Christmas, Easter</hi> and <hi>Pentecost</hi> held their <hi>Publick Courts,</hi> and did wear their <hi>Crowns</hi> till the Times of <hi>H.</hi> 2. and then they did dispatch Publick Affairs: Thus far he complied with the <hi>Saxon Customs;</hi> but he had a new Work to do: The Archbishop he could not rely upon, and therefore was put to find out a new way, by sending for a <hi>Legate</hi> from the <hi>Pope</hi> to serve his turn. And thus <hi>William,</hi> for his own Ends, having so hard a Game to play here, called in the <hi>Pope's Assistance;</hi> who knew well enough how to draw his own Advantage out of it. But <hi>William</hi> would go no further than his Interest carried him; for after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he declared, <hi>That he would maintain his own Rights, which he enjoyed in</hi> Normandy, viz. <hi>That nothing should be done without</hi>

                  <p>And what now doth the <hi>Appropriation of a Church with a Cure of Souls</hi> signifie to prove his <hi>Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction?</hi> When those things in his Time were not brought under such strict Rules as they were afterwards; but <hi>Appropriation</hi> might have been made by any <hi>Lay Person,</hi> that never pretended to the least <hi>Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction;</hi> and he might as well have brought his demolishing so many Churches in the <hi>New Forest,</hi> for an Instance of his <hi>Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction.</hi>

For it is declared by Act of Parliament, 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>That all Ecclesiastical Power is united and annexed to the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Crown of this Realm;</hi> which all Bishops do own, <hi>in taking the Oath of Supremacy;</hi> and therefore the old Form continuing, can signifie nothing against the <hi>Law of this Realm</hi> and their own <hi>Oaths.</hi> But as long as the main Points were secured by the Laws, there was no necessity apprehended of altering the Forms; for, on the other side, it was objected, that since the Laws had placed all Jurisdiction in the Crown, it seemed as unreasonable to continue the old Form of Prohibitions <hi>in laesionem Coronae &amp; Dignitatis Regiae;</hi> how can this be, say they, when the <hi>Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction Ecclesiastical</hi> as well as <hi>Civil,</hi> is owned to be from the Crown? It is said in Answer, That, <hi>a Prohibition implies that the thing is drawn into</hi> aliud Examen than it ought to be, and this is <hi>contra Coronam &amp; Dignitatem Regiam.</hi> Why not then as well when an <hi>Ecclesiastical original Cause,</hi> is brought into a <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Court?</hi> for that is <hi>aliud Examen</hi> then, by Confession on that side; and if <hi>Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction</hi> be derived from the Crown, the <hi>aliud Examen</hi> must relate only to <hi>the Court,</hi> and not to <hi>the Crown.</hi> All that I infer from hence is, that the old Forms were thought fit to be continued; &amp; both Parties reconciled them as well as they could to the Laws in force. But the Judges <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Coke</hi> 2 Inst. f. 602.</note> confessed, That <hi>although de jure both the Jurisdictions were ever in the Crown, yet the one was sometimes usurped by the See of</hi> Rome, which is a plain acknowledgment, that by the Matters of Fact in those times, the <hi>Right</hi> could not be proved; and especially in the times of <hi>H.</hi> 3. when the Popes Usurpations here, were at so great a height, that the King upon <hi>Writs</hi> of <hi>Enquiry</hi> sent into the several Counties, found, That <hi>the Revenues of the Roman Court, by Provisions, Extortions,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>exceeded the Kings.</hi> And the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.

For the Pope pretended to the <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Disposal</hi> of <hi>Church Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments,</hi> by Vertue of his <hi>Ordinary Jurisdiction,</hi> which was said to be twofold. 1. <hi>Voluntary,</hi> in the <hi>Collation</hi> of <hi>Benefices.</hi> 2. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial,</hi> in the hearing of Causes; the former might be done at <hi>Rome,</hi> but the other in the <hi>Ordinary Ecclesiastical Courts.</hi> And <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Bracton,</hi> who was a Judge in his time, owns the Pope as much to have <hi>the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction,</hi> as the <hi>King</hi> had the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral;</hi> but yet he adds, That, <hi>if an Ecclesiastical Judge did med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with Matters out of their Cognizance, the King's Prohibition did lye against him, and he ought to supersede his Proceedings till it

were tryed in the King's Court, to whom the Jurisdiction belonged.</hi> But it is still harder to prove <hi>the King's Ecclesiastical Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, because the Spiritual Courts were to certifie the Kings Courts, in case of Bigamy, Bastardy, and such like.</hi> For the Question is not about their <hi>Temporal Subjection</hi> to the King in <hi>signifying</hi> the <hi>Sentence of the Court,</hi> but whence they derived their <hi>Authority</hi> of hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Ecclesi astical Courts;</hi> over which, <hi>Bracton</hi> saith <hi>the Pope had the ordinary Jurisdiction, &amp; the Power to delegate others to execute it.</hi>

If the first Instance doth hold, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>the Sentence of Excommunication by the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop, holds against the Sentence of the Pope or his Legate,</hi> it only proves that the <hi>Eccesiastical Jurisdiction</hi> here by Law is in the Archbishop, and not in the Pope or his Legate.

                  <p>There is no doubt <hi>the Ecclesiastical Courts may be limited by the Laws of the Land;</hi> and there are some Causes which belong to them not originally of a Spiritual Nature; but they have been a long time possessed of them by <hi>Custom,</hi> and are allowed by Law; which is well expressed in 24 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 12. where it is said, <hi>That all Causes Testamentary, Causes of Matrimony and Divorces, Rights of Tithes, Oblations and Obventions (the Knowledge where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, by the Goodness of Princes of this Realm, and by the Laws and Customs of the same, appertaineth to the Spiritual Jurisdiction of this Realm) shall be determined within the Kings Jurisdiction and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It doth not seem probable, <hi>That the King by his own Authority would remove Secular Canons, and put in Regular;</hi> when <hi>Hoveden</hi> saith, in the same Case, <hi>H.</hi> 2. <hi>did it by the Pope's Authority, and</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Statutes of Provisors</hi> were excellent Statutes; but are said to be enacted for the Good and Tranquility of the Realm, which no doubt the King and his Parliament were bound to take care of.

               <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Whether the King's Supremacy by Law extends to the Dispensing with Laws: Of the Nature and Original of the Power; The Inconsistency of such a</hi> Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Power <hi>with the Frame of our Government.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>HAving thus far proceeded in clearing the ancient <hi>Legal Supremacy,</hi> I am now come to an Instance of greater Weight and Difficulty; and which will therefore require more Pains and Care in the Examination of it, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 12. <hi>By the Ecclesiastical Laws allowed with in this Realm, a Priest cannot have two Benefices, nor a Bastard can be a Priest; but the King may by his Ecclesiastical Power and Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on dispense with both these, because they be</hi> mala prohibita, <hi>and not</hi> mala per se.</p>
               <p>Here we are to enquire into these things,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) How far the King's <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in the Cases mentioned.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) How far the Reason here given will justifie a <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Dispensing</hi> with Laws.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) As to the Cases here mentioned; there is no doubt but the <hi>Canonists</hi> made the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Dispensing</hi> in these to be an Argument of the <hi>Pope's Supremacy,</hi> or the <hi>Plenitude of his Power:</hi> But doth it hence follow, That what Princes did to their own Subjects, as to the qualifying them for a <hi>Legal Possession</hi> of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices,</hi> must argue a <hi>Supremacy</hi> in them over Ecclesiastical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Causes? And there is a difference to be made between not <hi>Receiving</hi> the <hi>Pope's Canons</hi> in particular Cases; and a <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Dispensing</hi> with <hi>Ecclesiastical Laws.</hi> If the Law were so then, as is <hi>noted</hi> by <hi>Fineax,</hi> in 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 12. the plain Consequence is, That the contrary were no part of the Ecclesiastical Laws, allowed within this Realm. As in the famous Case about the Canon Law concerning Bastardy, when the <hi>Barons</hi> said, <hi>Nolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges Angliae mutari;</hi> no man can say, That the <hi>Barons dispensed</hi> with the Pope's Ecclesiastical Laws; but that they refused to execute them; for, as it is well observed in <hi>Standish</hi>'s <hi>Case,</hi> in <hi>Kelway</hi>'s <hi>Reports,</hi> 7 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Ecclesiastical Laws have no force, where the General Practice hath been contrary.</hi> If this were no more than a private Opinion of <hi>Fineux,</hi> of what he thought the King might do, although there were no Precedent for it,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41236:18"/>
then it signifies little; but if from hence it appears, What the <hi>Common Law</hi> of <hi>England</hi> was; then it follows, That this was not received at that time for the <hi>Ecclesiastical Law</hi> of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. And so <hi>Hobart,</hi> in <hi>Colt</hi> and <hi>Glover</hi>'s Case understands it, <hi>f.</hi> 147. for he produces this as an Instance, <hi>That the Crown always kept a Possession of its Natural Power:</hi> And to this he adds <hi>a Power of Commendam or Retaining a Benefice with a Bishoprick,</hi> 11 H. 4. 60. This he calls <hi>a Power of Dispensation in Spirituali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus:</hi> But with submission to two such great Men in the Law, <hi>If the Crown always kept a Possession of these Rights,</hi> there could be no <hi>Dispensation</hi> with the <hi>Ecclesiastical Law</hi> in these <hi>Matters,</hi> but an <hi>Exclusion</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>As for Instance, The <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>France</hi> do challenge many <hi>Priviledges</hi> to themselves in their Kingdoms, in plain <hi>Derogation</hi> to the <hi>Canon Law;</hi> and for these <hi>Priviledges</hi> they plead an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Right</hi> of the <hi>Crown,</hi> or an <hi>immemorial Custom:</hi> As in the great Controversic of late Years, about the <hi>Regale,</hi> the Canon Law is express, <hi>That upon Pain of Excommunication, no Lay Person what soever shall presume to meddle with the Profits of Vacant Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 12. <hi>q.</hi> 2. <hi>n.</hi> 46, 47.</note> which was decreed by two Popes in several Councils, <hi>Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> II, in a Council at <hi>Awergn,</hi> MXCV, and <hi>Innocent</hi> II, in. <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran Council</hi> MC XXXIX; both entred in the Body of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Law: And yet the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>France</hi> insist to this Day on the <hi>Rights</hi> of <hi>Vacant Sees,</hi> as belonging to them. But can this be pleaded as a <hi>Dispensing</hi> with the <hi>Ecclesiastical Laws</hi> allowed in that <hi>Realm?</hi> No, but that this Part of the <hi>Ecclesiastical Law</hi> was not received there; for that, partly by the <hi>Feudal Right,</hi> partly by the <hi>Right of the Crown,</hi> partly by <hi>Immemortal Custom,</hi> the Profits of Vacant Bishopricks accrue to the King.</p>
               <p>It is a harder Point to defend the <hi>Regale,</hi> where the Custom hath gone along with the Canon; but if the Rights of the Crown be defended in <hi>France</hi> against <hi>Custom</hi> and <hi>Canon</hi> too, our Kings cannot be blamed for resuming other <hi>Rights</hi> after so long Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation by the Popes. But where the <hi>Canon Law</hi> was not receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in any Part of it, there it hath no Force to oblige; and where there is no Ecclesiastical Law in Force, there can be no <hi>Dispensing</hi> with it; for although the later Canon Law, doth void all <hi>Customs</hi> against the <hi>Liberties</hi> and <hi>Priviledges</hi> of the Church, <hi>Non debet in hac parte Canonibus, ex aliqua consuetudine praejudi<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ium generari:</hi> Yet when these Canonists come to explain it, they tell <note place="margin">C. Clerici de Judiciis. C. cum terra declect. C. 1 &amp; ult. de Consuet.</note> us, <hi>That an immemorial Custom hath Force against a Canon;</hi> but how? Not <hi>as a Custom, but as it is a Proof of an Ancient Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge granted by the Pope;</hi> although there be not the least <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps of it: And so this Instance of <hi>H.</hi> 7. will prove, according to this Way, only some Ancient Priviledge our Kings had, and no <hi>Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction</hi> by the Right of the Crown.</p>
               <p>But whether the King could <hi>Dispense</hi> with the <hi>Ecclesiastical Laws</hi> in these Cases, or not, it is certain the Pope challenged to himself the <hi>Power</hi> of doing it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:41236:18"/>
For, after that the Third Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> liad strictly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hidden Pluralities (which were then so common and scandalous) upon pain of Forfeiture, <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third complained in the Fourth <hi>Lateran,</hi> That <hi>he saw little or no Benesit come by that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Canon;</hi> and therefore he seems to make one more severe: That <hi>whosoever takes another Benefice, shall be deprived of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ipso jure; and if he seeks to keep it, to lose the other.</hi> Yet after all, this ends only in the <hi>Popes Power to dispense as he saw Cause, with Persons of greater Rank or Merit, and greater Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Words are, <hi>Circa sublimes tamen &amp; literatas Personas, quae</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">De Multa de Prabend.</note> 
                  <hi>majoribus Beneficiis sunt honorandae, cum ratio pustulaverit, per Sedem Apostolicam poterit Dispensari.</hi> Here the Dispensing Power is fairly owned in the Canon it self.</p>
               <p>And in the other Case, of the <hi>Incapacity of Priesthood by Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimation;</hi> the same stout Pope declares, That it was in his <hi>Power</hi> to dispense with that too.</p>
               <p>The Case was this; The Church of <hi>Worcester,</hi> upon the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy <note place="margin">C. <hi>Innotuit de</hi> Elect.</note> of the See, had chosen the Arch-Deacon of <hi>York</hi> for their Bishop; he comes to the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> for Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; but secretly confesses to him his <hi>Illegitimacy;</hi> (which came to the Popes Ear.) Upon Application to the Pope for his Confirmation, he demurs upon it. He could not deny that he had all other Qualifications: But there was a Canon of the former <hi>Lateran Council,</hi> which voided the Election of all <hi>Persons Illegitimate.</hi> So then the Business is at an end. Not so neither. <hi>His Predecessor could not hinder him from Dispensing in this Case; who had equal Power with himself. And there were many Reasons to induce him to grant him a Dispensation.</hi> Why then did he not give one? There was something else to be done first. The <hi>Dispensing Power</hi> must be owned by the Church of <hi>Worcester:</hi> And therefore they must first intreat the Pope to <hi>Dispense</hi> with him, by a humble Supplication; and then expect his Favour by <hi>Postulation.</hi> And so, for the present he voids his Election.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Matt. Paris</hi> takes particular Notice, That in the Publication <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat. Paris, ad</hi> A. D. 1235.</note> of the <hi>Decretals</hi> by <hi>Gregory</hi> 9. <hi>This Power of Dispensing in these two Cases,</hi> was looked on as a <hi>great Innovation;</hi> but such as brought great Advantages to the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the same <hi>Pope,</hi> saith <hi>Matt. Westminster,</hi> voided the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of <hi>John Bloud</hi> to the See of <hi>Canterbury, because he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matt. Wesim. ad</hi> A. D. 1233.</note> 
                  <hi>two Benefices with Cure of Souls, without a Dispensation.</hi> And <hi>Stephanus de Segrave</hi> obtained, he saith, <hi>of that Popes Nuncio here, a Dispensation of</hi> Tot quot; <hi>but it came to nothing by his Sons Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here we see a Power of <hi>Dispensing</hi> with <hi>Ecclesiastical Laws,</hi> publickly owned and entred in the Body of the Canon-Law; and that by virtue of <hi>the Plenitude of the Popes Power,</hi> which could not be bounded by the Canons of the Church, nor by the Laws of his Predecessors; nor by the solemn Profession every Pope makes at his Entrance, to preserve inviolably the Canons and Constitutions of his Predecessors.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:41236:19"/>
This made so great an Alteration in the state of the Church, that it is no wonder great Complaints were made of it; consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that the Consequence of such a Power, could be nothing less than a subversion of all Orders, and Canons, and Privileges; for there could be no security of any of them any longer than it consisted with the Popes Pleasure.</p>
               <p>Hence came all the Complaints of <hi>Non-obstante's,</hi> by the <hi>whole English Nation in Parliament, That by their means Oaths,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matt. Paris,</hi> A. D. 2246. p. 649. A. D. 1251. p. 818.</note> 
                  <hi>Customs, Charters, Grants, Privileges signified nothing;</hi> for the Pope could <hi>Dispense</hi> with his own <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Promises,</hi> as well as other mens; and so there could be no Trust in any thing he said or promised in never so solemn a manner. Which is an effectual course to overthrow any Government in the world. And it is a wonder, that after such gross and avowed violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the most solemn Engagements, Mankind did not renounce all kind of Society with him: For that is founded upon Trust in Compacts and Promises; and if those may be dissolved at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, there is no foundation of mutual Society left; there being no reason to expect the Performance of that from others, which they do not think them selves obliged to do. And so such a <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Dispensing</hi> with <hi>Obligations,</hi> naturally tends to a Dissolution of Government. For it is sinking the main Pillars on which the whole Fabrick stands; which will tumble down sooner or later upon the heads of those who do it.</p>
               <p>But the great Argument then was, That <hi>Supreme Power can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be bound;</hi> and therefore the <hi>Popes</hi> pleaded, whatsoever <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi> or <hi>Laws</hi> their Predecessors made, they could not tie up them; because <hi>Par in Parem non habet imperium:</hi> So we find <hi>Innocent</hi> 3. argued in the <hi>Canon-Law.</hi> And to the same purpose <hi>Matt. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> saith, That his Successor <hi>Inneocnt</hi> 4. did. But they did not <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matt. Paris,</hi> A. D. 1253. p. 873. <hi>Lib. Diurnus Pontif.</hi> 30.</note> attend to their own <hi>Professions,</hi> still extant in the <hi>Liber Diurnus,</hi> wherein they did declare in the most solemn manner, That <hi>they would maintain the Canons and Constitutions of their Predecessors.</hi> Which was an absolute Bar to all <hi>Non-obstante's,</hi> if they acted upon Principles of common Honesty among Men.</p>
               <p>But besides this, in <hi>Privileges granted to others</hi> upon valuable Considerations (which the Popes took care of) the Persons to whom they are granted, become <hi>Parties,</hi> and have a real <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest</hi> in them; so that they become of the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Contracts;</hi> which cannot be broken without plain Injustice, and dissolving that Obligation between them.</p>
               <p>It is agreed by the most Learned and Judicious Lawyers, That <hi>when Grants or Promises do pass into the Nature of Contracts, they</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ferrand. Vasq. Cont. Fret.</hi> l. 3. c. 51. n. 2. <hi>Pet. de Marca, de Concord. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerd. &amp; Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rii,</hi> l. 3. c. 10. n. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>are irrevocable by the Parties that made them.</hi> And this the best French <hi>Canonists</hi> do plead against the Popes Power of revoking the <hi>Gallican Liberties,</hi> supposing them at first to have come from the Popes <hi>Condescensions</hi> to them. And the same Reason will hold as to other <hi>Liberties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:41236:19"/>
But here lies the main Difficulty, to shew, When <hi>the Grants that are made by Superiors, do pass into the Nature of Contracts;</hi> so that they cannot be <hi>Revoked</hi> or <hi>Dispensed with.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The short of it is, When they are rather <hi>Capitulations</hi> than <hi>Laws.</hi> For <hi>Laws</hi> are properly the Commands of those who have Authority to oblige; and the Reason of the <hi>Obligation</hi> is drawn from the <hi>Authority</hi> of the Persons: But <hi>Capitulations</hi> proceed upon <hi>Consent</hi> of <hi>Parties</hi> having differing <hi>Interests;</hi> and these among Private Persons, are called <hi>Contracts;</hi> and no one que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, but that such all men are by natural Justice bound to perform.</p>
               <p>But the Popes insisted on <hi>the Plenitude of their Power;</hi> and a Question is put among the <hi>Canonists,</hi> and variously debated: Whether <hi>if the Pope swear to some things in the Conclave, as that he will hold a General Council within such a Time, he can Dispense with himself, or not?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some say, he is guilty of Perjury, and cannot absolve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, although he should apprehend that a greater Good would come by not keeping it. For that both <hi>Pope and Emperor are bound by their own Contracts;</hi> the keeping of them being a Part of <hi>Natural Justice:</hi> which no <hi>Plenitude of Power can Dispense with;</hi> since all <hi>Contracts</hi> giva a <hi>Right</hi> to the Persons with whom they are made; insomuch that <hi>Baldus</hi> his Authority is cited by <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Baldus, in</hi> c. 2. §. <hi>Siquis vero de Pace Const. In l. Digna vox. In</hi> l. 1. <hi>F. De Const. Princip.</hi>
                  </note> them for these Words, <hi>Contractus qui fiunt cum Principe, habent naturam bonae Fidei contra Dominum;</hi> and he goes so far as to say, That <hi>the Sovereign Power is so obliged by the Contracts made by Princes with their own Subjects, that they are not revocable by themselves or their Successors: And if they were not obliged by their own Contracts, no man could trust them; and consequently all Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with them, would be dissolved.</hi> And whatever <hi>Supreme Power</hi> may do as to such Acts as are properly its own, yet where there is <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jaeobat. De Conciliis.</hi> l. 7. f. 320. C.</note> 
                  <hi>Jus quaesitum alteri</hi> (as in all <hi>Contracts</hi> there is) that cannot be taken away by it.</p>
               <p>But all this was answered on the other side, by the <hi>Plenitude of the Popes Power;</hi> for it was a <hi>Contradiction,</hi> they said, to own that, and to say, That <hi>there was any Engagement by Oath, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, which he could not Dispense with.</hi> For, as <hi>Hank.</hi> 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 37. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hob. R.</hi> f. 146.</note> says, <hi>Papa omnia potest.</hi> And therefore all such <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises</hi> as limit the <hi>Popes Dispensing Power,</hi> are void in themselves. And as to <hi>Ecclesiastical Laws</hi> or <hi>Constitutions,</hi> they easily resolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all Difficulties about them, upon such Principles as these.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>the Popes have the supreme Power in the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>the Ecclesiastical Laws were the Popes Laws.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That <hi>it is an inseparable Prerogative in the Pope to Dispense with Ecclesiastical Laws upon Necessity and urgent Occasions.</hi>

But I shall endeavour to give a clearer Light into this Matter, by shewing the several Steps and Degrees how this <hi>Dispensing Power</hi> came into the World, and how it passed from the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical to other Laws, when Princes assumed such a <hi>Plenitude of Power</hi> in <hi>Civils,</hi> which the <hi>Popes</hi> practised in <hi>Ecclesiasticals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first time we read of <hi>Dispensations</hi> was with respect to the Ancient Canons of the Church; and it implied a <hi>Relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 1. <hi>q.</hi> 7. <hi>sect. nisi rigor.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>of the Rigour of them;</hi> not with respect to their <hi>Force</hi> or <hi>binding Power,</hi> but as to the <hi>Penance</hi> which Persons were to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo for the Violation of them. And herein the Notion of <hi>Dispensing</hi> was very different from what the <hi>Canonists</hi> made it afterwards, when they declared it to be <hi>a Relaxation of the Law it self;</hi> so that it should not have that Force upon the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which it otherwise had: For, a Dispensation with them, is <hi>a Licence to do that which they cannot lawfully do without it;</hi> and that with a <hi>non-obstante</hi> to that which otherwise makes it Unlawful. <hi>De Jure illicitum fit ex Dispensatione licitum, &amp; hic est proprie effectus Dispensationis,</hi> saith <hi>Pyrrhus Corradus;</hi> who <note place="margin">Praxis Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens. Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carum Auctore Pyrrho Corra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do.</note> gives a large Account of the Practice of <hi>Dispensations</hi> in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> which conclude with a <hi>non-obstante</hi> to any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Constitutions</hi> or <hi>Canons</hi> of <hi>Councils:</hi> But no such thing can be found in the Ancient Practice of the Church, because the Popes themselves were then believed to be under the Canons. But when it was supposed, That the severe Execution of the Canons would rather hinder than advance the Good of the Church, the Governours of it thought they had sufficient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to abate the Rigorous Execution of them: As about the <hi>Times</hi> of <hi>Penance,</hi> the <hi>Translation</hi> of <hi>Bishops</hi> from one See to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the <hi>Intervals</hi> of <hi>Orders,</hi> and such like. But the Popes then pretended to be strict Observers of the Canons, when the <note place="margin">

                  </note> particular Bishops took upon them to <hi>Dispense</hi> with the <hi>Execution</hi> of them; as appears by <hi>Ivo</hi>'s Preface to his <hi>Collection</hi> of <hi>Canons,</hi> where he distinguisheth the <hi>Immoveable</hi> or <hi>Moral Precepts</hi> from the <hi>Canonical;</hi> which he calls, <hi>Moveable.</hi> In the former, saith he, <hi>no Dispensation</hi> is to be allowed; <hi>But in those things which only concern Discipline, the Bishops may Dispense, provided there be a Compensation,</hi> i. e. That the Church's Interest may be better secured or advanced thereby, as he there discourses at large; And his Rule is, <hi>Ibi Dispensatio admittenda est, ubi rigor pericu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losus est:</hi> But by this means the Severity of the Primitive Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ivo Epist.</hi> 236</note> was quite lost.</p>
               <p>The Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> observing this, thought it a proper time for them to appear zealous for the <hi>Ancient Canons,</hi> which gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them a great Reputation in the World; and by this means <hi>the Custody of the Canons</hi> was looked on as their particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince: Which they improved so well, that at last they turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Guardianship</hi> of the <hi>Canons</hi> into <hi>a Power over them;</hi> and then they found Fault with the Bishops <hi>Dispensing</hi> with them, for another Reason, <hi>viz.</hi> Because the <hi>Dispensing Power</hi> was a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41236:20"/>
                  <hi>Prerogative</hi> of the <hi>Roman See,</hi> and Inferior Bishops could act no farther in it than they had Authority from it.</p>
               <p>We find that in S. <hi>Bernard</hi>'s time, the <hi>Pope</hi> did take upon him to <hi>Dispense</hi> too far, to his great Dissatisfaction; for <hi>by his Dispensing Power,</hi> he saith, <hi>he overthrew the Order of the Church;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bernard de consider. ad Eugenium, l.</hi> 3.</note> Murmur loquor, <hi>saith he,</hi> &amp; querimoniam Ecclesiarum. The Pope dispensed with the <hi>Ecclesiastical Laws,</hi> in <hi>Exemptions of Abbots and others from that Subordination,</hi> they stood in to their proper Superiors: He saith, <hi>He could not see how this Dispensing Power could be justified: You do indeed shew a plenitude of Power, but it may be not of Justice; you shew what you can do, but it is a Question whether you ought or not; and you ought to consider, First, Whether it be lawful; then whether it be decent; and lastly, whether it be expedient.</hi> At last, he allows a <hi>Dispensing Power</hi> in two Cases, <hi>Urgent Necessity, and Common Good;</hi> otherwise he saith, It is not <hi>fidelis Dispensatio, sed crudelis Dissipatio,</hi> an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of all Order and Government. In one of his Epistles he speaks sharply against getting a Dispensation to do that which it was not lawful to do without one: And he thinks he hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bernard. epist.</hi> 7.</note> it by invincible Reason, For a Licence from the Pope can never make that Lawful, which without it were Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</p>
               <p>When the Practice of the <hi>Dispensing Power</hi> grew more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, there were two great Questions raised concerning it; Whether if a <hi>Dispensation</hi> were granted without <hi>Just Cause,</hi> it were <hi>Lawful</hi> or not? And, Whether if it were not <hi>Lawful,</hi> yet it was <hi>valid?</hi> There were some who flattered the <hi>Dispensing Power</hi> so much, that they allowed it in all Cases, whether there were a just Cause or not: These were the high-flown <hi>Canonists,</hi> who resolved all <hi>Laws</hi> into <hi>Will and Pleasure:</hi> But others, who allowed a <hi>Dispensing Power</hi> upon a <hi>Just Cause,</hi> yet thought it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the Original Design of Government, for those who are entrusted with Care of the Laws, to Dispense with them, without such a Cause as answers the End of Government: And some went so far, as to deny any Validity in a <hi>Dispensation</hi> granted upon <hi>Pleasure;</hi> for as an unjust Law hath no Force, so, said they, an unjust Dispensation of a Good Law hath none.</p>
               <p>Upon this Point two great Schoolmen differ. <hi>Suarez,</hi> whom <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Suarez de le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibus, l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 18, 19. <hi>Vaugbans</hi> Rep. <hi>f.</hi> 348. <hi>Suar. c.</hi> 18. <hi>n.</hi> 6.</note> the Lord Chief Justice <hi>Vaughan</hi> commends for his Learning in this Matter, goes upon these Grounds,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That a Prince is not <hi>Dominus, sed Dispensator Legum;</hi> although the Force of a Law depends upon his Authority; and therefore in Dispensing with a Law he doth not act by <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Power,</hi> but by <hi>Administration:</hi> For he is not <hi>Lord over the Community, but Governour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That for him to <hi>Dispense</hi> in a Law made for the <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> without a <hi>just Cause,</hi> is not only <hi>malum quia prohibitum, sed ex se, &amp; ex natura rei &amp; semper malum:</hi> Therefore <hi>Suarez</hi> was <note place="margin">
                     <hi>n.</hi> 26.</note> far from thinking a Prince might Dispense with any thing that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41236:21"/>
was not <hi>malum in se;</hi> for he makes it to be so, for him to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense with a <hi>malum quia prohibitum,</hi> if it be prohibited by a Law made for a Publick Good, and there be no just Cause for it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That although a Prince sins in <hi>Dispensing</hi> with such a Law; yet his <hi>Dispensation</hi> holds as to the <hi>Force</hi> of the <hi>Law;</hi> which he supposes to depend <hi>on the Will of the Prince,</hi> and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>c.</hi> 19. <hi>n.</hi> 6.</note> therefore his Will being altered, the Obligation ceaseth as to the Persons Dispensed with.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That although such a <hi>Dispensation</hi> holds as to the Law, yet he thinks a Prince bound in Conscience to <hi>Revoke</hi> such a <note place="margin">
                     <hi>n.</hi> 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Dispensation,</hi> because it is unlawful for him to persist in such a Will, it being repugnant to the <hi>Common Good,</hi> and the <hi>Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of his <hi>Duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. That if such a <hi>Dispensation</hi> be to the Injury of a third Person, then it is void in it self, as being repugnant to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>n.</hi> 10.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vasquez</hi> saith, <hi>They are all agreed, That no Prince hath a Power to Dispense with his Laws according to his Pleasure;</hi> or <hi>because</hi>

                  <hi>they are his Laws:</hi> But he saith, <hi>There is a Dispute, Whether an unlawful Dispensation be valid or not? And he thinks not, and that a Man's Action after the Dispensation, is as faulty as if there had been none;</hi> His Reason is, <hi>because a Prince is bound by his own Laws, so that he cannot Dispense with himself as to the Obligation of them; for, if he could at Pleasure Dispense with himself, he could never be bound; for how can a Man be bound to keep a Law, in which he can Dispense with himself when he pleases? And if he cannot Dispense with himself, much less with any under him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus endeavoured to clear the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Original</hi> of the <hi>Dispensing Power;</hi> I now come</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) To the <hi>Reason</hi> assigned by Sir <hi>E. Coke,</hi> from the <hi>Year Books,</hi> why the King may Dispense with Laws, because they be <hi>mala prohibita</hi> and not <hi>mala per se.</hi>

                  <hi>Vasquez,</hi> That the Dispensing Power lies in him, <hi>qui habet Potestatem condendi &amp; abrogandi legem.</hi>

                  <hi>Pufendorf, That none can Dispense with a Law, but such as have the Power of making it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we need no Authorities in this Matter: For to <hi>Dispense</hi> (in the Sense it is here taken) <hi>is to take away the Obligation of a Law;</hi> and whoever takes it away must have the Power of laying it on: And there is no Difference between the <hi>Dispensation</hi> with a Law, and the <hi>Abrogation</hi> of it; but that a <hi>Dispensation</hi> is an <hi>Abrogation</hi> of it to particular Persons, while others are under the Force of it; and an <hi>Abrogation</hi> is a <hi>General Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that being no more than a <hi>Relaxation</hi> of the whole Law, to those Persons who were bound by it before: But if a part of the Law be taken away, as to the whole Community, then it is called a <hi>Derogation</hi> of it; But if the Law be <hi>Relaxed</hi> only for a limited Time and under certain Conditions, then it is not an <hi>Abrogation,</hi> but an <hi>Indulgence</hi> or <hi>Suspension</hi> of the Law.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Dispense with a Law</hi> is more than to give an <hi>Equitable Sense</hi> or a Favourable Interpretation of a Law; for he that <hi>Inteprets</hi> a Law, supposes his Interpretation to agree with the Sense and Design of the Law; he that <hi>Dispenses,</hi> owns that which he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penses with, to be against the Intention of the Law, but that he hath <hi>Power</hi> to take away the <hi>Force</hi> of it, so far as he thinks fit.</p>
               <p>He that saith, <hi>Thou shalt not kill,</hi> doth not reach to Legal Executioners of Justice, <hi>interprets</hi> the Law according to <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Equity:</hi> But when <hi>God</hi> said to <hi>Abraham, Go and Sacrifice thy Son,</hi> he must be supposed, by virtue of his <hi>Supreme Authority,</hi> to <hi>Dispense</hi> with the Law in his Case, so as to make that Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful upon his Command, which would not have been so with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>
               <p>Some will not allow this to be called a <hi>Dispensation,</hi> but an <hi>alteration of the Matter of the Law;</hi> but when that Alteration comes from the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Law Makers,</hi> it is the same; so that to <hi>Interpret</hi> a <hi>Law</hi> is an Act of <hi>Discretion</hi> and <hi>Judgment;</hi> but to <hi>Dispense</hi> with it, of <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Jurisdiction.</hi> And none can therefore <hi>Dispense</hi> in the <hi>Law of God,</hi> but he that made it; all that the Wisest and greatest Men can justly pretend to, is no more than to give the true Sense of it; and it is intolerable Prsumption for any Creature to pretend to more.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:41236:22"/>
An <hi>Equitable Sense,</hi> as to Human Law, is not always that which seems to be most favourable to those who go against the Letter of it; but that which most enforces the End and Design of the Law, although it be not comprehended in the Words of it.</p>
               <p>If a Law mentions a Crime of a lesser nature, in regard of Circumstances, and in regard of those Circumstances, promises some Favour, (as Benefit of the Clergy) it can be no <hi>Equitable Sense</hi> to extend it to such Acts which have worse Circumstances, because the Ground of the Favour was the extenuation of the Fact by the Circumstances; so that the chief Rule of <hi>Equity</hi> in the Interpretation of a Law, is to attend to the <hi>Intention</hi> and <hi>Design</hi> of it, more than to the bare Words.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Intention</hi> and <hi>Design</hi> of the Law is not to be measured by Particular and Accidental Cases, wherein some Inconveniencies are to be born, but by the <hi>Publick</hi> and <hi>General Good,</hi> which more than makes amends for them; which is the Reason of that Maxim, <hi>Better a Mischief than an Inconvenience;</hi> which is false, unless taken in such an <hi>Equitable Sense.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are certain Ways of Reason, which Mankind do allow in the <hi>Equitable Interpretation</hi> of Laws, as <hi>That no positive Law must be interpreted against Natural and Divine Laws:</hi> That <hi>if Laws contradict each other, one or the other must lose its Force:</hi> That <hi>no Case which overthrows a Law by necessary Consequence, was ever intended to be allowed by it;</hi> For that were to make a Law, and to give a Liberty to break it at the same Time.</p>
               <p>If a Law be designed for a <hi>Publick Good,</hi> and an Exception be afterwards made against it, as to the <hi>Incapacity of some Persons, by it, for Publick Service,</hi> which could not but be foreseen and considered at the Time of making the Law, there is no Reason that should be alledged as a Reason for <hi>Dispensing</hi> with the Law, which was intended at first by the Law: For however the Case may be put, as to such things which could not be foreseen, at the making of a Law, yet what was intended to be prevented by the making it, cannot in Reason be alledged against it: Because if there had not been other things to have over-ballanced that Inconvenience the Law had never been passed.</p>
               <p>There is no doubt but the same Power which makes a Law, may <hi>Dispense</hi> with it, if it sees Cause; for if it can <hi>Abrogate</hi> a Law, as to the <hi>whole Community,</hi> it may as well <hi>Dispense</hi> with it, as to particular Persons, and leave it in Force to all others.</p>
               <p>The Question then is, Whether a Prince assuming to himself a <hi>Dispensing Power,</hi> doth not thereby assume the <hi>Legislative</hi> too? Since it appears, That there can be no <hi>Power</hi> to take off the <hi>Obligation</hi> of a Law, but that which causes it; although it be with respect to particular Persons; but if it amount to a <hi>General Suspension</hi> of a Law, there can be no Question to those who understand what these things mean.</p>
               <p>Our present Business was to shew, That if the King can <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense</hi> with <hi>Mala prohibita,</hi> as such, the <hi>Legislative Power</hi> must
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41236:22"/>
be resolved into him; because a <hi>Dispensing Power</hi> can be refer'd to no other: And if the King may Dispense with all <hi>Mala pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibita,</hi> he may Dispense with all just human Laws. For no Law can be just, which requires <hi>Malum in se;</hi> and therefore such a Law being void of it self, there can be no Exercise of a Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Power, but concerning <hi>Mala prohibita.</hi> And if the King can therefore Dispense, because they are <hi>only prohibited,</hi> then from a Parity of Reason he may <hi>Dispense</hi> with <hi>all Laws</hi> that concern only such things; and we cannot be secure of any Laws, but such as forbid things that are <hi>evil in themselves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. And this is my Second Reason against it, That it takes away all <hi>Security</hi> by our <hi>Laws,</hi> both as to our <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. As to our <hi>Religion:</hi> I grant, that, to take away <hi>all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> is <hi>Malum in se;</hi> to take away the <hi>true Religion,</hi> is <hi>Malum in se;</hi> but in a Nation divided about the <hi>true Religion,</hi> and where the Prince is of one Opinion, and the main Body of the Nation of another concerning it, what <hi>Security</hi> can the People by this <hi>Rule</hi> have as to the enjoying that which they account the <hi>true Religion,</hi> but the Prince doth not? The utmost we can suppose in this Case, is, for such Laws to be made, as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend to be most effectual for this Purpose. But what <hi>Security</hi> can these Laws afford, if the Prince assume a Power of <hi>Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> with <hi>Ecclesiastical Laws?</hi> It is not possible they can have any, unless they can be secure he shall never exercise this <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensing Power;</hi> for by it, he may equally suspend all Laws which relate to it; he may give a <hi>Dispensation</hi> to such as are unquali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by our Laws, and put them not only into Places of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Trust, but into all Ecclesiastical Preferments, as soon as he thinks fit; and that without any Check upon his Conscience; because those whose Office it is to interpret the Laws, tell him, he hath such a Power by Law to <hi>Dispense with Ecclesiastical Laws,</hi> although passed in the solemnest manner, and with a Design to give <hi>Security</hi> to the People concerning the preserving their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>And the higher this Point is carried, still the less <hi>Security</hi> For, if it be thought such a <hi>Prerogative of the Crown, as voids all that is made against it,</hi> then Laws signifie just nothing: For, every Law is a Limitation of unbounded Will and Power; and therefore Laws afford no manner of <hi>Security;</hi> for either they are void of themselves, or may be made void when a Sovereign Prince pleases. And I think (as Men are) meer <hi>Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> will never be taken for an infallible <hi>Security.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it may be said, That <hi>taking away the true Religion,</hi> is <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum in se; and therefore by this Rule such Laws cannot be dispensed with.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Very true; we think so: But suppose a King of another Opinion; and that he should think it good Service to destroy
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41236:23"/>
                  <hi>Heresie and Schism,</hi> and those are <hi>Mala in se;</hi> what <hi>Security</hi> can there be then from this Rule? For the same Persons who assert the <hi>Dispensing Power,</hi> make the <hi>King</hi> to be <hi>Judge,</hi> not meerly of the <hi>Necessity</hi> and <hi>urgent Occasions,</hi> but of what is <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum in se,</hi> and what not? Suppose then, he should look on our Religion as <hi>Heresie and Schism,</hi> what possible <hi>Security</hi> can this Distinction afford us?</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to our <hi>Civil Liberties;</hi> Which are founded upon our Laws, made by the <hi>Consent of King and People.</hi> But if there be such an <hi>inseparable Prerogative</hi> in the <hi>Crown,</hi> as enables the King to <hi>Dispense</hi> with all <hi>Mala prohibita,</hi> what becomes of all the <hi>Ancient Charters of Liberties?</hi> For, no one can pretend that the contrary to them all are <hi>Mala in se.</hi> And if there be no farther <hi>Security,</hi> than what this Distinction affords, we are in a very precaridus Condition, as to all our <hi>Liberties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I confess the Case is different, as to the <hi>Ecclesiastical Laws,</hi> mentioned in 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 12. and as to our <hi>Civil Liberties:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these <hi>Ecclesiastical Laws</hi> had their Force as such from a <hi>fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Power;</hi> and as far as they were the Laws of the Kingdom, it was by a <hi>Tacit Consent</hi> and <hi>Acceptation;</hi> and not by any so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Enacting of them. And as to such as these, where the Laws were not received, and the things were no farther evil, than as they were prohibited by such a Foregin Power, there is nothing but what is reasonable in the Case of 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 12. as it is in the Books.</p>
               <p>But when this hath been extended to <hi>Laws</hi> which have passed in the most solemn manner by the <hi>King in Parliament;</hi> it is time not only to take notice of, but to set forth the <hi>mischievous Consequences</hi> of this Distinction, as it is so applied; for it leaves us under no manner of <hi>Security</hi> by our <hi>Laws.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It contradicts the Sense of our own Nation in former Ages. Which I shall shew in a remarkable Instance, about the <hi>Statutes</hi> of <hi>Provisors,</hi> 35 <hi>E.</hi> 1. 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 13 <hi>R.</hi> 2. which were <hi>Prohibitory Statutes.</hi> And it cannot be supposed that at that time, when the Pope was allowed to be <hi>Head of the Church,</hi> and consequently <hi>Supreme Patron</hi> of the <hi>Benefices</hi> of it, that the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of a Title to an <hi>Ecclesiastical Benefice</hi> from him, should be thought <hi>Malum in se.</hi> But these <hi>Statutes</hi> being in force, I shall make it appear that the King did own he had no Power to <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense</hi> with them, but as the <hi>Parliament</hi> thought fit to allow it.</p>
               <p>I begin with 15 <hi>R.</hi> 2 at a time, <hi>when the Kingdom was in quiet;</hi> and however, could not be in any disturbance on the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Provisors,</hi> which the Nation desired and only those who depended on the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> opposed. But the <hi>Court-Bishops</hi> suggested that it was for the Kings Interest in dealing with the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to have a Power to <hi>Relax</hi> and to <hi>Dispense</hi> with these <hi>Statutes</hi> as he saw Cause. Therefore the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41236:23"/>
Arch-Bishop of <hi>York,</hi> then Chancellor, proposed it in the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Parliament, as one of the things for which it was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rot. Parl.</hi> 15 R. 2. n. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>viz. To find out a Temperament in that Matter, so as the Pope might not lose his Right, nor the King his.</hi> After this Matter was debated, the Commons declare their Assent <hi>en plein Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> That <hi>without prejudice to the Rights of those who were in</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">n. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Possession by virtue of the Statute, the King by the Advice and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Lords, might Dispense with the said Statute, so as should seem reasonable and useful till the next Parliament, but so as the said Statute be repealed in no Article of it.</hi> And they reserve to themselves <hi>the Liberty of disagreeing the next Parliament.</hi> And they conclude with a solemn Protestation, That <hi>this was a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty not practised before, and ought not to be drawn into an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Precedent for the future; and they desire this Protestation might be Entred and Recorded in the Rolls of Parliament; which the King commanded to be done.</hi> Doth this now look like a <hi>Declaratory Act,</hi> and <hi>made in Affirmance of the Kings Dispensing Power?</hi> It might as well be said, That an Act for <hi>Restraining</hi> the <hi>Prerogative,</hi> is made in <hi>Affirmance</hi> of it. It is true, there is a <hi>Dispensing Power</hi> granted, but with such Restrictions and Limitations as shew, that such a Power was not then thought to be inherent in the Crown. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Why should it be proposed to the <hi>Parliament</hi> to grant it, if the King had it before? Did the <hi>King</hi> ever put it to the <hi>Parliament</hi> to grant him a <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>Pardon Malefactors?</hi> But in the case of <hi>Dispensing</hi> with a <hi>Law,</hi> it was not only proposed but assigned, as one Reason of calling the Parliament.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Why <hi>till the next Parliament,</hi> if it were owned to be an <hi>inherent Right of the Crown?</hi> Would the Parliament go about to bound and limit an <hi>inseparable Prerogative</hi> in such a manner?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Why is it called <hi>a Novelty, and a thing not to be drawn into example?</hi> Was ever any thing like this said of a <hi>Declaratory Act?</hi> The Natural Consequence whereof is just contrary; that whereas some just Right of the Crown hath been contested and denied, for the future it ought to be owned and submitted to by all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. It is hard to think of Words more inconsistent with a meer <hi>Declaratory Act</hi> than those, <hi>Ne soit trait en ensample nen Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence en temps avenir.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. If this were <hi>a Declaratory Act,</hi> what need it be repeated so often in Parliament afterwards? Were the Commons so forgetful of the Kings Prerogative, as to need making so many <hi>Declaratory Acts</hi> about the same thing? Yet thus we find it about this <hi>Dispensing Power,</hi> as to the Statutes of <hi>Provisors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For 16 <hi>R.</hi> 2. The <hi>Archbishop of York</hi> again declared in the opening of the Parliament, That <hi>one Cause of calling it, was to</hi>

                  <hi>Revocation;</hi> but he then took time to consider. But 9 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 8. the King reinforced in Parliament all the <hi>Statutes</hi> against <hi>Provisors;</hi> as it is in Print.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Answer is, <hi>Let the Statutes be observed and kept.</hi> But if the Statutes were to be strictly observed, what <hi>saving</hi> can there
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41236:24"/>
be <hi>to the King's Prerogative?</hi> since the <hi>Statutes</hi> were <hi>Universal,</hi> and the <hi>King's particular Grants</hi> in this Case were the great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the Commons Desire to have them reinforced, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this King's Reign: And these <hi>Statutes</hi> continued in full Force to the Time of <hi>H.</hi> 8. insomuch that Cardinal <hi>Woolsey</hi> was prosecuted by the King's Attorney, for offending against them by his <hi>Legatine Power,</hi> although he had the King's Assent to it, and he exercised it several Years by his Permission. <hi>Stephen Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner,</hi> in his Letter to the <hi>Protector,</hi> saith, <hi>That he obtained his Legatine Power by the King's Assent:</hi> From whence he observes, <hi>What Danger they may fall in, who break the Law with the King's Consent;</hi> for in the <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s Case, he saith, <hi>That because his Legatine Power was against the Laws of the Realm, the Judges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Offence to be such as incurred the Praemunire: And this he Asserts was the Sense of the Lawyers of that Time;</hi> and for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it, he brought the Case of the Lord <hi>Tiptoft, who suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd on</hi> Tower-Hill, <hi>because in execution of the King's Commission, he had offended against the Laws of the Realm: And of many Judges who had Fines set on their Heads in like Case, for acting against the Law of the Realm by the King's Commandment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is pleaded on the other side, <hi>That the Commons,</hi> 1 H. 5. <note place="margin">Short ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, p. 25<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>n.</hi> 22. <hi>put in the saving the King's Prerogative into their Petition concerning the Statute of Provisors, that it may stand in full Force: And this was an owning the King's Dispensing Power by all the Commons in Parliament, when they were in a high Debate with the Crown.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This seems to have a good shew of Reason to any one that doth not consider the Practice of those Times, in Acts of Parliament; for the Petitions of the Commons, before 2 <hi>H.</hi> 5. were not taken entire and just as they delivered them; but several <hi>Clauses</hi> were inserted by the Court, especially such as seemed to preserve the <hi>King's Prerogative;</hi> which the Commons found so inconvenient, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rushworth</hi>'s Collections, <hi>vol.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 574.</note> That the next Year, as Serjeant <hi>Glanvil</hi> observed, (and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably on the Occasion of these <hi>Savings,</hi> 1 <hi>H.</hi> 5. n. 15, and n. 22.) the Course was altered, and hath so continued.</p>
               <p>Therefore methinks so great Weight should not be laid on these <hi>Savings,</hi> as if they implied the owning the <hi>Dispensing Power,</hi> when the Design of the Law was against it. And the King's Answer is, <hi>Let the Statutes be held and kept.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I appeal to any Man's Understanding, whether <hi>the saving the King's Prerogative</hi> can be any other than a <hi>General Clause</hi> put in, without respect to the <hi>Dispensing Power;</hi> since the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition</hi> is against the <hi>Exercise</hi> of it, and the Answer, <hi>That the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes should be observed?</hi> If they were observed, what Use of the <hi>Dispensing Power;</hi> for that lay in giving leave not to observe them? What strange Sense is this, The King promises, <hi>The Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes shall be kept, saving his Prerogative, that they may not be kept?</hi> for, they feared the not keeping them from such a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative:</hi> and when the King therefore Yields <hi>they shall be kept,</hi> he doth give up any such <hi>Prerogative,</hi> or else he doth not answer their Petition.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:41236:25"/>
The Truth is, when the Kings had got this Power into their Hands, though it were with such Limitations at first, yet they found Arts from time to time to keep it, till at last they were unwilling to part with it; as appears by <hi>H.</hi> 4. but upon the restless Importunity of the Commons it was laid down by him. And now in the beginning of <hi>H.</hi> 5. the Commons took Care to prevent its Rising in a new Reign; but he being a Prince not ready to part with any thing which looked like Power, was in probability, not easie to be brought to confirm the <hi>Statute:</hi> of <hi>Provisors,</hi> without some general Words of <hi>saving his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> which the <hi>Commons</hi> might yield to, that they might gain the main Point; since those Words could signifie nothing against the very <hi>Intention</hi> and <hi>Design</hi> of the <hi>Law.</hi>

               <p>Here we see, the Prerogative bounded, where the <hi>Interest of particular Persons is concerned;</hi> but doth the Law take more Care of them than of the <hi>Publick Interest,</hi> and the concernment of the whole Nation?</p>

               </p>
               <p>This is admirable Learning, if it be brought out of these Terms: And the meaning is, The King can do nothing to the <hi>Prejudice</hi> of the People in their <hi>Private Capacities,</hi> but he can do what he will with the <hi>Publick.</hi> I had thought, a Prince had been, in the first Place, bound to regard the <hi>Good</hi> of the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi> and to take Care of the <hi>salus Populi complicati,</hi> (as it is called) <hi>i. e.</hi> as they are imbodied together, and not of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate <hi>Interests</hi> of particular Men, which can never be preserved, when the Publick Safety is not secured.</p>

               <p>Never was Law more tender of the <hi>Interest</hi> of <hi>Particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> than ours: But suppose a <hi>Penal Law by Act of Parliament,</hi> relates immediately to the <hi>Publick,</hi> and gives no particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons <hi>any Special Actions;</hi> is such a <hi>Law</hi> therefore <hi>Dispensable,</hi> because only the <hi>Publick Good,</hi> and the <hi>Safety</hi> of the <hi>Nation</hi> are concerned? which are not (it seems) to be valued with the Private <hi>Interests</hi> of <hi>Particular Men.</hi> They who affirm such things, may be very learned in Book Cases; but they do not seem to have studied the <hi>Jus Publicum,</hi> as <hi>Bracton</hi> calls it, which concerns <hi>Statum Reipub.</hi> or the <hi>Political Law</hi> of this Nation; <note place="margin">Bract. l. c. 5. n. 2.</note> which shews the great Respect which the <hi>Good</hi> of the <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> ought to have above <hi>Private Interests:</hi> But when Persons take up their Notions and Maxims, from Laws relating to <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum,</hi> they are very apt to judge of <hi>Publick Laws,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to those <hi>Measures.</hi>

               <p>Still the Law is extreamly tender of us, as to <hi>Meat</hi> and <hi>Drink,</hi> and not only for our selves, but for our <hi>Horses</hi> too; so that the <hi>King</hi> cannot <hi>Dispense</hi> with the Laws about them: And yet can we think so meanly of the Wisdom of our Ancestors, that they would take such Care of <hi>Bread,</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> and <hi>Horse-Meat,</hi> that the King himself could not inhance the Price of them; but that as to their <hi>Laws,</hi> which relate to the <hi>Publick,</hi> they were content to leave them to the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Pleasure</hi> of their Prince? No one that reads the <hi>History</hi> of our <hi>Ancestors,</hi> and the <hi>Contests</hi> they had with <hi>Kings</hi> to obtain their <hi>Publick Liberties,</hi> could ever entertain such a Thought concerning them.</p>

               <p>This is certainly <hi>Malum prohibitum;</hi> and yet the King cannot <hi>Dispense</hi> with it. And it is really a very hard Case, if the King cannot <hi>Dispense</hi> with a <hi>Monopoly</hi> in Trade, and may Dispense with a <hi>Monopoly</hi> in <hi>Religion, i. e.</hi> That notwithstanding all the Laws for setling our <hi>Religion</hi> at Home, he may grant a <hi>Licence</hi> to <hi>Foreigners</hi> to introduce another, although never so repugnant to our Laws; for none who understood our Affairs, could ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, That this <hi>Dispensing Power</hi> was set up for any other End.</p>
               <p>But what shall we say to the <hi>Precedents</hi> on the other side? I shall pass by others, which have been sufficiently answered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and only speak to that which above all others hath been declared to be the Foundation of the <hi>Dispensing Power;</hi> and therefore deserves to be farther cleared; and that is,</p>
               <p>The Case of <hi>Dispensing with the Statutes about Men's continuing Sheriffs more than a Year;</hi> which is urged as plain and conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <note place="margin">Short ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, <hi>p.</hi> 9.</note> because <hi>it was for a Publick Good, and preventing great Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs; yet the King's Power of Dispensing in this Case was allowed by all the Judges of</hi> England, 2 H. 7. <hi>and this hath been cited as adjudged in several Books of great Authority,</hi> Fitz-Herbert, Plowden, Coke, <hi>&amp;c. and the Practice hath ever since been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:41236:26"/>
This is the whole strength of the Argument. And I shall not repeat what others have already said, to shew that this was not the <hi>Reason</hi> of the <hi>Judicial Sentence</hi> then given; but the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Ground</hi> of <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>Judges, after they had declared the Patent to be good.</hi> But however that were, it cannot be denied, that great <hi>Lawyers</hi> since that time, have taken it to have been the Sense of the Judges then. For <hi>Coke</hi>'s Words are express in <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>'s Case; <hi>It is Enacted by the Parliament of</hi> 23. H. 6. <hi>That no</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">7 R. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>man should serve the King as Sheriff of any County above one Year, and that notwithstanding of any Clause of</hi> Non-obstante <hi>to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that is to say, notwithstanding that the King should expresly dispense with the said Statute; howbeit, it is agreed in</hi> 2 H. 7. <hi>That against the express purview of that Act, the King may by a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial</hi> Non-obstante <hi>dispense with that Act.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here it is plain, that in <hi>Coke</hi>'s Opinion, at least, the Judges did agree, that although King and Parliament had made an Act which made void any Grant with a <hi>Non obstante,</hi> yet that such a Grant made afterwards, with a special <hi>Non obstante,</hi> was good.</p>
               <p>I am not much concerned, whether it were their Opinion or not; because I think there is much greater <hi>Reason,</hi> and strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>Authority</hi> on the other side.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to <hi>Reason:</hi> If a <hi>Non-obstante</hi> from the <hi>King,</hi> be good, when by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> a <hi>Non-obstante is declared void,</hi> what doth an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> signifie in such a Case? Must we say, <hi>It is a void Clause?</hi> But then to what purpose was it put in? Did they who made the <hi>Act,</hi> understand it to be a <hi>void Clause</hi> when they put it in? Certainly, it was then thought otherwise; and if it were so, we have the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Parliament</hi> against the <hi>Opinion</hi> of the <hi>Judges.</hi> If it were not <hi>a void Clause</hi> then, how came it to be so afterwards? What <hi>Alteration</hi> was made in the <hi>Law of England</hi> in that Interval, and by whom? How comes a <hi>Clause</hi> that had force in 23 <hi>H.</hi> 6. to have none, 2 <hi>H.</hi> 7? Could <hi>Radcliff</hi> or the rest, by their Opinions, destroy the <hi>Force</hi> of an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No; But <hi>Coke</hi> saith, <hi>No Act can bind the King from any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative which is sole and inseparable from his Person; but he may</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">12 R. f. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>dispense with it by a</hi> Non-obstante, <hi>as a Sovereign Power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand any of his Subjects to serve him for the Publick Weal, and this solely and inseparably is annexed to his Person; and this Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Power cannot be restrained by any Act of Parliament, neither in</hi> Thesi <hi>nor in</hi> Hypothesi; <hi>but that the King by his Royal Power may dispense with it; for upon the Commandment of the King and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Subject, does his Government consist; as it is provided by the Statute of</hi> 23 H. 6. <hi>c.</hi> 8. <hi>That all Patents made or to be made of any Office of a Sheriff,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for Term of years, or for Life, in Fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simple or in Tail, are void and of none effect, any Clause or Parol of</hi> Non-obstante <hi>put or to be put into such Patents to be made not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding. And further, Whosoever shall take upon him or them to accept or occupy such Office of Sheriff, by vertue of such Grants or
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41236:27"/>
Patents, shall stand perpetually disabled to be or bear the Office of Sheriff within any County of</hi> England, <hi>by the same Authority. And notwithstanding that by this Act,</hi> 1. <hi>The Patent is made void.</hi> 2. <hi>The King is restrained to grant a</hi> Non-obstante. 3. <hi>The Grantee disabled to take the Office, yet the King by his Royal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Power of commanding, may command by his Patent (for such Causes as he in his Wisdom doth think meet and profitable for himself and the Commonwealth, of which he himself is sole Judge) to serve him and the Weal Publick, as Sheriff for such a County, for years or for Life,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And so was it resolved by all the Justices of</hi> England <hi>in the Exchequer Chamber'</hi> 2 H. 7.</p>
               <p>Here the Point is resolved into <hi>an inseparable Prerogative in the King;</hi> which no <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> can restrain, although made with his own Consent. Is there no <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> then, which this great Lawyer will allow to restrain <hi>the King</hi>'s <hi>Prerogative,</hi> so as he cannot <hi>disperse</hi> with it? What saith he to the Case of <hi>Buying Offices at Court?</hi> Cannot the King by vertue of his <hi>Prerogative,</hi> order his Houshold as he pleases, to dispose of Offices about him, as he thinks fit; No. The same Lawyer saith, That <hi>no</hi> Non obstante <hi>could dispense with the Act against</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Inst.</hi> 234.</note> 
                  <hi>buying of Offices.</hi> And yet one would think that the King had as great a <hi>Prerogative</hi> in the <hi>Court,</hi> as over the <hi>Kingdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how comes he to say, <hi>That the King can dispense notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Disability,</hi> when elsewhere he saith, <hi>The King can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not dispense in the Case of a Disability by Law?</hi> For the Reason he gives why the <hi>King cannot present</hi> a Man to a Living who is convict of <hi>Simony,</hi> is, because <hi>the Law hath disabled him.</hi> Very <note place="margin">1 <hi>Inst.</hi> 120. 3 <hi>Inst.</hi> 154.</note> well. And yet in this Case, although the <hi>Law hath disabled him,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> may <hi>dispense.</hi> Where are we now? The <hi>King</hi> can <hi>dispense</hi> with a <hi>Disability,</hi> and he cannot <hi>dispense</hi> with it. This is indeed a very <hi>dark learning of Dispensations,</hi> as C. <hi>Justice Vaughan</hi> well called it; for we cannot yet find the way through it.</p>
               <p>Can the <hi>King dispense with a Disability in Law</hi> or not? If not, the <hi>Case of Sheriffs</hi> is gone. If he can, then why not in the case of <hi>Symony?</hi> Why not, as to <hi>sitting in Parliament without taking the Oaths?</hi> No, here <hi>is a Disability in Law.</hi> What then? Cannot the K. dispense with a <hi>Disability in one Case,</hi> as well as <hi>the other?</hi> Bu: the same Person saith, That in that Case, <hi>because the Words amount to a Disability, the King cannot dispense,</hi> and here, where the <note place="margin">3 <hi>Inst.</hi> 154.</note> 
                  <hi>Disability</hi> is expressed, he may.</p>
               <p>But we are lately told, there are two sorts of <hi>Disabilities:</hi> one is <hi>actually incurred, as that upon the Members who sit without</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Short Account,</hi> p. 38.</note> 
                  <hi>taking the Oaths; and the other is a Disability annexed to the Breach of a Law, as a penalty, and that penalty not to be incurred before a Legal Conviction; and in this Case the King's Dispensation coming before the Conviction doth prevent it, by making that lawful which would not have been so without it. But when a Disability is actually-incurred, it cannot be taken off but by Act of Parliament.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">P. 30.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:41236:27"/>
I Answer, That if the <hi>Law</hi> which <hi>makes the Disability,</hi> doth allow of a <hi>Dispensation</hi> antecedent to the <hi>Conviction,</hi> then I grant that the <hi>Dispensation</hi> before <hi>Conviction,</hi> prevents the <hi>Disability.</hi> As in <hi>Digby</hi>'s Case; if the <hi>Dispensation</hi> had come before <hi>Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4 Rep.</note> the <hi>Disability,</hi> as to holding the former Living, had been prevented; because the Law doth expresly allow of a <hi>Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation</hi> in the Case. But here is no such thing. The Act of Parliament, supposes no <hi>Dispensation,</hi> but makes an <hi>utter Disability,</hi> as to the holding the Office, in Sir <hi>Edward Hales</hi> his Case; but a <hi>dispensing Power</hi> is set up against the <hi>Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and such a <hi>Dispensation</hi> neither before nor after <hi>Conviction,</hi> can prevent a <hi>Disability</hi> If it could, I can by no means see why it might not as well hold as to Members of Parliament, (at least as to the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Supremacy)</hi> if they take their <hi>Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> before Sitting in the House. For the <hi>Disability</hi> doth not take place till they enter the <hi>Parliament,</hi> 5 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1. <hi>And he that entreth the Parliament without taking the said Oath, shall be deemed no Knight, Citizen, Burgess, or Baron, nor shall have any Voice, but shall be as if he had been never Returned or Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Intention of the <hi>Law</hi> for the <hi>Test,</hi> was a <hi>disability to hold the Office;</hi> but it allows time for Persons to qualifie themselves, as appears by the <hi>Act</hi> for the <hi>Test.</hi> Is not this plain overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>design</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> for Persons instead of doing what the Law requires, to take out a <hi>Dispensation</hi> for not doing it, and so prevent the Disability? And what doth a Law signifie, when the very <hi>design</hi> of it is overthrown? And what is the Power of making Laws by common Consent in Parliament, if without such Consent, the whole force of the Law may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by a <hi>dispensing Power?</hi> So that this doth not meerly make Laws to signifie nothing but according to <hi>Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;</hi> but it makes our very <hi>Constitution</hi> insignificant; which requires to every Law the Consent of the People in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>As for Instance, By the <hi>first Constitution</hi> of the <hi>Roman Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> the <hi>King had the custody of the Laws, but no Laws were</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>to be made but by the Consent of the Roman People in the</hi> Curiae, (thence called <hi>Leges Curiatae)</hi> Would any one have thought this any Privilege, if after these Laws were passed, the King should claim <hi>an inseparable Prerogative of dispensing</hi> with them as he sees Cause?

               </p>
               <p>I will not dispute whether this were the <hi>Original Contract</hi> of our Nation or not; but this I may say, That when our <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> came to a Settlement, after long struglings, this was one of the <hi>Fundamental Articles</hi> of it, That <hi>no Laws should pass, or Burdens should be laid upon the People but by their own Consent in</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But certainly <hi>dispensing</hi> with Laws, is <hi>altering them;</hi> not as to their Words, but as to the Intention and Design of them, which is the main thing in a Law; and he that alters the Law, as to any one, whose Case is common with others, may alter it as to all others in equal Circumstances. And what doth such a Law then signifie?</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Charter</hi> of King <hi>John,</hi> the <hi>Commune Consilium Regni,</hi> was <hi>to pass all Aids; and besides particular Summons to the Great Men, general Summons were to be given to others, to appear with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in forty days; and if they did not, Matters were to go on however.</hi> This very <hi>Charter,</hi> as appears by <hi>Matt. Paris,</hi> was renewed, 9 <hi>H.</hi> 3. But he had learned the Trick of a <hi>Non obstante</hi> from his good Friend the Pope; and when he was urged with his own Grants, he said, <hi>Doth not the</hi> Pope <hi>void his Grants with a</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matt. Paris,</hi> f. 854.</note> Non-obstante? <hi>Why may not I do the same by the Grants of</hi> my Self <hi>and</hi> my Predecessors? To whom a sharp Reply was made. <hi>As long as he observed Justice in his Actings, he would be King, and no longer.</hi> Which I only mention to shew, that the Use of a <hi>Non obstante</hi> was then looked on as a Violation of Justice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:41236:28"/>
And so it must needs be, if our Laws, as <hi>Bracton</hi> saith, be <hi>Communis Reipub. Sponsio;</hi> for then they are of the <hi>Nature of Contracts,</hi> and when Laws are so, it is agreed by those who write of these Matters, although otherwise no Enemies to a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensing Power,</hi> That they are <hi>not to be Dispensed with</hi> by a <hi>non obstante.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Where there is therefore not only a <hi>Contract</hi> with others in the passing of a <hi>Law,</hi> but an <hi>Oath to observe the Laws,</hi> I do not see how a <hi>non obstante</hi> or a <hi>Dispensing Power</hi> can take Place.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We have the <hi>Advantage</hi> in Point of <hi>Authority</hi> as well as <hi>Reason,</hi> as to this very Case of <hi>Dispensing with the Statute of</hi> 23 H. 6.</p>
               <p>For I take it for granted, That the <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> is more to be regarded than the <hi>Opinion</hi> of <hi>Judges:</hi> And I think we have good Reason to believe, That the Parliament did not think this Act could be voided by a <hi>non obstante.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1.) The <hi>Parliament</hi> that declared, any <hi>non obstante against the Act to be void,</hi> was certainly of that Opinion; or else they did a ridiculous thing, to put in a Clause which was <hi>void of it self.</hi>

               <p n="2">(2.) The <hi>Parliament,</hi> 28 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 3. was of that Mind; for what need <hi>an Indemnity by Act of Parliament,</hi> if the King could by his <hi>Dispensing Power</hi> have made it lawful for the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> to continue?</p>

(3.) The Parliament, 8 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 4. continued in the same mind, for, whereas in the beginning of his Reign <hi>Sheriffs were continued more than a Year, by reason of the Troubles,</hi> it was not then thought, (though in a Case of such <hi>Necessity)</hi> That the King could <hi>Dispense with this Law;</hi> but they were <hi>indemnified by Act of Parliament,</hi> and the <hi>Act declared to stand in full Force.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And now I leave any Man of Reason to judge, Whether this famous Case be a sufficient Foundation for the seting up a <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensing Power,</hi> either as to a <hi>Particular Statute</hi> made for the <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our Religion,</hi> or for <hi>a Suspension of our Ecclesiastical Laws.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>I Now come to the <hi>Alterations</hi> made in our <hi>Laws,</hi> about the <hi>King's Supremacy</hi> in the Time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth.</p>
               <p>24 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 12. An <hi>Act</hi> passed <hi>for taking away all Appeals to</hi> Rome, <hi>which is founded on the King's Natural and Independent Right of Governing, and doing Justice to all his People; and the Sufficiency of his own Clergy, for Hearing and Determining such Matters as belonged to their Function; and therefore all Causes are to be Heard, Discussed, Examined, finally and definitively Adjudged and Determined within the King's Jurisdiction and Authority, and not elswhere in the Courts Spiritual and Temporal: But if the King be concerned, then it is referred to the Upper-House of Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Preamble</hi> of this <hi>Act</hi> against <hi>Appeals to</hi> Rome, is conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: <hi>Whereas by divers Authentick Histories and Chronicles, it is manifestly declared and expressed, That this Realm of</hi> England <hi>is an Empire governed by one Supreme Head and King,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>with plenary, whole and entire Power, Preheminence, Authority, Prerogative and Jurisdiction</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for final determination of Causes,</hi> &amp;c. so that here is an <hi>Appeal to Ancient History</hi> in this Matter, and we have still sufficient Evidence of it before the <hi>Popes Encroachments</hi> prevailed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Barons</hi> told <hi>Anselm,</hi> in <hi>William Rufus</hi> his time, <hi>It was a thing unheard of, and contrary to the Custom of his Realm for any one to go to</hi> Rome <hi>without the King's Leave;</hi> which is after explained <hi>by way of Appeal: Anselm</hi> made but a shuffling Answer to this, <hi>although he had sworn to observe the Customs of the Realm,</hi> and he could not deny this to be one, but he pretended, <hi>It was against S.</hi> Peter<hi>'s Authority, and therefore could not observe it; for this were,</hi> saith he, <hi>to abjure S.</hi> Peter. From whence I infer, That the Custom of the Realm, was then thought by <hi>Anselm</hi> to be inconsistent with <hi>the Pope's Authority:</hi> For whatever they talk of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> it is the Pope they mean.</p>
               <p>In the Reign of <hi>H.</hi> 1. the Pope complains grievously, <hi>That the King would suffer no Appeals to be made to him; and that due</hi>

                  <hi>Reverence was not shewed to S.</hi> Peter <hi>in his Kingdom; and that they ended Ecclesiastical Causes at Home, even where Bishops were concerned; and very learnedly quotes the De<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               <p>That Passage in the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>H.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 5. which seems to allow of <hi>Appeals,</hi> is a <hi>mere Forgery,</hi> the whole Chapter being a <hi>Rapsody</hi> taken out of the <hi>Canonists.</hi>

               <p>And although <hi>H.</hi> 2. in his <hi>Purgation</hi> for the Death of the Archbishop, did swear, <hi>That he would hinder no Appeals to</hi> Rome <hi>in Ecclesiastical Causes; and that he would quit the Ancient Customs of the Realm:</hi> Yet <hi>Hoveden</hi> saith, <hi>The Constitutions of</hi> Clarendon <hi>were renewed in the Parliament at</hi> Northampton, <hi>and the Justices in Eyre were sworn to observe them, and to make others observe them inviolably: And for those who went out of the Kingdom</hi> (in Case of <hi>Appeals) the Justices were to enquire</hi> per consuetudinem Terrae, <hi>according to the Ancient Custom; and if they did not return and stand to the King's Court, they were to be outlawed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Time of <hi>R.</hi> 1. the Popes complained much of <hi>Geofry,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> for slighting <hi>Appeals made to</hi> Rome, <hi>and</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But when the <hi>Rights of the Crown</hi> were given up by King <hi>John</hi> to the <hi>Pope,</hi> no Wonder if the <hi>Liberties of Appeals</hi> were granted by him: But yet, in the succeeding Reigns, we have several Instances upon Record of Persons imprisoned by the King, for making <hi>Appeals</hi> to <hi>Rome.</hi>

So that this <hi>Right</hi> was still owned by our Princes, when the Matter came into Contest, and therefore the Act of <hi>H.</hi> 8. against <hi>Appeals</hi> was but a just <hi>Resuming</hi> of the <hi>Ancient Rights</hi> of the <hi>Crown.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 19. A <hi>Commission</hi> is appointed <hi>for reviewing the Canons:</hi> And it is observable, That because it could not be done in <hi>Parliament Time,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> hath <hi>Power given him by Act of Parliament to nominate the thirty two Persons to act in this Matter,</hi> in these Words; <hi>Be it therefore enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That the King's Highness shall have Power and Authority to nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41236:30"/>
and assign at his Pleasure the said thirty two Persons of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; whereof sixteen to be of the Clergy, and sixteen to be of the Temporality of the Upper and Nether House of Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And because the last Resort was to the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Act of Appeals;</hi> therefore to prevent any Inconveniences thereby, a <hi>new Power</hi> is granted by this Act, <hi>i. e. Upon an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the King in Chancery, a Commission is to be directed to such Persons as the King shall appoint, who are to hear and determine such Appeals, and the Causes concerning the same.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 21. After the <hi>Submission of the Clergy,</hi> and the King being owned <hi>Supreme Head,</hi> yet the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>dispensing</hi> with the <hi>Canons</hi> in particular Cases, did not pass by <hi>Commission</hi> from the King, but by <hi>Act of Parliament.</hi> The Words are, <hi>It standeth therefore with natural Equity and good Reason, that all and every such Laws human, made without this Realm, or induced into this Realm by the said Sufferance, Consents and Custom, Your Royal Majesty, your Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting the whole State of your Realm, in this your High Court of Parliament, have full Power and Authority not only to dispense, but also to Authorize some elect Person or Persons, to dispense,</hi> &amp;c. So that the Power of granting <hi>Faculties</hi> at a time when the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative</hi> was highest, was not executed by <hi>Commission</hi> from the King by vertue of his <hi>Supremacy</hi> and <hi>Prerogative Royal,</hi> but was granted to the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in the manner expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in that Act.</p>
               <p>A late Author has stretched this <hi>Statute</hi> to a Power of <hi>dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> in other Cases, besides those which depended on the <hi>Canon-Law.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Visitatorial Power, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 262.</note> 
                  <hi>For,</hi> saith he, <hi>the Pope usurped such a Power in derogation of the Authority Royal, and then that Power must be originally in the King; otherwise, in the Construction of the Act, it could be no Usurpation.</hi> But this is a very false way of Reasoning; <hi>The</hi> Pope <hi>usurped such a</hi> Power <hi>on the Crown;</hi> therefore <hi>the Crown hath it of Right:</hi> For the <hi>Popes Usurpations</hi> were many of them <hi>unreasonable</hi> (his <hi>Primacy,</hi> according to <hi>Canons,</hi> being allowed) and our Law did restore to the King the <hi>ancient Right</hi> and <hi>Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Crown,</hi> and not put him into the <hi>Possession</hi> of all the <hi>extravagant Power</hi> which the <hi>Pope usurped.</hi> For this Law charges the Pope <hi>with intolerable Exactions of great Sums of Money, in Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, Censes, Peter-Pence, Procurations, Fruits, Suits for Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and Expeditions of Bulls, for Arch-Bishopricks and Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks, and for Delegates and Rescripts in Causes of Contentions and Appeals, Jurisdictions Legantine, as well as Dispensations, Licenses, Faculties, Grants, Relaxations, Writs, called</hi> Perinde valere, <hi>Rehabilitations, Absolutions,</hi> &amp;c. Now all these were Usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in <hi>Derogation of the Crown;</hi> but doth it therefore follow that the <hi>Crown</hi> hath a <hi>Right</hi> to them all? But to go no further than the Business of <hi>Dispensations;</hi> Hath the King a Right by this Statute to <hi>dispense</hi> as far as the Pope? The Pope
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41236:31"/>
usurped a Power of <hi>dispensing</hi> in <hi>Matrimonial Contracts,</hi> in <hi>Oaths,</hi> in <hi>Vows,</hi> in some <hi>positive Divine Laws,</hi> which I suppose <hi>H.</hi> 8. by vertue of the <hi>Supremacy,</hi> never pretended to. So that it is a very mistaken Notion of some Men, That <hi>the King had all the</hi> Power, <hi>which the</hi> Pope <hi>usurped.</hi> And as to the <hi>Act,</hi> it is plain by the Words of it, That the <hi>Original</hi> Power <hi>of Dispensing,</hi> was lodged in the <hi>King, Lords and Commons,</hi> and the <hi>Ministerial Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution</hi> of it with the <hi>Arch Bishop of Canterbury,</hi> even with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the King himself. But if the King had pretended to <hi>all the</hi> Power <hi>which the</hi> Pope <hi>usurped,</hi> he must have dispensed with himself.</p>
               <p>But this Author offers to Prove, That <hi>there is a</hi> Power <hi>in the Crown to dispense with Acts of</hi> Parliament, <hi>even such as concern</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 266.</note> 
                  <hi>the Consecration of Bishops; because it is said,</hi> 8 Eliz. That <hi>the Queen by her Supreme Authority had dispensed with all causes or Doubts of any Imperfection or Disability in the Persons,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To give a clear Answer to this, we must consider these Things;</p>
               <p n="1">1. That, 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. The Act of 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. for the <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Electing</hi> and <hi>Making Arch-Bishops</hi> and <hi>Bishops,</hi> was revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; as appears by the same Act, 8. <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. 7.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That by another Act, 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 2. The <hi>Book of Common-Prayer and Administration of Sacraments and other Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>which were in use in the time of</hi> 6 E. <hi>and repealed by</hi> Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> were re-inforced, 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 2. 2. and the <hi>Repeal annulled.</hi> But by the Act 5 and 6 <hi>E.</hi> 6. c. 1. §. 5. the <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi> of making <hi>Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, was added to the Book of Prayer, as of like Force and Authority with it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>E.</hi> 6. being revived with the express men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Alterations</hi> and <hi>Additions</hi> made to it; there was ro Necessity apprehended, 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> to make a distinct <hi>Act</hi> for that which was in force already by the Name of <hi>Additions therein ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and appointed by that Statute.</hi> And this, I conceive, was the true Reason why a Bill did not pass, 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> to that purpose: For, I find by the <hi>Journals</hi> of the <hi>House,</hi> a <hi>Bill</hi> was prepared and read the third time in the House of Lords; but upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, it was laid a side, as superfluous.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the <hi>Popish Party</hi> took Advantage of this, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, That the <hi>Book of Consecration,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>was not established by Law, being not expresly mentioned, and therefore the Bishops made by it, were not Legal Bishops.</hi> And upon this <hi>Bonner</hi> resolved to stand the Trial against <hi>Horn,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> as may be seen in <hi>Dyer, R.</hi> f. 234., So that the <hi>Papists</hi> then stood upon it, That <hi>the Crown could not dispense with Laws;</hi> otherwise <hi>Bonner's Plea</hi> signified nothing. For if there were such an Inherent Right
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41236:31"/>
in the Crown to <hi>Dispense with Laws</hi> in <hi>Ecclesiastical Matters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> then these were <hi>Legal Bishops,</hi> having all the Queen's <hi>Dispensing Power</hi> for them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Clause in the Queen's <hi>Letters Patents</hi> for <hi>Dispensing</hi> with <hi>Imperfections</hi> and <hi>Disability,</hi> was put in out of <hi>abundant Caution,</hi> and not for any <hi>Necessity</hi> that we can find: But it was Customary in the <hi>Popes Bulls</hi> to put in such kind of <hi>Clauses;</hi> and therefore they would omit no <hi>Power</hi> in that Case, which the <hi>Pope</hi> did pretend to; which the Act faith, was <hi>for avoiding all Ambiguities and Questions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. But after all, lest there should be any Colour for <hi>Disputing</hi> this Matter left, according to the express Letter of the Law, therefore it was declared, 8 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. 3. That not only the <hi>Book of Common-Prayer,</hi> but the <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Consecrating Archbishops, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which was set sorth in</hi> Edward <hi>the Sixth's Time, and added to the Common Prayer, shall stand and be in full Force and Effect: And all Acts done by it, are declared to be Good and Perfect to all Intents and Purposes:</hi> So that this <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> doth rather overthrow a <hi>Dispensing Power;</hi> for if there were then such a <hi>Supreme and Absolute Power</hi> in the <hi>Crown,</hi> as to <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Matters,</hi> what need such an <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and Ratifie what our Author supposes done by virtue of it?</p>
               <p>But to return to the 25th of <hi>H.</hi> 8. In the same <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> care is taken for the <hi>Visiting Exempt Places,</hi> as <hi>Monasteries, Colledges and Hospitals,</hi> by a particular <hi>Commission</hi> under the Great Seal.</p>
               <p>But that which comes nearest to our Business is, That 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 1. another Act passed, wherein <hi>the King's Supremacy is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, and a Power given by Act of Parliament for him to Visit, Redress and Amend all Errors, Heresies, Abuses, Contempts and Enormities whatsoever, which by any manner of Spiritual Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or Jurisdiction ought or may lawfully be Reformed in any Usage, Custom, Foreign Laws, Foreign Authority, Prescription, or any Thing or things to the contrary hereof notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the King had this Power by virtue of his <hi>Supremacy</hi> and <hi>Prerogative Royal,</hi> can we imagin <hi>H.</hi> 8. so weak a Prince, and so little a valuer of his own <hi>Prerogative,</hi> as to have that given him by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> which was acknowledged to be in him before? But the Words are express, <hi>And that our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>shall have full Power and Authority from Time to Time to Visit,</hi> &amp;c. From whence it follows, That in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>H.</hi> 8. and the <hi>Parliament,</hi> such a <hi>Power</hi> was not <hi>perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41236:32"/>
inherent in him,</hi> but that it did belong to the <hi>Legislative Power;</hi> and therefore an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> was required for it; so that the <hi>Supremacy,</hi> as then setled by <hi>Law,</hi> lay in a total re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting any <hi>Foreign Jurisdiction,</hi> and governing this Church and Kingdom by our own Laws: Which is well expressed in the <hi>Preamble</hi> to the Act against <hi>Appeals, viz. That this Realm of</hi> England <hi>is an Empire governed by one Supreme Head and King, having the Dignity and Royal Estate of the Imperial Crown of the same, unto whom a Body Politick, compact of all Sorts and Degrees of People, divided in Terms and by Names of Spiritualty and Temporalty, been bounden, and ought to bear, next to God, a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and Humble Obedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By virtue of this Act <hi>Cromwel</hi> was made <hi>Vicegerent</hi> and <hi>Vicar General,</hi> (for both are in the same <hi>Commission)</hi> and the King gave to him <hi>omnem &amp; omnimodam Jurisdictionem, Authoritatem sive Potestatem Ecclesiasticam, quae nobis tanquam supremo Capiti hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jusmodi competit,</hi> &amp;c. which are the Words of his <hi>Commission.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It's true, That the Power of granting a <hi>Commission</hi> to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise this Power, is not expressed in the <hi>Act of Parliament;</hi> but it being <hi>vested</hi> in the <hi>King</hi> by the <hi>Act,</hi> he might appoint <hi>One</hi> or more <hi>Commissioners</hi> to do it in his name; but the Case is very different where that very <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Delegation</hi> is taken away by <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> for that is the present Case.</p>
               <p>To make this clear, we must consider the Words of this Act, and compare them with 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. the 17 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. 12. and the present <hi>Commission.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Words, 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 1. are the same in effect with those 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. But with this observable Difference, That whereas the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>H.</hi> 8. gives <hi>the King his Heirs and Successors full Power and Authority from Time to Time to Visit,</hi> &amp;c. That of 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. unites the <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> to the <hi>Imperial Crown of this Realm;</hi> but then it doth not proceed as the other did, <hi>To give full Power and Authority to her, her Heirs and Successors, to visit,</hi> &amp;c. but the Words are, <hi>And that your Highness, your Heirs and Successors Kings or Queens of this Realm shall have full Power and Authority by this Act, by Letters Patents under the Great Seal of</hi> England <hi>to Assign, Name and Authorise, when and as often as your Highness, your Heirs and Successors shall think meet to Exercise, Use, Occupy and Execute under your Highness, your. Heirs and Successors, all manner of Jurisdictions, Priviledges and Preheminences, in any wise touching or concerning any Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual or Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction,</hi> &amp;c. so that the <hi>Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of this <hi>Extraordinary Jurisdiction</hi> is by this Act limited to such <hi>who are nominated and appointed by the Letters Patents.</hi> The Fountain of all <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> is acknowledged to be <hi>in the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41236:32"/>
Imperial Crown of this Realm,</hi> but the <hi>Administration</hi> is twofold; <hi>Ordinary,</hi> in the <hi>Archbishops, Bishops and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Courts;</hi> and to secure their Dependance on the Crown, the <hi>Oath of Supremacy</hi> is required by this Act to be taken by every <hi>Archbishop, Bishop,</hi> and all <hi>Ecclesiastical Persons</hi> and <hi>Officers.</hi> But besides this, it was then thought fit, That there should be an <hi>Extraordinary Administration</hi> of it, which is limited by this Act to such <hi>as should be nominated and appointed in Letters Patents,</hi> &amp;c. and no other Reason can be given of the Change from what it was in the Time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, for it is not now placed <hi>absolutely,</hi> as then, in the Queen, <hi>her Heirs and Successors,</hi> but the <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> is annexed to the <hi>Crown,</hi> and the <hi>Extraordinary Administration</hi> to be by <hi>Commission</hi> under the Broad Seal.</p>
               <p>Now since this <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>nominating Commissioners for Extraordinary Jurisdictions</hi> is taken away by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,</hi> the only Question is, Whether notwithstanding the <hi>Right of Jurisdiction</hi> being still in the <hi>Crown,</hi> a <hi>new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> may not be granted for <hi>Extraordinary Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There had been no Question in this Case, if the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration</hi> of <hi>Extraordinary Jurisdiction</hi> had not been set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. to be by <hi>Commission,</hi> and that very <hi>Power of granting such a Commission</hi> had not been taken away by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as the Matter now stands, the only Pretence left for it is, <hi>That the same Act which confirms the Repeal, hath a Salvo for the King's Supremay,</hi> in these Words; <hi>Provided always, That this Act shall not extend, or be construed to extend to abridg or diminish the King's Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy in Ecclesiastical Matters or Affairs.</hi> If these Words be taken strictly, with Respect to the same Matter, they make the <hi>Act</hi> inconsistent with it self: For then the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would be, The <hi>King's Supremacy</hi> shall not extend to the setting up such a Court, always provided, that his <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,</hi> notwithstanding this Act, may extend to the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up such another Court. Is it consistent with the Wisdom of a Parliament to make such delusory Acts? Therefore we must understand the <hi>King's Supremacy in other Matters.</hi> And there was this Reason for it, All the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> touching the <hi>Supremacy</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's Time were repealed by Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and the <hi>Restoring</hi> the <hi>Supremacy</hi> to the <hi>Crown</hi> was by the same Act which set up the <hi>High Commission;</hi> and therefore
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41236:33"/>
when part of that Act was <hi>Repealed,</hi> and that <hi>Repeal confirmed,</hi> it was fitting to add a Clause, That there was no intention to abridg or diminish the <hi>Supremacy setled by Law,</hi> especially, since by that <hi>Act</hi> the <hi>Ordinary Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> of the <hi>Bishops in their Courts was revived:</hi> And it is very well known, what Clamors had been made, As though the <hi>Bishops Courts</hi> being held <hi>in their own Names</hi> were inconsistent with the <hi>King's Supremacy;</hi> and although the Judges had declared, <hi>July</hi> the first 1637. <hi>That there was no necessity that Processes Ecclesiastical should be in the King's Name; and the King,</hi> August <hi>the eighteenth, in</hi> 13 Car. 1. <hi>published a Proclamation to that purpose:</hi> Yet all this did not satisfie some, but the Bishops were still thought by them, in their <hi>Ordinary Jurisdiction,</hi> to usurp upon the <hi>King's Supremacy</hi> and <hi>to abridg and diminish it;</hi> therefore when this Act passed to <hi>revive</hi> their <hi>Jurisdiction,</hi> it was no more than reasonable to add such a Clause to prevent Misconstruction, <hi>viz. That this Act, nor any thing in it, be construed to extend to abridg or diminish the King's Supremacy in Ecclesiastical Matters;</hi> as the <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Jurisdiction</hi> of the Bishops had been thought to do.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Vindicator</hi> of the <hi>Ecclesiastical Commission,</hi> could <note place="margin">Vindication <hi>Eccles. Com.</hi> p. 19.</note> not forbear a <hi>Marginal Note</hi> to that purpose. <hi>The Court held by his Majesties Ecclesiastical Commissioners, is more legal than the Bishops Courts; This is in the Kings Name, theirs in their own Name only:</hi> As though the new setting up a Court, forbidden by Law, did not make it illegal, in whose <hi>Name</hi> soever it were; and as though <hi>Courts</hi> expresly owned and allowed by Law, were <hi>illegal,</hi> meerly because the <hi>Forms</hi> of their <hi>Proceedings</hi> do not run in the <hi>Kings Name.</hi> But I desire him to take an Answer from his own <hi>Oracle</hi> the <hi>L. Ch. J. Coke,</hi>

                  <hi>Now albeit the Proceedings and Process in the Ecclesiastical Courts, be in the Name of the Bishops,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>it followeth not therefore, that either the Court is not the Kings, or the Law, whereby they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, is not the Kings Law. For taking one Example for many, every Leet or view of Frank Pledge holden by a Subject, is kept in the Lords Name, and yet it is the Kings Court, and all the Proceedings therein are directed by the Kings Laws; and many Subjects in</hi> England <hi>have and hold Courts of Record, and other Courts, and all their Proceedings be according to the Kings Laws and Customs of the Realm.</hi>

                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:41236:33"/>
1. It is Objected, That 2 <hi>Jac. the Judges declared in the</hi> Star-Chamber, <hi>That the Deprivation of Non-conformists, was</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cr.</hi> f. 37. <hi>Moor,</hi> f. 755. <hi>Noy,</hi> f. 100.</note> 
                  <hi>lawful, because the King had supreme Ecclesiastical Power, which he hath delegated to the Commissioners, whereby they had Power of Deprivation by the Canon Law of this Realm; and the Statute of</hi> 1 Eliz. <hi>doth not confer any new Power, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain and declare the ancient Power: And therefore they held it clear, that the King without a Parliament might make Orders and Constitutions for the Government of the Clergy, and might deprive them, if they obeyed not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I answer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Our Question is not, Whether the King, without a <hi>Parliament,</hi> may not require the <hi>Observation</hi> of <hi>Canons</hi> pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>the Convocation,</hi> so as to deprive the <hi>Obstinate,</hi> by Vertue of his <hi>Supreme Power</hi> in <hi>Ecclesiastical Matters;</hi> but whether he may appoint a <hi>Commission</hi> with <hi>Power to deprive</hi> against an <hi>Act of Parliament;</hi> which hath taken away the <hi>Legal Power</hi> of any such <hi>Commission.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In matters of this nature, it is safer trusting the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Judicature</hi> of the <hi>Nation in Parliament,</hi> than the <hi>Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial Opinion</hi> of <hi>the Judges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in this Case the Parliament hath declared it self ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way; as appears by the <hi>Canons,</hi> 1640. which were not only condemned in <hi>Parliament</hi> afterwards (which then might be imputed to the heat of the Times) but in the most <hi>Loyal Parliament</hi> after the King's Return, particular care was taken, that <hi>neither the Canons of</hi> 1640. <hi>should be confirmed, nor any other Ecclesiastical Laws or Canons, not formerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, allowed, or enacted by Parliament, or by the Established Laws of the Land as they stood in</hi> the Year of the Lord, 1639. Which implies, that the Sense of the Parliament then was, that we are not to own any <hi>Canons</hi> but such as were <hi>confirmed, allowed,</hi> or <hi>Enacted by Parliament,</hi> or by <hi>the Established Laws of the Land before</hi> 1639. And therefore no new <hi>Injunctions</hi> without a <hi>Parliament or Convocation,</hi> can make the Clergy liable to a <hi>Legal Deprivation.</hi> No, not that which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender is so pleased with the thoughts of, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>give their Assent and Consent to the King's Declaration, on pain of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation.</hi>

                  <hi>Because the Pope granted a Dispensation with a</hi> non obstante <hi>to the Canon Law:</hi> And yet in this Book he proves, That a <hi>non obstante</hi> is <hi>no ways binding to the Supreme Power;</hi> so that no Man could more effectually over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw his own <hi>Assurance</hi> than he hath done himself: For, saith he, <hi>Present Sovereigns, whether King or Pope can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi>

                  <hi>bind their Successors.</hi> And again, <hi>Acts of Graces and Favours are alterable and suspendible at the Pleasure of the Succeeding Sovereign:</hi> Why then should any be so weak as to think the <hi>Plenitude of the Pope's Power</hi> as to <hi>Abby-Lands,</hi> can be bound up by the Act of any former Pope? I confess the comparing these two Books together hath extreamly lessened his <hi>Assurance</hi> of <hi>Abby Lands</hi> with me.</p>
               <p>And his Answers to the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Revocation</hi> are so <note place="margin">

                  <note place="margin">Defence. <hi>p.</hi> 24</note> saith, <hi>The Commissioners may deprive if Clergymen should not assent and consent to all contained in the King's Declaration, if he required it.</hi> But it is to be hoped, That Princes will not take the Measures of <hi>Justice,</hi> and <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> from such Men: We will therefore set aside the <hi>Omnipotent Engine</hi> of a <hi>non obstante,</hi> which doth not <hi>bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> so much as it <hi>undermines,</hi> and consider the <hi>Legal Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity</hi> of these <hi>Conditional Freeholds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>All Freeholds</hi> are in some Sense <hi>Conditional,</hi> or else they could never be <hi>forfeited:</hi> Which shews, that there are none <hi>Absolute,</hi> with Respect to the Law.

                  <note place="margin">p. 320.</note> 
                  <hi>Common Law.</hi> Our Author several times mentions this Case; but puts it off till he comes to Treat of <hi>Appeals, i. e.</hi> to the Place he knew it to be improper in. For the Question is not, Whether an <hi>Appeal</hi> doth lie to the King in <hi>Chancery</hi> in a Case of <hi>Deprivation?</hi> but, Whether there be not a <hi>Remedy at Common Law,</hi> if a Person be deprived of <hi>a Free-hold without due form of Law?</hi> And after a great deal of <hi>Impertinency,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">p. 224.</note> about the <hi>manner of Appeals,</hi> he at last concludes, <hi>The Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy had been at Common Law only;</hi> which is clear giving up the Point. For then, in case a Person be deprived without due course of Law, of his Free-hold, he grants, that he is to have his Remedy at Law; and consequently that a <hi>Depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of such a <hi>Free-hold</hi> without <hi>due Course of Law,</hi> is not sufficient. For the <hi>Law</hi> provides no Remedy where there is no Injury done, nor just Cause to seek for Redress. And so I come to the second Objection; which is this;</p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>to deny the Jurisdiction of this Court, is to deny the King's Supremacy; and that is a dangerous thing by the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:41236:35"/>
The Case was this; Dr. <hi>F.</hi> of <hi>Magdalen College</hi> in <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Visitatorial Power,</hi> p. 313.</note> 
                  <hi>Oxford,</hi> being summoned before the <hi>Commissioners,</hi> deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>the Authority of the Court, and persisted in so doing;</hi> which our Author saith, <hi>in another Kings Reign perhaps might have been interpreted a Questioning the very Supremacy it self; which, how fatal it was to</hi> John Fisher, Bishop <hi>of</hi> Rochester, <hi>and Sir</hi> Thomas Moor, <hi>is worthy to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, both as a Demonstration of our Kings Clemency, and that the Doctor hath not so much reason to complain of his hard Usage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Meaning whereof is this, That if they had proceeded in Justice against him, he ought to have suffered as Bishop <hi>Fisher</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Moor</hi> did. This is more than <hi>a bare In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuation,</hi> That to deny the <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> of this Court, is to deny the <hi>Kings Supremacy;</hi> and that it is <hi>meer Clemency</hi> not to deal by them who do it, as <hi>H.</hi> 8. did by Bishop <hi>Fisher</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Moor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, 1. It is by no means evident, That those two Persons suffered meerly on that Account. For their <hi>Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> in <hi>Parliament,</hi> was for refusing <hi>the Oath of Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> I. mentions the Words of Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Moor</hi> to that purpose, which he spake to the Lords when he was condemned. And their <hi>Attainder,</hi> if I mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake not, was in the same <hi>Parliament</hi> which made it <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> to deprive the King of his Dignity, Title or Name of his <hi>Royal Estate,</hi> and therefore could not be by an <hi>Act</hi> not then passed.</p>
               <p>But, 2. Suppose that they were at last proceeded against on the Act then passed, what is this to the present Case? when <hi>Coke</hi> saith, <hi>This Act was twice Repealed.</hi> And it is no <note place="margin">4 <hi>Inst.</hi> f. 42.</note> 
                  <hi>extraordinary Clemency,</hi> not to be proceeded against by a Law that hath no force.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Statute in Force, 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> c. 1. is against those who <hi>defend or maintain the Authority, Jurisdiction, or Power of the Bishop of</hi> Rome, <hi>or of his See, heretofore claimed, used, or usurped within this Realm, or by any Speech, open Deed, or Act, advisedly, wittingly attribute any such manner of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, Authority, or Preheminence to the said See of</hi> Rome, <hi>or any Bishop of the same, for the time being, within this
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41236:36"/>
Realm.</hi> So that it cannot be denied, that there is occasion for <hi>his Majesties Clemency;</hi> but it is to another sort of Men.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is very hard straining to make the denying the <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> of this <hi>Court,</hi> to be denying the <hi>Kings Supremacy,</hi> when a Person hath done all which the <hi>Law</hi> requires him to do towards owning the <hi>Supremacy.</hi> If he had said Dr. <hi>F.</hi> had taken <hi>Possession</hi> of his <hi>Fellowship</hi> there, without taking <hi>the Oath of Supremacy,</hi> which the Law requires, he had then indeed given ground to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect him for <hi>denying the Kings Supremacy;</hi> but to take no notice of those who refused to do as the <hi>Law</hi> requires, and to talk thus of what <hi>Severity</hi> might be used to one that hath done it, looks in him neither like <hi>Clemency</hi> nor <hi>Justice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. It was always looked on, as a <hi>Legal Right</hi> to make <hi>Exception</hi> to the <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> of <hi>a Court,</hi> especially when <hi>newly established,</hi> without <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ordinary Understanding, in <hi>flat Contradiction</hi> to it. It is very new Doctrine that in a Legal Government <hi>Exceptio Fori</hi> shall be interpreted a <hi>Denial of supreme Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> which was not only allowed by the <hi>Canon</hi> and <hi>Civil Laws,</hi> but by the most Ancient <hi>Common Lawyers</hi> we have.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bracton</hi> observes several things, which are material to this purpose.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first <hi>General Exception which is allowed,</hi> he saith, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bract.</hi> 1. 5 de Excep. c. 1.</note> is <hi>contra Jurisdictionem. Exceptions</hi> are either <hi>dilatory</hi> or <hi>Peremptory.</hi> Some that are only <hi>dilatory,</hi> as to the <hi>Action,</hi> may be <hi>peremptory</hi> as to the <hi>Jurisdicton.</hi> And these are to be put in <hi>ante Litem contestatam, ad perimendum Judicium, ne procedat.</hi> And the first of this sort, are the Exceptions <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Jurisdictionem, &amp; contra Personas Judicantium, quibus deficit Autoritas judicandi.</hi> So that he supposes, that such who do not deny the Kings Supreme Authority, may have a <hi>Legal and just Exception</hi> against the <hi>Authority</hi> of a Court.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:41236:36"/>
2. It was an allowable <hi>Exceptio Fori</hi> then, if any Lay-Persons <note place="margin">L. 2. c. 8. <hi>n.</hi> 9.</note> did take upon them to proceed by <hi>Ecclesiastical Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Ecclesiastical Causes,</hi> saith he, <hi>a Secular Judge hath no Cognizance, because he hath not the Power of Coercion proper to them,</hi> viz. <hi>by Ecclesiastical Censures;</hi> therefore, he saith, in his Causis pertinet Cognitio ad Judices Ecclesiasticos. His Reason is, <hi>Because those only are the competent Judges, who have the Power of Coercion proper to the Court.</hi> And for the same Cause, <hi>Ecclesiastical Judges</hi> are not to interpose in <hi>Secular Causes, cum jura sint separata &amp; limitata.</hi> And although the <hi>Exemption</hi> of <hi>Ecclesiastical Persons</hi> from the <hi>Civil Courts,</hi> be certainly taken away by the <hi>Acts of Supremacy;</hi> yet it hath been still alledged by our Divines, That <hi>the Ecclesiastical Censures were still reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the Ecclesiastical Functions;</hi> either in the way of <hi>Ordinary</hi> or <hi>Delegate Jurisdiction.</hi> If the <hi>High Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> did seem to go further, then that Power being taken away by <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> it must return to the <hi>Ancient Course.</hi>
