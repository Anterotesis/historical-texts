            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Case of the People (called <hi>Quakers</hi> once more) Stated, and Published to the World, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>WE are an Afflicted and Suffering People in these Kingdoms at this Day. Mocked, Reproached, haled before Magistrates, violently Abused, and Imprisoned, and much Hard dealing exercised upon us: This is apparently visible to all People, and needs no further proof.</p>
            <p>But, whether these <hi>Afflictions,</hi> and <hi>Sufferings, Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and <hi>Hard Dealing,</hi> be <hi>Iust,</hi> or <hi>Unjust,</hi> according to our <hi>Deserts,</hi> or out of the <hi>malice</hi> and <hi>enmity</hi> of our <hi>Adversaries,</hi> This is the <hi>Question</hi> to be enquired into; <hi>Unjust, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous, and out of Malice and Enmity, and not of due Desert</hi> (say We) <hi>are these Sufferings imposed on Us:</hi> But <hi>Iustly, and according to Desert, and the Laws of the Land</hi> (say our Adversaries.) Who shall <hi>be Iudge</hi> in the Case between Us? Even, <hi>the Law of God,</hi> the <hi>Gospel of Christ,</hi> the <hi>Scriptures of Truth,</hi> the <hi>Example of Primitive Christians,</hi> our <hi>Neighbours,</hi> and the <hi>Witness in every Mans Conscience.</hi> And to the <hi>Iudgement</hi> of all <hi>These</hi> we Appeal, and shall abide their Sentence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> We are Accused of an Hainous Crime, and as if We deserved the Greatest punishments, <hi>Because we are Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scenting, and Differing from the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and cannot Conform to all Her Worships, and Ceremonies, therefore are We said to be Hereticks; Because holding, and practising Differing things from Her,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plea.</hi> The Scriptures of Truth (which are according to both Law and Gospel) do Say, and Judge, That they who sometimes did Discent, and Differ from some of the Church of Christ, in some <hi>Principles,</hi> and <hi>Practices,</hi> and could not practice in <hi>all things,</hi> what some <hi>others did,</hi> as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57815:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
where it is signified, That some of the Church of Christ believed <hi>they might eat All things;</hi> some others of the Church did <hi>eat Hearbs,</hi> some esteemed <hi>One day above Another,</hi> others esteemed <hi>Every day Alike;</hi> this kind of <hi>discenting,</hi> and <hi>dife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> about <hi>Meats,</hi> and <hi>Days,</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> were amongst the Members of the True Church; <hi>but What is the Iudgement of Scripture in this case of Difference amongst them?</hi> Not that the <hi>Discenters</hi> one from another should be <hi>Punished,</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned,</hi> and <hi>Banished,</hi> but ver. 5. <hi>Let every man be perswaded in his own mind.</hi> And <hi>One</hi> was not so much as to Judge <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> in this case of <hi>Difference,</hi> and <hi>Discenting;</hi> much less to <hi>Imprison</hi> one another for that <hi>Cause.</hi> And in <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 15. it is there signified, That if <hi>any persons</hi> were <hi>discenting,</hi> and <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent</hi> in <hi>Iudgement,</hi> or in the growth in Grace, from the rest of the Church, every one was to walk <hi>in that measure</hi> of Truth, as he had <hi>attained to;</hi> And <hi>if any were otherwise-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> (viz. Different in the Growth in the Grace of God) <hi>then God should reveal the same unto them;</hi> And notwithstanding their <hi>difference</hi> in <hi>Iudgement,</hi> whether <hi>in cases Substantial,</hi> or <hi>Ceremonial,</hi> yet, they were still to be in <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Unity,</hi> and walk in their <hi>measures,</hi> to which they had attained, and they were not to be <hi>imprisoned</hi> and <hi>persecuted,</hi> as we are at this day: Hence, observe, <hi>That the Iudgement of Scriptures,</hi> which the Law of God, and Gospel of Christ are according to, is clear <hi>for us,</hi> and against <hi>them</hi> that <hi>hate us,</hi> that <hi>imprison us,</hi> and <hi>afflict us,</hi> for <hi>discenting</hi> and <hi>differing</hi> in some Doctrines, and Practices, from the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If we were indeed <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and <hi>Erroneous people;</hi> suppose so, which never yet was truly <hi>proved,</hi> of us, nor <hi>can be;</hi> What <hi>Iudgement</hi> do the <hi>Scriptures</hi> (which are according to the Law of God, and Gospel of Christ) give in <hi>that case?</hi> Not that we should be thus <hi>imprisoned,</hi> and <hi>afflicted,</hi> with <hi>corporal punishments;</hi> but according to <hi>Titus, Tit.</hi> 3. 10, 11. we should first be <hi>Admonished in love,</hi> and <hi>Exhorted once and again;</hi> and then, if we <hi>gain-say,</hi> and will not <hi>hear Reproof,</hi> to be <hi>Rejected, cast Out,</hi> and <hi>Denyed</hi> of the <hi>Assembly of Saints;</hi> But not <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned,</hi> and <hi>banished:</hi> and according to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. where it is <hi>signified,</hi> That some, in the <hi>denomination</hi> of the Church, did
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57815:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Offend</hi> against <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi> and were <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and <hi>Discenters,</hi> because of their <hi>Evil deeds,</hi> from the True Church; yet, these were <hi>not</hi> to be <hi>imprisoned,</hi> and <hi>persecuted</hi> in their <hi>persons;</hi> but <hi>delivered unto Satan for the destruction of the Flesh, that the Spirit might be saved in the Day of the Lord;</hi> they were to be <hi>Spiritually dealt withal;</hi> and they were to be <hi>cast out</hi> into the Wicked world, among the <hi>Ungodly,</hi> to have their <hi>portion</hi> from God, with the <hi>Wicked,</hi> to be delivered to <hi>Sathan</hi> for the <hi>destruction of the Flesh,</hi> that it might be <hi>destroyed,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> saved in the Day of the Lord. So, if we were indeed such, as these were, <hi>Discenters,</hi> and in <hi>difference</hi> from the True Church, because of <hi>some Wickedness,</hi> yet the <hi>Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Scriptures</hi> is <hi>against</hi> our <hi>Enemies</hi> in this Case, who <hi>persecute,</hi> and <hi>imprison</hi> us; for thus it ought not to be done <hi>unto us,</hi> if the Church of <hi>England</hi> were the very <hi>True Church of Christ,</hi> and <hi>We</hi> in <hi>difference</hi> from <hi>Her,</hi> by <hi>False principles,</hi> or <hi>Evil conversation,</hi> or <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>any thing else. Thus you see <hi>the Iudgement of the Scriptures,</hi> and of <hi>the Law of God,</hi> and <hi>Gospel of Christ,</hi> is <hi>against</hi> our <hi>persecutors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> But suppose <hi>We doubt,</hi> That the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and its <hi>Ordinances, Discipline,</hi> its <hi>Worships</hi> and <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi> be not according to the <hi>Scriptures of Truth,</hi> but are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>in the form of Godliness,</hi> without <hi>the power:</hi> suppose we, in Conscience <hi>believe this,</hi> and think we can <hi>prove it,</hi> which is the very <hi>truth</hi> of the <hi>Case,</hi> and <hi>therefore</hi> do deny <hi>Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> to Her, lest we should <hi>sinne against God,</hi> and wrong our <hi>own Consciences,</hi> at least, as we believe. What <hi>Iudgement</hi> doth the <hi>Law of God,</hi> and <hi>Gospel of Christ,</hi> give, in this Case? We are <hi>exhorted,</hi> and <hi>commanded</hi> in Scriptures, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>From covetous men, and proud men, lovers of themselves, false accusers, despisers of them that are good, high-minded men, and lovers of pleasures, they that have the Form of Godliness, but not the Power, from all such we are to turn away.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we believe we are <hi>Iustified</hi> by the Scriptures, in <hi>turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away</hi> for these <hi>divers Years past,</hi> (and till we be <hi>otherwise perswaded</hi> by sound Doctrine) from the <hi>Ministry</hi> and <hi>Churches</hi> that are in <hi>England,</hi> or lately have been, (and found Reason hath not been yet shewed us, to the contrary,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57815:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by you) because they are <hi>such,</hi> as the Scriptures Exhorts us to <hi>turn away from;</hi> and because we have <hi>judged,</hi> that they have had <hi>the form of godliness,</hi> but not the <hi>power;</hi> so we are not to be <hi>impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned,</hi> and <hi>persecuted,</hi> though we <hi>differ,</hi> and <hi>disent,</hi> and turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from all them that are <hi>Coveteous, Proud, Boasters, lovers of themselves, despisers of them that are good, high-minded men,</hi> and such <hi>as have a form of godliness, but not the power.</hi> But we are Judged Just, and our Case not <hi>condemned</hi> by the <hi>Law of God,</hi> and <hi>Gospel of Christ,</hi> and by the <hi>holy Scriptures,</hi> but rather such as inflict Sufferings upon us: And for any of our <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Doctrines</hi> that we hold, we deserve no <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment</hi> nor <hi>Persecution,</hi> because hereof; for <hi>we testify before God, Angels</hi> and <hi>Men, <hi>That we hold and maintain, no Principles of Religion, nor Practice of Worship, nor Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of Gospel, but what are according to Scriptures of Truth.</hi>
               </hi> And we are ready to be <hi>tryed,</hi> and <hi>proved</hi> in <hi>that case,</hi> and to bring the matter to <hi>Issue,</hi> in faire <hi>proceedings</hi> with any <hi>man,</hi> that shall <hi>object</hi> the contrary; And thus the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Scriptures are for us, as we suppose (at least), and if we are in Errour, either by denying any thing on the one hand, or affirming any thing on the other, we have not been hitherto, well proceeded against, in order to our <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We are accused as for a great Crime, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned, <hi>because we meet together, in the Name and Power of Iesus Christ, to wait upon him, and to worship him in Spirit and Truth; in Prayer to God, and Exhortations one to another, to Righteousness and Holiness:</hi> But, what <hi>Iudgment</hi> doth the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Gospel,</hi> and <hi>holy Scriptures</hi> give, and our <hi>Neighbours</hi> also, between <hi>Us</hi> in this <hi>Case?</hi> Lets come all to their <hi>Barr,</hi> and receive <hi>just Sentence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plea.</hi> First, The <hi>Iudgment</hi> of <hi>God's Law, Christ's Gospel</hi> and <hi>holy Scriptures,</hi> are not against our <hi>meeting together,</hi> but on the contrary, do <hi>command us,</hi> and <hi>exhort us,</hi> with <hi>promises</hi> of <hi>blessings,</hi> to <hi>meet together</hi> in the worship of God, and to <hi>wait upon him;</hi> And it was the <hi>practice</hi> of the <hi>primitive Christians,</hi> to <hi>assemble themselves together,</hi> in that <hi>form</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> as we do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t this day, (to wit) in a <hi>private manner,</hi> and <hi>separate from the</hi>

            <p>

And the <hi>Iudgment</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which are accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to both <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Gospel,</hi> and the <hi>presidents of Saints justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy us</hi> in this Case, in chusing patiently to <hi>suffer</hi> the greatest <hi>penalties</hi> of the Law, rather than to obey by doing any such Law, as requires things contrary to our <hi>pure Consciences;</hi> as in the Example of the <hi>three children,</hi> Dan. 3. who were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>to fall down and worship the Golden Image, at what time soever they heard the sound of the Musick, upon the penalty of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cast into the midst of the burning firy Furnace;</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment <hi>they could not obey,</hi> nor could Truth <hi>fall down to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the Image.</hi> But rather choosed to suffer the <hi>penalty</hi> of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cast into the midst of the <hi>burning firy Furnace,</hi> which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly was done unto them; again, in the case of <hi>Daniel,</hi> chap. 6. who was commanded to make <hi>no Petition to any God or man for thirty dayes, save to King</hi> Darius, <hi>upon the penalty and affliction of being cast into the Lyons Den;</hi> But <hi>Daniel</hi> did rather chuse to <hi>suffer the penalty,</hi> to be cast into the <hi>Den of Lyons,</hi> than to obey the <hi>Commandment,</hi> and was cast into the <hi>Lyons Den<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Persecute and Imprison us, because they require obedience of us, in things against our Consciences.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Though we do disobey <hi>Laws,</hi> and cannot <hi>actively</hi> obey every Law of man, when it requireth and commandeth things contrary to a good Conscience; yet herein also we are <hi>Iustified,</hi> by the <hi>Law of God, Example of Saints</hi> and <hi>holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> and they give <hi>Iudgment for us,</hi> and consequently <hi>against our enemies</hi> in this <hi>case;</hi> and in <hi>particular</hi> in the two examples before-mentioned in <hi>Daniel,</hi> the <hi>three children</hi> were expresly commanded <hi>to fall down and worship the golden Image;</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> was also required by the Kings decree, <hi>not to pray to any God or man, save to King</hi> Darius; yet all these holy men of God, did absolutely <hi>disobey the Law and Decree,</hi> so requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, and did contrary to the commandment: for the <hi>three children</hi> did not <hi>bow,</hi> nor <hi>Daniel cease to pray to his God,</hi> but <hi>prayed</hi> as at <hi>other times,</hi> and yet were <hi>Iustified</hi> of God in so doing. Also, the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 18. were commanded <hi>to preach no more in the name of Iesus,</hi> but the Apostles did <hi>disobey</hi> their <hi>commandment,</hi> and went on and Preached in the Spirit and Power of Christ, contrary to the commandment of the Rulers, and appealed to them, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were not better to obey God than man?</hi> Many Examples we might collect out of the Scriptures, that the <hi>servants of God</hi> did <hi>disobey the commands of Kings and Rulers,</hi> and could <hi>not obey</hi> (by doing) any command contrary to God, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther choosed to suffer <hi>afflictions,</hi> and <hi>death</hi> it self, than to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey such <hi>Lawes</hi> and <hi>Decrees,</hi> as required any thing contrary to a <hi>pure Conscience;</hi> and this is our case at this day, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not obey (by doing) any thing against our <hi>Consciences,</hi> but must <hi>break the Lawes of men,</hi> and disobey their <hi>commandements,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than <hi>break the Law of God,</hi> and sin against our own <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,</hi> whatsoever we <hi>suffer</hi> because hereof; and yet the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Saints,</hi> and <hi>Scriptures, Iustify us</hi> in this behalf.</p>
            <p>And let all our enemies cease to cry out <hi>Rebellion</hi> and <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience</hi> to <hi>Lawes</hi> and <hi>Government;</hi> for we are not such as do <hi>willfully</hi> and <hi>obstinately disobey</hi> any Lawes of men, but for <hi>Conscience sake,</hi> and that we may not sin against <hi>God,</hi> nor offend his <hi>Witness</hi> in us; Therefore we cannot obey Laws con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> And as for our Conversations among men, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of our daily walking and converse with them in our dealing, in respect of honesty, and faithfulness, and truth, and justness in works and words; our Neighbours shall give witness for us: We will not justify our selves, tis God that justifies us, and the Law of God, Gospel of Christ, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Examples of holy men, our Neighbours, and the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God in all mens Consciences, shall bear witness to us. And all these do give judgment for us in these cases, to whom we do appeal for Judgment.

and as fully <hi>in force</hi> as this Act can be: Yet some such Lawes there are, which <hi>better deserves Execution</hi> than <hi>this,</hi> yet they lie <hi>Dormant,</hi> as is visibly apparent at this day, as in 4 <hi>Iac. cap.</hi> 5. in these words: <hi>
                  <hi>Be it Enacted, &amp;c.</hi> That all, and every person or persons, which after Forty dayes next following the end of this present Session of Parliament, Shall be Drunk, and of the same Offence of Drunkeness, shall be lawfully Convicted; shall for every such offence, Forfeit, and loose five Shillings, &amp;c. to be paid to the hands of the Church-Wardens of that Parish where the Offence shall be committed, who shall be accountable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the use of the Poor of the same Parish. And if the said per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or persons so Convicted, shall refuse, or neglect to pay the said Forfeiture, then the same shall be levied of the Goods of every such person, or persons, by Warrant of Precept from the Court, Iudge, or Iustices, before whom the same Conviction shall be: And if the Offender be not able to pay the sum of Five Shillings, then he shall be committed to the Stocks for the space of Six Hours.</hi> I pray you read the Statute at large, tis worth a sober mans pains to read over, and then Judge whether <hi>that Law</hi> be duly <hi>Executed</hi> at this day; and also, whether it deserves not <hi>more strict Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution</hi> than the <hi>present Act</hi> against us. Also the 1 <hi>Iac. cap.</hi> 7. in these words: <hi>That all persons calling themselves Schollars, going about Begging; All Idle persons going about in any Country, either Begging, or using any Subtle Craft, or unlawful Games, or Playes; or feigning themselves to have knowledge in Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ognomy, or pretending that they can tell Fortunes, or such other like phantastical Imaginations; All Fencers, Bear-wards, Common-players of Interludes, &amp; Minstrels, wandring abroad, Shall be taken, adjudged, and deemed as Rogues, Vagabonds, and sturdy Beggars, and shall suffer such pains and punishments as is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,</hi> 39 Eliz. cap. 4. (<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>That every such person shall be stripped Naked from the middle Upwards, and shall be openly Whipped, until his, or her Body be bloody, &amp;c. and shall be forth-with sent from parish to parish,</hi> &amp;c. And read the Statute at large, and then consider how duly it is <hi>Executed</hi> now, and whether it deserves not <hi>Execution,</hi> as much as the late <hi>Act</hi> against us, though in some places, the one is more <hi>Executed</hi> than the <hi>other;</hi> where many of our <hi>friends,</hi> being honest sober per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,

and of good <hi>Conversation,</hi> and yet are haled out of their Meetings, where they are met only to worship God, and for no other end, and sent to <hi>Prison,</hi> and persecuted to the very <hi>height</hi> of the said <hi>Act;</hi> when as <hi>idle persons,</hi> following <hi>unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Games,</hi> and <hi>Playes,</hi> and <hi>Bearwards, common players of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terludes,</hi> and <hi>Minstrells</hi> of diverse kinds, do wander up and down <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Country,</hi> and having their <hi>Play-houses</hi> publick, where their wickedness is acted; such <hi>persons,</hi> and such <hi>things,</hi> though <hi>appearing publickly,</hi> yet are permitted, and little or no notice taken of them by some of the Magistrates, so as to punish them for breach of the Lawes, for the preventing of these Evils; but such wickedness is too much suffered, though there be diverse <hi>Acts of Parliaments</hi> against such <hi>persons</hi> and such <hi>actions,</hi> as well as there is one against our <hi>Meetings,</hi> yet, the Act against us, is more put in <hi>Execution</hi> in some places for the breaking of our <hi>Meetings,</hi> which are for the <hi>Worship of God,</hi> than the <hi>good Lawes</hi> for suppressing wickedness, though there is better <hi>Law</hi> for the <hi>one,</hi> than for the <hi>other;</hi> diverse other <hi>Lawes</hi> and <hi>Statutes</hi> made for good ends, for the <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing of wickedness</hi> in the Land there are, which are but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>easily Executed</hi> at this day; but here is one <hi>Act</hi> against <hi>peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able meeting together</hi> for the worship of God, which is violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Prosecuted</hi> and <hi>Executed</hi> upon <hi>Innocent men:</hi> and let all just men judge of these things, though there be a Law Enacted against our <hi>Meetings,</hi> so there is against <hi>Drunkards</hi> and <hi>drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enness,</hi> and <hi>unseasonable tipling in Taverns</hi> and <hi>Ale-houses,</hi> and against <hi>Minstrells, Fidlers, Pipers</hi> and <hi>Players, Common-Players</hi> and <hi>Stage-Players,</hi> that go up and down the Countries, and have their <hi>Play-houses</hi> in publick Cities, which Statutes ought to be rather Executed, though they are not: but these things we shall leave to all sober people to judg of.</p>
            <p>And seeing that <hi>The Law</hi> against <hi>Us</hi> is more put in <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,</hi> than these <hi>other Lawes,</hi> it doth appear that there is more <hi>envy</hi> against us, and our peaceable <hi>Religious Meetings,</hi> than there is against <hi>Prophaneness</hi> and <hi>Wickedness, Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and <hi>Stage-Playing,</hi> and <hi>such like;</hi> and such Magistrates, wheresoever they are, are not excusable in the sight of God; though there is a Law against us, while they Prosecute it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
