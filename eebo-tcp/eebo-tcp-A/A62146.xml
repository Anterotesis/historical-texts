         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>REaders of Books may be divided into
three sorts, 1. for <hi>Edification,</hi> 2. for <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation,</hi>
3. for <hi>Cavillation.</hi> But the last are the
worst, who peruse writings of purpose to
pick quarrels with them; which proceeds
from an ignorant critical kind of pride or
malignancy of Spirit, and may be compared
to the Horse flesh flies, who in the end of
Summer cannot see, yet by chance fall upon
sound flesh, fly-blow it first, and then feed
upon it. I should not apply this kind of
reading to any particular person, but that Dr.
<hi>Peter Heylin</hi> appears so in the <hi>Appendix</hi> to his
<hi>Respondet Petrus,</hi> and in the other two <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendixes</hi>
to his <hi>Examen Historicum,</hi> wherein he
falls upon the most frivial passages, and in
a snarling petulant way.</p>
                  <p>I shall here only acquaint the Reader, that
Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi> hath been too hasty in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<pb facs="tcp:66001:3"/>
of my <hi>Post-haste Reply</hi> to his <hi>Respondet
Petrus,</hi> which Answer was not till now made
publique. Printed indeed it was, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after his former <hi>Appendix,</hi> but by the
perswasion of his friends, I did suppresse it
(excepting a few private Copies) until now
that I find him with another <hi>Appendix</hi> in
<hi>Answer</hi> to that <hi>Reply</hi> of mine, which I here
publish out of a respect to him, lest the
world should think so great a Master of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
should fight with a shadow or a <hi>non
ens:</hi> 'Tis worthy enough of him, how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
soever the worth may be in it self. And
yet in earnest I could have been content to
have spared my self and the Readers pains
herein, if the Doctor had been so ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to have crav'd pardon of me, as he hath
done by letter of that other person (as I am
informed) with whose Histories he quarrel
as he doth with mine.</p>

And although it be very large to small pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,

Charles, relating to the Lord Prymate,</hi> The
<hi>Articles of Ireland,</hi> and The <hi>Earl of Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi>
And (as if it were so memorable a
business to be kept upon Record) he gives
us punctually the day, when he began to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66001:6"/>
undertake this <hi>Taske,</hi> and the time of his
finishing; In which I find little else true,
but the confessing <hi>of his infirmities, and his

cleering himself, he hath added more spots

                     <p>Indeed <hi>Petrus</hi> hath made hast; for not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the extremity of the season
(as he sayes) and his languishing quartan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ague,

<hi>vacation</hi> not profitable for the vent thereof;
And so it came not forth untill just the first

what is it lesse, than for him to live defam'd,

can help it, if a Man will make himself
such? I wish he be not prophetick in it,
which by this book he hath put hard for,
Let him not blame me, tis the malefactor
himself (not the judge who pronounceth
justly) that is the Author of his own ruine.</p>
                     <p>And thus in briefe we have the <hi>Preface</hi>
to his large <hi>Treatise;</hi> which I shall leave to
such, whom it may concern, if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it worthy of answering, for I find
some learned Men are for the Negative, as
if he had been in it, his self-revenger, and
next doore to a <hi>felo dese,</hi> rather to be piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
than opposed.</p>
                     <p>I shall only take notice of his <hi>Appendix,</hi>
and shew him to the Reader by that light
by which he longs to be seene (wherein
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66001:7"/>
                        <hi>Petrus</hi> falls upon me) not so much answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
as to shew how little he deserves it. I
have been a while considering, which part
to take of that double Counsell of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
in the like case, <hi>Answer not &amp;c. And
yet answer &amp;c.</hi> I concluded upon the latter
in this <hi>Post-Hast,</hi> that the <hi>Term</hi> might
not want an enterlude at the <hi>ending,</hi> as
well as it had by his Book, at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of it.</p>
                     <p>And now let me meet my <hi>Petrus,</hi> who
spends 17 whole Pages in the combate with
me, taking in his large <hi>Frontis peice</hi> or the
Contents of his <hi>Appendix,</hi> which might
have well stood for the whole. So have we
seen a daring coward practise on the <hi>Stage</hi>
to sence with his supposed foe, when all
that while it was but with his own hat and
feather. How much time doth <hi>Petrus</hi>
spend, to hear himself speak, imagining the
Reader to be bound up to his sence and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
                     <p>Indeed I had warning heretofore not to
meddle with him, and was told, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66001:7"/>
he was blind, yet he with his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
could see as far into a <hi>Millstone</hi> as any
other Man: And that if he should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in my History (as how could he

And this generall protestation I hope takes

Notwithstanding to touch on each of

                     <p>1 To the First, I never said that the Church
was <hi>Mera Chimaera</hi> as it is, or, hath a being,
and ought to be beleived; but as the Respondent
by his answers made it: In which I conceived
him to swerve from the Article, where his

my prosecution was, that the Vniversities are
eminent parts, and Seminaries of the Church, and
had better opportunity to discuss controversies, than
diverse other assemblies; Not by any meanes to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
them, but to prepare them for the determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

and <hi>Wickliffists,</hi> (as he styles them) very coarsly,
calling them <hi>scattered Conventicles,</hi> charging them
with <hi>Heterodoxes in Religion,</hi> who, I have heard and
read, suffered very much under the tyranny of the
See of <hi>Rome.</hi> 5. He highly magnifies <hi>the Writers of
the Church of</hi> Rome, and in special <hi>Bellarmine for his
cordial and stout maintenance of some fundamental points
of Faith,</hi> comparing <hi>him with any of the Divines or learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men of the Reformed Churches,</hi> entituling him <hi>Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lissimus
Cardinalis,</hi> and so much himself confesseth;
but by another Witness, I have been told, that he
did also then, and at other such times, accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
divers others, not only the like, but greater
Titles.</p>
                     <p>6. He confesseth (page 215.) that upon this,
Dr. <hi>Prydeaux censured him in the Schools for a Papist,
and one of</hi> Bellarmines <hi>Disciples.</hi> For my part, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but subscribe to so learned a Testimony: and if
it be so, it were better for him to appear the same,
than thus to disguise himself to the dishonour of
our profession. This whole Relation speaks little or
nothing to the Doctors reputation; <hi>Out of thine own
mouth will I judge thee.</hi> What he tells us immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after, <hi>of his two Sermons at</hi> Woodstock, <hi>and of
the commendation given him by some of the Court,</hi> as they
must be his own Flatterers, so it appears they were
no judicious wise men by the over-much latitude in
it, <hi>(ibid.) as if in those two Sermons he had done more
against Popery, than all the Sermons Dr.</hi> Prydeaux <hi>had
preached in his life time;</hi> as it was an absurd, ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
rant, so it is worse becomming his own pen to
be the Trumpet thereof. And how it agrees with
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:66001:18"/>
his <hi>haesitation, whether the Religion of Popery be I dolatrous
and superstitious?</hi> (as he doth in his <hi>Examen Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum</hi>
of Mr. <hi>Fullers</hi> History) I leave it unto any man
to judge, I am sure in it he strayes from the <hi>Homilies</hi>
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who do fully determine
it. And what that Error was which he preached
in a Sermon at <hi>Westminster,</hi> for which the Dean pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
rebuked him in the Pulpit, saying, <hi>Sir no
more of that,</hi> and persisting therein he stroke the
Pulpit with his staff, saying, <hi>No more of that I say,</hi>
I leave to his own memory, it being very likely
to be a kin to this.</p>
                     <p>And whereas he saith (page 216.) that he
maintained this position, <hi>that the Church could not
erre,</hi> unless he have some unknown reserve, I know
no point concludes him more, to be what Dr. <hi>Pryde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux</hi>
apprehended him, and so I begin to think I
was not at first much mistaken in conceiving of that
<hi>Anonimous Observator</hi> (Peter Heylin) who began to
write to the disparagement of the late Primat, to
have been some Agent of the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nay, as if he had not injured himself sufficiently,
he goes on to tell us, (page 217.) <hi>of the opposition he
made to Dr.</hi> Prydeaux, <hi>and of his judgement in the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
propounded, and of a check given to Dr.</hi> Prydeaux
<hi>by the late Archbishop of Canterbury.</hi> To what end is all
this? is it, or can it be any reputation for him thus
to thwart Dr. <hi>Prydeaux?</hi> will he put his in the same
scale with him? Well, as we know Dr. <hi>Prydeaux</hi>
was an eminent and a pious person, so it appears
Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> was a Disturber of him, and hath in
this very Book of his <hi>Examen Historicum</hi> confirm'd
it sufficiently, in the abuse of Mr. <hi>Thomas Fuller,</hi> one
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:66001:19"/>
of better reputation than himself; and therein
(sooth for to say) I cannot but commend him, he
alwaies aims at high and worthy persons, not spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
his Bolt (soon shot) upon such as are of mean<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
esteem. We have his own Confession, and so the
Crime is no <hi>new one,</hi> (as he saith) but an old one,
with which seeing he hath charged himself, what
need we any further Witness? He comes off but
poorly from the <hi>Hiss,</hi> and is as much mistaken in
his confident conclusion; this whole Relation with
all prudent men <hi>making very much for the ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in penning of his book, &amp; affirming his own tale of</hi> St.

these are not to be heeded, being only his own
testimony, and will be as little effectual to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring

what he hitherto vented, hath been to the late <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat</hi>

of some unsavory language against Dr. <hi>Hackwell,</hi>
not much to be valued; only let me tell him, as <hi>to
his reputation,</hi> which he here at last <hi>much boasts of, to
have been with the generality of this Nation,</hi> certainly
he hath looked on himself with some Multiplying
Glasse, for I can witnesse, that with the Court and
Parliament, Clergy and Commonalty, he had the
least of resp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ct, and as much of the general hatred
as any of his profession; he being indeed of such an
harsh disposition, that few persons could consort
with him: And so he continued during the Court
and Parliament, as appears by the speech of a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Member, Sir <hi>Benjamin Ruddier, 7 Novemb. Anno</hi>
1640. After he had traced the proceedings of some
of the Clergy, very much to their rebuke, <hi>he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
about dancing upon Sundayes, that they would fain
be at some thing that were like the Masse that will not bite,
a muzzled Religion; they would evaporate and dispirit
the power and vigour of Religion, by drawing it out
into solemn specious formalities, into obsolete an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquated
Ceremonies new furbished up. And</hi> Mr.
Speaker (said he) <hi>this is the good work in hand
which Dr.</hi> Heylin <hi>hath so often celebrated in his bold
Pamphlets. All his Acts and Actions are so full of mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
Involutions and complications, as there is nothing
cleer, nothing sincere in any of his proceedings, &amp;c.</hi> and
much more, which I forbear.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, this Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> was intertained by some
persons, a fit bold Agent to be made use of in the
opposing of such whom they pleased should be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted,
and that for promotion (of which yet,
they did not think him much worthy) he would
adventure upon the broaching any thing for seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

                        <pb n="33" facs="tcp:66001:20"/>I shall only add this, that it had been very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent

without the name of any Author, but now laid claim
to by the History of King</hi> Charls, p. 34.) His nonsense is
thus to be understood, <hi>viz.</hi> That he would have
observed the same defects in the former Histories,
had he known them to be <hi>Sandersons,</hi> but they
were published without the name of any Author,
till now, that they are laid claim to by the Author
of the History of King <hi>Charls;</hi> this he would seem
to say.</p>
                  <p>But in earnest, this his first <hi>Advertisement</hi> is so
false, as that I expected his craving pardon of the

this his petty Pamphlet, by which <hi>Errata</hi> he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peears
to have conned over his <hi>Advertisements</hi> for to

of King <hi>Charls.</hi> And then, to confirm his bold Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the defects in the former (of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> &amp;

Examinor <hi>of all Scripturients by his Examen Historicum;</hi>
but as others have censured him (Dr. <hi>Hackwell</hi> by
name) so say I, <hi>The condition of the Man being such,

                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:66001:30"/>
his testimony as to the truth is not valuable, for, or

                  <p>And this with modesty I may averr (whatever
his malice can imagine to the contrary) that these
Histories sell well, holding up their first good
price, and thereby are valued in the commodious
and profitable vent, with the general acceptation
of those that pay for them, an argument sufficient
against Dr. <hi>Heylins</hi> Censure.</p>
                  <p>But what occasion he intends forthwith to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise,
of quarreling with other Authors, we must
expect some formal reasons no doubt. He being
about (as we are informed) to <hi>Animadvertise</hi> on
the large volumes and elaborate work of Mr. <hi>Fox</hi>
his <hi>Books of Martyrs,</hi> for the Doctor could never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
those stories. And that being soon dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
then we are to be assured of his <hi>Advertisements</hi>
on Sir <hi>VValter Raughleys large History of the VVorld.</hi>
And afterwards he resolves to publish a set form of
Apology in excuse of his own works. And in fine
(as the best at last) <hi>he will examine himself, because</hi>
