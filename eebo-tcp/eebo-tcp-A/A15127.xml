            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here bee diuers thinges, &amp; especially fiue, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I first tooke this labour in hande, had almost vtterly dissuaded me from the same.</p>
            <p>First, bycause I doe with all my hart hate contention and strife, and especially in matters of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, among such as professe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> selfe same Gospell.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for that I feared gretly least some slander might redounde to the Gospell by this open contention, séeing that God is not the authour of contention or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, but of peace.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I doubted whether this kinde of dealing by writing, might minister matter to the common aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries of the Gospell, to reioyce and glorie, and to flatter them selues the more in their damnable errors.</p>
            <p>Fourthly I, greatly suspected the slanderous reportes of the backbiter and of the vnlearned ton<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

bycause he loueth to speake euill, and heare euill of all those that be not in all pointes inclinable to his phansie, whereof I haue great experience, being my selfe most vniustlye slandered by that viperous kinds of men: the other, bycause they be not able to iudge of controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies according to learning and knowledge, and therefore are ruled by affection, &amp; carried hedlong with blind zeale, into diuers sinister iudgementes &amp; erronious opinions.</p>
            <p>Lastlye, bycause I knowe sundrie (in all respectes) worthie men, much more able to deale in suche matters, than I am.</p>
            <p>But when I considered my dutie towardes God, to his Churche, and to our most gracious Lady and soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Elizabeth hir Maiestie (by whose ministerie God hath giuen his Gospell frée passage vnto us) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first stoppe and hinderaunce was answered. For I thought that, that dutie ought not to be omitted for any such cause, séeing God and not man, shall be my Iudge: and also that not he which defendeth the truthe, and confuseth errours, but he that impugneth the truthe, and spreddeth sectes, is the authour of contention.</p>
            <p>Likewise when I remembred y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> it was no new thing to haue contentions, sectes, &amp; schismes in the Churche of Christ, (especially when it enioyeth externall peace) and that we had manifest examples therof from time to time, (first in Peter, &amp; Paule. <hi>ad Gala.</hi> 2. Paule &amp; Barnabas, Acto. 15: then in the Churche of the Corinthians. 1. Cor. 1. and .3. Afterwardes betwixt the orientall Church &amp; occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall Church, touching Easter &amp; such like matters: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Bishops of Aphrica and the Bishops of Italie, for rebaptising of heretikes: &amp; sundrie times, yea vsuallie in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> external peace of the church, as may be more at large séene in Eusebius, <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>eccle. histo. ca.</hi> 6. <hi>&amp; lib.</hi> 5. <hi>ca.</hi> 24.25.26. <hi>&amp; li.</hi> 8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Likewise in Ruffinus <hi>li.</hi> 1. <hi>ca.</hi> 1. In Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zom. <hi>Li.</hi> 6. <hi>ca.</hi> 4. In Basilius magnus <hi>epist.</hi> 61. <hi>ad fratres &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:22862:3"/>
Episcopas in accidente: &amp; epist.</hi> 69. and in sundrie other auncient and learned histories and writers.</p>
            <p>For the second point I was satisfied, for I thought, that, that could be no slander to this Church which by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of Sathan hath bene practised in all Churches euen synce the ascention of Christ.</p>
            <p>Thirdly when I perceiued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> these men against whome I nowe write, did agree with the aduersaries in defacing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> state of religion, the order of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon prayers, the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie, the sacramentes, the kind of gouerme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. &amp;c. vsed and allowed in this realme of England, and that in as oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious &amp; spitefull manner as the aduersaries do: likewise that they séeke to ouerthrow the selfe same pillers of this Church with the aduersaries (although not by the selfe same meanes) I thought that the confutation and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe of the one should be the confutation &amp; ouerthrow of the other, and therefore the aduersaries to haue small cause in déed of reioycing.</p>
            <p>Against backbiters, slanderers, and vnlearned tongs, I shall by Gods grace arme my selfe with pacience, for their taulke is no sufficient cause for a man to absteyne from dooing his dutie.</p>
            <p>To conclude, I, (although the vnworthiest and vnmée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test of a great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber) was bold to take vpon me this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise, partly to shew, that the booke called the Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is not such, but that it may easily be answered, and especially to satisfie mine owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science: for I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered that if no man had taken vpon him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enuie of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon sort, in withstanding the enterprises &amp; procéedings of the Anabaptists whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they began in Germanie, Anabaptisme had ouerrunne those Churches &amp; vtterly destroyed them.</p>
            <p>These were the reasons that satisfied the former ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections, and especiallye moued me to take vppon me this labour: wherewith, if I can also satisfie others, I haue my desire: if not, yet haue I done my dutie, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
<pb facs="tcp:22862:4"/>
mine owne conscience. And for asmuche as the matter toucheth the state of the whole Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, I thought it most méete to dedicate this my booke, rather vnto the same generally, than to any one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer member thereof: protesting that if I haue affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med any thing therein, that by learning and good reasons may be proued erronious, I will reforme the same, for I wholly submit it to the rule of Gods worde, and the iudgement of those that he learned, discrete, &amp; wise. The Lord blesse the (o deare spouse of Christ) with the continuance of his Gospell, of the Quenes Maiestie, and of godlye peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Amen.</p>

            <head>A briefe examination of the reasons vsed in the booke, called an Admonition to the Parliamente.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irst, in that booke the scripture is most vntollerably abused, and vnlearnedly applyed, quoted only in their margent to delude both such, as for lacke of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, can not, and suche, as either for slouthfulnesse or some preiudicate opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, will not, examine the same: as I haue particulerly declared in my aunswere following.</p>
            <p>Secondly their proofes consist especially of these argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The first is <hi>ab eo quod est secundum quid, ad id quod simplicitorest</hi> as, such and such things were not in the Apostles time, <hi>Ergo</hi> they ought not to be nowe. Whiche kinde of argumente is very deceiptfull, and the mother and welspring of many both olde and newe schismes: of old, as of them that called them selues <hi>Apostolicos,</hi> and of the <hi>Aërians:</hi> of new, as of <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> who conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring neither the diuersitie of times concerning the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ecclesiastical pollicie, nor the true libertie of the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian religion in externe rytes and ceremonies, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters neither commaunded nor forbidden in Gods lawe, nor the authoritie of Christian magistrates in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian congregation, concerning the same haue boldely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprised to stirre vp many and heynous errours: For if these reasons should take place: the Apostles vsed it not, <hi>Ergo</hi> it is not lawfull for vs to vse it: or this either: they did it, <hi>Ergo</hi> we must needes do it: then no Christians may haue any place to abide in: they maye haue no Christian Princes: no ministration of sacraments in Churches and suche like: for the Apostles had no place to abide in, they
<pb facs="tcp:22862:5"/>
had no Christian Princes to gouerne them, no churches to minister sacraments in. &amp;c. Likewise we must haue al things common: we must departe with al our possessions when we be conuerted to the Gospell: baptise abroade in the fields: minister the communion in priuate houses on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: be alwayes vnder the crosse and vnder Tyrants, and such like: For the Apostles had al thinges common, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from their possessions, baptized abroade in fieldes, ministred the communion in priuate houses, were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes vnder persecutors and Tyrants. &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another kind of argumente is much like vnto this, and is taken <hi>ab authoritate negatinè,</hi> which in matters of saluation and damnation holdeth when we reason <hi>ab au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritate scripturae,</hi> from the authoritie of the scripture, but not else: For this argument (it is not commaunded in the scripture to be done nor there expressed, <hi>Ergo</hi> it ought not to be done) is so far out of the way and so erronious, that it is not tollerable: for it taketh away the most parte of all due circumstances, without the which either after one manner or other, the very institutions of Christ can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be obserued: For how is it possible to receiue the holy Communion, but either sitting, standing, knéelling, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, or lying: either at one time or other: in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> morning, or at night: before meate, or after meate: clothed or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: in this place or in that place. &amp;c. and yet none of these circumstances are in scripture commaunded, or by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary collection may thereof be gathered: the same is to be said of the obseruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of times, of common prayers, and other conuenient and necessarie orders in the Church. If this argumente were good, then all good lawes and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances made for the aduancing of true religion, and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing of good orders, were to be abolished, whiche were the very roote and welspring of stubbornesse, obstinacie, sedition, disobedience, and confusion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third kind of argument is called <hi>petitio principij,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:22862:5"/>
whiche is when a man frameth vnto himselfe principles of his owne deuise, grounded neither vpon authoritie, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet upon substantial reason, and then vpon the same will conclude his purpose: which is <hi>vit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentands: a very erronious kynde of reasoning</hi> as these men doo in vsing these two false principles: the one, when they say, that to be inuented by an Antichristian Pope which was not so inuented: the other, when they say that nothing may be vsed in the Church of Christ which was inuented by the Pope, or vsed in the Popes Churche: which can not be true, as in sundrie places of the boke I haue declared. The selfe same reasons moued the <hi>Aërians</hi> to forsake the order of the Churche, and to commaunde their Disciples to do the contrarie of that that the Church did. We borrow good lawes of the Gentiles, and we vse the Churches, Belles, Pulpits, and many other things vsed of Papists. &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The fourthe kynde of reason is, of negatiues by comparison: as this, Priestes and Ministers are to be known by their doctrine, not by their apparel, <hi>Ergo</hi> they ought not to haue distinct apparell from other men. This argumente followeth not, for negatives by comparison are not simplie to be vnderstanded, but by the way co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison: And therefore of the former sentence thus we may conclude, that the apparell is not to be estéemed as a note of difference in comparison to learning &amp; doctrine, and yet a note. As when Paule sayth that Chryst sente him not to baptise, but to preache the Gospell: 1 Cor. 1. And God by his Prophete I wil have mercy, and not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. Ose. 6. and Mat. 9.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The fift is <hi>ab eo quod est non causam vt causam pone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, vvhen that is taken for the cause of any thing, vvhich is not the cause:</hi> as when they condemne the booke of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayer, and a prescript forme of seruice, bycause (as they say) it mainteineth an vnlerned (or as they term it)
<pb facs="tcp:22862:6"/>
a reading ministerie, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the boke is not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cause of it, neither yet a prescripte forme of prayer, but either the parties themselues that be vnlearned, or they that do ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte them, or else both. This kind of argument is vsuall in the Admonition.</p>
            <p>There be other vnlearned and vnskilfull reasons vsed in this booke, whiche may easily be discerned euen of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: and therefore I here omit them.</p>
            <p>Thus much I thought good generally to write, which being duly considered, the booke it selfe needeth no other kinde of confutation.</p>

               </gap>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be feared in this Church of Englande, and almoste playnly professed in this Admonition, the authors wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of agrée with them in these forenamed practises and qualities.</p>
            <p>Moreouer it may also please you to consider the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and practises of the <hi>Donatists,</hi> who deuided them selues from the congregation, and had their peculiar Churches, or rather Conuenticles, in <hi>Africa:</hi> They taught also that all other Churches were spotted and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, bicause of their Ministers.

               </gap>atly ioyne with the Papists, and by the selfe same assertions, bend their force agaynst this Churche of Englande. For,</p>
            <p>Fyrst, the Papistes affirme that we are not the true
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:22862:10"/>
Churche, no, that we haue not so muche as the outward face and shewe of the true Churche. And so do these men almost in flat and playne termes.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Secondly the Papistes say, that we haue no mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie, no Byshops, no Pastours, bicause they be not ritely and canonically called to these functions: the selfe same do these men affirme.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Thirdly, the Papistes say, that our Sacraments be not rightly ministred: and so say they likewise.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Fourthly, the Papistes wholly condemne our booke of Common prayers, set out by publike authoritie, and the whole order of our seruice: In that poynt these men do fully ioyne with them also, for they condemne it wholly, and that with most bitternesse.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Fiftly, the Papistes would not haue the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures read in the Churche to the people: no more would they. For they say, reading is not féeding, but as euil as playing vpon a stage, and worse too.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Sixtly, the Papistes denie the ciuill Magistrate to haue any authoritie in Ecclesiasticall matters: and so do they.</p>
            <p n="7">7 To be shorte, the Papistes refuse to come to our Churche, to communicate with vs in the Lords supper: and these men would not haue them by lawes and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment compelled there vnto.</p>
            <p>Hereby it is manyfest, that the Papistes and they ioyntly séeke to shake, nay to ouerthrowe the selfe same foundations, grounds, and pillers of our Churche, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not by the selfe same instruments and engines. Wherfore it is time to awake out of sléepe, and to draw oute the sworde of discipline, to prouide that lawes which be generall and made for vniformitie, aswell of doctrine as Ceremonies, be generally and vniuersally obserued: that those which according to their conscience and duetie execute them, be maynteyned, and not disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,

either boldly to defende the religion and kinde of gouernement in this Realme established, or else (if you can) to refourme and better the same: for it can not bée, but that this fréedome giuen vnto men, to obey and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey what they liste, to speake what they liste, agaynst whome they liste, and where they liste, to broche what opinions and doctrine they list, muste in the ende burst out into some straunge and daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous effecte.

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HESE TVVO</hi> treatises conteyned in this admonition, as they be voyde of sounde learnyng, so are they full of blynde affection, and stuffed with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable and vnchristian terms and phrases: wherfore it is to bée feared, that they procéede not of loue, but of hatred, not of zeale, but of malice, not of humilitie, but of arrogancie, not of myndes desirous to reforme, but of stomackes séekyng to deforme and confounde, that whiche is in due forme and order by lawfull authoritie established. For what charitable, zealous, and humble spirite, woulde so spitefully and slaunderously speake of their brethren, whose doctrine is pure, whose zeale is feruent, whose suffering for the Gospel hath ben in time of triall, comparable with any mans that nowe liueth: who haue also paynfully taughte the worde of God in this realme, and do at this day, and by whose ministerie the Gospel hath taken roote, and is come to that encrease that now (God be thanked) appeareth. Surely these op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious termes, proude generation, tyrannous lordships, vngracious, cruel, Popelike, wicked raigne, proude enimies. &amp;c. applied to brethren, procéede not from the humble and mylde spirite of GOD, but from the proude and arrogante spirite of Sathan. Therfore by this vnséemely preface it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, from what spirite the reste of thys admonition spryngeth. Touchyng the crueltie and rigeure these men complayne of, I shall néede to speake little, bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manyfeste to all that bée not with synister affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons blynded, that lacke of seueritie is the principall

cause of their licentious libertie. But who séeth not their hypocrisie, whiche would make the worlde beléeue that they are persecuted when they be with too much lenitie punished for their vntollerable contempt of good lawes, and other disordered dealings? Naye suche is their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersenesse, or rather arrogancie, that if they be debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red but of the least part of their will and desyre, by and by they crie out of crueltie and persecution. It is to be doubted what these men will do when persecution com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in déede, whiche now make so muche of a little or rather of nothing. As for this great brag, For how so euer learned and many they seeme to be, they should and may in this realme fynde inowe to matche them, and shame them too, if they hold on as they haue begonne, <hi>Satis arroganter dictum est:</hi> And verifieth that to be true, that is commonly spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of these kinde of men, that is, that they contemne all other in comparison of themselues: that they thinke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues only zealous, only learned &amp;c. But it is possible they may be matched, and I know no man of learning afrayde to encounter with them, eyther by word or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Touching the ministerie and gouernement of the Church, what faults there is to be therin found, we shall vnderstand when we come to their reasons. God graunt vs humble and méeke spirites, that godly vnitie may be maynteyned in the Churche.</p>
            <p>One thing I must desire thée to note (gentle reader) (wherin the follie of these men maruellously appeareth) how they haue paynted the margent of their booke, with quoting of scriptures, as though al were Scripture they write, when as in déede they abuse both the Scripture and thée: For what one place of scripture is in all thys preface alledged to any purpose, and yet howe many is there quoted?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:22862:13"/>To proue that wée muste reade these two Treatises without parcialitie or blinde affection, here is noted in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> marge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. 1. Thess. 5. vers. 21. James. 1. James. 2. The place to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Thessalonians is this, <hi>Trie all things, and keepe that vvhiche is good.</hi> The place of the first of James is this, <hi>VVherfore my deare brethren, let euery man be svvifte to heare, slovve to speake, and slovve to vvrath:</hi> And the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde place of James is this, <hi>My brethren, haue not the faithe of our Lorde Iesus Christe in respecte of persons.</hi> And to what purpose are these places alledged? What proue they? Or what néede is there to alledge them? These Apostles in these places speake not of rayling li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, but of hearing the word of God, and iudging of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faithe according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth, and not to the persons.</p>
            <p>To proue that tyrannous lordship can not stand with Christs kingdom, they alledge the .15. of Mat. and Luc. 16. The place in the 15. of Mat. vers. 23. is this, <hi>But he answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hir not a vvorde. Then came to him his disciples, and besought him, saying: Sende hir avvay for she cryeth after vs.</hi> In the sixtéenth of Luke it is thus: <hi>Then he sayd vnto them, ye are they vvhiche iustifie youre selues before men, but God knovveth your hartes: for that vvhiche is highly estemed among men, is abhomination in the sight of god.</hi> I would gladly know how their assertion, and these two textes hang together. I allowe not tyrannous Lordshyp to stande with Christes kingdome: But it may well inough for any thyng in these two places to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Tyrannous Lordship is not estéemed among men, but hated.</p>
            <p>To proue that they whose authoritie is forbidden by Christe, will haue their stroke without their fellowe seruauntes, &amp;c. is quoted, Math. 20. Math. 23. Mark. 10. Luke. 22. In the .20. of Math. it is thus written, <hi>Yee knowe that the lordes of the Gentiles haue domination ouer them &amp;c.</hi> In the .23. of Mathew. <hi>But be ye not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:22862:14"/>
Rabbi, for one is your doctor or teacher, to wit, Christ.</hi> The places in Marke and Luke be all one with that in the 20. of Mathew. The conclusion that is gathered of these places is very darke and generall: they should<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> haue declared who they be that haue this authoritie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, and what the authoritie is. Touching these places alleaged in the 20. of Mat. 10. of Mar. 22. of Luke, <hi>Musculus</hi> and diuers other learned men think, that they extende not onely to the Apostles and men of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, as we call them, but to all Christians, of what state soeuer they be. And it is the common opinion of all wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that these words of Chryst do not condemne supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioritie, Lordeshippe, or any suche lyke authoritie, but the ambitious desire of the same, and the tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nical vsage thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Musculus</hi> expounding these places sayth in this sorte: <hi>VVhosoeuer vvill be great among you. &amp;c. He sayth not, no man ought to be chiefe among you, vvhich he shoulde haue said, if it had not ben lawful in the kingdome of God for some to be great and chiefe, or if it had ben necessarie, that all shoulde haue bene in all things equall: the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall spirits are not equal, the stars be not equal, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles them selues vvere not equall: Peter is found in many places to haue ben chiefe amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the rest, vvhich vve do not denie. Therfore this is not Christes meaning to haue none great or chiefe among Christians, seeing the very necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of our state requireth that some be superiours and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, so far is it from beeing repugnaunt to charitie. In a common vveale it is necessarie that some should excell o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; so is it in a vvell ordered familie: In like maner there must be in the Churche gouernours, presidents, rulers, of vvhome Paule maketh mention. Ro.</hi> 12. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. <hi>As there is also in the body some principall me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers, some inferiour. &amp;c. Therfore Christ doth not require that in his kingdome all should be equall, but this he doth require,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:22862:14"/>
that none should desire to be great, or to be thought and counted chiefe.</hi> Hitherto <hi>Musculus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which interpretation muste néedes be true, else we may say, that Christe in this place reiecteth and disallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth the Princes and Magistrates of the Gentiles, and also forbiddeth the same among Christians, which is false and Anabaptisticall.</p>
            <p>Likewise the same <hi>Musculus</hi> sayth, that Chryste tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth in this place, what he ought to be in déede that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth to beare rule ouer other, to wit, that he ought to be a seruaunt to other, that is (as he dothe interprete it) to profite other, and to serue for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie of other, for though the name of a prince and of a lorde be a name of honor and dignitie, yet is it the office of a prince &amp; lorde to serue those which be vnder the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in gouerning of them carefully, and in prouiding for their wealth and peace.</p>
            <p>Moreouer the Greke wordes that Chryste vseth in all these places, as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, doe signifie to rule with oppression, and to rule as a man list.</p>
            <p>Furthermore Christe doth not say, that no man shall be great among them or beare rule, but he sayth: <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque voluerit inter vos magnus fieri. &amp;c. He that desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to be great among you. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, it is manyfest that in Matthewe and Marke, he reproueth the ambition of the sonnes of <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedie,</hi> who ambitiously desired the one to sitte on hys right hande, the other on his lefte. And in Luke the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of the rest of the Apostles, who contended among themselues which of them should be greatest.</p>
            <p>So that it is playne, that these places suppresse am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and desire of rule, in all kinde of men: and not superioritie, not magistracie, not iurisdiction in any kinde of persons.</p>
            <p>Touching the place in the .23 of Mat. where Chryste
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:22862:15"/>
said vnto his disciples, <hi>Be not you called Rabbi, call no man father, be not called maisters.</hi> Who is so ignorant, to thinke that Christ forbiddeth by these wordes one Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten man to call another, lorde, maister, father? shal not children call their parents father? shall not scholers call their teacher, maister? And shall not seruauntes call him master, vnder whose gouernement they are? Is it not lawfull for one to call an other maister, doctour, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, lorde. &amp;c? Paule (notwithstanding these wordes of Christ) 1. Cor. 4. calleth himself their father: and. 1. Ti. 2. he calleth himself the doctour of the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles. Wherfore it is manifest that these names be not here prohibited, muche lesse the offices: but only the pharisaicall, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and arrogant affection of superioritie: As it is also manifest by this that foloweth: <hi>VVho so euer exalteth himselfe. &amp;c.</hi> And surely as Christe condemneth here the ambitious affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of such as ambitiously desire these names of superioritie, so doth he in like maner co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne those who be so puffed vp with pride and arroga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie, that they contemne and disdayne to call men in authoritie by the titles of their offices: For pride, contempt and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancie, is, as well in refusing to giue honoure and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, as it is in ambitious desiring the same.</p>
            <p>But the chiefe purpose of Christe in this place is, to teache vs not so to depende vpon men, as though it were not lawfull to breake their decrées, or to decline from their authoritie: For there is one only Father, Lorde, and maister, to whome wée are so bounde, that by no meanes wée maye declyne at any tyme from hys pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes.</p>
            <p>These places therfore may be aptly alledged against the pride, tyrannie, and ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Bishop of Rome, whiche séeketh tyrannically to rule, and not to profite: But it maketh nothing at all against the lawfull autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of any other in any state or condition of men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:22862:15"/>Howe aptly that place of the .24. of Mathew, <hi>But if the euill seruaunt shall say in his heart. &amp;c.</hi> is alleaged, let all men iudge. I thinke it forbiddeth not to punishe suche as breake good lawes. But Lorde how these men are beaten, which do as they liste, say what they liste, and that with reioycing thereto: that is, if they be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise beaten than hitherto they haue bene, they will not only with schismes and factions teare in sunder this Churche of Englande, but in time ouerthrow the whole state of the common wealth.</p>
            <p>To proue that either we muste haue a righte mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie of God, and a righte gouernement of his Church, according to the Scriptures set vp. &amp;c. or else there can be no right religion. &amp;c. is alleaged the ninth of Matth. the fourth to the Ephe. and the eightenth of Math. In the ninth of Mat. the place they alleage is this, <hi>Surely the haruest is great, but the labourers be fevve: vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. &amp;c.</hi> In the fourth to the Ephe. <hi>He therefore gaue some to be Apostle. &amp;c.</hi> In the eightenth of Mathew, <hi>If thy brother trespasse agaynst thee. &amp;c.</hi> The first place declareth that Ministers of the words are necessarie in Christes Churche. The seconde, that there is diuers kindes and degrées of them. And the thirde sheweth an order of correcting secrete sinnes, and priuate offences, and medleth not with those that be open and knowne to other. Nowe therefore consider to what purpose those places be noted in the margente, and howe little they proue that which is concluded.</p>
            <p>As for all the rest of the places of Scripture that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth noted in the margent of this preface, I knowe not to what purpose they be alleaged, but onely for vayneglorie to bleare the eyes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ignorant people, and to make them beléeue that all that which is written in this booke, is nothing else, but Scripture it selfe. They haue delt very subtilly, to cote the places onely, and not
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:22862:16"/>
to set them downe in playne words, for by this meanes they thinke that of the moste parte it shall neuer be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanded, howe vnaptly, and to what small purpose they be alleaged.</p>
            <p>This name Puritane is very aptely giuen to these men, not bicause they be pure no more than were the Heretikes called <hi>Cathari,</hi> but bicause they think them selues to be <hi>mundiores cateris,</hi> more pure than others, as <hi>Cathari</hi> dyd, and seperate them selues from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches and congregations as spotted and defyled. Bicause also they suppose the Church which they haue deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be without all impuritie.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Will not aunswere words, but matter, nor bare affirmations or negations, but reasons: and therfore in as few words as I can, I will comprehende many lines.</p>
               <p>But before I enter into their reasons, I thinke it not amisse to examine that assertion which is the chiefe and principall grounde (so farre as I can gather) of their Booke: that is, that those things onely are to bée placed in the Churche, which the Lorde him selfe in his worde commaundeth: As though they shoulde say, nothing is to be tollerated in the Churche of Chryste, touching either doctrine, order, ceremonies, discipline,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:22862:17"/>
or gouernement, except it he expressed in the worde of God. And therfore the most of their argumentes in this booke be taken <hi>ab authoritate negatiuè,</hi> which by the rules of Logique proue nothing at all.</p>
               <p>It is moste true, that nothing ought to be tolerated in the Churche, as necessarie vnto saluation, or as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of faith, except it be expresly conteined in the worde of God, or may manifestly therof be gathered: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we vtterly condemne &amp; reiect Transubstantiation, the sacrifice of the Masse, the authoritie of the bishop of Rome, woorshipping of Images, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And in this case an argumente taken <hi>Ab authoritate Scripturae negatiuè,</hi> is most strong: As for example: It is not to be found in Scripture, that the Bishop of Rome ought to be the head of the Church, and therfore it is not necessarie to saluation, to beléeue that he ought to be the head of the Churche. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It is also true, that nothing in ceremonies, order, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, or gouernement in the Churche is to be suffered, béeing against the worde of God: And therfore wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect all ceremonies, wherein there is any opinion to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, woorshipping of God, or merite: As créeping to the crosse, holy breade, holy water, holy candle. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But, that no ceremonie, order, discipline, or kynde of gouernement may be in the Churche, except the same be expressed in the worde of God, is a great absurditie, and bréedeth many inconueniences.</p>
               <p>The Scripture hath not prescribed any place or time wherin or when the Lords Supper shoulde be celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, neyther yet in what manner. The Scripture hath not appoynted what tyme or where the congregation shall méete for common prayer, and for the hearing of the worde of God, neyther yet any discipline for the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting of suche as shall contemne the same.</p>
               <p>The scripture hath not appoynted what daye in the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:22862:18"/>
wéeke should be moste méete for the Sabboth day, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Saterday, whiche is the Iewes Sabboth, or the day now obserued, which was appointed by the church.</p>
               <p>The Scripture hath not determined what forme is to be vsed in Matrimonie, what woordes, what prayers, what exhortations.</p>
               <p>The Scripture speaketh not one woorde of standing, sitting, or knéelyng at the Communion, of méetyng in Churches, fieldes, or houses, to heare the word of God: of preaching in pulpets, chaires, or otherwise: of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing in fontes, in basons, or riuers: openly or priuatly, at home, or in the churche, euery day in the wéeke, or on the Sabboth day only. And yet no man (as I suppose) is so simple to thinke that the Church hathe no authoritie to take order in these matters. I pray you what mente Sainct Paule in the .1. Corinth. 14. after he had prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed certayne orders vnto them to bée obserued in the Churche, thus generally to conclude? <hi>Omnia decenter &amp; ordine fiant, Lette all things be doone decently and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi> Dothe hée not there giue vnto them authoritie to make orders in the Churche, so that all thynges hée doone in order and decently? The best interpreters doo vnderstande this as a general rule giuen vnto the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che to examine hir traditions and constitutions by: And therefore without all doubte their iudgemente is, that the Churche hath authoritie in external things to make orders and appoynte lawes, not expressed in the woorde of GOD, so that thys rule of the Apostle bée ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued.</p>
               <p>Nowe if eyther godly Councels or auncient fathers were any thing at all regarded of these men (as they be not, suche is their arrogancie) this controuersie mighte soone be decided.</p>
               <p>For the most auncient fathers and best learned, as <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinus Martyr, Irenaeus, Tertulian, Cypria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> and other do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly

declare, that euen from the Apostles tyme, the Churche hath always had authoritie in suche matters, and hath obserued diuers orders &amp; ceremonies not once mencioned in the worde of God.</p>
               <p>That notable learned father <hi>Augustine</hi> hathe diuers sayings touching this matter worthie to be noted. In his Epistle <hi>ad Casulanum.</hi> 86 he sayeth thus: <hi>In his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus de quibus nihil certi statuit scriptura diuina, mos populi Dei, vel instituta maiorum, pro lege tenenda est.

In the same Epistle he reporteth the aunswere that <hi>Ambrose</hi> made vnto him, béeing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded whether it were lawfull to faste on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both day, or not to fast, séeing that among the Churches there was some diuersitie in this pointe. <hi>Quando hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, that in Ceremonies and externall disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, hée hath not in Scripture particularly determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned any thyng, but lefte the same to hys Churche, to make or abrogate, to alter or contynue, to adde or take awaye, as shall be thoughte from tyme to tyme moste conuenient for the presente state of the Churche, so that nothing be doone againste that generall rule of Saincte Paule. 1.

               <p>Fourthly, that the obseruyng of them taketh not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie from the conscience, bicause they be not made to be perpetuall and inuiolable, but to be altered as tyme, occasion, and necessitie requireth.</p>
               <p>Fifthely, that all oughte to obeye suche ordinaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for charitie sake, thoughe all stande not in néede of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:22862:21"/>Sixthly, that if a man do violate them by ignoraunce or forgetfulnesse, he doth not offende: if by contempte or stubbornesse, he doth greatly offende.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, that confusion (which is to suffer euery man to doe what he list) is the séede of contention and brauling.</p>
               <p>Last of all, that the true Ministers of God be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious, neither yet the Churches of God.</p>

               <p>Of the same iudgement in this matter is master <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,</hi> as it apeareth in his Epistle to master <hi>Alasco</hi>: These be his words: <hi>If you vvill not admitte suche libertie and vse of vesture to this pure and holy Churche, bicause they haue no commaundement of the Lorde, nor example of it: I do not see hovve you can graunt to any Churche, that it may celebrate the Lordes Supper in the morning, and in an open Churche, especially consecrated to the Lorde: that the Sacrament may be distributed to men kneeling or standing, yea, to vvomen asvvel as to men. For vve haue receyued of these things neither commaundement of the Lorde, nor any example, yea, rather the Lorde gaue a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie example.

               <head>An examination of the places of Scripture alleaged in this portion of the admonition.</head>
               <p>TO proue that nothing in this mortall life is more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to be sought for, &amp; carefully to be looked vnto than the restitution of true religion and reformation of Gods Churche, there is noted. 2. Reg. 23. 2. Chron. 17. 2. Chron. 29.30.31. Psalm. 132. Math. 21. Iohn. 2. In the first place it is declared howe <hi>Iosiah</hi> after he had founde the booke of the Lawe, reformed the Churche. In the seconde place <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> tooke away the high places and groues out of Iuda. &amp;c. In the. 29.30.31. of the. 2. Chron. is described the dooings of <hi>Ezechias,</hi> in repayring the temple and reforming Religion. &amp;c. In the. 132. Psalme it is declared with what care <hi>Dauid</hi> went about to build the temple of God after that he was once established in his kingdome. In the. 21. of Math. Iesus went into the temple, and caste out all them that solde and boughte in the temple. &amp;c. the like he did in the seconde of Iohn. All this is confessed to be true, and no man denieth it. And I pray God make vs thankefull for the Quéenes maiestie, who hath not bene slacke in this poynt, but hath lyke a vertuous, religious, and godly Prince, in the very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into hir reigne, notwithstanding the multitude of hir aduersaries bothe at home and abroade, abolished all superstition, and restored the simplicitie of the Gospell. But these men alleage these places to the discredite of this reformation, and of the whole gouernemente of this Churche. Howe aptly and howe truely, let godly, wise, and learned men iudge.</p>
               <p>To proue that these things onely are to be placed in Gods Churche, which God him selfe in his worde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth, is noted the fourth and the twelfth of Deut.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:22862:22"/>
                  <hi>Ye shall put nothing to the vvord that I commaunde you, neither shall you take any thing therefrom. &amp;c.</hi> And in the other place: <hi>VVhatsoeuer I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde you, take heede you do it, thou shalt put nothing thereto, nor take oughte therefrom.</hi> God in the olde lawe to his people, prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed perfecte and absolute lawes, not onely morall and iudicial, but ceremonial also: neither was there the least thing to be done in the Churche omitted in the lawe. And therfore for them at that time, and during that state, it was not lawfull to adde any thing, nor to take any thing away, no not in ceremonies or other ciuill lawes: nowe in the time of the Gospell God hath left vnto his Churche expressed in his worde, a perfect rule of fayth, and maners, and sufficient to saluation, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed is he that shall adde any thing to it, or take any thing from it in that behalfe, for therein it is perfect and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute. But as he hath lefte the Iudiciall lawe to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the Magistrate, to adde thervnto, or take ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, or alter and chaunge the same, so that no lawe be made agaynst the rule of fayth and good maners expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the worde of God: so hath he lefte authoritie vnto his Churche to make lawes, and appoynte orders and ceremonies, as shall from time to time be thought most expedient and profitable for the same: so that nothing be done contrarie to his worde, or repugnaunt to the same. And this authoritie hath the Church vsed euen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apostles tyme, as it is manyfest both by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Acto. 6. Acto. 15. 1. Cor. 11. and other Ecclesiasticall stories and auncient fathers, as is before by me proued.</p>
               <p>But to come to the words of Deut. themselues, what is it to adde to the worde of God, or to take from it? true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to thinke otherwise, or teache otherwise of God than he hath in his word reuealed: those take from the word that beléeue lesse tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word is expressed: those adde to the word, first, which teach or decrée any thing either in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:22862:23"/>
matters of fayth or ceremonies, contrary to the worde. Secondly, those that make any thing necessarie vnto sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, not conteyned in the worde. Thirdly, suche as make any religion, or opinion of merite in any thing that they them selues haue inuented besides the worde of God. Last of all, they adde to the worde, which forbid that for a thing of it selfe vnlawfull, which Gods worde doth not forbid, and make that sinne, which Gods word doth not make sinne. But suche as truely and sincerely embrace the worde of God, and admit nothing contrary vnto it, if in gouernement and ceremonies without any wicked or superstitious opinion, they appoint or retaine suche as they know not to be agaynst the worde of God, and profitable for the present state of the Churche, can not truely be sayde to adde any thing to the worde of God, or take any thing from it, though the same be not expressed in the worde.</p>
               <p>The other places noted in this margent, as Psal. 37. Rom. 12. 1. Cor. 2. and the rest, are not alleaged to proue any thing in controuersie, but onely without iudgement placed in the margente to make a shewe: howe aptely they be applied I leaue to the consideration of the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Reader.</p>
               <p>This one thing I can not but maruell at, that these fellowes so please them selues in the platforme of their Churche, and attribute so muche therevnto, that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horte, nay rather charge the court of Parliament, with perfect hatred to detest the present state of the Churche, and with singuler loue to embrace that which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe in this booke, and so moue them rather to this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect hatred of vs, and singuler loue of them selues, they vse the authoritie of the 31. and 39. Psalme. In the one <hi>Dauid</hi> sayth, <hi>that he hath hated them that giue themselues to dec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>As though all suche as like or allows of the present state of the Churche of this Realme of Englande, gaue them selues to deceytfull vanities, were contemners of God, wicked and bloudy men, blasphemers of God, and his enimies. I will not aggrauate this blasphemie of theirs: let Prince, nobles, and all other louers of God and his word consider diligently this spirite, and in time preuent the burning malice of the same: no Turke, no Iew, no Papist, could possibly haue spoken more spight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully of this Churche and state: but suche is the spirit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Mat. 7. and .11. as though they onely had the worde of God, and were of the Churche, and we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners &amp; reiecters of the same. O where is humilitie?

            <div type="section">
               <head>Answere.</head>
               <p>The proposition that these libellers would proue is, that we in Englande are so farre from hauing a churche rightly reformed according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prescript of Gods word, that as yet we are not come to the outwarde face of the same. For proofe hereof they vse this argument: There be thrée outward marks wherby a true christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Church is knowen: preaching of the word purely, ministring of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts sincerely, &amp; Ecclesiastical discipline, which consisteth in admonition and correction of faults seuere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But this Church of England (for so in effect they say) is voyde of all these, <hi>Ergo,</hi> it hath not so muche as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal face of a Church. To proue that the word of God is not preached truely, they reason on this sorte: The ministers of the worde are not according to Gods word proued, elected, called or ordeyned: nor the function in such sort so narrowly looked vnto, as of right it ought, &amp; is of necessitie required: And therfore the word of God not truly preached. Here (thanks be to God) they alleage not one article of faith, or poynt of doctrine, nor one péece of any substaunce to be otherwise taught and allowed of in this church (for not euery mans <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>olly is to be ascribed to the whole church) than by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prescript worde of God may be iustified, neither can they. Now how this conclusion
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:22862:24"/>
followeth (though the antecedent were true) lef those iudge that be learned. The ministers are not rightely proued and elected. &amp;c. <hi>Ergo</hi> the worde of God is not tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preached: howe wicked soeuer the man is, howsoeuer he intrude himself into the ministerie, yet may he preach the true worde of God: for the truth of the doctrine doth not in any respecte depende vpon the goodnesse or euil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the man: I pray you howe were you and some other of your adherents, called, elected. &amp;c. But to come to the purpose: They would proue that the ministers of the worde in this Churche of Englande, are not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods worde proued, elected, called, or ordeyned.</p>
               <p>What force and pithe is in their arguments shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in the seuerall answeres to euery one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This one thing I muste let you vnderstande, that these men séeke to defaco this Churche of Englande by the selfe same grounds that the Papists do: although by another kinde of proofe.

But now to their reasons.</p>
               <p>The first is this. For wheras in the old church a triall was had <note n="l" place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Acts.</hi> 6.3. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2.7.8 <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.6.</note> bothe of their abilitie to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structe, and of their godly conuersation also: nowe by the letters commendatorie of some one man, noble or other, tag and rag, learned and vnlearned, of the basest <note n="m" place="margin">1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 12.31</note> sort of the people (to the slaunder of the gospel in the <note n="n" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14.</note> mouthes
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:22862:25"/>
of the aduersaries) are freely receyued.</p>
               <p>It is true that in the olde Churche tryall was had of their abilitie to instruct, and of their godly conuersation: But the place in the margent alleaged oute of the fyrst Chapter of the Actes of the Apostles maketh nothing for that purpose: béeing therein no mention at all of any triall made either of learning or maners, but onely of presenting two, and of praying and casting of lottes: And master <hi>Caluine</hi> in his Institutions sayth playnely, that out of this place of the Actes and example, there can be no certayne rule gathered of electing and choosing Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, for as that ministerie was extraordinarie, so was the calling also. Reade master <hi>Caluine</hi> and you shall soone see howe little this place, so ofte in this mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent coted, maketh for that purpose for the which it is coted. In the sixt of the Acts, mention is made of Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons onely, whome you will not allowe to be ministers of the worde, and therefore this place serueth not your turne, neither is there any thing spoken of any tryall, but only they are willed to looke out among them, seauen men of honest reporte, and full of the holy Ghost and wisedome to be appoynted Deacons. The rule of sainct Paule in the .1. Timo. 3. and Tit. 1. is to be followed. And the Booke of ordering Ministers and Deacons, sette foorth and allowed by this Churche of Englande requireth, that who soeuer is to be admitted into any order of the ministerie, shoulde so be tryed, examined, and proued, bothe for learning and life, as sainct Paule there requireth. Reade the Booke with indifferencie and iudgement, and thou canst not but greatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende it. If any man neglect his duetie in that poynt, his faulte muste not bée ascribed to the rule appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, neyther yet to the whole Churche. Is the lawe euill, bicause some Lawyers in their office swarue from
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:22862:25"/>
it? This is a fallation <hi>a non causa ad causam.</hi> Agayne if some bée admitted into the ministerie, eyther voyde of learning, or lewde in lyfe, are all the rest for their sake to be condemned? Or is this a good argument, some bee admitted into the ministerie without trial, therfore none is lawfully admitted into the ministerie? or some mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters be vnlearned and euill, <hi>Ergo,</hi> there is none good? I thinke you wil not denie, but that there is now with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Church of Englande, as many learned, godlie, graue, wise, and woorthy ministers of the word, as there is in any one realme or particular Church in all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome, or euer hath bene heretofore.</p>
               <p>Touching letters commendatorie of some one man noble or other, it may bée that the parties whiche gyue these letters be of that zeale, learning, and godlynesse, that their particular testimonie ought to be better credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, than some other subscribed with an hundred hands. And I thinke there is bothe noble men and other, who may better be trusted in that poynt, than a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of parishes in Englande, whiche consist of rude and ignorant men, easily moued to testifie any thing: And in many places for the most parte, or altogether, drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Papistrie. I knowe no reason to the contrarie, and I sée no scripture alledged, why one learned, godly and wise mans testimonie, may not be receyued in such a case, and yet the booke expresseth no such thing, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth due examination of learning, and sufficient te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonial of conuersation, and giueth libertie to any one particular man, to obiect any crime against any such as are to be ordered, and willeth that the partie accused be kept from the ministerie, vntill he haue cléered himself of the crimes obiected. If tag and rag be admitted, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and vnlearned, it is the fault of some, not of all, nor of the lawe: And if they were called and elected accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your fantasie, there would some créepe in, as euil
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:22862:26"/>
as any be nowe, and woorse too.</p>
               <p>You say that there be admitted into the ministerie of the basest sorte of the people: I knowe not what you meane by the basest sorte: This I am sure of, that the ministerie is not now bound to any one tribe, as it was to the tribe of <hi>Leui,</hi> in Ieroboams tyme: Now none is secluded from that function of any degrée, state, or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng, so that those qualities be founde in him, which in that office are to be required.</p>
               <p>I maruel to what purpose the twelfth chapiter of the first booke of Kings is here quoted, for Ieroboam is there reproued bicause he toke the préesthood from the tribe of <hi>Leui,</hi> to the whiche onely it did apperteyne.</p>

Wée haue many examples to the contrarie, Peter forswore his maister Chryste, whyche was as euill as sacrifising to idolles, and yet hée was not put from hys Apostleshippe. Wée haue dyuerse examples in the Primitiue Churche, of suche as by feare béeyng compelled to sacrifise to straunge gods, after repented, and kepte still the office of preaching the Gospell, and did moste constantly dye in the same.</p>

               <p>To proue that no minister was placed in any congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,

but by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent of the people, you alledge the. 14. of the Acts, and of the. 2. to the Corinth. the. 8. chapter. In the 14. of the Acts, vers. 23. for the which you haue quoted the 13. it is thus written: when they (that is Paule and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas) had ordeyned them elders by election (for so is some tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) in euery church, &amp; prayed &amp; fasted. &amp;c. The text is plain that Paule &amp; Barnabas did ordeyn them el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: &amp; the gréek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, although it signify to elect by putting vp of hands, yet it is the common opinion almost of al ecclesiastical writers, that this word in scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is vsed for the solemn maner of ordring mynisters by the imposition of hands. Surely howsoeuer the word is taken, yet here is no generall rule prescribed of elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ministers. You may as well conclude, that al thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ought to be common, among Christians, bycause wée reade Acts. 2. that all those whiche beléeued had all things co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon among them: and that those whiche be conuerted to the Gospell oughte to sell their goodes and landes to bée distributed at the discretion of the myni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, bicause they did so, Art. 2. &amp; 3. In the. 2. to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians. 8. The Apostle declareth how the Churches had chosen Luke (or as some thynke Barnabas) to bée his companion in his iourney<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But what makes thys for electing of Mynisters &amp; Howe followeth this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? The Churches had chosen Luke or Barnabas, to bée Paules companyon in hys iourney: therfore mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the woorde muste be elected by the people.</p>
               <p>These thrée last reasons are all one, &amp; the places of scripture which I haue set downe &amp; answered be alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of you to proue that the election of ministers, was then made by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon consent of the people, and that euery co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation had authoritie to cal their ministerie.</p>
               <p>I doe not denye but in the apostles tyme, and after euen to <hi>Cyprians</hi> tyme, the peoples consent was in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places required in the appointing of ministers: But
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:22862:29"/>
I saye, that in the whole Scripture, there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, that it should so be, nor any example that maketh therein any necessarie or generall rule, but that it may be altered as tyme and occasion serueth. For in suche matters not commaunded or prohibited in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture touching ceremonies, discipline, and gouernement, the Churche hath authoritie from tyme to tyme to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynte that whiche is moste conuenient for the presente state as I haue before declared.</p>
               <p>And I adde, that howesoeuer in the Apostles tyme, that kinde of electing and calling ministers was conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient and profitable: now in this state of the Church, it were most pernicious and hurtfull.</p>
               <p>First bicause in the apostles time, the church was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the crosse, and therfore very few in comparison was there that embraced the gospel, and commonly they kept together, or at the least met oftentimes, so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> one of them was thorowly knowne to another, and they themselues could best iudge who amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them was the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ittest to teach and instruct, hauing always diuers fit for that function. Now the church is in prosperitie, and therfore the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that professeth, great, and dispersed into dyuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and in moste parishes not one fit for the ministerie among them or knowne vnto them: so that they should call they knowe not whome.</p>
               <p>Secondly in the Apostles tyme, all or the moste that were Christians were vertuous and godly, and such as did sincerely professe the worde, and therefore the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their pastour might safely be committed to them: nowe the churche is ful of hypocrites, dissemblers, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kardes, whoore mongers. &amp;c. so that if any election were committed to them, they would be sure to take one like to themselues.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in the Apostles time, al that professed Christ had knowledge, and were able to iudge who were méetes
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:22862:29"/>
to be their pastour. Now the most be ignorant and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out iudgement in suche matters.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, in the Apostles tyme there was in the Churche no Idolaters, no superstitious persons, no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes: nowe the Churche is full of Papists, Atheistes, and suche lyke. Who séeth not therfore what straunge ministers we should haue, if the election of them were committed to their seuerall parishes?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, in the Apostles time there was no Churche established, béeing then no christian Magistrates, and therefore the state of the Churche was popular: nowe there is christian Magistrates, and a Church established and subiect to rulers. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Therefore this diuersitie of the state of the Churche requireth a diuers kinde of gouernement, and an other kinde of ordeyning Ministers. For this cause in <hi>Concilio Laodicensi,</hi> which was <hi>Anno. 334.</hi> it was decréed, that the election of Ministers should not be permitted to the people.</p>
               <p>This alteration of gouernement and orders in the Churche of Chryst is well set out by <hi>Ambrose</hi> in the. 4. to the Ephe. vpon these words, <hi>Et ipse dedit. &amp;c.</hi> where he saith on this sorte: <hi>That the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of Christians might encrease and be multiplied, in the beginning it vvas per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to euery one to preache the Gospel, to baptise, and to expounde the Scriptures, but vvhen the Churche vvas enlarged there vvere certaine parishes appoynted, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours and other officers ordeined in the Churche. &amp;c. Therfore the vvritings of the Apostles do not in al things agree vvith the orders that are now in the Church.</hi> Thus farre <hi>Ambrose.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Musculus</hi> also in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon places answering to this question, why that ministers of the word are not chosen nowe by the ministers and the people, as they were in the primatiue Church, but appointed by the Magistrate,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:22862:30"/>
sayth thus: <hi>Talis tum Ecclesiarum erat statiu vt aliter non essent eligendi ministri, quia Christiano magistratu destitue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bantur. Sireuocas temporum illorum mores, primum conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; statum quo<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> illorum reuoca. Such vvas then the state of Churches, that they coulde choose their Ministers no othervvise, bicause they had no christian Magistrates. If thou vvouldest haue the maners and customes of those times obserued, then must thou call backe their condition and state.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Bishoppes haue authoritie to admit ministers (which is here denyed) it is playne by that whiche is written. 1. Timo. 5. <hi>Manus cito ne cus imponas, Lay thy hands rashly on none.</hi> These words <hi>Ambrose, Chriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,</hi> and al learned writers, for the moste part, do say to be an admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Timothie, that he ought to be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspect in appoynting of ministers. And to Titus. ca. 1. Paule sayth that he left him at Creta, <hi>vt constitnat oppi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datim presbiteros, that he should appoynt ministers in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tovvne.</hi> This <hi>Hierome</hi> and others do expounde of the authoritie that Titus had in placing ministers in euery Churche. It is the generall consent of all the learned fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that it perteineth to the office of a Bishop to order and elect ministers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word. In this saith <hi>Hierome in Epist. ad Euagriu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. A Bishop doth excel al other ministers, in that the ordring, and appoynting of ministers doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly pertayne vnto him.</hi> And yet these men say that the right of ordring ministers doth at no hand apperteyne to a byshop. But for the order and maner of making mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, peruse the booke made for that purpose, and as I sayd before, so I say agayne, if thou hast any iudgement thou canst not but like it, and allowe of it.</p>
               <p>The seuenth. Then none admitted to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie, but <note n="u" place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts.</hi> 1.25.</note> a place was voyde aforehande, to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:22862:30"/>
which he should be called: but nowe byshops (to whome the righte of ordering Ministers doth at no hande appertayne) doe make 60.80. or 100. at a clap, and sende them abroade into the countrey like masterlesse men.</p>
               <p>To proue this you cite in the margent the first of the Actes, where it is declared howe Mathias was chosen into the place of Iudas, to make vp the number of the twelue Apostles. Surely this is but a slender reason: Mathias was chosen into the place of Iudas: <hi>Ergo</hi> no man muste bée admitted into the ministerie, excepte a place beforehande be voyde, to the which he shoulde be called. Euery meane Sophister will laughe at the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dishnesse of this argument.</p>
               <p>Mathias was chosen to be an Apostle, and not to any certayne cure, and therefore this example proueth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: If you had used mo reasons I woulde haue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered them. What certayne cure had Paule, Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas, Philippe, Epaphroditus, Andronicus, Iunius, and yet they were not of the twelue Apostles? It is a straunge doctrine to teache that a man may not preache oute of hys owne cure: It is more straunge to say, that it is not lawfull for him to preache, excepte he haue some Pastorall cure, béeyng of hym selfe able to lyue, and not mynding to bée burdensome to the Churche. If you séeke for any texte in Scripture to confirme this doctrine, you can fynde none: if you séeke for examples to the contrarie, you shall fynde plentie.</p>
               <p>That the ordering of Ministers dothe appertayne to Byshops properly, which you here vtterly denie, I haue proued before: they be best able to iudge of mens abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to that function. It is their especiall charge to sée that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:22862:31"/>
there be méete ministers in the Churche, and therefore good reason that they should haue the chiefe stroke in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of them: and yet in that businesse they trust not them selues alone, they haue other godly and learned ministers to assist them in examining suche as are to be admitted: they also require a testimoniall of life and conuersation from that place wherein those that are to be Ministers, haue bene latest and longest remayning.</p>
               <p>If suche numbers as you say be admitted at one time and sent abroade like masterlesse men, that is the faulte of the person, not of the lawe: neither is it a sufficient cause to debarre any learned, godly and méete man from the ministerie, able to liue of him selfe, or hauing any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ecclesiasticall liuing, as Prebende, fellowship in some colledge of either Uniuersitie, or such lyke, though he haue no pastorall charge and cure, neither shall you euer be able to proue, but that a man disposed and able to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o good in the Churche of Chryst, may be admitted into the ministerie, although he haue no Ecclesiasticall liuing at all.</p>
               <p>I mislike runnagates and masterlesse men, and suche as are compelled to séeke vp and downe to get them ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices, aswell as you, and I hope the redresse thereof is already determined.</p>
               <p>The eyght.

               <p>Your places of Scripture alleaged to proue that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters were then Preachers, proue not that all were then Preachers.

               <p>I suppose you are not of that mynde, that men maye now in this Church vnder christian magistrates preach without licence: It hath always ben the opinion of wise, learned, and godly men, that since the apostles time none were ordinarily called to the office of preaching, but such as were called of God by man: onely Anabaptistes and some other sect of heretikes teache the contrarie.</p>

fynde your selues so muche gréeued with, was appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted long before the Churche of Rome declined from the puritie of Chrystes religion, for <hi>Stephanus</hi> bishoppe of Rome, who liued the yeare of our Lorde .256. is sayde to be the first which did appoynt this kinde of apparell for ministers, neither are you able to shew that any antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Pope inuented the same: But admit it were so that this apparell was eyther borowed of the Iewes, or taken from the Gentiles, or inuented &amp; vsed by some An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian Pope, yet it followeth not, but that the same may be wel vsed of Christians in the Churche of Christ.</p>
               <p>Augustine in his epistle <hi>ad Publicolam</hi> hath this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table saying, <hi>Et cum templa, idola, luci, &amp; si quid huiusmodi data potestate euertuntur, quamuis manifestum est cum id a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimus, non ea nos honorare, sed potius detestari, ideo tamen in vsus nostros priuatos duntaxat &amp; proprios, non debemus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de aliquid vsurpare, vt appareat nos pietate ista destruere, non auaritia.

VVhen temples, idols, groues, and such like things by authoritie be ouerthrovvne, although it is manifest, when we do that, vve honor them not but detest them, yet for al that vve may not therefore conuerte them or vse them to our ovvne priuate vses only and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that it may appeare that we destroy them for religion sake, and not for couetousnesse: but when they are conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, not into priuate and our owne vse, but into common vses or to the honor of the true God, that is done and broughte to passe in them, which is done and broughte to passe in men themselues, when of Idolaters and wicked per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sons they are chaunged into true religion.

In this point I doe not wel perceiue howe it may be affirmed for a surety, that we can vse nothing that perteined to the Pope, &amp; is vsed in Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

                  <hi>Bucer</hi> in an epistle that he writte to <hi>Iohn Alasco,</hi> is of the same iudgement, his words are worthy to be noted and be these. <hi>For if by no meanes it be lawfull to vse those things vvhith were of Aarons preesthod or of the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is it not lavvfull for vs to haue Churches, nor holidaies.

The vvhiche consente and professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on beeing chaunged into the consente and profession of Christianitie, there can sticke in the thinges them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues no note or marke of Antichrists religion. The vse of belles vvas a marke of Antichristianitie in oure Churches, vvhen the people by them vvere called to Masses, and vvhen they vvere rong againste tempestes:
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:22862:37"/>
Novv they are a token of Christianitie, vvhen the people by them are gathered together to the Gospell of Christe, and other holie actions. VVhy may it not then be, that the selfe same garmentes maye serue godlie vvith godlie men that vvas of vvicked signification vvith the vngodly? Truly I knovve very many ministers of Christ, most godlie men vvho haue vsed godly these vestures, and at this day do yet vse them: So that I dare not for this cause ascribe vnto them any faulte at all, muche lesse so heynous a faulte of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municatyng vvith Antichrist, for the vvhich fault vve may vtterly refuse to communicate vvith them in Christe. The preestes of diuels did celebrate in their sacrifices, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution of bread and the cuppe, as Iustinus Martyr and Tertullian make mention. VVhat lette is there vvhy vvee may not vse the same ceremonies also? you will saye vvee haue a commaundement of the Lorde touching this cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie. Very vvell. And by the selfe same it appeareth that same thing to serue among the children of God to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of Christe, vvhich the vvicked abused in the seruice of deuils, if the commaundement of Christ be added therto.

Yea truly if you weare a cap or a peculiar kynd of apparell, as a ciuile and politique thing, it smelleth neyther of Iudaisme nor Monachisme: For these will seeme to separate themselues from the ciuile and common life, and accompte a merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious deede in the wearing of a peculiar garment. So Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stachius Bishop of Sebastia, was not simply condemned for wearing a peculier kinde of garmente: but for that he did put religion in his garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.

If in case, any of the people be persuaded that these things Sauoure of Papisme, Monachisme, or Iudaisme, let them be tolde the contrarie, and perfectly instructed therein. And if so be thorough the importunate crying out hereon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the people by some men, many be disquieted in their conscience, let them beware vvhiche so do, that they bring not greater yokes on their owne neckes, and prouoke the Queenes maiestie and bring many faithfull ministers in such daunger, as they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ridde themselues out of againe.</hi> Hitherto <hi>Bullinger.</hi>

               <p>I haue the rather set downe these mens sayings at large, bycause they be both pithie, learned, and wholy to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your assertion. Wherefore I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude that a Christian magistrate may retayne any ciuill, politique or Ecclesiasticall orders and rites, of whomesoeuer they were inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, or howsoeuer they haue bin abused, so that, First, they be not against the word of god: Secondly that iustification and remission of sinnes be not attributed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: Thirdly that the Churche be not troubled wyth the multitude of them: Fourthly that they be not decréede as necessarie and not to be chaunged: And last of all that men be not so tyed vnto them, but that by occasion they maye bée omitted, so that it be withoute offence

and contempte.</p>
               <p>Yet one thing I must admonish you of, that there is a difference to be made betwixte those things which were wholy dedicated to false gods, and to be vsed in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping of them: and those things which were vsed in the false worshipping of the true God: for the Papists herein differ from the Gentiles, that they acknowledge and confesse the true God, and beleue the same articles of faith that we do, but yet worship him not arighte, nor beleue on him in all points as the word of God prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth: And therefore if things abused of the Gentiles, and inuented by them may be vsed of Christians, much more may things inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted and abused by Papists. But of thys matter I minde also to speake something in the seconde parte of this Admonition.</p>

In the meane time, this I am sure of, that the Homilies appointed to be reade in the Churche, are learned, godly, agreable to Gods word, and more effectuall to edification than a number of your sermons which consiste in wordes only, and entreate of little else but of cap, surplesse &amp;c.

               <p>Hythertoo Antichriste had not inuaded the Churche of Rome. But what shoulde I trouble you with anye mo authorities? Those that bée learned maye easyly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande, that these names, Metropolitane, Archbishop, Archdeacon, Primate, Patriarke, and suche like, be most auncient and approued of the Eldest, best, and worthiest councels, fathers, and writers. And forasmuch as the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall and beginning of these names (suche is their anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie) can not be found (so farre as I haue read,) it is to be supposed that they haue their originall from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles them selues: For as I remember Saincte Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine hathe this rule in his 118. Epistle <hi>Ad Ianua. Those things that be not expressed in the scripture, and yet by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition obserued of the vvhole Churche, come either from the Apostles, or from generall Councels, as the obseruing of Easter, the celebrating of the day of the Ascention, and of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of the holie Ghost, and such like:</hi> very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned therfore and ignorant be those, whiche so boldly affirme, that these names (vsed in the purest tyme of the Churche) be Antichristian.</p>
               <p>Whether that the name of Prelate of the garter, Erle, Countie Palatine, Honour, high Commissioner, Iustice of peace, and Quorum, (béeing necessarie offices in this Common weale, partely for the honour of the Prince and Realme, but especially for the good gouernement of all states and degrées of persones) bée Antichrystian, lette those consyder, to whome GOD hathe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mytted the sworde of gouernemente.

               <p>Lordes grace, lorde Bishop, honour, &amp;c. be names of reuerence, teaching vs to acknowledge our dutie towar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des oure superiours, and their authoritie ouer vs: and it is muche more to bée reprehended, not to gyue ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to whome honour is due, than to receyue honoure when it is due. You may and you please in verie aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient histories, and in greate learned fathers see, as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and reuerente titles giuen vnto Bishoppes as these bée. And surely it is not Antichristian to be called by names and titles, not ambitiously soughte for, but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and lawfully giuen according to the condition and state of the place wherein a man is: But it is Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, that is, proude, presumptuous, disdaynful, arrogant, and contemptuous, to refuse to giue to euerye one that name and title that by lawe, ciuilitie and duetie of vs is requyred, and expresseth oure reuerence, duetie, and obedience.</p>
               <p>You woulde speake as muche of names of honoure and reuerence in other persons, if you durste bée so bolde with them, as you thinke you may bée with some.</p>
               <p>Nowe it followeth to proue that the offices signified by these names, are not strange and vnheard of in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes churche, neyther yet plainely in Gods word forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, that they are not to be remoued, but as most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie to be reteyned.</p>
               <p>It is without all doubte, that bothe these names and offices haue bene in Chrystes Churche long before Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene Councell, and that they haue hadde in the same, continuaunce euen to thys daye, as partely it maye bée gathered by that whyche I haue spoken before, and moste manyfestlye by all Hystories, and learned wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from béefore that Councell of Nice, to this instant

               <p>Here a man may reason thus: the distinction of degrées began in the Churche, when men began to say, I holde of Paule, I holde of Apollo. &amp;c. But this was in the Apostles time .1. Cor. 1. Therefore these distinctions of degrees began in the Apostles time.</p>

the Churche of God is not a confused congregation, but ruled and directed as well by discipline &amp; pollicie in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of regiment, as by the worde of God in matters of fayth.

               </p>
               <p>But you say A number of things co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary vnto gods worde are conteyned in this boke, as bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme by women, priuate communions, Iewish purifiengs, obseruing of holydayes &amp;c. patched, if not altogither, yet the greatest peece out of the Popes portuis.</p>
               <p>Here is not one prayer in all the whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> booke found fault with, and yet your quarrell is against a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripte forme of prayers inuented by man.</p>
               <p>You maruellously forget your selfe, and confusedly go from matter to matter, without any consideration.</p>
               <p>Digressing therefore from prayers conteyned in the communion booke, you come to other matters in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same, against gods word, as you say, and first you alledge bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tising by women.</p>
               <p>I deny baptising by wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be expressed in that booke, and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you haue proued it to be necessarilye gathered out of the same, then shal you heare my iudgemente thereof.</p>
               <p>Your places of scripture alledged against it, are not of sufficiente force to proue your purpose. Christe in the 28. of Mathewe saide to his Disciples, goe and teache all nations, baptising them in the name of the father. &amp;c.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:22862:47"/>
                  <hi>Ergo</hi> women may not baptise, I say this argumente fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not, no more than this doth, <hi>Ergo</hi> pastors may not baptise, for it is manifest that an Apostle is distinct from a pastor.</p>
               <p>The second place you doe alledge is .1. Cor. 14. where Paule sayeth, it is a shame for women to speake in the congregation: Paule sayeth not that it is a shame for wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to speake at home in priuate houses, for women may instructe their families: yea and they may speake also in the congregation in time of necessitie, if there be none els there that can or will preach Christ, and hereof we haue examples.</p>
               <p>If women do baptise, they baptise in priuate houses, not in the congregation.</p>
               <p>Surely you are able to marre a good matter for lacke of skilfull handling.</p>
               <p>You say in your margent that <hi>Victor.</hi> An. 198. did first appoint that women might baptise. By this ye adde more credite to the cause than you are aware of. For <hi>Victor</hi> was a godly bishop and a martir: and the Church at that time was in great puritie not being long after the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles time. But truly I can finde no such thing in all his decrées: only this he saith, that such as be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted of the Gentiles to the faith of Christ, in time of necessitie, or at the pointe of death, may be baptised at any time in any place, whether it be in the Sea or in a riuer, or in a pond, or in a well, so that they make a confession of their faith. He maketh no mention at all of any baptising by wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and therfore you haue done your cause great iniurie.</p>
               <p>The seconde thing you mislike is priuate communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And you quote the 1. Cor. 11. In which chapter sainct Paule reproueth the prophanation of the supper among the Corinthians by banquetting and contempte of their brethren, and he exhorteth one of them to tarrie for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: But how can you applie thys to your purpose?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:22862:47"/>I knowe not what you meane by priuate Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: If you meane the receyuing of one alone, there is none such allowed in the booke: If you meane bicause it is ministred sometime vpon occasion in priuate houses, I sée not howe you can call it priuate in respecte of the place, if the number of communicants be sufficient. You muste explicate your selfe, before I can tell what you meane.</p>
               <p>There is nothing in the Communion booke touching the Communion, contrarie to that place of S. Paule by you quoted, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>The Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion exhibited to sicke persons is allowed both of <hi>Peter Martir</hi> and <hi>Bucer,</hi> as in the other treatise I haue declared, and consonant to the custome of Christes Churche, euen from the Apostles time, as it is to be séene in olde writers.</p>
               <p>The third is, the Iewish purifyings (as you terme it) you cite for that purpose Act. 15. where Peter speaking agaynst certayne of the Pharisies, which beléeued and taught that it was néedeful for the Gentiles which were conuerted, to be circumcised, and to obserue Moses law, saith on this sort: <hi>Novv therfore vvhy tempt ye God, to lay a yoke on the disciples necks. &amp;c.</hi> how any thing here conteyned, prohibiteth wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after they be deliuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the great daunger and paynes of childe bearing, to giue in the congregation thankes for their deliueraunce, let the godly Reader iudge. Surely this is no Iewishe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying, but christian giuing of tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks, most consonant &amp; agreable to the word of God. But hereof also something more is to be spoken in another place.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, you mislike obseruing of holy dayes: And you alledge Exod. 20. <hi>Sixe dayes shalte thou labour and do all thy vvorke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To obserue any day superstitiously, or to spende any day vnprofitably, is flat agaynst, not this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:22862:48"/>
onely, but others also in the holy Scriptures. And I woulde to God it were better looked vnto. But to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stayne any day from bodily labour, that we may labour spiritually in hearing the worde of God, magnifying his name, and practising the workes of charitie, is not, either agaynst this, or any other commaundement. For I thinke the meaning of this commaundement is not so to tye men to bodily labour, that they may not intermit the same to labour spiritually: For then how could we preachers and students excuse our selues? howe mighte the people lawfully come to oure Sermons and Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in any of the sixe dayes? But of this thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so occasion wyll bée ministred to speake more héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>In the ende you adde (patched, if not altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet the greatest peece oute of the Popes portuis.)</p>
               <p>To this I aunswere briefly, it maketh no matter of whom it was inuented, in what booke it is conteyned, so that it be good and profitable, and consonant to Gods worde. Well sayth <hi>Ambrose, Omne verum a quocunque dicitur, à spiritu sancto est. All truthe, of vvhomsoeuer it is spoken, is of the holy ghost.</hi>

               <p>These be but words of pleasure: God be tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ked, there be ministers (&amp; such as you mislike of) which féede their flocks diligently, and preach in time and out of time, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording both to S.

For what is it to preache euery day, and to spende the time with words onely, or with bitter inuectiues agaynst certayne trifles, and agaynst superiours? Suche sermons doe not edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, but destroy, doe not worke in the hearts of the hearers faythe and charitie, but eyther contempte of religion, or else contempte of superiours, contempt of good orders, yea hatred, malice, vndiscrete wrath, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured with a pretence of zeale. Truely suche sermons seldome or neuer worke any good effecte: many wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in London coulde on that sorte occupie the time.

And yet I knowe the oftner a man dothe preache (the former circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces béeing considered) the better it is. But of euery one it will be required according to his talent: and not he that speaketh moste, but laboureth most to speake, not he that preacheth moste often, but that preacheth moste

               <p>These and a great many other abuses are in the ministerie remaining, which vnlesse they be remoued, and the truth broughte in, not onely Gods iustice shalbe poured forth, but also gods Churche in this realme shall neuer be buylded.

               <p>The seconde externall note of the true Churche of Christe is ministring of the Sacramentes sincerely: you would proue that this Churche of England hath not the Sacramentes sincerely ministred: First by thrée gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall reasons pertaining to both the Sacramentes: then by certain abuses whiche you fynde seuerally in eyther of them.</p>
               <p>The first generall reason is this: In olde time the worde was preached before the Sacraments were ministred: now it is supposed to be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient if it be read.</p>
               <p>To proue that the worde was preached before the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts were ministred, you alledge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> third of Mathew verse, 12. <hi>VVhich hath his fanne in his hand, and vvil make cleane his flovver, and gather his vvheate into his garner. but vvill burne vp the chaffe vvith vnquencheable fyre.</hi> I vnderstand not how you can of this place conclude, that there must be of necessitie preaching and not reading be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the administration of the Sacraments. If you say, Iohn preached vnto suche as came vnto his Baptisme, and readde not vnto them, therefore of necessitie there must be preaching, and not reading, I denye the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for it is a common rule that we may not conclude a generall doctrine of a singuler or particuler example:
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:22862:52"/>
and I am sure it is agaynst all rule of Logicke.</p>
               <p>But how if it maye be proued, that Iohn did baptyse some without preaching vnto them? In that third chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Mathew, verses .5. and .6. we reade that all Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem and all <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>daea,</hi> and all the region round about Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, went out to be baptized of him, and that they were baptized of him in Iordane, confessing their sinnes, but we reade not that he did immediatly before preache vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: and verses .13.14.15. it is manifeste, that he did baptize Christe without preaching. This is but a slender proofe you vse therby to condemne the sinceritie of our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments and administring of them in this Churche.</p>
               <p>There is no man I thinke whiche doth not allowe of preaching before the administration of the Sacraments. But it is not therwith ioyned <hi>tanquam de necessitate sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti, as of the necessitie of the sacrament,</hi> neyther is there any thing here alledged, for preaching before the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the Lords Supper. In déede we reade not that Christ did preache immediatly before the distribution of the Sacrament of his body &amp; bloud to his disciples, onely he told them, that some of them should betray him, &amp; that he had greatly desired, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ate that passeouer with them.</p>
               <p>This I write to shewe youre blynde and vnlearned collections, not to disallow preaching in the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sacraments.</p>
               <p>But I woulde gladly learne why you doe so greately myslyke of readyng the Scriptures, I hope you be not Zwingfildians: Is not the worde of God as effectuall when it is read, as when it is preached? or is not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, preaching?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Isidorus</hi> sayeth, that reading bringeth great profite to the hearers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tertulian</hi> sayth when wée come togither to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the holy Scriptures, wée féede oure faythe wyth those heauenly voyces, we rayse vp oure affiaunce, wée

fasten our hope. And againe he calleth the reading of the Scriptures, the féeding of our fayth. But what néede I speake anye more of a matter so manyfeste. You flatly ioyne with the Papist in this: For in the confutation of the Apologie of the Churche of Englande, mayster Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding calleth reading of the Scriptures to the people in the Churche, a spirituall dumbnesse, and a thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable. &amp;c. That to reade the scriptures in the church is no newe thing, but moste auncient, and grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Gods worde, it is manyfest by that whiche is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the fourth of Luke, where the Euangelist sayeth, that Christ on the Sabboth day going into the synagoge according to his accustomed manner, risse vp to reade, and there was deliuered vnto him the booke of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete Esaye, and as soone as hée opened the Booke, hée founde the place where it was written, <hi>Spiritus Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni super me. &amp;c. The Spirite of the Lord vpon me. &amp;c.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse in the thirtéenth of the Actes, wée reade that Paule and other of his companie béeing in the Synagoge on the Sabboth day, was sent vnto by the rulers of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagoge, <hi>Post lectronem legis &amp; Propherarum, after the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng of the lawe and the Prophets,</hi> to know if they would make any exhortation to the people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iustinus Martyr Apolog. 2. pro Christianis,</hi> sayeth, that in his tyme the manner was on the Sabboth daye when the people were gathered together to haue the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures read in the publique congregation, and in the time of publike Prayer for the space of one whole houre.</p>
               <p>

               <p>The seconde generall reason is this: Then Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes were ministred in publique assemblies, nowe in priuate houses.</p>
               <p>The places of Scripture wherby you proue that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments were then ministred in publique assemblies, be taken out of the first of S. Marke, and .1. Cor. 11. which places of Scripture proue, that Iohn did baptize openly, &amp; that the Lords Supper was ministred in the publique congregation, but neyther of them bothe conclude that these Sacraments may not also be ministred vppon any occasion in priuate houses: For what sequele is there in this reason, all the countrey of <hi>Iudaea,</hi> and they of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> wente out vnto him, and were baptised of him in the riuer of Iordan, confessing their sinnes, <hi>Ergo</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme may not be ministred vpon any occasion in priuate houses? you may as well conclude, that none ought to be baptized, but in the riuer of Iordan, and none but suche as be able to confesse their sinnes, and so you shoulde se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude children from Baptisme, as the Anabaptistes doe.</p>
               <p>Baptisme was ministred in <hi>Cornelius</hi> house. Actes 10. The place is not of the substaunce of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>To the .1. Corin. 11. it is answered before. Surely this Churche of England doth not permit the sacraments to be ministred in priuate places, except there be a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>grega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then not vsually, but only in certaine cases.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:22862:53"/>The thirde generall reason is this: Then by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters onely: now by midwiues and deacons equally.</p>
               <p>That then the Sacraments were ministred onely by ministers, you alledge the 28. of Mathew, whiche place is answered before. Likewise .1. Cor. 4. <hi>Let a man so thinke of vs as of the ministers of Chryst, and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers of the mysteries of God.</hi> Here is not one worde for your purpose. Except you take mysteries for sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, which if you do, you are much deceyued: for by the word, mysteries, here, he vnderstandeth the worde of God and Gospell of Chryste, as all learned writers do interprete it. We reade in the eight of the Actes that Philip béeing a Deacon did baptize: we reade also that Moses wyfe did cirumcise. But where dothe this Churche of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land allow any woman to baptise, or deacon to celebrate the Lords supper? and if it did, the dignitie of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments doe not depende vpon the man, be he minister or not minister, be he good or euill. Let euery one take héede that they do not vsurpe that authoritie wherevnto they be not called.</p>
               <p>Those be your general reasons, which in déede bée no reasons, but bare words. Your particuler reasons wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you séeme to proue that neither of the sacraments be sincerely ministred; be these that followe. And first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Lordes supper you reason on this sort.</p>

               <p>What you vnderstand here by the introite, certayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie I knowe not: The first thing that we say at the Communion is the Lords prayer, which <hi>Celestinus</hi> did not inuente, but Chryste, Mathew. 6. nor first vse in the celebration of the Lordes Supper, but the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, as we reade in good Chronicles: nexte vnto that is a very godly and necessarie prayer, worthy to bée sayde in the celebration of suche a mysterie; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no matter at all who, inuented it, or brought it in: And yet <hi>Celestinus</hi> was a godly Byshoppe, and the Churche of Rome at that time had the substaunce of the Sacraments according to Gods word, neither was there any superstition mixed with them: notwithstanding I know not any introite of <hi>Celestinus</hi> inuention that we haue in our order of the Communion, for the introite that he appointed was one of the Psalmes as <hi>Volatera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Gratianus,</hi> and <hi>Polydorus Virgilius</hi> doe testifie. And we have not any Psalme in the celebration of the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, if we had, it were not to be reproued.</p>
               <p>This I am sure of, that it is not euill bycause it is in the Masse booke, excepte it be repugnaunt to the worde of God: For the Lordes prayer, some of the Psalmes, the Gospels and Epistles, the Nicene creede, &amp;c. be in the Masse book, and yet good, so is there some other good prayers in it also.</p>

               <p>Alwayes in the Churche there hath bene read the scriptures in the celebration of the mysteries, and I am sure the Gospell was not wont to be read from the one ende to the other at one time. Well, it is but your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion without reason, that the Epistle and Gospel ought not to be read at that time: for you bring no proole, and I thinke the contrarie. First bicause they be scripture, and tend to edifie: secondly, bicause it hath bene the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of long time, euen since <hi>Alexanders</hi> time. <hi>Anno.</hi> 111.</p>
               <p>The third. The Nicene creede was not read <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> in their communion, we haue it in ours.</p>
               <p>The Nicene Creede, and euery parte of it is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vppon the worde of God, it was collected by that famous Councell of <hi>Nyce,</hi> to confounde that dete<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>an any mislike it, but Arrians and suche lyke, of the which secte you giue iuste suspitions that you bee fautours. Thys Créede in this forme was not framed in the Apostles tyme, bycause the heresie of Arrius was not then hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. And therfore no good reason to say, it was not read in the Apostles tyme at the Communion, <hi>Ergo</hi> it ought not to bée read nowe. But this argument is intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the Nicene Créede is read at the Communion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Communion is not sincerely ministred. All these thrée reasons bée taken <hi>ab authoritate negatiu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hristian Princes, and therefore we may haue no christian Princes. Then they had no ciuill or politike lawes, <hi>Ergo</hi> we ought to haue none. Then the Churche had no externall peace, but was vnder persecution, <hi>Ergo</hi> it should haue no peace now. Then Christians had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie in nothing, but all things were common, <hi>Ergo</hi> no man may haue any thing of his owns, but common to other: we doe not reade expressely, that children were then baptised, therefore they oughte not to be baptised nowe (for so do the Anabaptistes reason) neither do we reade that women dyd then receyue the Supper, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ought not to do it nowe: with infinite other as absurde as these.</p>
               <p>The fourth. There was then accustomed to be an examination of the communica<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, which nowe is neglected.</p>
               <p>Howe proue you that there was then any examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of communicants? If there had bene either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement or example for it in scriptures, I am sure you woulde not haue lefte it vnquoted in the margent: S. Paule sayth 1. Cor. 11. <hi>Probet homo scipfum. Let a man examine him selfe. &amp;c.</hi> But be speaketh of no other exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination: wherefore this reason of yours is altogither friuolous and without reason.</p>
               <p>And yet I do not disalowe the examination of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants, so there be a discrete respect had of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, places, and other circumstaunces, neither it is neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in this Churche of Englande, but by learned and discrete ministers, with bearning and discretion vsed. But note I pray you the force of his argument: some ministers neglect to examine the communicants, <hi>Ergo</hi> the Communion is not rightly and sincerely ministred: as though the examination of the communicants were
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:22862:55"/>
of the substance of the sacrament. If you woulde reason after your accustomed manner, you should rather co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude thus, the Apostles were not examined when they recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Communion neither is it expressed in scriptures that they examined others, therefore there oughte to bée no such examination: this is your vsuall manner of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning, but it is childish, vnlesse it were to conclude dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or saluation.</p>
               <p>The fifth. Then they ministred with common <note n="a" place="margin">

               <p>The place you alledge Act. 2. (which is this) <hi>And they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued dayly vvith one accorde in the Temple, and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king bread at home, did eate their meate togither vvyth gladnesse and singlenesse of harte,</hi> maketh as muche for your purpose as it maketh for the Papists halfe commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, for they alledge it to proue that the supper may be ministred with bread onely: But learned interpreters and especially Master Caluyne, denie this place to bée mente of the ministration of the supper: howsoeuer it is vnderstanded, it doth not necessarily proue that the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was then ministred in common and vsuall bread, for there is no mention made of the kinde of bread. The place alledged out of the twentith of the Actes, speaketh of bread, but not of any one certaine kinde of bread: The truth is that it skills not what kinde of bread is vsed, leue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or vnleuened so it be breade, although it were to be wished for the auoyding of superstition, that common and vsuall bread were vsed, and also that the forme were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and the quantitie encreased. But these things are not <hi>de substantia sacramenti,</hi> and therefore not sufficiente to proue that the supper is not sincerely ministred.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:22862:56"/>If any thinke better of one kinde of bread than of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ministration of the sacrament, it is their error, and derogateth nothing from the order of administratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Master Caluine in his Institutions, <hi>cap.</hi> 19. <hi>sect.</hi> 72. tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this matter writeth on this sorte: <hi>Caeterum in manu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> accipiant fideles necne: inter se diuidant, an singuli quod sibi datum fuerit, edant: calicem in Diaconi manu reponant, an proximo trada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: panis sit fermentatus, an azymus: vinum ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brum, an album: nihil refert: haec indifferentia sunt, &amp; in eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia libertate posita. But whether the faithfull take it in their hands or no: whether they deuide it among them selues or euerie one eate that whiche is giuen vnto them: whether they giue the cup to the deacon, or deliuer it to him that is nexte: whether the bread be leuened or vnleuened: the wine red or white, it makes no matter: These be indifferent things, and put in the libertie of the Church.</hi> Master <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi> likewise in his censure vppon the booke of common prayers is of the same iudgement, his wordes be these: <hi>The thirde chapter is of the substance, forme, and breaking of bread, which all do vvell ynough agree vvith the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Christ, vvhome it is manifest to haue vsed vnleue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned bread, and easie to be broken, for he brake it and gaue to his disciples peeces of the bread broken: Touching the forme and figure, vvhether it vvere rounde or square, there is nothing declared of the Euangelistes. And bycause thys bread is vsed only for a signe, and not for corporall norish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente, I see not, what can be reprehended in this descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the bread vvhiche is in this booke, excepte some would peraduenture haue it thicker, that it may the more fully represent the forme of true bread.</hi>

               <p>The places of Scripture that you quote in the marge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to proue sitting at the Communion, declare that Christe and his disciples sat at the table, but that proueth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.

               <p>This your argument toucheth them as well as it doth vs, whiche receyue it standing or walking. But to sitte, stand, knéele, or walke, be not of the substaunce of the sacrament: and therefore no impediments, why it may not be sincerely ministred.</p>
               <p>It behoueth humble and méeke spirits, in such indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rente matters, to submitte them selues to the order of the Church appointed by lawfull authoritie, and not to make schismes and contentions in the Church for the satisfying of their owne fansies.</p>
               <p>Touching knéeling at the Communion, it forceth not who did first appointe it (although I can finde no suche decrée made by <hi>Honorius</hi>) it is the méetest manner of

receiuing this sacrament in mine opinion, being commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vsed in praying and gyuing of thanks, both which are annexed to this sacramente, and are to be required in the Communicants, &amp; therfore I think this to be a good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: the méetest gesture for praying and thanks gyuing is knéeling: but those that receiue the Eucharist, pray and giue tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks, <hi>Ergo</hi> the metest gesture for them is knéeling.</p>
               <p>The onely perill is adoration, whiche may aswell bée committed sitting or standing: But wherefore then ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth preaching? there is as muche daunger of contempte the one way, as there is of adoration the other waye.

               <p>From whencesoeuer these words were borrowed they were well borrowed, for it is a godly prayer, and an apte applycation of that sacrament, and putteth the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants in minde of the effecte of Christes passion exhibited vnto them by that sacrament, and sealed with the same, if it be worthily receiued.</p>
               <p>It maketh no matter from whome we receiue any thing so it be godly, profitable, and consonant to the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. But I pray you tell vs what Pope inuented these words, The body of our Lorde Iesus Christ. &amp;c.</p>

               <p>It is the common consente of ecclesiasticall histories, that the Apostles did celebrate the Lords supper with the Lords prayer, and yet we do not read that Christ did so: you also teach that the supper oughte not to be ministred without a Sermon, and in the ministration thereof you vse diuers prayers and other orders which Christe vsed not: Can you spye a mote (if it be a mote as it is not) in another mans eye, and can you not perceiue a beame to be in your owne? There is nothing conteined in Gloria in excelsis, but the same is taken out of the scriptures, and to be vsed of all true Christians.</p>

               <p>The twelfth. They ministred the sacramentes plainly, we pompeously, with singing, piping, surplesse, and copewearing.</p>
               <p>This is a very slender reason to proue that the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Supper is not sincerely ministred, bycause there is singing, piping, surplesse and cope: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you shew your reasons against that pompe which is nowe vsed in the celebration of that sacrament, you shall heare what I haue to saye in the defence of the same. I thinke that there is nothing vsed in the administration therof, that doth in any respecte contaminate it, or make it impure: As for piping, it is not prescribed to be vsed at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion by any rule, that I knowe. Singing I am sure you do not dissalowe being vsed in al reformed churches, and an arte allowed in scriptures, &amp; vsed in praysing of God by Dauid.

               <p>These be all the reasons you vse to proue that the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramente of the Supper is not rightely and sincerely ministred, whereof some bée impious, some ridiculous, and all of them vnworthy any confutation.</p>

It is certen that such kind of vesture hath bene vsed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ministration of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, long before any corruption of doctrine tooke place in the Churche, as it appeareth both by <hi>Hierome</hi> in his first booke <hi>aduersus Pelags.</hi> where he maketh manifest mention of a white garment vsed in the administration of sacrifice, by the Byshop, priest, &amp; deacon.

and therfore when answere is made that the infant doth beleeue, not hauing as yet faith in deed, it is answered that he doth beleeue for the sacrament of fayth, and that he doth conuert himself vnto God for the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion, bicause the answere it selfe doth perteine to the celebration of the sacrament.</hi> And a little after he sayth: <hi>Ita<expan>

               <p>It is also manyfest by these authorities, that godfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers or sureties were required at the baptising of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants: which <hi>Tertullian</hi> also signifieth in his booke <hi>de baptismo.</hi> But you your selfe confesse godfathers to be of great antiquitie in the church of Chryst, for you say that <hi>Higinus</hi> brought them in, and <hi>Higinus</hi> was the nynth Byshop of Rome, and liued <hi>Anno.</hi> 141.</p>
               <p>You may aswell finde faulte with Pulpit and church, as with the fontes, and the reason is all one.

and that sharpely.</p>
               <p>Youre Eldership is not for this tyme and state, as it is before declared, and yet maye menne bée compelled to render a reason of their faythe if any be doubted of: althoughe youre places quoted for that purpose proue no suche thing.

               <p>Of sitting and knéeling at the Communion, I haue spoken before: knéeling is no shewe of euill, but of an humble, reuerent, and deuoute mynde.</p>
               <p>Of excommunication you haue spoken nothing hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and therfore it commeth in here out of place, we shall haue afterwarde more occasion to speake of it.</p>

The place alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged out of the thirde of Matthew, telleth howe they that were baptized, confessed their sinnes, it speaketh nothing of any confession of fayth.</p>
               <p>It is well, that you admitte some to answere for the Infant in the absence of the parente, and why not in hys presence too? what Scripture haue you, that the parente at the baptizyng of hys chylde, shoulde make a rehersall of his fayth, and desyre that his chyld should bée therein baptyzed: Thys I desyre to knowe for myne owne learnyng, for I neyther remember anye suche thyng in Scripture, neyther yet in any auncient wryter: I doe herein but desyre to bée enstructed.</p>
               <p>I knowe not what you meane, when you saye, (That in the absence of the parentes some one of the congregation knowing the good behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and sounde faith of the parentes, may both make a rehersall of their faith: and also if their fayth be sounde and agreeable to holie Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, desyre in the same to be baptised.) What if the parentes be of euill behauiour? What if it be the chylde of a drunkarde, or of an harlot? What if the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes bée Papists? What if they be heretikes? what if they erre in some poynte or other, in matters of faythe? shall not their children be baptized? herein you haue a further meaning than I can vnderstande: And I feare, fewe doe perceyue the poyson that lyeth hydde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der these woordes: Maye not a wycked father haue a good chylde? Maye not a Papiste or heretike haue

               <p>What Scripture haue you to proue that suche Seni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors as you meane, and Deacons had any thing to doe in Ecclesiasticall discipline? I thinke the onely discipline that wée haue in the whole new Testament (except you wil make admonition and exhortation a parte of it) is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication:
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:22862:63"/>
and the execution of that is onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the ministers of the worde. Math. 16. Iohn. 20. Examples hereof we haue .1. Cor. 5. 1.

So did <hi>Ambrose</hi> excommunicate <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Emperour and is therfore in all stories greatly commended. I reade in the fifth Chapter of the first to the Corinthians, that the incestuous Corinthian was exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated publique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the presence of the whole congregation. But I reade neyther of Senior nor Deacon called as officers to the same. Sainct Paule himselfe sayth: <hi>Ego quidem vt absens corpore, praesens spiritu, iam decreui tanquam praesens vt is. &amp;c.

               <p>To proue that the office of Seniors was to gouerne the Churche with the rest of the Ministers, to consult, to admonishe, to correct and to order all thinges appertey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the state of the congregation, you alledge Actes 14. and the first Corin. 12. In the .14. of the Acts it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that Paule and Barnabas ordeyned elders at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioche in euery Churche, but there is not one woord spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of their office, and therefore that texte serueth not youre purpose. You haue alledged this selfe same place twice béefore, to proue that no minister of the worde oughte to bée placed in anye Congregation but by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sente of the people, and that the election of mynisters oughte to bée by the congregation: Nowe you alledge it
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:22862:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to proue the office of your Seniors, can it bothe be ment of Seniors, and of the ministers of the worde, béeing as you saye, distincte offices? will you thus dallie with the Scripture, and make it a nose of waxe (as the Papistes terme it) to wrest and writhe it whiche waye you liste. Here you muste néedes confesse eyther contradiction in your selues, or falsification.</p>
               <p>In the .1. Cor. 12. Sainct Paule sayeth, that God hath ordeyned in the Churche, firste Apostles, then Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, thirdly teachers, then them that doe miracles, after that the giftes of teaching, helpers, gouernours, diuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of toungs: here is not one worde of the office of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors, neyther yet of their names: For this worde, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours, teacheth vs, that Christe hath ordeyned in his Churche some to beare rule and to gouerne, but whether one in euery congregation or mo: whether ministers of the worde or other: whether magistrates or Seniors, it is not here expressed: howsoeuer it is, it maketh nothing for your purpose.</p>
               <p>I knowe that in the primatiue Churche they had in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Churche certaine Seniors, to whom the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Congregation was committed, but that was before there was any christian Prince or magistrate that openly professed the Gospell, and before there was anye any Churche by publique authoritie established, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ciuile gouernement: both the names and offices of Seniors was extinguished before <hi>Ambrose</hi> tyme, as hée himselfe dothe testifie, writing vpon the fift of the first to Timo. I tolde you before that the diuersitie of tyme and state of the Churche requireth diuersitie of gouernement in the same. It can not be gouerned in tyme of prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, as it is in tyme of persecution: It maye not be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned vnder a christian Prince, which doth nourish and maynteyne it, as it maye bée vnder a tyrant, when it is constrayned to flée and séeke corners: It can not bée go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:22862:64"/>
in a whole Realme, as it may be in one little Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or towne: it can not be gouerned when it is disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed thorough many places, as it maye be when it is col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected into some one narrow and certaine place: To bée shorte, it can not be gouerned when it is full of hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, Papists, Atheists, and other wicked persons, as when it hath very fewe or none suche: As commonly it hathe not in tyme of persecution, when the golde is as it were by fyre tryed from the drosse. He that according to thys diuersitie of the forme, state and tyme of the Churche doothe not allowe a diuersite of gouernemente, dothe confounde and not edifye. I praye you what Seniors coulde you haue in moste parishes in Englande fitte for that office? But wyse, not wilfull men haue to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this: God hath giuen the chiefe gouernement of his Churche to the Christian Magistrate, who hath to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what is moste conuenient: and wée must therwith be content, so that nothing be doone agaynst faythe, and the commaundement of God.</p>

               <p>In the sixt of the Acts we learne that there were cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen seauen Deacons, but there is not one worde to proue that euery congregation had their Deacons.</p>
               <p>In the third of the first to Timothie S. Paule sheweth what qualities and conditions a Deacon ought to haue, but not one worde of deacons béeing in euery congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise you it passeth my cunning to wring out of them any such sense, rather the contrarie may be gathered out of the words following, which be these: <hi>For though I shoulde boast somewhat more of our authoritie which the Lorde &amp;c.

For he vvas not of the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sorte of ministers, but one of the chefe among the Apostles: And therefore he saith, if I bost more I neede not be ashamed, for I haue good cause.</hi> And a litle after: <hi>Quamuis enim commune sit omnibus verbi ministris idem<expan>

               <p>In the .18 of Mathew, Chryst saith on this sort: <hi>If thy brother trespasse agaynst thee, go and tell him his faulte betweene him and thee alone, &amp;c.</hi> In the which place, it is by the consent of al interpreters manyfest, that Christ prescribeth a rule of correcting priuate and secret sinnes, and not of suche as be open and knowne to others. For he would not haue priuate &amp; secret sinnes blased abroade and publikely reprehended, before the partie offending be in this order first priuately admonished: this maketh nothing for your purpose, it taketh away authoritie of iudging and condemning from priuate men, and not from publike magistrates.</p>
               <p>In the .12. of the .1. to the Corinth. <abbr>vse</abbr> .28. these be the words of the Apostle: <hi>And God hath ordeyned some in the church: as first Apostles, secondly Prophets, thirdly teachers, then them that do myracles, after that the gift of healing, helpers, gouernors, diuersitie of toungs.</hi> How can you gather of these words, that all this commeth to passe (that is, hatred, fauoure, corruption by money, and affection in iudgemente) bycause the regymente lefte of Chryste to hys Churche is committed to one mans hands? In these wordes the Apostle declareth, that Chryst hath lefte in his Churche gouernours, and thereof you may well conclude, that in the Church there muste be some which shoulde haue authoritie ouer the rest. The Apostle dothe not here say that in euery parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer congregation Chryst hath left many gouernours, no more than he sayth that he hath lefte many pastors for one flocke: but in his Churche he hath ordeyned go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours.</p>
               <p>The gouernement of the whole vniuersall Church, is
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:22862:73"/>
not by Chryst committed to one byshop, or one Prince, nor the gouernement of the whole worlde to one Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, for no one man can discharge suche a cure, and therfore he hath appoynted in his Churche diuers By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, diuers Princes, many Gouernours. But one Prince may suffise to gouerne one kingdome, and one Archebyshoppe one Prouince, as chéefe and principall ouer the rest, one Byshop one Dioces, one Pastor one parishe, neither doth the Apostle speake any thing to the contrarie.</p>
               <p>In the .xij. to the Romanes it is thus written: <hi>he that ruleth with diligence.</hi> What maketh this for your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, or how can you wring it to your assertion?</p>
               <p>In the .5. of the .1. to Timothie. <hi>The Elders that rule well are worthy of double honour. &amp;c.</hi> Paule sheweth in these words that suche are worthy their stipende and rewarde, which rule well in the Churche, and do their dueties diligently: But what is that to your assertion?</p>
               <p>The places alledged out of the fiftenth of the Actes bée of the like sorte. Wheresoeuer mention is made in the Scriptures, of gouernours or Elders, that you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to improue the gouernement of one man, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you shewe a greate wante of iudgement. And yet there is no one person in this Realme (the Prince one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excepted) which hath suche absolute iurisdiction as you woulde make youre disciples beléeue. But youre meaning is that Chryste lefte the whole gouernement of hys Churche to the Pastor, and to some foure or fyue of the Parishe besides, whiche you are not able to proue, and your places of Scripture alledged signifie no such matter. In déede as <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, writing vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the .5. of the .1. to Timothie: <hi>The Sinagoge, and after, the Church had seniors, without whose counsell nothing was done in the Churche,</hi> but that was before his time, and before there was any Christian Magistrates, or
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:22862:73"/>
any Churche established: neyther is there any authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in the whole Bible, that enforceth or prescribeth that kynde of gouernement as necessarie or conueniente for all tymes: no more than there is to proue that in the Churche there muste be alwayes suche as haue power to worke miracles, or that haue the gift of healing and such lyke: whiche offices notwithstanding are mencioned as well as gouernours in the first to the Corinth. 12. Well sayth <hi>Musculus</hi> in his common places, <hi>Tit. de magistratis. Si reuocas temporum illorum mores, primum conditiones &amp; statum quo<expan>

               <p>You say, it is more easie for the wicked by brybing to peruerte &amp; corrupt one man tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to peruert &amp; ouerthrow y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith and pietie of a zealous &amp; godly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie: And therfore better the gouernment of the Church to bée committed to many, than to one. If this reason be good, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more there be that rule, the better is the gouernement, and so, <hi>popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris status erit optimus reipublicae status,</hi> against all both di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie and Philosophie: For we sée that God himselfe in his common weale of Israell, did alwayes allowe the gouernement and superioritie of one ouer the rest, bothe in the tyme of Iudges, and after in the tyme of the kings. And in the new Testament we may also sée that kynde of gouernement moste allowed of .1. Peter .2. But I will not here reason with you in this matter, and call that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to question whiche hath ben by so many learned menne determined, and by the examples of all good common weales confirmed. You that woulde haue all brought to suche a popularitie, I pray you tell me in how many pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes in Englande coulde you fynde suche Pastors and suche Seniors as you say should be? In those places that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:22862:74"/>
be gouerned by many, doe you not sée what contention there is? what enimitie? what factions? what partes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king? what confusion? what little good order obserued? what carelesnesse and dissolutenesse in all manner of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour? I coulde make this manifest by examples, if I were disposed.</p>
               <p>In the .18. of Exodus, which (place you quote to proue that Seniors ought to be zelous and godly) Iethro giueth Moyses counsell not to wearie himselfe in hearing all matters that be brought vnto him, but rather to commit the hearing &amp; determining of smaller matters to others: And therefore verse .21. he sayth: <hi>Prouide thou among all the people, men of courage, fearing God, men dealyng truly, hating couetousnesse, and appoint such ouer them to be rulers ouer thousandes, rulers ouer hundredes, rulers ouer fifties, and rulers ouer tennes. &amp;c.</hi> This maketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for Seniors: Moses here was chiefe, these were but his vnder officers placed by himselfe. This place ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth well for the gouernement of one Prince ouer one whole realme, and giueth him good counsell what vnder officers he ought to choose. To the same effecte and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is that spoken and written which you cite out of the fyrst of Deuteron. <abbr>vse</abbr> .13.</p>

               <head>Answere.</head>
               <p>You complayne much of vnbrotherly &amp; vncharitable entreating of you, of remouing you from your offices and places. Surely in this point I must compare you to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne heretikes that were in Augustines time, who most bitterly by sundry meanes afflicting and molesting the true ministers of the Churche, yet for all that cried out, that they were extreamly dealte with, and cruelly perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by them: or else vnto a shrewd and vngratious wife which beating hir husbande, by hir clamorous co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaints, maketh hir neighbours beleue, that hir husband beateth hir: or to him that is me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned in <hi>Erasmus</hi> colloquies, that did steale, and runne away with the Priests purse, and yet cried alwaies as he ranne, stay the thiefe, stay the thiefe, and thus crying escaped, and yet he was the thiefe him selfe. You are as gentlie entreated as may be, no kinde of brotherly perswasion omitted towardes you, most of you as yet kepe your liuings, though some one or two be displaced, you are offered all kind of friendlinesse
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:22862:80"/>
if you could be contente to conforme your selues, yea but to be quiet and holde your peace, you on the contrary side most vnchristianly, and most vnbrotherly, both publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and priuately raile on those, that shew this humanitie towards you, slaunder them by all meanes you can, and most vntruly report of them, séeking by all meanes their discredit. Againe they as their allegiance to the Prince &amp; dutie to lawes requireth, yea and as some of them by oth are bounde, do execute that discipline, whiche the Prince, the lawe, and their oth requireth: You contrary to al obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, duty, and oth, openly violate &amp; break those lawes, orders, and statutes, which you ought to obey, and to the which some of you by oth is bounde. If your doings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede in dede from a good conscience, then leaue that liuing and place, whiche bindeth you to those things that be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst your conscience, for why shold you striue with the disquietnesse both of your selues and others, to kepe that liuing which by laws you cannot, excepte you offende a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science? or what honestie is there, to sweare to statutes and lawes, and when you haue so done co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to your oth to breake the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and yet still to remaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, and enioy that place which requireth obedience and subiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to them? For my parte I thinke it much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by remouing you from your liuings to offende you, than by suffering you to enioy them, to offend the prince, the lawe, conscience and God. And before God I speake it, if I were persuaded as you séeme to be, I would rather quietly forsake all the liuinges I haue, than be an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of strife and contention in the Church, &amp; a cause of stumbling to the weake, &amp; reioysing to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked. I know, God would prouide for me, if I did it <hi>bona conscientia,</hi> yea surely, I would rather die, than be an author of schismes, a disturber of the common peace and quietnesse of the Churche and state. There is no reformed Churche that I can heare tell of, but it hath a certayne prescripte
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:22862:81"/>
and determinate order, aswell touching ceremonies, and discipline, as doctrine, to the which all those are constray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to giue their consent, that will liue vnder the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, and why then may not this Churche of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land haue so in like manner? Is it méete that euery man should haue his owne phansie, or liue as him list? Truly I know not whervnto these your doings can tende, but either to Anabaptisme, or to méere confusion.

               <p>I do not well vnderstand your meaning: woulde you haue vs to proue, that to reade prayers before and with the administration of the sacraments, is according to the word of god? In déede in the booke of seruice, there is first appointed to be read, some one or two profitable senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, mouing either to prayer or to repentance, after fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth a generall confession, then the Lords prayer, and certaine Psalmes, nexte certaine Chapiters out of the olde and newe testamente. &amp;c. Last of all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of the Sacramente. If you aske me of the sentences: they be Scripture. If of the Lords prayer, Psalmes, and chapiters: they be scripture also. If of the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:22862:83"/>
Sacrament of the supper? it is according to Scripture. Math. 26. Mar. 14. Luc. 22. 1. Cor. 11. If of the other prayers annexed? they be likewise according to the scripture, for they be made to God in Christes name, for suche things as we néede or as we desire, according to that saying of christ. <hi>Quicquid petieritis. &amp;c.

               <p>If you would haue vs to proue, that to reade prayers or scripture in the Churche is according to the worde of God: (whiche you séeme to denie) then we say vnto you, that if there were any pietie in you, any religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, any lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, you would make no such vaine and godlesse doubts.

               <p>If you meane by priuate communion, the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ministred to one alone: there is no suche allowed in the booke of common prayers, but if you call it priuate, bycause it is ministred sometime in priuate houses to sicke persons: Then haue we the example of Christ, who ministred the supper in a priuate house, and inner par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, Marc. 14.

We haue also the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Apostles them selues who did minister the Supper in priuate houses, especially if that place bée vnderstanded of the supper, whiche is in the seconde of the Actes, and before alleadged of you to proue that common and vsuall bread oughte to be in the supper: Likewise of the primatiue Churche, as appeareth in the

               <p>If you meane by priuate baptisme, baptisme mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred in priuate houses and families: you haue therof ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in the Scriptures. Acts. 10. other priuate baptisme allowed in the church of Englande I know none.</p>
               <p>Master <hi>Bucer</hi> in his censure vppon the Communion booke, speaking of the order appoynted in the same for priuate baptisme, writeth thus: <hi>In this constitution all things are godly appoynted, I would to God they were so obserued, and especially this, that the baptisme of Infants be not deferred, for therby is a doore opened vnto the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, to bring in a contempt of baptisme, and so of oure whole redemption, and Communion of Chryste, which through the sect of Anabaptists, hath too muche preuay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with many.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For women to baptise we haue no rule that I knowe in the whole Communion booke, but in scripture we haue an example of Moses wife that did circumcise, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision is correspondent to baptisme. But I know no generall doctrine can be grounded of a singuler example, and therfore most of your arguments be very féeble.</p>
               <p>Holy dayes ascribed to Sainctes, wherein not the Saincts, but God is honored, and the people edified, by reading and hearing suche stories and places of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as pertayne to the martyrdome, calling, and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of suche Saincts, or any other thing mentioned of them in scripture, muste néedes be according to Gods worde. For to honor God, to worship him, to be edifyed by the stories and examples of Saincts out of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, can not be but consonant to the scripture. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script seruice for them is all taken out of Gods word, and not one péece thereof, but it is moste consonant vnto the same: If there be any that is repugnant, set it downe, that we may vnderstande it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:22862:84"/>I tolde you before, that touching the dayes and tymes, and other ceremonies, the Churche hath authoritie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine what is moste conuenient, as it hath done from time to time. S. <hi>Augustine</hi> in his Epistle <hi>ad Ianua.</hi> in the place before of me recited, saith, <hi>that the passion of Christ, his resurrection, his ascention, and the day of the comming of the holy ghost,</hi> (which we commonly call Whitson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide) <hi>is celebrated, not by any commaundement vvritten, but by the determination of the Churche.</hi> And it is the iudgement of all learned writers, that the Church hath authoritie in these things, so that nothing be done against the worde of God. But of this I haue spoken partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, &amp; intende to speake more largely therof in the place folowing, where you agayne make mention of it.</p>
               <p>Of kneeling at the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion, I haue also spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before, and declared my iudgement therof. There is more scripture for it, than there is either for standing, sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or walking: but in all these things (as I haue decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) the Church hath authoritie to iudge what is fittest.</p>
               <p>Of wafer cakes, ministring in surplesse, or cope, and churching of women, I haue spoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: wafer cakes be bread: surplesse and cope, by those that haue authoritie in the Churche, are thought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine to comelynesse and decencie. Churching of women, is to giue thanks for their deliueraunce. Breade to be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the Communion, comelynesse and decencie, giuing of thanks for deliueraunce out of perill and daunger, be agréeable to Gods worde: therefore all these things be agréeable to Gods worde. The forme of bread, whether it ought to be cake breade, or loafe breade: euery particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler thing that perteyneth to decencie or comelinesse: at what time, in what place, with what wordes we oughte to giue thanks, is not particulerly written in scripture, no more than it is, that you were baptised. And therefore
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:22862:84"/>
(as I haue proued before) in suche cases the Church hath to determine and appoynt an order.</p>
               <p>That women shoulde come in vayles, is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned in the booke, no more in déede is the wafer cake, and therefore you might well haue lefte these two out of your reason, béeing thrust in without all reason.</p>
               <p>The .121. Psalme (for I thinke your printer was ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>séene in that quotation) <hi>I haue lifted vp myne eyes. &amp;c.</hi> teacheth, that all helpe commeth from God, and that the faythfull ought onely to looke for helpe at his handes, and therfore a most méete Psalme to be sayd at suche time as we béeing deliuered from any perill, come to giue thanks to God.</p>
               <p>What meane you to adde, and suche other foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishe things, what foolishnesse, I beséeche you, can you finde in this so godly a Psalme? O where are your wits? nay where is your reuerence you ought to giue to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly scriptures?</p>

               <p>If they were disposed to be craftie, I thinke they might soone deceiue you, for any great circumspection or discretion that appeareth to be in you by this booke. You finde great fault, that we stand so much vpon this worde repugnant, as though nothing were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant, or against the worde of God, but that which is expressely forbidden by playne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, and herein (you say) we deceyue our selues. But you do not tell vs how we are decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, neyther do you let vs vnderstande, what you thinke this worde repugnant, doth signifie. This is but slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der dealing, to finde a faulte, and not to correcte it: you should yet haue tolde vs your opinion of the signification of this worde, séeing so great a matter doth depende vpon it. True it is, that this worde repugnant, or agaynst the worde of God, is, to be contrary to that which in the worde is commaunded or forbidden not onely in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest words, but also in sense and vnderstanding: except you vnderstande this worde repugnant on this sorte, you will bring in many poynts of daungerous doctrine. For we read in the Acts. 2. and .4. that the Apostles had al things common, and yet Christians haue not all things common. Those that were then conuerted to the Gospell solde all they had, and layde it at the Apostles féete. Act. 4. now it is farre otherwise. Then Chryste ministred his supper at night, after supper, we in the morning before dinner: he in a priuate house, we in the publike Church: he to men onely, we to women also, with a great many of such apparant co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarieties, which be none in déed, bicause they be not agaynst any thing commaunded or forbidden to be done, or not to be done, either in expresse words, or in true sense. And therfore you are gretly deceiued, when
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:22862:85"/>
you think that we are persuaded, that those things which you finde fault with, be agaynst the worde of God.</p>
               <p>As for this your saying, (If either they were not blynded, or else their hartes hardened) I praye God it be not moste aptly spoken of youre selues, but I will not take vpon me to iudge those secretes that be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowne to God and your selues.</p>

               <p>Of the prescript forme of seruice, and of such cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions as hitherto you haue found in it, I haue spoken before sufficiently, so haue I also done of the ministerie, and of reading, so that I muste referre you to the former treatise for these matters, lest I should be too tedious, and offende as ofte, in diuers tymes iterating the same thing, as you doe.</p>
               <p>This I must néedes say, that you make here a childish digression farre from the purpose that you haue taken in hande, for the communion booke medleth not with the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of ministers, although somtimes the Booke of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering ministers be bounde with the same: neyther are these thinges that you here speake of, there to be founde. And therfore no cause why you should absteyn from sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing to that booke. But now to your painted margent.</p>
               <p>You say by the word of God the ministerie is an office of preaching, &amp; we make it an office of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, To proue it to be an office of preaching, you note
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:22862:86"/>
in youre margente. Matth. 26. But I thinke your mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is the .28. and Marke. 16. Where Chryste sayeth to hys Disciples, <hi>Go therfore and teache all nations. &amp;c.</hi> What if a man shoulde say vnto you, that this commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was giuen onely to the Apostles? For he sayeth, <hi>Go into the whole worlde,</hi> where as you teache nowe, that no man may come into the ministerie, except he first haue a flocke, and then muste he kéepe him with his flocke, and goe no further. If this doctrine be true, then can not this place serue your turne: For as the office of Apostle is cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by your doctrine, so is this commission also, except you will haue the one part to stand, that is, <hi>(Goe and preach)</hi> and this to be abrogated, <hi>In vniuersum mundum, into the whole worlde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But wher doth the booke make the ministerie an office of reading only? or what contrarietie is there betwixte reading and preaching? nay what difference is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixte them? if a man shoulde write his sermon, and reade it in the booke to his flocke, dothe he not preache? Is ther no Sermons but such as be sayd without booke? I thinke to preache the Gospell is to teache and instructe the people in faithe and good manners, be it by writing, reading, or speaking without book: And I am sure the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of God doth worke as effectually by the one of these wayes, as it doth by the other. Did not Sain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>te Paule preache to the Romaynes, when he writte to them? was not the reading of Deuteronomie to the people a prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching? 2. Reg. 23. Will you so scornefullye and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuously speake of the Reading of Scripture, being a thing so fruitfull and necessarie?</p>
               <p>But to come to the Booke, not of Common prayer mentioned in the Article, but of ordering Deacons and Ministers, wherevnto this dothe appertayne, whyche you fynde faulte with: the saying of the Bishop to him that is to be made minister is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:22862:87"/>
                  <hi>Take thou authoritie to preache the word of God, and to minister the holy Sacramentes in the congregation, where thou shalte be so appoynted.</hi> What faulte fynde you in these wordes? Doth he giue him authoritie to reade or to preache? I take vpon me the defence of the booke, not of euery mans doings. But this you say is spoken in mockerie, bicause they may not preache, excepte they haue newe licences. Surely I thinke no man is admitted into the ministerie, but he is permitted to preache in his owne cure without further licence, excepte it be vpon some euill vsage of himselfe afterwardes, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in lyfe or doctrine. It maye be, that a man be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted minister, and afterward fall into errour, or heresies, as did Iudas, and <hi>Nicolaus</hi> the Deacon, it is méete that suche should be restrained from preaching, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their former licence. In all reformed Churches, I am sure this order is obserued.</p>
               <p>That none ought publiquely to preache withoute li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence in a Church established, and hauing Christian ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, I haue shewed before.</p>
               <p>In the Scriptures (you say) there is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto the ministers of God, the knowledge of the heauenly misteries, and for proofe hereof, you cite the .1. Cor. 4. which is néedelesse, for it is manyfeste. And yet all haue not knowledge of them alike: no there is greate diuersitie among them touchyng knowledge of these mysteries, and yet he that knoweth least, may be profitable in the churche, according to his talent.</p>
               <p>You goe on, and say, that therfore as the greatest token of their loue, they are enioyned to feede Gods lambes: and you alledge the .21. of Iohn, the wordes of Christ to Peter: <hi>Feede my lambes. &amp;c.</hi> al this is true, and féeding is not onely publique preaching, but reading also of the Scriptures, and priuately exhorting,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:22862:87"/>
and that according to the gifte and grace giuen of God to euery man.</p>
               <p>And yet you say, with these suche are admitted and accepted, as onely are bare readers, that is onely able to saye Seruice, and to minister a Sacrament. I saye this is the faulte of the man, not of the booke, for the Booke alloweth none suche. But what is this to your purpose? what kynde of reason is this? Some Byshoppes admit some vnméete ministers, therfore you wil not subscribe to the Communion booke: or there be some ministers that can not preache, therfore there is some thing in the Communion booke repugnant to the worde of God. It appeareth you had but small re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde to that whiche you tooke in hande to proue: or that you can fynde little matter in the booke of seruice to carpe at, when you fall into suche friuolous digressions.</p>
               <p>For reading Ministers, you bidde vs viewe these places. Mala. 2.7. Esay. 56.10. Zacha. 11.15. Math. 15.14. 1. Timoth. 3.3.</p>
               <p>The Prophet Malachie in the second Chapter and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth <abbr>vse</abbr> sayeth on this sorte: <hi>For the Preestes lippes should preserue knowledge, and they should seeke the law at his mouthe: for hee is the messenger of the Lorde of hostes.</hi> In whiche wordes the Prophete dothe signifye, that the Préestes ought to bée learned in the lawe, and able to instruct, whiche no man denyeth: and if there be any crepte into the ministerie, whiche are not able so to doe, it is to be ascribed either to the negligence of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe, and suche as haue to doe therein, or to the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of the tyme. But here is nothing spoken agaynste reading, for any thing that I can gather: and if any man shoulde come vnto mée, and demaunde of me any que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion touching the lawe of God, I thinke I should bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter satisfie him, if I did reade the wordes of the lawe vnto him, than if I shoulde make a long tedious discourse
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:22862:88"/>
of myne owne, to little or no purpose. It is the word it selfe that perceth and moueth the conscience.</p>
               <p>I speake not this againste interpreting of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or preaching (for I knowe they be both necessary) but agaynst suche as be enimies to the reading of them.</p>
               <p>The places in the .56. of Esay, and in the eleuenth of Zacharie, tende to the same purpose, they all speake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst ignorant, foolishe, slouthfull gouernours and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours, there is nothing in them that condemneth or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alloweth reading of the Scriptures, or reading of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: No more is there in the fiftéenth of Matthew, nor 1. Timo. 3. reade the places, and you shall soone sée with howe little iudgement they be quoted against suche Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, as vse to reade the Scriptures and prayers to the people. If you had sayde agaynste dumbe and vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ministers, viewe these places, you had sayde some thing. For reading ministers, that is, for reading the Scriptures publiquely in the Church by ministers, view you these places. 1. Tim. 4. <hi>Till I come, giue attendance to reading, to exhortation to doctrine.</hi> In the which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des as <hi>Musculus</hi> sayth, <hi>Exprimit ordinem ecclesiasticum, quo primum ex sacris scripturis aliquid legebatur, deinde ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortatio &amp; doctrina subijciebatur, He expresseth the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall order, wherein first there is some thing read oute of the Scriptures, then followeth exhortation and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.</hi> Luke. 4. Where we learne that Christe béeing at Nazareth, as his custome was, went into the Synagoge on the Sabboth day, and stoode vp to reade. &amp;c. Act. 15. it is thus written: <hi>For Moyses of olde tyme hath in euery ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie them that preache him, seeing hee is read in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goges euery Sabboth day.</hi> Where he also séemeth to call reading, preaching.</p>

               <p>That reading is feeding, <hi>Musculus</hi> gyueth these reasons: First, bicause it maketh the people expert and cunning in the scriptures, so that they can not be so easily deceiued with false teachers.

For we, learning the law euen from our youth, haue it as it were written in our memorie.</hi> Secondely, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Reading of the Scripture is good for suche as can not reade them selues: to such lykewise as can reade, but yet haue not the bookes of the holie Scripture at home in their houses.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it maketh the people better to vnderstande the Sermons preached vnto them: bicause through the continuall hearing of the Scriptures read, they be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the wordes and phrases of the same.</p>
               <p>Last of all, it may be, that some men be more edified by the simple reading of the scriptures, than by sermons.</p>
               <p>But both of reading the Scriptures, and the profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse therof, I haue spoken before in the former trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise. I can not but maruell what these men meane, not onely in spyte and malice to ioyne with the Papistes

against the Communion Booke, but agaynst the publike reading of the Scriptures in the Churche also: Saying that Reading is no feeding, but it is as euill as playing on a stage, and worse too: than the which no Papist coulde haue spoken more spitefully.</p>
               <p>If there be any ministers that can scarsly reade, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende them not, neyther doth the Booke of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon prayer allowe of them: these be but Papisticall cauillations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the puritie of our seruice and Sacraments.</p>
               <p>As for that which foloweth, These are emptie fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. &amp;c. And the places of scripture quoted in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, may be aptly spoken and alledged agaynst wicked, ignorant, and dumbe Pastors, not against vertuous, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, learned preaching, or (as you terme them) reading ministers. And therfore I leaue them to you, and to the Papists, better to be considered of.</p>

               <p>Here is muche a doe about bare reading and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle seruice saying: by like you lacke matter to make out your Uolume, when you iterate one thing so often.
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:22862:90"/>
I tell you agayne, no honest, godly, or learned man euer hitherto did, or will disalowe reading of the scriptures in the Churche, or a prescript order of common prayers. Shewe any learned mans iudgement to the contrarie, shewe the example of any Christian Churche of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, or of any late reformed Church, wherein there is not bothe reading of the Scriptures in the publike con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and a prescript order of common prayers: nay shew any one sillable in the Scriptures to the contrarie. As for your places alledged out of the. 1. Corinth. 3. <abbr>vse.</abbr> 5. &amp; 1. Corin. 3. <abbr>vse.</abbr> 9. The one to proue that by the booke bare reading is good tilling, the other that by the same booke, single seruice saying is excellent buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. &amp;c. they shew your intollerable audacitie (I will terme it no worse) in abusing the Scriptures. In that place to the Corinth. the Apostle sayth thus: <hi>VVho is Paule then? who is Apollos? But the ministers by whom ye beleeued, and as the Lorde gaue to euery man.</hi> Howe can you gather hereof, that by the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion booke bare reading is good tylling? or how can you hereof conclude that (which I thinke you meane) that the sole and onely reading of the Scriptures is not tylling, or that the Scriptures may not be read in the open congregation by the minister? What sequele call you this? Paule and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollos be the ministers by whom you beléeued, as the Lord gaue to euery man: Therefore the reading of the scriptures edifie not, or it is not lawful for them to be red in the church by the minister. You come too soone from the vniuersitie to haue any great skill in logike: but belyke bicause there is mention made of tilling in the next verse of that chapter, therfore you quote it in the margent, mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing onely the line: for this is your vsuall maner, if you haue but one worde in a text which you vse in your booke, you quote the place, as though it made for your purpose. This is neither playne nor wise dealing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:22862:90"/>In the ninth verse of that chapiter these be the words: <hi>For we togither are Gods labourers, ye are Gods husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie, and Gods buylding.</hi> Howe do you apply these wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des? or howe do they proue, that by the booke of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayers, single seruice saying is excellente buylding, &amp; that he is a shepheard good inough that can (as a Popish Priest could) out of their portuis say fayrely their diuine seruice? nay how can you possibly collecte any thing out of this texte, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst a prescripte order and forme of prayers? If you be past shame before man, yet remember that God will call you to a reckning, for thus shamefully abusing his holy scriptures. But now I remember this worde buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, is in this text, and that is inough for you.</p>
               <p>If any haue misliked often preaching, or haue sayde that much preaching bringeth the word of God into contempte, or that foure preachers were inough for all London, they are to be blamed (and that iustly) and not the booke, for it willeth no man to say so.</p>
               <p>But if any hathe sayde, that some of those which vse to preache often, by their loose, negligent, verball and vnlearned sermons haue brought the worde of God into contempt, or that foure godly, learned, pithie, diligent, and discrete preachers mighte doe more good in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, than fortie contentious, vnlearned, verball, and rashe preachers, they haue sayde truely, and their saying might wel be iustified. Howbeit take héede y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you slaunder no man, or vniustly séeke the discredite of any, whilst you séeke to vtter your malice agaynst that godly booke. None that fauoureth Gods word (as I thinke) denieth that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the word of God is the vsuall and ordinary meanes, wherby God vseth to work fayth in vs. And that therfore
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:22862:91"/>
preachers be necessarie. But the place of Sainct Paule Rom. 10. by you alledged, derogateth nothing from the reading of the Scriptures: And I thinke no learned man will denie, but that fayth commeth also by hearing the scriptures read.</p>
               <p>The examples of suche as haue bene conuerted by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the scriptures, and hearing of them read, be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite. I knowe not whervnto this your bitternesse against reading of the scripture tendeth, except it be to confirme another opinion of the Papists, touching the obscuritie and darknesse of the Scripture, or diuers senses and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of the same. If you ioyne with them in that also, then I haue to say vnto you with S. <hi>Augustine, In hijs quae aperte in scripturis posim sunt, inueniuntur illa omnia quae continent fidem, mores<expan>
                        <am>

                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> viuendi. In those things that be playne and manifest in the scriptures are al such things conteyned which pertayne to fayth and good manners.</hi> And with <hi>Hierome in Psalme.</hi> 86. <hi>Sicut scripserunt Apostoli, sic &amp; ipse dominus: hoc est per Euangelia sua locutus est, vt non pauci intelligerent, sed vt omnes. Plato scripsit in scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura, sed non scripsit populo sed paucis, vix enim intelligunt tres homines. Isti vero, hoc est principes ecclesiae, &amp; principes Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stino<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> scripserunt paucis, sed vniuerso populo. As the Apostles writ so did the Lorde, that is, he spake by his Gospels, not that a few, but that all might vnderstande. Plato writ, but he writ to few, not to the people, for scarse three do vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande him: these, that is, the Apostles writ not to few, but to the whole people.</hi> But I thinke you doubte not of this matter.</p>
               <p>If the reading of Scriptures edifie not, what néeded <hi>Chrysostome</hi> writing vpon the .3. to the Col. so earnestly exhorte the people to get them Bybles, or at the least the newe Testament, to be as it were a continuall master vnto them to instruct them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>

                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:22862:91"/>
with suche vehement words, haue moued the people to reade the scriptures, declaring not only the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie of them, but the easinesse also to be vnderstood? Is not thys saying bothe auncient and true, <hi>That when we reade the Scriptures God talketh with vs: VVhen wee praye, then we talke with God?</hi> In the one and thirtie Chapter of Deuteronomie, it is thus written, <hi>Thou shalte reade this lawe before all Israell, that they maye heare it, that they maye heare, and that they maye learne, and feare the Lorde your GOD.</hi> But touching this matter I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre you to that whiche I haue spoken before in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer parte of youre admonition. And also I beséeche you take paines to peruse the .15. article of that notable Iewel &amp; worthy Byshop late of Salisburye wherein he of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose entreateth of this matter against Master Harding. Foolishly he spake (you say) when he said. &amp;c. No surely but you do folishly gather y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reding is vnprofitable bycause Sainte Paule saide that a Byshop must be apte to teache: for your argument is this in effecte: a Byshop must be apte to teache, therefore the scriptures néede not to be redde to the people, which is a <hi>non sequitur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your place of the 2. Chronicles. 13. I haue touched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, where it was alledged to the same purpose: I haue shewed how vnaptly you vse it. For <hi>Ieroboam</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued for making suche préests as were not of the tribe of <hi>Leui,</hi> to the whiche tribe only the préesthood was then tyed, now it forceth not of what stocke or tribe he is that is admitted to the ministerie, so that other qualities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of a minister be in him.</p>
               <p>You will say no more in this matter but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire vs to consider with you, what small pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite and edification, this silly reading hath brought to vs these thirtene years past. &amp;c. And what can you tell howe much it hath profited? I thinke very much: but the lesse bycause of your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentiousnesse:
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:22862:92"/>
For by the factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that you haue stirred, many be brought into a doubte of religion, many cleane driuen backe: and no doubte the frutes of the Gospell would haue muche more appeared, if you had not made this schisme in the Churche, a perpetuall companion, but yet a deadly eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to the Gospell.</p>
               <p>I know not what you meane by your Circumcelio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or newe Apostle: If you meane such as preach in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places as they be called, or as they sée occasion, I sée not with what honest zeale, or godly affection, you can call them in derision Circumcelions or newe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles. Some such haue done more good with their fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sermons (as you terme them) than you haue done with your rayling libels. But as I said in the beginning I will not aunswere wordes but matter, although I am constrained to do otherwise, you are so full of words, and barren of matter.</p>

               <head>Answere.</head>
               <p>Your seconde reason in fewe wordes is this: In the booke of common prayer it is appointed that after the creede if there be no sermon an Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly must followe, either already set out or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to be set out, but you knowe not what wil here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be set out, therefore you will not subscribe.</p>
               <p>You haue no cause to suspecte any thing touching reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion set out by publique authoritie (for so is the booke) or hereafter to be set out by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon authoritie. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto you are not able to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uince any homily set out by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon authoritie, of any error, and therefore you ought not to be suspicious of any that is to come. If any Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shall hereafter be sette out, wherein you mislike any thing, you néede not to reade it, the boke doth not appoint you this or that Homily to read, but some one which you like best. But what néede you to be scrupulous in thys matter? if you be disposed to preach, then néede you reade no Homily at all; therefore this is no reason.</p>
               <p>This assertion (that in the holy scriptures is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned al fulnesse to decide controuersies) if you meane controuersies in matters of fayth and in matters touching saluation, is very true, but you haue vsed little discretion in quoting some places to proue the same.</p>
               <p>I finde no faulte with you for citing the sixte verse of the 2. Timo. 3. for the 16. verse, that is but a small ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight, and it may bée in the Printer: But howe doe you
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:22862:93"/>
conclude this assertion of the words of Peter. 2. epist. ca. 1. verse. 20. which be these, <hi>so that ye first knovve that no prophecie of the scripture is of any priuate motion:</hi> For this place only proueth that the scriptures be not of men but of the holy Ghost: it speaketh nothing of the suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie of the Scripture.</p>
               <p>That place also. 1. Cor. 1. is not fitly applyed to this purpose: there is scripture sufficient directly to proue the sufficiencie of scripture, so that you shoulde not haue née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to giue the aduersarie occasion to carpe at the vnapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of these places for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Homelies contayning doctrine agréeable to the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, be of the same nature that sermons be: Wherfore if it be not lawfull in the Church to reade homilies, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it lawfull to preach Sermons: The reason is all one, neyther is there any difference, but that Homilies be read in the booke, Sermons sayde without the booke.</p>
               <p>Homilies are pithie, learned, and sound: sermons ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be words without matter, vnlearned, erronious: But of reading Homilies in the church I haue somthing spoken before, now it shal be sufficient only to set down Master <hi>Bucers</hi> iudgemente of this matter in his notes vppon the Communion booke, which is this. <hi>It is better that vvhere there lacks to expound the scriptures vnto the people, there shoulde be Godly and learned Homilies readde vnto them, rather than they shoulde haue no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation at all in the administration of the supper.</hi> And a little after: <hi>there be too fevve Homilies, and too fevve points of religion taught in them: vvhen therefore the Lord shall blesse this kingdome vvith some excellent prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, lette them be commaunded to make moe Homilies of the principall points of religion, vvhich may be readde to the people, by those pastors, that cannot make better themselues.</hi>

               <p>This is contained in your first reason and there aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered. Your collection hangeth not togither, for howe followeth this: these holydayes be superstitiously obserued of some, therefore you may not allow them.

The Saboth day is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitiously vsed of some, so is the church, so is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Créed, &amp; the Lords prayer, and many things else, and yet I hope you will subscribe to them. You heape vp a number of places in the margent to proue that which no man doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of, that is this portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the commaundement, Sixe daies shalt thou labour &amp;c. The meaning of which wordes is this, that seing God hath permitted vnto vs sixe days to do our owne works in, we ought the seuenth day wholy to serue him. This is no restraint for any man from seruing of God any day in the wéeke else. For the Iewes had diuers other feasts whiche they by Gods appointmente obserued, notwithstanding these wordes Sixe dayes. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:22862:94"/>Euery man hath not bodily laboure to doo, but may serue God aswell in these sixe dayes, as in the seuenth. And certenly he doth not by any means break this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, which abstayneth in any of these six dayes from bodily laboure to serue God. For this is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement. (<hi>Reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber that thou kepe holy the Saboth day</hi>) as for this (<hi>Sixe dayes thou shalt vvorke</hi>) is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundemente, but tendeth rather to the constitution of the Saboth, than to the prohibiting of rest in any other day appointed to the seruice of God: And it is as muche as if he shoulde say, sixe dayes thou maist worke, and so do some translate the Hebrew worde.</p>

               <p>Surely this is a sore reason, the booke of Common prayers requireth kneeling at the Communion, <hi>Ergo</hi> it is not to be allowed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:22862:97"/>That knéeling is not to be vsed, you proue on this sort: Kneeling is a shewe of papistrie, and dothe not so well expresse the misterie of the Lords supper: therefore not to be vsed.</p>
               <p>Of knéeling at the Communion I haue spoken before, now therfore I will onely note in one worde or two the slendernesse of this argument.</p>
               <p>You say, knéeling is a shewe of euill, and for proofe thereof you alledge. 1. Thessa. 5. <hi>Absteyne from all appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of euyll.</hi> Howe followeth this, the Apostle willeth vs to abstayne from all apparaunce of euill: Therefore knéeling at the Communion is a shew of euill. But your meaninge is, that bicause the Papistes knéeled at the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cring of the Masse, (as they called it) therefore we may not knéele at the receiuing of the Communion: you may as well say, they prayed to images and saincts knéeling, therfore we may not pray knéeling.</p>
               <p>There is no such perill in knéeling at the Communion as you surmise, for the gospeller is better instructed than so grossely to erre: And as for the learned Papiste he is so farre from worshipping, that he disdayneth that holy Communion, iesteth at it, and either altogither abstey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth from comming vnto it, or else commeth onely for feare of punishement, or <hi>pro forma tantum,</hi> for fashion sake: and the moste ignoraunt and simplest Papist that is, knoweth that the Communion is not the Masse, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do they sée it lifted vp ouer the Priestes heade, with suche great solemnitie as they did, when they tooke it to be their God. No truely, the contempt of that misterie is more to be feared in them, than worshipping: and to be short, if they be disposed to worship, they will aswel wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship sitting, as knéeling. But they are farre from suche an opinion of the bread and wine in the blessed Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for they make no accompt at all of it.</p>
               <p>You say, sitting is the moste meetest gesture,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:22862:97"/>
bycause it signifieth rest, that is a full finishing thorowe Christ of all the ceremoniall lawe. &amp;c. What? are ye nowe, come to allegories and to significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? Surely this is a very papisticall reason. Nay then we can giue you a great deale better significations of the Surplesse, of crossing, of the ring in mariage, and many other ceremonies, than this is of sitting. I praye you in the whole Scripture, where dothe sitting sygnifie a full finishing of the ceremoniall lawe, and a perfect worke of redemption that giueth rest for euer? If allegories please you so well, let vs haue eyther standing, which signifieth a readinesse to passe (vsed also in the eating of the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer) or knéeling, whiche is the proper gesture for pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and thankes giuing, and signifieth the submission and humblenesse of the mynde. But you say, Christ sat at his Supper, therfore we must sitte at the receyuing of the Supper: You may as well say, Christ did celebrate his Supper at night, after Supper to twelue, onely men, and no women, in a parlour, within a priuate house, the thursday at night before Easter, therfore we ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion at night, after supper, being twelue in number, and onely men, in a parlor, within a priuate house, the Thursday at nighte before Easter. But who séeth not the <hi>non sequitur</hi> of this argument?</p>
               <p>The places written in youre margent to proue, that Christ did sitte at Supper be néedlesse, and were vsed for the same purpose before, where I haue also spoken my opinion of kneeling.</p>
               <p>If you cite the Gal. 4. and 5. and the Epistle to the Hebrues, in many places to proue, that sitting signifieth rest, that is, a full finishing of the ceremoniall law: you do but delude the readers, and abuse the Scriptures, for there is no suche matter to be founde in them: If you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them to proue that Christe is the full finishing of the Ceremoniall lawe, you take vpon you to proue that

               <p>You note also the .20. of Exodus: <hi>Thou shalt not bow downe to them nor worship them,</hi> to proue that we may not knéele at the Communion: but how fitly, euery child may iudge: for what sequele is there in this argument?

Prieste was ordeyned, and what were his offices: But hée speaketh nothing of the abolishing of the Priesthoode.

               <p>You farre ouershotte your selfe in my opinion, when you set it downe, that you neuer read in the newe Testament this worde Priest, touching office to be vsed in good parte.

               <p>The superstitious toyes you fynde in publique Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme be these.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:22862:101"/>First, that in our prayer we say, that God by the baptisme of his sonne Iesus Chryste, did san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the floud Iordan and al other waters, to the misticall washing away of sinne.</p>
               <p>The seconde is, that we require a promise of the godfathers and godmothers, which is not in their powers to perfourme.</p>
               <p>The thirde, that we aske questions of Infants, which can not answere and speake. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The fourth, that we marke the chylde in the forehead with a crosse, making thereby a newe sacrament. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The fifth, that we make an euill choyse of those that are to be admitted witnesses. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>By the first you say, that wee attribute to the signe that which is proper to the worke of god in the bloud of Chryst, as though vertue were in water to washe away sinne.</p>
               <p>You know very wel that we teache farre otherwise, and that it is a certayne and true doctrine of all suche as do professe the Gospell, that the outwarde signes of the sacramente, doe not conteyne in them grace, neither yet that the grace of God is of necessitie tyed vnto them, but onely that they be seales of Gods promises, notes of Christianitie, testimonies and effectuall signes of the grace of God, and of our redemption in Chryste Iesus, by the which the spirite of God dothe inuisibly worke in vs, not onely the increase of fayth, but confirmation also.</p>
               <p>You vnderstand likewise, that this difference there is betwixt these externall elements, béeing selected to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental signes (that is, betwixt water in baptisme, and common water, bread and wine in the Eucharist, and vsuall bread and wine) that these nowe be sacraments,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:22862:102"/>
sanctified to an other vse, to a spirituall vse, to the nori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of fayth, and féeding of the soule, to be instruments of the holy ghost, by the which as by instruments we be fed to eternall life. Furthermore, you can not be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante, that whosoeuer contemneth these external signes, and refuseth them, can not be a member of Chryst, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet saued.</p>
               <p>Last of all you haue learned, that there is suche a simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude betwixte the signes, and the thing signified, that they are not onely in Scripture vsually called by the names of those things whereof they be Sacraments (as breade the body of Chryst, and water regeneration) but also that the contumelie or contempt done to the one, dothe redounde to the other, that is, the contempt of the signes, is the contempt of the things signified, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore S. Paule sayth. 1. Cor. 11. <hi>He that eateth and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vnworthily, eateth and drinketh his owne damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Non dijudicans corpus domini.</hi> And Christ, Iohn. 3. <hi>Except a man be borne of water and the spirite, he can not enter into the kingdome of heauen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These things béeing considered, it is no superstitious toy, but a godly and true saying, that Chryste hath san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified all waters (vsed in baptising) to the mysticall washing away of sinne, not ascribing, or attributing washing away of sinne to the externall element, any otherwise, than instrumentally, or in any other respecte than for the similitude that Sacraments haue with the things wherof they be Sacraments: for we knowe that wicked men may receyue these externall signes, and yet remayne the members of Sathan. It is certaynely true, that the mistical washing away of sinne is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the worke of God in the bloud of Christ, and for that purpose you might haue alledged much more playner &amp; directer places of scripture than most of these which you haue noted in your margent: but I think your
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:22862:102"/>
meaning is not therfore to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temne the outward signes and sacraments, as the heretikes called <hi>Messalians</hi> did.</p>
               <p>The seconde thing you mislike, is that we require a promise of the godfathers and godmothers, which is not in their powers to perfourme: to this cauillation I haue answered before, and haue decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, both out of <hi>Dionysius Areopagita,</hi> and <hi>August.</hi> why they answere so in the infants name, and why they make that promise, which I thinke they performe sufficiently, if they pretermit nothing that lyeth in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunce therof: and so sayth <hi>Dionisius,</hi> for suche promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are not made absolutely, but <hi>quantum in nobis est.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To proue that it is not in the godfathers to perfourme that which they promise, you quote the saying of sainct Paule to the Rom. cap. 7. <abbr>vse.</abbr> 15. <hi>I allovv no that vvhiche I do, for vvhat I vvould that I do not, but vvhat I hate that I do.</hi> And <abbr>vse.</abbr> 18. <hi>For I knovve that in me, that is, in my flesh, dvvelleth no good thing, for to vvil is present vvith me, but I finde no meanes. &amp;c.</hi> And. <abbr>vse.</abbr> 21. <hi>I finde then by the lavv, that vvhen I vvould do good, euill is present vvith me.</hi> In al these places the Apostle declareth, that infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties remayne, euen in the faythfull, by reason of the flesh, and that they can not come to suche perfection in thys lyfe, as they do desire. But howe doe these places proue that godfathers are not able to perfourme that whiche they promise for the Infante? truely these proofes are too farre fetched for my vnderstanding. In the ninth to the Romanes, the Apostle sayth: <hi>That it is not in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth, but in God that she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth mercy.</hi> In the which words he sheweth that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cause of our election, is not in our selues, but in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mercy of god. But what is this to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> promise of godfathers made at the baptizing of infants? if you would haue a man to promise nothing, but that which is in his power to performe, then must you simply condemne all promises made by man:
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:22862:103"/>
for there is nothing in his power to perfourme, no not mouing of his foote, not comming to dynner or supper. &amp;c. Therefore as all other promises be made with these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete conditions, if God will, so muche as lieth in me, to the vttermoste of my power, if I liue. &amp;c. so is the promise in baptisme made by the godfathers likewise.</p>
               <p>To the thirde superstitious toy (as you call it) that is, the questions demaunded of the Infant at the time of baptisme, I haue also answered out of sainct <hi>Augustine,</hi> in the first parte: where it may also appeare that this maner of questioning was vsed in the baptising of infants long before <hi>Augustines</hi> time, for <hi>Dionisius Areopagita</hi> maketh mention of them in like maner.</p>
               <p>To proue that this questioning with the infant, is a mocking of God, you quote Galath. 6. <abbr>vse.</abbr> 7. <hi>Be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, God is not mocked, for whatsoeuer a man soweth, that shall he reape.</hi> Paule in this place taketh away ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses, which worldlings vse to make for not nourishing their Pastors, for no fayned excuse will serue, bicause God is not mocked: But what is this to be questioning with infants? howe followeth this? God is not mocked, <hi>Ergo</hi> he that questioneth with infants, mocketh God. Truely you mocke God, when you so dallie with hys scriptures, and séeke rather the glory of quoting of many places of scripture, than the true applying of any one.</p>
               <p>Concerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fourth toy, that is, crossing the child in the forehead, which you call wicked and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious, I haue before declared master <hi>Bucers</hi> opinion: It may be lefte, and it hath bene vsed in the primatiue Churche, and may be so still, without either superstition or wickednesse: neither dothe it any more make a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament (bicause it is in token that hereafter he shal not be ashamed to confesse Christe crucified) than your sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting dothe at the Communion in token of rest, that is, a full finishing through Chryst of the ceremoniall law. &amp;c.
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:22862:103"/>
I thinke you knowe that euery ceremonie betokening some thing, is not by and by a sacramente, and therefore here is as yet no wicked diuorse of the worde and sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, excepte it be made by you.</p>
               <p>Touching the last, whiche you rethorically say you will speake nothing of, that is, the euill choise of witnesses, I thinke in parte it is true, but you speake that without the booke, and therefore without my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of defence. For I meane not to take vppon me the defence of any abuse within the booke, (if there be any) much lesse without the booke.</p>
               <p>But I know not wherto this tendeth that followeth, that is, Howe conuenient it were, seing that the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the faithful only are to be baptised &amp;c. Do yée not comprehend those vnder the name of faithful whiche be baptised? For else it passeth mans vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, to knowe who be faithfull in déede, bycause the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleuers may make a confession of faith in wordes: And in this worlde it cannot certainely by man be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, who among Christians be faithfull, who be vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. I praye you aunswere me this one question: If a childe be founde, whose father and mother be vnknowne (as it hath happened sometimes in our remembraunce) will you not baptise it, bycause the parents be not foorth comming to make a confession of their faith? or bycause the sounde faith of the parents is vnknowne? But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I haue spoken in another place.</p>

And yet S. Peter .1. epist. cap. 3. speaking to the husbands saith. <hi>Likewise ye husbandes dwell with them as men of knowledge, giuing honor vnto the woman. &amp;c.</hi> S. Peter wold haue the man to giue honor vnto his wife, &amp; yet his meaning is not that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shold make an Idol of his wife.</p>
               <p>Last of al you like not that the married persons shoulde be enioyned to receiue the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion.

               </p>
               <p>Other pettie things (you say) out of the boke, which you call in the margent abuses accidentall, as women to come bareheaded, bagpipes, fidlers, comming in at the greate dore. &amp;c. you will not speake of: Truly neither will I speake of them, bycause being out of that booke and meare trifles, they are not within my compasse. But in the meane time, this is a sore reason: The ring is vsed in matrimonie, the man saith to his wife, with my body I thee worship, the newe married persons receiue the Communion togither: therefore you will not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe to the booke of common prayers. But this argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t cannot be aunswered: women come to the Churche bareheaded, with bagpipes and fidlers, at the great dore of the Churche, and these things bee not in the booke, therefore you will not subscribe to the booke.</p>

They appointe a prescript kinde of seruice to burye the deade: and that whiche is the duty of euery christian, they tie alone to the minister, whereby prayer for the dead is mainteyned, and partly gathered out of some of the prayers, where they praye that we wyth this our brother, and all other departed in the true faith of thy holy name, may haue our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte consummation and blisse, both in body and soule.

               <p>It is true that we haue a prescript kind of seruice to bury the dead, and that we appointe that office to the minister, and what haue you in the whole scripture against this? or who euer hath found faulte with either of these two things (I meane prescript seruice to bury the dead, &amp; the minister to execute that office) but you alone? or when was it euer heretofore reproued by any, but euen by your selues now of late?</p>
               <p>You say, that therby prayer for the dead is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned as may partly be gathered out of some of the prayers, where wee praye, that we with thys our brother, &amp; other departed in the true faith of thy holy name. &amp;c. You know full wel what our doctrine is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning prayer for the dead, &amp; you ought not thus boldly to vtter a manifest vntruthe, for in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you do but bewray your sinister affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. How proue you, that a prescript forme of seruice for burying the dead, and the minister only to burye them,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:22862:106"/>
doth mainteine prayer for the dead? when you haue she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed your reason, you shall heare my answere.</p>
               <p>In saying that these words gathered out of some of the praiers, that we with this our brother &amp;c. import praier for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dead, you do but quarell: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we say that we with Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob may raigne in thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, do we pray for Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wish our selues to be where they are?</p>
               <p>In the like manner when we saye, that we wyth this our brother, and all other departed in the true faith of thy holy name, may haue our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte consummation and blisse both in body and soule, we pray not for our brother and other that be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted in the true faith, but we pray for our selues, that we may haue our perfect consummation and blisse as we are sure those shall haue which dye in the true faith.</p>
               <p>Now wey this reason, there is a prescript forme of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the dead, &amp; it is made a portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ministers office, therefore you will not subscribe to the Communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> booke.</p>

But yet of mourning apparel, and burial sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, giue me leaue to speake a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. It is no good reason to say, that bicause mourning ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell is only vsed of custome, therfore it is superstitious &amp; hethenish: many things be vsed of custom which be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther superstitious nor heathenishe, as to receiue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before dinner, to celebrate the Lords day on the sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, not on the saterday, to preach in pulpits, &amp; such like.
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:22862:107"/>
Mourning apparell is of great antiquitie, (as you know) and I thinke it is no matter of religion, but of ciuilitie and order. If any man put religion in it, then no doubte it is superstitious.</p>
               <p>But wherin haue funerall sermons offended you? or with what face of brasse dare you like<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them to trenfalls? What similitude is there betwixte a godly sermon and the wicked masse? In what one pointe are they like? or how dare you condemne suche sermons, being then most necessary and most profitable? what? is there a more fitte time to entreate of the mortalitie of man, and shortnesse of his dayes, of the vanitie of this world, of the vncerten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of riches, of the resurrection, of the iugement to come, of eternall life, and of euerlasting death, and of infinite other most necessarie points, than that wherin we haue a present example before our eyes? When is there a more méete time to beate downe trentalls, sacrificing for the dead, prayers for the dead, purgatorie, and such like, than that wherin they were accustomed to be most vsed? sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is as much difference betwixte our funerall ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and the Papisticall masses and trentalls, as there is betwixte colde and hote, blacke and white, lighte and darkenesse, truth and lies, heauen and hell. But belike there is some other priuate cause, that maketh you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte funerall sermons.</p>
               <p>You say that in the best reformed Churches they are remoued: I thinke you say not truly, (and I am sure that Master Caluine doth very well like and allowe of them, as appeareth in the forme of common prayers vsed of the English Churche in Geneua, and by him allowed.) But if it be so, I tell you playnely, for my parte I lyke not that reformation, excepte there bée weightier reasons than eyther you vse, or I can perceyue.

               <p>You say, we pray that all men may be saued, we doe so in déede, and what can you alledge why wée shoulde not so doe? Sainct Paule .1.

Surely if those things whiche were good in the Popes pontificall, and either conteyned in the scripture, or well vsed before in the auncient Church, or wel prescribed by general councels, be also in our Pontificall, our pontifical is neuer the worse for hauing of them: for if the thing it self be good &amp; profitable, it forceth not from whom it was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was vsed, so that now it be rightly vsed.

Cor. 1. for these places haue ben fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d out since and thought méete nowe to be alledged, but how discretely by emmination it will appeare. The words of the Apostle to the Gala. 2. <abbr>vse.</abbr> 6. be these. <hi>And of them whiche seemed to be greate I was not taught (what they were in tyme passed, it maketh no matter to mee, God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth no mans persone) neuerthelesse they that are the chiefe, did communicate nothing wyth me.</hi> The Apostle in these wordes doth declare, that he receyued not the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell whiche he preached, of men, no not of the Apostles, but of Iesus Christe, and that the Gospell preached by him, ought to be no lesse credited, than the Gospel prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by them. So that in those wordes he declareth that the truth of the doctrine doth not depende of anie mannes person. He speaketh nothing agaynst superioritie <hi>quoad ordinem, concerning order,</hi> but dothe rather acknowledge it, for he sayth, <hi>they that are the chiefe. &amp;c.</hi> But it is true that master Caluin noteth on this place: <hi>Hic non est cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ambitionis, quia nequaquam de personis agitur. The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is not for ambition, for it is not vnderstanded of the persons.</hi> Nowe I pray you consider this argumente, Paule receyued the Gospell that he preached, not of the Apostles, but of Christ, or the Gospel preached by Paule is equiualent with the Gospell preached by other of the Apostles: therfore the names of Archebishoppes, Archdeacons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. are drawne out of the Popes shop together with their offices, or this, Paule sayth, that they that were the chiefe did communicate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with him: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the names and offices of Archbishops bee taken out of the Popes shop.</p>
               <p>The wordes in the .5. to the Herues .4. <abbr>vse</abbr>, be these:
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:22862:111"/>
                  <hi>And no man taketh this honour to himselfe, but he that is called of God as was Aaron.</hi> The Apostle here sheweth, that Christe was a laufull Priest, bicause he was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto called by God as Aaron was. What is this to Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops. &amp;c. This place teacheth, that no man oughte to intrude himself to any function, except he be thervnto cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by God. But what maketh this agaynst any lawfull function or authoritie? or what conclusion call you this? Christ did not take vnto him that office whervnto he was not called, or no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> must take vpon him that whervnto he is not called: <hi>Ergo</hi> Archebishops &amp;c. and their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices came out of the Popes shop.

               </p>
               <p>In the .16. of Luke <abbr>vse.</abbr> 25. it is thus written, <hi>but Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham sayd, sonne remember that thou in thy lyfe tyme re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauedst thy pleasures, and lykewise Lazarus paynes: now therfore is he comforted, and thou art tormented.</hi> The riche glutton in his lyfe receyued pleasure, and therfore was after in hell tormented, Lazarus receyued paynes, and after was comforted. Therfore Archbishops. &amp;c. and their offices come out of the Popes shop. These fellowes neither care for <hi>maior, minor,</hi> nor conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, so they say some thing, and vaynly paynt their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent with shamefully abusing the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>The wordes of Ezech. chap. 34. <abbr>vse.</abbr> 4. bée these: <hi>The weake haue ye not strengthened, the sick haue ye not hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, neyther haue you bounde vp the broken. &amp;c.</hi> In the whiche place the Prophet speaketh against suche Kings, magistrates, and rulers, as despise the people of God, and vse themselues cruelly towardes them: this doth as well condemne kings and magistrates, as it dothe Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishoppes, although in déede it condemneth no office or superioritie, but the abuse of the same, that is the man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busing the office, and not the office it selfe.</p>
               <p>In the .2. Cor. 1. <abbr>vse.</abbr> 24. the Apostle speaketh thus vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:22862:112"/>
them. <hi>Not that we haue dominion ouer your faith, but wee are helpers of your ioye, for by faith you stande.</hi> S. Paule here sayth, that he hath no authoritie to alter true religion, or to rule ouer their consciences: but howe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth this, that Archebishops. &amp;c. came out of the Popes shop? Paule saith that he had no power ouer the consciences of the Corinthians: therfore Archebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops. &amp;c. and their offices were drawne out of the Popes shop. If you had ben more studious when you were a Sophister (if euer you were any) you would haue learned better to frame an Argument, and haue had better iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the sequele of the same. If you had not troubled your margent with these quotations, you had lesse vttered your follie.</p>
               <p>So muche of the Cannon lawe as is contrarye to the Scriptures, is Antichristian and diuellish: but there bee diuers Canons in it, very good and profitable, which may well be reteyned. Good lawes may be borrowed euen of Turkes, &amp; heathenish idolaters: and why not of Papists also? I haue tolde you before, that the thing it selfe is to be considered, not the inuentor: if it be good and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it may be vsed, whosoeuer did inuent it.</p>
               <p>In that you say, That you maye as safely by the warrant of Gods worde subscribe to allow the dominion of the Pope vniuersally to reign ouer the church of God, as of an Archbishop ouer an whole prouince. &amp;c. You expresse but youre heate, I suppose you thinke not so: can the Pope as well gouerne the whole Church as the Archbishop one prouince, and a lord Bishop one dioces? Is one king as well able to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the whole world, as he may be to gouern one king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? or bicause you can rule one parrishe well, can you therfore in like manner well gouerne twentie parishes? Surely an Archbishop may well gouerne one prouince,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:22862:112"/>
but the Pope can neuer well gouerne the whole church. And yet an Archbishop hath not the the charge of gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement ouer the whole prouince generally, but onely in certain cases exempted, &amp; therfore may do it more easily.</p>
               <p>You borowed these arguments from the very Papists who by the selfe same reasons, go about to proue the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes supremacie, for thus they argue:</p>
               <p>Among the Israelites ther was one high Priest, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che had authoritie ouer the rest, therfore ther must be one high Priest (which is the Pope) ouer the whole Churche of Christ. Master Caluin in his Institutions chap. 8. doth answere this reason on this sort: <hi>Quod in vna natione fuit vtile, id in vniuersum orbem extendere nulla ratio cogit: imo gentis vnius &amp; totius orbis longe diuersa erit ratio. That whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is profitable in one nation, can not by any reason bee extended to the whole worlde, for there is great difference betwixt the whole worlde and one nation.</hi> And a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Perinde enim est ac si quis contendat, totum mundum à praefecto vno debere regi: quia ager vnus non plur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

               </p>
               <p>An other of their reasons is this: Peter was the chiefe among the Apostles, therfore there ought to be one chief ouer the whole Churche. The same maister Caluine in the book and chapter before rehersed, maketh this one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to that Argumente: <hi>Vnus inter Apostolos sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus fuit, nempe quia pauci erant numero. Si vnus duodecim hominibus praefuit, an propterea sequetur, vnum debere cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum milibus hominum praefici? There was one chief among the Apostles, bicause they were but few in number, but if one man rule ouer twelue, shall it therefore followe that one maye rule ouer a hundred thousande?</hi> And a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after, <hi>Quod inter paucos valet, non protinus traehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum est ad vniuersum orbem terrarum, ad quem regen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum

               <p>But I meane a little to examine your places of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to sée if you haue any better lucke in applying of them, than hitherto you haue had in others.</p>
               <p>To proue that it is agaynst the worde of God, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Byshops with titles of great rulers, as Lorde, Lords grace, Metropolitane, primate of all Englande, honor. &amp;c. (for I doe not remember that we call them kings) you first quote Math. 23. which place is very ofte by you iterated, and sufficiently by me answered before.</p>
               <p>In the .13. of Iohn, which you vse also for the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, Chryst, after he had washed his disciples feete, tooke an occasion thervpon to exhorte them to humilitie, which vertue is very necessarie in all degrées of men, aswell in rulers and Magistrates, as in inferiours. And therefore that place requireth humilitie in all, especially in the ministers of the worde: but it disaloweth superioritie in none. When Chryst addeth and sayth, <hi>the seruaunt is not greater than his master. &amp;c.</hi> he armeth them agaynst persecutions, and willeth them to looke for afflictions: for in the .15. chapter he addeth to the same words, <hi>If they haue persecuted me, they vvill persecute you also.</hi> And to this are Archbyshops and Lordbyshops aswell subiect as other men, examples whereof we haue of our owne, as Cranmer, Ridley, Hooper. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>That in the .5. chapter of S. Iohn is not spoken to the Apostles, but to the whole company of Iewes, in reproofe of their vayne glory, for so is that place to be vnderstoode, else it were altogither vnlawfull for any man to receyue honor, yea euen for Princes them selues.</p>
               <p>To the like purpose tende the words of the Apostle 2. Cor. 10. <abbr>vse.</abbr> 16.17.18.</p>
               <p>Surely bothe the names of Archbyshops, Lordeby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, &amp;c. and their offices, may aswell stande with these
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:22862:114"/>
places of the scripture, as the names &amp; offices of kings, nobles, and any other persons in estimation or dignitie. In déede the mother of all heresies and sectes, that is, vayne glory and arrogancie, in all these places is vtterly condemned.</p>
               <p>But I pray you dothe Christ condemne superioritie in all those whom he exhorteth to humilitie? is not humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie aswell required in Princes and great rulers, as it is in meaner persons? yes surely, and a great deale more. Wherfore Christ in suppressing ambition, pride, &amp; arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancie, and exhorting to humilitie, doth not condemne su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioritie, neither yet titles of reuerence, but requireth humblenesse of spirite, &amp; lowlinesse of mynd in al degrées of persons, especially in superiors, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this vertue dothe moste adorne: the mightiest and noblest Prince in the worlde may come nearer this admonition of Christ, than the poorest slaue. It is therfore the affection of the minde that Christ here condemneth: not superioritie, not titles of honor and dignitie: yea he reproueth in this place such hautie &amp; proude stomakes as yours be, which contemne and disdayne those whom they ought both in words and déedes, both in titles and subiections to reuerence.</p>
               <p>To proue that ciuill offices ioyned to the eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall, is agaynst the worde of God, first you note Luke. 9. <abbr>v.</abbr> 60.61. where it is thus written. <hi>And Iesus sayde vnto him, let the dead bury their dead, but goe thou and preache the kingdome of God. Then another sayde, I vvill follovv thee Lord, but let me first go bid the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> farevvel vvhich are at my house.</hi> How conclude you any thing of these places agaynst ciuill offices in Ecclesiasticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons? Christes meaning in this place is, to teache vs (I meane al Christians) that when he calleth vs, we ought not to be hindered from following (and that foorthwith) by any excuse of dooing duetie towards our friends, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of worldly commoditie, or for feare of any payne or
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:22862:114"/>
trouble, and this is spoken generally to all Christians, and not alone to any one kinde of men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for the same purpose you vse Luk. 12. <abbr>vse.</abbr> 14. where Christe speaking to him that sayde vnto hym, <hi>master bid my brother deuide the inheritaunce with me,</hi> answereth on this sorte, <hi>man, who made me a iudge, or a deuider ouer you?</hi> Christe came in déede to be iudged, and not to iudge, he came to worke the work of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not to decide controuersies touching lands and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions. But will you therfore take from Christian men authoritie to iudge? for this example of Chryste can no more be applied to Byshops, than it may be to kings, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the doings of Christ is a patterne for al christians, and yet christians may iudge matters, &amp; decide controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies amongst their brethren. Looke .1. Cor. 6. The Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistes vse this text for one of their reasons to condemne magistracie among Christians: and therefore a very learned and late writer in his exposition of this place, writeth thus: <hi>Hinc colligitur quantopere insaniant, qui ex hoc loco magistratum inter Christianos damna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, nam Christus non argumentatur à re ipsa, tanquam profana sit, sed à voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione sua, quod missus sit in alium finem, tamet si res erat per se satis sancta &amp; pia. Hereof it may be gathered how greatly they dote, which condemne magistrates amongest Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians by this place, for Christ doth not reason of the thing it selfe, as though it were prophane, but of his owne vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, bicause he was sent to another ende, although the thing of it selfe is holy and good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the third place you alledge. Rom. 12. <abbr>vse.</abbr> 7. <hi>He that hath an office, let him wayte on his office, or he that tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth on teaching.</hi> What is this to the purpose? He that hath an office must attende vpon his office, &amp; he that tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth on teaching, therfore Byshops may not haue ciuill offices? The office of a Byshop is as well to gouerne by discipline, as by preaching: this is a very simple argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:22862:115"/>Fourthly, you cite the .1. Timo. 6. <abbr>vse.</abbr> 11. <hi>But thou, O man of God flee these things, and follovv after righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, godlynesse, faith, loue, pacience and mekenesse.</hi> Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I thinke you dote, or else dreame, your applications of scripture be so straunge. What speaketh Paule here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst ciuill offices in Ecclesiasticall persons? be onely willeth them in the person of Timothie to flée couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and to follow righteousnesse. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The last text here quoted is the seconde to Timoth. 2. <abbr>vse.</abbr> 3.4. <hi>Thou therefore suffer affliction as a good soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier of Iesus Chryst, no man that vvarreth entangleth him selfe vvith the affayres of this lyfe, bicause he vvoulde please him that hath chosen him to be a souldier.</hi> This latter sentence is generall, and perteyneth to all men. The meaning is this, whosoeuer would be a souldier vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chryst, must leaue all worldly things, and followe him. It speaketh nothing either of ciuill or ecclesiasticall offices. For if you will knowe what he there meaneth by the affayres of this life, heare what master <hi>Caluine</hi> sayth, writing vpon that place: <hi>Per negotia vita intel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to the iurisdiction of the pastour? This declareth that the disciples of Antiochia trusted the elders whiche were in Iudea with the distribution of their almes.</p>

If they would marke these words of yours wel, they might soone vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that you séek as great iurisdiction ouer them, as any of those persons whome you haue here named.

But you must be borne with, least you shoulde haue séemed to youre disciples to haue sayd nothing.</p>
               <p>Some of those ministers (you say) may tarie in their Colledge, and leade the liues of loyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring losels as long as they liue. If you knew any suche loytering losels in any Colledge, I trust you would make them knowne to other also: If you knowe none suche, then are you a slaunderer of Colledges, and suche as be in them: It were to be wished in my opinion, that there were many preachers in Colledges, of greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance than I knowe any.

where the Gospell is now preached, they had neuer suche rewardes for learning.

We make no mention of licences, to eate white meate, and flesh in Lente, and that wyth a safe conscience, for rich men that can buy them with money, nor we saye nothing howe dearely men pay for them. As for dispensations with bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed boyes, tollerations for non reside<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, bulles to haue two benefices, to haue three, to haue more, and as many as they lift or can get, these are so common, that all Godly and good men
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:22862:121"/>
are compelled with griefe of harte, to crie out vpon such abhominations. We omitte excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication for money, absolution for the same, and that by absoluing one man for another, which how contrarie it is to the scriptures, the complaints of many learned men by propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in open schooles proposed, by writings in printed bookes set out, and by preaching in ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pulpits, haue ben sufficiently witnessed. To co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, this filthy Courte hath full power, togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the authoritie of this pettie Pope, Metropolitane and primate of all England, to dispence in all causes wherein the Pope was wont to dispence, vnder whiche are conteyned more cases and causes, than wee are able to recken. As for my Lordes grace of Yorke, we deale not with hym. We referre him to that learned Epistle whiche Beza wrote vnto hym about these matters.</p>

               <p>I thinke this Court to be necessarie for the state of this Churche and Realme: and if there be abuses in it, eyther in the lawe it selfe, or in the persons, I wish it were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. But the whole order of the Courte is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be condemned, no more than it is of other Courts, which cannot be missed, and yet haue abuses in them. I confesse my selfe to haue little experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in such matters, and therefore I will speake the lesse thereof.</p>
               <p>As I do mislike that there should be any time forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to marrie in, (for that can haue no good meaning) or any dispensations for boyes to kéep benefices, or excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and absolutions for money, or one man to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:22862:121"/>
for another, and if there be any other suche like a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse: so do I vtterly condemne your vnsemely and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian termes, as filthy quauemire, poysoned plashe of all abominations, filthy Courte, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially considering wherof they be spoken, to whome, and by whome: they argue a scolding nature, and a stomacke boyling with contempt of lawes, and superiours. Neither can I suffer you to slaunder, not that Courte, but thys Churche with manifest vntruthes, as you do, when you saye that banners, bells, and making of crosses, be allowed to bee vsed in the gang weeke, and that the Archebishops Courte hath full power to dispence in all causes, wherin the Pope was wont to dispe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: which both be most vntrue. I thinke in dispensations, this Courte goeth no further than the lawes of the Realme do permitte.</p>
               <p>Agreable to this spirite is your contemptuous speach, vsed to both the Archbishops, men to be reuerenced, not only in the respecte of their yeares, and authoritie, but of their singuler wisdome, grauitie, learning, and sounde religion also. Howbeit you reuerence them, as you do all other that be in authoritie, except some, whome you do but séeke to vse, to bring your intents to passe, I will saye no more.</p>
               <p>I thinke you haue abused master Beza with your false reports, which hath caused him to write otherwise than he woulde do, if he knewe the whole state of the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie: So you haue also abused other notable learned men, and caused them to write according to your phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, which since that time (being truly enformed) haue by their letters (which are to be séene) both condemned your contentiousnesse, and their owne to much credulitie. But our faith and Churche, dependes neyther vppon Master Beza, nor any other man, neyther do they looke for any
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:22862:122"/>
such prerogatiue. But still you are without the booke.</p>
               <p>You bid vs in the margent (to proue that the regiment of the Church should be spirituall) reade Ephe. 1. verse. 23. 1. Thessa. 5. vers. 13.1. Timo. 5. vers. 2. Hebr. 10. vers. 30.</p>
               <p>In the place to the Ephe. the Apostle saith that <hi>God hath appointed Christ to be the head of the Church, which is his body, euen the fulnesse of him, that filleth all in all things.</hi> Here we learne that Christ is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head of the church But how proues this that the gouernement of the church is only spirituall? will you hereby take away ciuill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, and other gouernours that God hath placed in his Church? It is subtilly done of you, to quote the places only, and not to apply them, nor to conclude of them: For surely if you had layde downe the words, and applied the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to your purpose, not wise and learned only, but very chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren would haue laughed you to scorne.</p>
               <p>In the .1. Thess. 5. The Apostle <hi>beseecheth them to loue suche for their vvorkes sake, as laboure among them, are ouer them in the Lorde, and admonish them.</hi> What argument call you this? S. Paule moues the Thessalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians to loue their pastours, <hi>Ergo</hi> the gouernement of the Church is only spirituall.</p>
               <p>In the first Timothie. 5. vers. 2. he willeth Timothie to <hi>exhorte the elder vvomen as mothers, the yonger as sisters,</hi> whereuppon you conclude thus: elder women must be exhorted as mothers, the yonger as sisters, wyth all purenesse. <hi>Ergo</hi> the gouernement of the Church must be spirituall.</p>
               <p>In the .10. Hebr. vers. 30. it is thus written <hi>For we know him that hath saide, vengeance belongeth vnto me, I vvill recompence saith the Lorde,</hi> And againe: <hi>the Lorde shall iudge his people.</hi>
               </p>

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:22862:122"/>
spirituall.</p>
               <p>I am ashamed of these reasons, and so will you be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, if you be not past shame. If you meane that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of the Churche is spirituall, bycause God by his spirite, gifts, and ministerie of his word doth gouerne it, you say truly, although these places be vnaptly alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: but if you meane, that therefore there néede no ciuill magistrates, no ciuill and politique lawes, no externall discipline, no outwarde ceremonies and orders, you are greatly deceiued, and ioyne with the Anabaptists, whose erroure in that pointe is sufficiently by diuers learned men confuted. And therefore I will not as yet intermeddle therewith, vntill I vnderstande further of your meaning.</p>

This Court poulleth parishes, scourgeth the poore hedge preests, ladeth Churche wardens with manifest periuries, punisheth whordoms and adulteries with toyish censures, remitteth without satisfying the congregation, and that in secrete places, giueth out dispensations for vnlawfull marriages, and committeth a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand such like abominations. God deliuer all Christians out of this Antichristian tyrannie, where the Iudges, aduocates, and proctours, for the moste parte are Papists, and as for the scribes and notaries as greedy as cormorants, and if they al should perhaps see this writing, they would be as angry as waspes, and sting like hornets, three of them would be ynough to sting a man to death, for why? they are high Commissioners.</p>

with none, but suche as haue respect to the persons and not to the matter: And therefore I omitte these wordes of pleasure, which you vse, when you say, that in this apparel there is no order, but confusion: no comelinesse, but deformitie: no obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but disobedience, both agaynst God &amp; the Prince.</p>
               <p>It is not euery priuate mans part to define what is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der &amp; comelinesse in external matters béeing indifferent, but it is proper to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> onely, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God hath committed the gouernement of his Church: whose orders and lawes (not béeing agaynst the worde of God) whosoeuer dothe disobey, disobeyeth both God and the Prince: as you do in disobeying the Princes lawes in these matters.</p>
               <p>It is wel that you séeme to iustifie the gray Amyse, bycause the Byshops haue disalowed of it in their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node: Truely this is your conscience and religion, to be alwayes <hi>ad oppositum,</hi> and to disallowe that which lawe and authoritie alloweth, and allowe that which they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowe. The next way (as I thinke) to driue you vnto conformitie in apparell, were to make a streight lawe, that no man should weare such kinde of apparell, bicause you loue to be contrary to lawes and good orders.</p>
               <p>But you say, they are as the garments of the Idoll, to the which we should say, auaunt and get thee hence, they are as the garmentes of Balaamites, of Popish priests, enimies to God and all Christians. Be it so: so were all thinges in Hierico accursed, and an abhomination to the Lord, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it lawfull for the Israelites to touch any thing thereof: and yet was the golde and the siluer, and the brasen and yron vessels, carried into the treasure house of the Lorde, and consecrated vnto him.

and brought vp to be sacrificed to Baall, yea and to burne that oxe with the selfe same wood, that was consecrated and dedicated to the Idoll Baal. Iudic. 6.</p>
               <p>Our forefathers tooke the temples dedicated wholy to ydols, yea to diuels, and most abhominably defiled with diuelish and abhominable seruice, and turned them into holy Churches, where Christ should be worshipped.</p>
               <p>To be short, no diuell, no idoll, no Pope can so defile the nature or forme (not béeing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the scriptures) of any of Gods creatures, that the libertie of a Christian man should be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away in vsing, or not vsing of them.</p>
               <p>And I say agayne with master <hi>Bucer, that for any thing to be a note of Antichrist, is not in the nature of any creature in it selfe, (for to that ende nothing vvas made of God) but it hangeth altogither of consenting to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christes religion, and the professing thereof: The vvhiche consent and profession beeing chaunged into the consent and profession of Christianitie, there can sticke in the things them selues no note or marke of Antichristes reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. The vse of belles vvas a marke of Antichristianitie in our Churches, vvhen the people by them vvere called to Masses, and vvhen they vvere roong agaynst tempestes, novv they are a token of Christianitie, vvhen the people by them are gathered togither to the Gospell of Christe, and other holy actions. &amp;c.</hi> You say also, that they doe not edifie. If you say that they doe not edifie of them selues, you say truly: for only the holy ghost on this sort doth edifie, by the ministerie of the worde: But if you say, they edifie not at all, that is, that they do not tende to edifying, as other ceremonies &amp; things vsed in the church (as pulpit, church, knéeling, singing, and such like) which be appointed for order &amp; decencie, do: then speake you that which you are not able by sound arguments to iustifie. <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> in his Epistle written to master <hi>Hooper,</hi> thinketh that they doe edifie after a sorte, as other cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies

               </p>
               <p>Furthermore, that they do edifie, it is manyfest, first, bicause they are by a lawfull Magistrate, by lawfull au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, for order and decencie appoynted in the Church, without any maner of superstition, or suspition of the same.</p>
               <p>Secondly, bicause we are by due proofe and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence taught, that suche as haue worns this apparell, and do weare it, by the ministerie of the worde, haue greatly edified, and doe daily.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, bicause also by experience we daily vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande, that suche as consente in wearing this apparell, consent also in all other poyntes of doctrine, and kéepe the peace of the Churche, which is one of the principall causes of edifying: contrariwise, suche as refuse the same apparell, not onely dissente and disagrée among them selues, but fall into diuers and straunge opinions, without stay: and slaunder the Gospell with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiousnesse, and teare in péeces the Churche of Christ with their factions and schismes: and be the cause why bothe the worde of God, and christian magistrates be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most generally contemned.</p>
               <p>I here omit that which I might as iustly bring for this kinde of apparel, as you do for sitting at the communion: I meane a fit and profitable signification, wherof master <hi>Martir</hi> speaketh in the Epistle before mentioned on this sort: <hi>I wil not here say, that they which sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to the defence of this matter, may pretende some honest and iust signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the apparell, and that not dissenting from the worde of God, which is this: the ministers of the Churche (as the prophet Malachie witnesseth) be angels and Gods messengers: but angels for the most part appeared, beeing clothed in white garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. I pray you how shal we debarre the Churche of this libertie, that it can not signifie some
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:22862:127"/>
good thing in setting foorth their rytes and ceremonies, especially beeing so done, that no maner of Gods honor is attributed vnto them, and that they be in sighte come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in number fewe, and that Christian people be not wyth them ouerburdened, and matters of greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portaunce be omitted.</hi>

               <p>You adde and say, that they haue the shewe of euill, (séeing the Popish priesthoode is euill.)</p>
               <p>When they were a signe and token of the Popishe priesthoode, then were they euill, euen as the thing was which they signified: but nowe they be the tokens and the signes of the ministers of the worde of God, which are good, and therefore also they be good: no man in this Churche of Englande is so ignorante, but that he kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth this apparell not to be nowe the signes of a Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing priest, but of a lawfull minister: wherefore it is a shewe of good: euen as it is in the lyke maner in the Uniuersities a shewe and signe of degrées in learning, and therfore a showe of good, excepte you will also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne degrées of learning. Neither is if any straunge matter, for the selfe same thing in others respectes, and at diuers times, to be the signe bothe of good and euill. The belles were a signe of euill, when they were roong to call to Masse, and to stay stormes and tempestes, the selfe same belles are now a signe of good, when they bée roong to sermons and other godly actions. The Churches them selues were a signe of euill, when Idolatrie was committed in them, and false doctrine preached: nowe they be a signe of good, when God is rightly worshipped in them: and his worde truely preached. Many such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples I could bring, but a reasonable man can gather of these sufficiently to confute your errour. Furthermore when we be willed to abstayne from all shewe of euill, it is ment of euill life, and euill doctrine, least we do any thing with a scrupulous conscience.</p>

               <p>This is an argument <hi>à non causa ad causam,</hi> it is not the apparell that worketh discorde, or hindreth the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Gospell, no, no more than it is the worde of God that engendreth heresies, or wyne that maketh dronke, or the sworde that murdreth, or the lawe that worketh iniurie. &amp;c. But it is the sinister affection, the rebellious nature, the contentious minde of man. For who began this contention, or when was it begonne? Truely if the lawe for apparell were vtterly abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet would not your contention cease, nay, it woulde burst out muche more vehamently, and in farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter matters, as this your admonition declareth.

Finally, that godly men may well vse that which wicked haue abused, howsoeuer vngodly.</p>
               <p>They bring the ministerie into contempte. Onely with you, and suche as you (by your continuall crying out agaynst them) haue deluded: contemners of good orders, lawes, and statutes, are to be seuerely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished for their contempt.

                     <pb facs="tcp:22862:131"/>In the former edition, and fourthe reason, it is thus written: In this booke we are enioyned to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Communion kneeling, whiche beside that it hath in it a shewe of papistrie, dothe not so well expresse the mysterie of this holy sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. For as in the olde Testament eating the Paschall Lamb standing, signified a readinesse to passe: euen so in receiuing it nowe sitting, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the example of Christe, we signifie a rest, that is, a full finishing thorough Christe, of all the ceremonial lawe, and a perfect worke of redemption wrought that giueth rest for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and so we auoyde also the daunger of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie.</p>
                  <p>In the seconde Edition these wordes be thus altered: In this booke we are enioyned to receiue the Communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> kneeling, which beside that it hath in it a shewe of popish Idolatrie, dothe not so wel expresse a supper, neither agreeth it so wel with the institution of Christ, as sitting dothe: not that we make sitting a thing of necessitie belonging vnto the Sacrament, neither affirm we that it maye not be receiued otherwise, but that it is more neare the institution, and also a meane to auoyde the daunger of Idolatrie. Here is the signification of sitting (whiche they before made) cleane dashed out, as a thing vnaduisedly before put in. It is also here graunted that the Communion may be receiued otherwise than sitting, with other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, whereof they haue nowe better considered. Surely this is a great alteration vppon suche a sodeine: And I would hardly haue bene persuaded that these men woulde so sone haue discredited themselues by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancie. But peraduenture the selfe same had not the

                  <p>In the same leafe and fifth reason, to these wordes: Besides that we neuer read in the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente that this worde Priest as touching of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is vsed in the good parte: In the second editio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is added, except it speake of the Leuiticall priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood or of the priesthood of Christ.

                  <p>All this is added in the seuenth reason: But some will say that the baptisme of women is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded by law, if it be not, why do you suffer it, &amp; wherefore are the children so baptized ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly? co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon experience teacheth that it is vsed almost in all places, and few speake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it: &amp; this I am sure of, that when it was put in the booke, that was the meaning of the most part, that were the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> present, &amp; so it was to be vnderstand, as common practise without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolement doth playnely declare. All these be but coniectures. Diuers things he suffered &amp; in many places vsed without controlement, which notwithstanding by
<pb facs="tcp:22862:132"/>
no law be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded. What the meaning was of those that penned the booke, I know not, neither as I thinke do you. And surely for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon practise I can say little, but for mine owne experience this I dare affirme, that I haue not knowne one child so baptised in places where I haue had to do, no not synce y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beginning of the Quenes Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties reigne. I speake not of the thing it selfe, but onely of your coniectures: I thinke if the circumstances of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> booke be well considered, it will appeare y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the meaning is, that priuate baptisme is rather to be ministred by some mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister (which in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of necessitie may soonest be come by) than by any woman. But in this point I submit my iudgement to suche as better knowe the meaning of the booke (being penners thereof) than I do.</p>
                  <p>In the same leafe and nynth reason speaking of certen things vsed aboute mariage, they adde these woordes: With diuers other heathenishe toyes, in sundry cuntryes, as carying of wheat sheafes on their heads, &amp; casting of corne, with a number of such like, whereby they make rather a maygame of mariage, than a holie institution of God. These be but toyes in déede, vsed I know not where, not contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in any part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> booke of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon prayers, &amp; therefore without my compas of defence.

                  <p>In the 10. reason to these woords, (as for confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: is added, which the papistes &amp; our men say was in tymes past Apostolicall, grounding their opinion perhappes vppon some dreame of Hierome: And in the same place these woordes be left out: We speake not of other toyes vsed in it, and how farre it differeth, and is degenerated from the first institution, they them selues that are learned can witnesse: And in the place hereof
<pb facs="tcp:22862:133"/>
this is inserted, as though baptisme were not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie perfecte, but needed confirmation, or as though the Byshop could giue the holy ghost. You your selfe in effecte haue confessed in your firste edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that confirmation of children is very auncient, and that it hath bene well instituted, for there you say that now it differeth and is degenerat from the first institution: But vpon better aduisement you haue left out these wordes in your second edition: as you haue also left out thèse, with other toyes vsed in it, whereby you confesse (contrarie to your former sentence) that the confirmation of children now vsed is without any toyes. Howsoeuer it pleaseth you to accompt Hieromes iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (touching the antiquitis of confirmation) a dreame: yet his dreame may be of as much credit with wise men, as your bare denial of the same.</p>
                  <p>The wordes that you haue added in the seconde place might well haue bene spared: for you knowe that confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation now vsed in this Church is not to make baptisme perfect, but partly to trie howe the Godfathers and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothers haue performed that which was enioyned them when the children were baptised: partly that the children themselues (nowe being at the yeares of discretion, and hauing learned what their Godfathers and Godmothers promised for them in baptisme) may with their owne mouth and with their owne consente openly before the Churche ratifie and confirme the same, and also promise that by the grace of God they wil euermore endeuor the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues faithfully to obserue and kéepe such things as they by their owne mouth and confession haue assented vnto. And this reason is alledged among other euen in the boke of Common prayers. And that it is not to make baptisme perfect, the boke of common prayers it selfe declareth in these words: <hi>And that no man shall thinke any detriment shall come to children by deferring of their confirmation, he shall know for truth that it is certaine by Gods vvorde
<pb facs="tcp:22862:133"/>
that children being baptised, haue all things necessarie for their saluation, and be vndoubtedly saued.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You adde, as though the Byshop coulde giue the holy Ghost: the Byshop may vse the ceremonie vsed by the Apostles, that is, <hi>imposition of handes,</hi> &amp; may safely say this godly prayer conteyned in the boke: <hi>Defend O Lord this child vvith thy heauenly grace that he may continue thine for euer, and dayly encrease in thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spirite, more and more, vntill he come vnto thy euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting kingdome. Amen.</hi> And other such godly praiers ther conteyned. Of any other kinde of giuing the holy ghost, there is no mention in that booke, and therefore these ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions myght very wel haue bene left out of your libell. But of the Bishops benedictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by laying on of his hands, heare Master <hi>Caluines</hi> iudgement in his Instit. cap. 19. secti. 4. <hi>Talem manuum impositionem quae simpliciter loco bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictionis fiat, lando, et restitutam hodie in purum vsum vilim. Such imposition of handes as is simplie made in the steade of blessing, I do commend, and vvish that it vvere restored at this day to the pure vse.</hi> There shall you also reade the very self same for me &amp; manner of confirmation allowed, which is now vsed in this Church of England.</p>
                  <p>To the ende of the eleuenth reason, these wordes be added, and open our eyes that we may see what that good and acceptable will of God is, and be more earnest to prouoke his glorie: to the which I only answere Amen.</p>

For howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Christ maketh perfecte all things with his becke, and by his power, yet Paule speaketh here especially of the spiritual gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the church. Although that in the meane time it is no hinderance, why thou mayest not also vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it of the vniuersall gouernement of the world.</hi> These words serue litle for your purpose. There is no man that doubteth but that Christe doth spiritually go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne his Churche, and raigne in the hartes of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full by hys sprite: But your meaning is, that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of the Churche is only spirituall, which you can no more gather of these wordes of Caluine, than you may that the gouernemente of the whole world ought only to be spirituall.</p>
                  <p>The same Caluine writing vppon .1. Thessa. 5 vers. 12. for the which you haue noted the .13. saith on this sorte: <hi>Hoc additum videtur, ad notandum spirituale regimen, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metsi enim Reges quo<expan>
                           <am>

This seemes to be added to note the spirituall regiment. For although kings also and Magistrates do gouerne by the ordinance of God, yet bycause the Lorde would haue the gouernemente of the Churche knowne peculierly to be his, therefore namely they are saide to rule in the Lorde, whiche gouerne the Churche in the name of Christe and by hys commaundemente.</hi> Hitherto Caluine also affirmeth that whiche no man denieth,
<pb facs="tcp:22862:135"/>
that God doth by the ministerie of his worde, spiritually gouerne his Church: But this taketh not away the ciuill Magistrate, neyther yet ciuill lawes made by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate externally also to gouerne the Churche. In his Commentaries. 1. Ti. 5. verse. 2. he speaketh not one word of this matter for any thing that I can perceiue. Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the place to the Hebrewes, he onely sheweth that God dothe gouerne hys Churche: the whiche I thinke no man is so wicked as to denye. You muste more plainly sette it downe what your meaning in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is, before you can be fully aunswered. For to proue that God dothe spiritually gouerne his Churche, is néedlesse, being denied of none, either Papiste, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant: but thereuppon to conclude that the ciuill magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate is secluded from the gouernement of the Churche, or that there néedeth no externall regiment, is dangerous, and sauoreth Anabaptisme.</p>
                  <p>In the same leafe and .19. reason these wordes be lefte out, ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners and belles: whiche argueth that they were before vntruly sayde to be vsed in gang wéeke: But to lye, is a small matter with these men.</p>

                  <p>You say, we choake our selues with our owne argumente, for euen the very name of trifles doth playnly declare, that they ought not to be maynteyned in Christes Church. Surely of them selues they be but trifles, as all other externall ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and indifferent things bée: It is the circumstaunces that maketh them no trifles, but matters of weight: For things indifferent béeing commaunded thus or so to bée vsed by the Magistrate (not as necessarie to saluation &amp; iustificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but as conuenient and necessarie for order &amp; decencie) bée not nowe trifles: And who soeuer without a lawfull vrgente cause, or in a case of necessitie, dothe breake y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law made of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, sheweth himselfe a disordered person, disobediente, a contemner of lawfull authoritie, and a wounder of his weake brothers conscience.

               <p>S. I haue receyued your letters (Reuerende father in Christe) vvherein you do ansvvere vnto those, vvhich I sent vnto mine olde friende, <hi>D. Parkhurst,</hi> aboue sixe yeres since, euen in the yere. 1566. And as I vsed a certayne kinde of vehemencie, so do you also vvith no lesse grauitie, put avvay my assertions. But assure your selfe; that I am so farre off from beeing offended vvith this your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, that I rather esteeme of that your admonition or reprehension (if it please you so to terme it) as of an espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall and singuler benefite. For by it I perceiue that I am beloued of you, vvhom before (although by face vnkno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vven) I vvas vvont to reuerence, for the testimonie of godlinesse and learning, vvhich <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> ( a man of godly memorie) dyd oftentimes giue of you vnto me, and vvherof I novve see an euident proofe in these your let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. For I knovve, that to defende the common cause agaynst any man, is a poynt of pietie: but a free admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, vvherby the errour of thy brother (beeing deceyued by other men) is reproued, to the intent that he mighte learne to iudge better, is as a token of loue. Bothe the vvhich, seeing that you haue no lesse learnedly, than true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performed, I haue iust cause to embrace your holinesse, trusting, that this displeasure vvhich hath arisen betvvixte vs, shall be a cause of perpetuall amitie. For thus muche I dare presume of your curtesie, that I shall easily obtayne pardon for this offence, if you vvould but consider at vvhat time, vpon vvhat occasion, and vnto vvhom I vvrote these things. The tyme vvas moste corrupt and troublesome, and diuers letters vvere brought vnto vs euery day, vvhen that vnhappie controuersie about apparell vvas broched amongst you. VVe then admonished your aduersaries, that they should not moue any contention in the Church, for a matter of so small importance: and vve thought the matter had beene vvelnigh buried. But beholde, contrary to all mens expectation, there commeth tvvo English men
<pb facs="tcp:22862:139"/>
from Geneua, vvho brings from master Beza, (vvhose eares they had before filled vvith crymes &amp; forged accusations) letters full of godly complaynts, vvherin he desired that we vvould helpe the most afflicted state of Englande, and cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled me, to make a iorney vnto you. Herevnto vvas ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned the reporte of those tvvo, vvho declared vnto vs the same things, vvhich before they had vttred at Geneua, and that vvith so great confidence, and shevv of holinesse, that they set dovvne in vvriting errors, and many superstitious abuses, vvhich they sayde vvere novv defended in England, and that al those vvere put fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ministerie of the church, vvhich vvould not consent thervnto. They sayd moreouer, that this vvas their greatest greese, that many of the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops shevved them selues to be the executors of those things, vvhich vvere dayly coyned of superstitious and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Courtiers. But vvho (I pray you) vvould suspecte, that any vvould so boldly make a lye in a common cause, the knovvledge vvherof could not long be hid? surely their talke moued vs very much, and I confesse I vvrote that Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle vpon a soden vnto. <hi>D.P.</hi> vvith vvho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I thought I might be bolde, for the olde friendship, vvhich beeing begon at Oxeforde, aboue .35. yeres agoe, hath bene so confirmed since, by his soiorning at my house the space of foure yeres, that bothe I am vvilling to be at his commaundement, and agayne also may assure my selfe of his good vvill, in any respect. Notvvithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, I thought nothing lesse, than that he vvould publish my letters abroad, for I onely desired to heare his aduise: vvho (for all that) neuer vvrote of this matter: vvhich thing moued me not much, bicause a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler honest man, and our common friende, <hi>D.A.</hi> vvrote ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of vnto vs, and deliuered you all from blame. Therefore I tooke no care at all for those my letters, vvhich I had vvritte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> onely vnto my <hi>P.</hi> of vvhose good vvill, I neither can nor ought to doubt. But surely I am very sory, since I vnderstand novv, that they haue ben farther published: and I think my selfe bound to giue your honor great thanks (Reuerend fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) for that at the length (though somevvhat late) you
<pb facs="tcp:22862:140"/>
haue aduertised me therof. And forsomuche as you vvrite, that you haue no doubte of the simplicitie of my minde, and sincere affection, I humbly beseech your gentlenesse, to make my excuse vnto others, also to vvhose hands, that my Epistle hath come. Verily since that time, vve haue had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do vvith those vayne bravvlers, vvho neither haue vvritten to vs at any tyme, neither yet can bragge of any thing that hath come from vs. For not long after, it more playnly appeared vvhat they vve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t about, vvhen as vnder the pretence of Ecclesiasticall discipline (the head and chiefest poynt vvherof they vvould haue to consist in exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) they vvere the chiefe authors of an alteration vvithin the seigniorie of the countie Palatine, vvhich maruellously troubled and disquieted those Churches. VVherfore once agayne (Reuerende father in Christ) I beseeche your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, that you vvould not conceiue any sinister opinion of Gualter, vvho beareth a singuler affection to the Englishe nation: for (God vvilling) I vvill set foorth a publike testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, hovv muche I esteeme of you al, vvhich serue Christ in that place: and certenly I vvould neuer haue sent my sonne into Englande, vvhome onely I haue of my vvife Zvvinglia (the memorie of vvhose death is most leefe and deare to me) except I had throughly persuaded my selfe of our consent and agreement. If you maruell that I haue not hitherto vvritten to your honor in his behalfe, you shall vnderstand, that I haue neglected it, for no other cause, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this, that before this time, there hath bene no entercourse of letters betvvixt vs, and I should haue bene ashamed to trouble you, so vvorthy a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; altogither (except by name only) vnto me vnknovvne, for a priuate matter.

And vve do earnestly pray vnto God, that he wil not only continue these so great graces in hir, but also increase them, and that he will defende hir from all euill. This vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Prince, beloued of God, in the iudgement of all good men, excelleth all the men Princes that novv reigne in the vvorlde, in vvisedome, in modestie, in mercy, in iustice, in dexteritie, and maruellous happinesse in all hir affayres, so that vndoubtedly, the godly of al nations do comfort them selues, and are confirmed in the true religion, for that they do euidently see Christe the Lorde so mightily to fauour his seruaunt, and to preserue hir in glory, and all maner vertue, before Heroicall and diuine Princes. But vve are not a lyttle sory, that in your spreading of the truthe, and enlarging of the limittes of Christes church, so many stops and stayes are cast agaynst you, and they springing from them that vvill seeme moste Euangelicall. For in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the reformation of our Churche, the same grieues occupied vs, for there vvere some, vnto vvhom in reforming, nothing might seeme sufficiently pure, in so muche that they separated them selues from the churche, and appoynted priuate conuenticles, the vvhich, there did presently follovv schismes, and diuers sectes, and they were a pleasaunt spectacle to our enimies, the Papistes. But at the length their hypocrisie and disorder dyd appeare, and they vanished of their ovvne accorde.

            <head>A briefe answere to certain Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets spred abroade of late.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> HAVE</hi> of late receyued thre litle Pamphlets, the first as it were a preface to the other two, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde entituled, An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops to deale bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly with their bre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thren: The thirde, An exhortation to the Bishops and theyr cleargie, to answere a little Booke that came foorth the last Parliament, and to other brethren to iudge of it by Gods worde, vntill they see it aunswered, and not be caried awaye with any respect of men.</p>
            <p>The Preface consisteth of these poynts especially: first by diuers examples it is there declared, that the wicked and vngodly of this world, coulde neuer away with such as woulde reproue them for their manyfest sinnes and vngodlynesse.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that this is the cause why these two Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises which wer lately written and imprinted in the last Parliament time. &amp;c. were of so many mysliked, and the authors thereof so cruelly entreated, and straightly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it rayleth on the Bishops and suche as be in authoritie, comparing them to false prophets and to Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseys. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:22862:142"/>Laste of all, it concludeth wyth threatenyng, that if they goe forewarde in their sinnes, their doings shall bée with more bitternesse of woordes and playnenesse of speache throwne into their faces.</p>
            <p>The first is néedlesse: for who knoweth not, that from tyme to tyme it hath ben the maner of such as wer despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly wicked, not to suffer their sins ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly to be reproued.</p>
            <p>The seconde is false, vncharitable, and slaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous: for the cause why the bookes bée not estéemed (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the wise and learned) is the vntrue doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned in them, maynteyned with vntrue and vnapt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations of the Scriptures, and interlaced with oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious termes and rayling speaches, tendyng to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietnesse of the Churche, and ouerthrow of true religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The authors therof to be imprisoned, not for telling any man of his sinnes, but for writing Libels agaynste this whole Churche of Englande, agaynst the booke of Common-prayers, agaynste the ministerie, agaynst the Sacramentes, fynally agaynst the whole forme and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of the Churche, by the whole consent of this realme established, &amp; according to the rule of Gods word. And with what face can you say, that they be imprisoned for telling men of their sins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where euer read you or herd you that any of the Prophets or apostles told me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their sins by li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>els? Surely that kinde of dealing is not for the Apostles of Christ, but for the ministers of Sathan.</p>
            <p>The thirde commeth of the same spirite that the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde dothe, that is, of the spirite of arrogancie, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice: for it compareth godly, wyse, zealous and learned Bishops, to idolatrous Priests, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Phariseys separated themselues from the common sorte of men, as more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and contemned the poore Publicanes as sinners: And therfore some learned interpreters thinke, that they bée called <hi>Pharisaei, quasi segregati, quod vitae sanctimonia a viel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi moribus &amp; vita separati essent, no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aliter at<expan>

<pb facs="tcp:22862:143"/>
refused to salute them, but spitte in theyr faces, wishyng the plague of God to lyghte vpon them, and saying that they were damned, and that God had taken his spirite from them, and all this bycause they did weare a cap: wherefore when they talke of Phariseys, they plucke themselues by the noses. But, Lorde, what a straunge tyme is this, when suche as they bee, dare thus boldly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishe libelles agaynst their superiors, for maynteyning and executing good and godly lawes?</p>
            <p>The conclusion of this Preface, is a stoute, presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and malaperte threatning, in my opinion, not to be suffered, but howe soeuer your penne and toung wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, yet I pray you holde your handes, or else. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In this portion entituled An exhortation to the Bishoppes to deale brotherly with theyr bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: There is no greate matter conteyned worthye of answering, onely the authour dothe excuse himselfe, for takyng vppon hym that exhortation, and moueth the Byshoppes to deale brotherly with the authors of the Admonition. Fyrst, bicause they be their brethren: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly bicause they oughte firste to haue discouered vnto the worlde by the worde of God, howe truely or falsly they haue written: Thirdly, bicause they do but disclose the disorders of our Churche of Englande, and humbly desire a reformation of the same, according to the rule of Gods word. &amp;c. Fourthly, that Papistes lye abroade in their dioces vntouched, &amp;c. Fifthly, that many leude light bookes, and balades flie abroade printed, not onely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reprehension, but <hi>Cum priuilegio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lykewyse in the same booke the Author séemeth to iustifie the Admonition, and to condemne the Lordship and authoritie of Byshops, ascribing thervnto the stay and hinderance of their pretenced reformation: charging them after a sort with mangling the Scriptures of God, and with snaring the godlie with suche lawes, as were
<pb facs="tcp:22862:143"/>
purposely made for the wicked. These be the principall contentes of that booke.</p>
            <p>The first reason, that is, (that they be their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren) might aswell be alledged for the impuritie of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptists, Arrians, and such like, who pretende the syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie of Gods woorde, and would be counted brethren: Yea it might aswell be alledged for many other male fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, who be also brethren, and yet must not therefore escape vnpunished for their offences. Shall not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince and the magistrate execute lawes vppon such as breake them, bycause they be their brethren in Christ? beware of such doctrine, &amp; let not affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in priuate mens causes carry you headlong into publique errours. But I thinke you are in this point deceiued, for how so euer we acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt them our brethren, yet they acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt not vs their brethren, neither wil they acknowledge vs so to be, as some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, bothe in open speach and manifest signes haue declared. And therefore when the Bishops deale with them, they deale with such as disdayne to be called their brethren.</p>
            <p>To their seconde reason I answere, that I thinke they haue bene talked with, and herd what they haue to say for them selues, but their hawtie mindes and good opinion conceiued of them selues, will not suffer them to sée their errours: In this reason you alledge nothing for them, but that which may also be alledged for the Papistes, or any other sect of heretikes. But it is an olde saying, <hi>Turpe est doctori &amp;c.</hi> How happeneth if that they them selues haue first defamed, not the Bishops onely but also this whole Churche of England with publique libelles, before they haue vsed brotherlie and priuate conference? This is to spye a mote in another mans eye. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>How true the third reason is, may appeare in my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to their Admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: But how true so euer it were, yet their disordered disclosing, by vnlawfull meanes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, by libelling, deserueth as much punishement as hitherto
<pb facs="tcp:22862:144"/>
they haue had: for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth nedeth no such vngodly meanes of disclosing. If Papists go abrode vnpunished when by lawe they may be touched, surely it is a great faulte, and can not be excused, and I pray God it may be better loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to: But this is no good and sufficient reason for the impunitie of other: Bicause some Papists be not puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, shall therefore no disordered persons be punished? Or bycause some in authoritie winke at some Papists, shall therefore no lawes be executed towards any offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours? Surely touching malice against the forme and state of this our Church, I sée no great differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwixte them and the Papists, and I thinke verily they both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire togither. The same answere I make to your fifte reason: shall no booke be suppressed bycause some be not? It is a fault (I confesse) to suffer leude ballets and bookes touching manners: But it were a greater faulte to suffer bookes and libells disturbing the peace of the Church, and defacing true religion.</p>
            <p>Concerning the titles and offices of Byshops I haue spoken sufficiently before.</p>
            <p>In mangling &amp; wresting of the scriptures none offend so muche, as do the Authours of the Admonition, who in that pointe are comparable to the Papistes, as may bée séene by the learned and diligent reader.</p>
            <p>If they, whome they terme godly, do willingly offend against suche lawes as were made for the wicked, they are to be punished according to the lawes, neyther are they to be spared bicause they pretende godlinesse: For there is no godlinesse in breaking of lawes.</p>
            <p>The thirde scroule called An exhortation to the Bishops and their clergie to aunswere a litle boke &amp;c, is satisfied (I trust) for I haue (as it is there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired) aunswered the shorte and peuish pamphlet (as they terme it) I haue disclosed their double and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupte dealing, their wringing of the scriptures to serue
<pb facs="tcp:22862:144"/>
their turne, and haue declared the true sense and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them: I haue not bumbasted it with rethoricke, but in plaine and simple manner vttered my iudgement according to the true meaning and sense of the scriptures: Notwithstanding I haue in sundrie points declared the vse of the Churche of Christ in times past, and do vse the testimonie of auncient councells and learned fathers, whiche these vnlearned men vnlearnedly contemne, a thing not hearde of in any age or Church, nor allowed of any learned man, but only of certaine heretiques and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially Anabaptists. To be shorte I haue not answered the booke by péeces, but wholy. How be it I must desire them to pardon me for not making more spéede wyth mine Answere: their friuolous quotations so troubled me, and my other businesse, that I could no sooner make an ende of it. In all the rest of that deriding Pamphlet, there is nothing of any moment, worth the answering. Therefore as they alledge this portion of a sentence ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of Saincte Augustine in his epistle <hi>ad Vincen. Si terrerentur &amp; non docerentur, improba quasi dominatio vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur, If they should be feared and not taughte, it mighte seeme a wicked gouernaunce:</hi> so I conclude with the other parte of the same sentence: <hi>Si docerentur &amp; non ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerentur, vetustate consuetudinis obdurarentur, &amp; ad capescenda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> via<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> salutis pigrius moue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tur: If they shold be taught and not feared, in time they woulde waxe stubborne, and be the hardlier moued to embrace the way of saluation.</hi>

            <head>¶ A briefe viewe of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde Admonition.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue also receyued a seconde Admonition to the Parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, the Authoure whereof vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh to teach how to reforme those things whiche the other Admonition found fault with. I shall not néede to make any long discourse of it, neyther will I: The aunswere to the first Admonition, is an answere to this also.</p>
            <p>Only I thought it good to note vnto you that this booke consisteth of these points especially: First it iustifieth the authours of the first Admonition, &amp; séemeth to complaine that they haue not iustice, bicause they appealing to the highest Courte of Parliament, their appeale woulde not be receiued. And therefore they say the scripture is plaine that it shal be easier for Sodom &amp; Gomorra in the day of iudgement, than for suche a Courte: (meaning the Court of Parliament) &amp; they quote for that purpose in the margent the .10. of Math. vers. 14.15. which is a shameful prophanation of the scripture, &amp; an egregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous slander to that honorable Courte. The iustnesse of the appeale, I leaue to the Iustices, and skilfull lawyers to be considered of, for it is not within the compasse of my facultie. Only I thinke that, that scroule can haue no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Parliament: first bycause it is a Libell: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bicause it was published in printe before the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was made priuie vnto it.</p>
            <p>In this parte these words of theirs would be wel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, there is no other thing to be looked for, than some speedy vengeance to light vppon the
<pb facs="tcp:22862:146"/>
whole lande, prouide as well as the politique Macheuills of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thinke they can though God do his worst: It would be knowne whome they meane by these politique Macheuills: For they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie all men of great authoritie, wit and pollicie.</p>
            <p>The seconde parte consisteth only of rayling wordes and slanderous accusatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, first against this whole church of England, for they say that we are scarce come to the outward face of a church rightly reformed, and that althogh some truth be taught by some preachers, yet no preacher may without greate danger of the lawes vtter all truth comprised in the booke of god &amp;c. And a litle after they ad &amp; say, that the truth in a manner doth but peepe out behind the screene: which speches as they be very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true (for who knoweth not that the Gospel is wholy, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blikely, &amp; fréely preached in this church of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d) so they be slanderous, neither can the Papists speak any worse.</p>
            <p>In this part also to proue that this is no true saying, in maters of pollicie &amp; gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, it is not repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the word of god, &amp; therfore it may be vsed: is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged this saying of Christ. Math. 12. <hi>He that is not with me is against me.</hi> But they haue forgote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words of christ, Mar. 9. <hi>qui non est aduersus nos pro nobis est, He that is not against vs is with vs.</hi> Wherevpon we may much better co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, that that which is not repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the scripture, is consona<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the Scripture, than they can doo the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary of the former place. Notwithstanding in both these places (as I thinke) Christe speaketh rather of men and persons, than of things themselues.</p>
            <p>In the same parte their speach of the Quéenes supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie is very suspicious, &amp; it would be demaunded of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what they think in déede of hir maiesties authoritie in ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical matters, for in this pointe they haue hitherto
<pb facs="tcp:22862:146"/>
delte very subtilly and closely: notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning may easily be perceiued of such as diligently co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider their bookes.</p>
            <p>Likewise in this parte they note certayne contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in this Churche, as betwixte the Communion boke and Iniunctions, touching wafers: the Communion booke and Aduertisementes concerning Churche vestures: the Cannons and the Po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tificall in not ordering of ministers <hi>sine titulo,</hi> and such like matters of no importance: which iustifie rather this church, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> otherwise: for surely if they had had weightier matters, they would no doubt haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged them. But in these same matters they are muche deceiued, for as I suppose in matters of ornaments of the Church and of the ministers thereof, the Quéenes maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie togither with the Archbishop or the commissioners in causes ecclesiastical, haue authoritie by Acte of parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to alter and appointe such rytes and ceremonies as shall from time to time be thought to them most conueniente. To be shorte, in that pointe they saye that in thinges of order one Churche maye many times differ from another without offence, following the generall rules of scripture for order, as in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing time and place for prayers &amp;c. whiche is a very true saying, and flat contrary to all that is saide either in the first admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or in this second: For if such things may be appointed in the church, not being expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the word of God, but depending vppon this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall rule, <hi>Let all thinges be done decently and in order.</hi> 1. Cor. 14. then surely the magistrate hath authoritie in such matters to appoint what shall be thought vnto them most conuenient, so that it be not repugnant to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:22862:147"/>The thirde parte of this booke condemneth the degrées of Doctors, Bachilers of diuinitie, and Masters of arte in the vniuersities, and slaunderously, vntruly, and oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briously speaketh of the vniuersities and suche as be in them: presumptuously prescribing a manner of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the same, when as I thinke verily, they knowe not what Uniuersities meane. But here we may note y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they séeke to ouerthrowe al learning and degrées of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. The same parte also very slaunderously and vnchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianly rayleth on some bishops by name and the rest of the clergie, charging them most vn truly with sundrie things: but bycause it is done by way of libelling (a diue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishe kinde of reuenge) therefore, I trust godly and wise men will estéeme of it accordingly. Besides slaunderous reports and opprobrious words, there is nothing in thys parte worthy the answering.</p>
            <p>In the fourth parte, the Authoure taketh vppon him to set downe a plat forme of a Churche, to prescribe the manner of electing ministers, of their exercises, of theyr equalitie, of the gouernement of the Church, &amp;c. Whiche surely being well considered, wil appeare not only a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused plateforme, without any sounde warrant of Gods worde, but also a fantasticall deuise, tending to the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe of learning, religion, yea the whole state and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of the common welth.</p>
            <p>But bicause I haue before in the confutation of the first Admonition, spoken sufficiently of al these matters, therfore I will only note one or two things in this parte, to let you vnderstand that these platformers builde not vppon that foundation that they woulde haue others so strictly bounde vnto: For let them tell me vppon what scripture this is grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded: Let no one minister medle in any cure saue his owne, but as he is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by common consente of the nexte conference or counsells prouinciall or nationall, or further
<pb facs="tcp:22862:147"/>
if it may fall out so generall of all Churches re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed? Or this, That the ministers muste be equall, and that some must be gouerned by all, and not al by some? Or that, the pastor or teacher in euery congregation ought to be the principall of the consistorie of their congregation? Or that, Many parishes may be ioyned in one, and haue one pastor, and yet that it is vnlawfull for one pastor to haue many parishes? Or that, In the meane whyle, till preachers increase to furnishe the places vnfurnished, vpon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ference among the learned, some discrete man be appoynted to make some entiet prayer. &amp;c. Or that it is euill so ofte to repeate, Glory be to the father. &amp;c. Lorde haue mercy vpon vs. &amp;c. or the Lordes prayer? For the text which they alledge for the same, Math. 6. is wickedly wrested, and corruptly alledged: for the words of Christe be not (as they translate them) When you pray <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> that is, many words without fayth, and the inwarde af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the minde, is forbidden. Paule. 1. Thessa. 5. saith, <hi>Pray continually.</hi> And Christ, Math. 6. sayth, <hi>Pray on this maner, Our father. &amp;c.</hi> So that of necessitie we muste oftentimes repeate the Lordes prayer, if we will beléeue Christe and his Apostle Paule: But Lorde what strange doctrine is this, to call Glory bee to the father. &amp;c. Lorde haue mercy vpon vs. &amp;c. Our father. &amp;c, popishe? Surely these men (as I suppose) be not well in their wittes.</p>

Here you find fault that this word scarce is left out. In déede this worde scarce was written in the margent of diuers copies of the first admonition: whether it were so in al, or no, I know not: no more do I whether any suche collection (as you pretend) was made. But what néed you so much sticke in words, when the thing is manyfest? For in effect they denie as much as that propositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> importeth: they wholly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne the ministerie, the ceremonies, and the gouernement of this Church.

A man may truly speake as much of the Romish church: for some truthe is taught by some Papistes: yea some truth is taught by some Iew and Turke.
