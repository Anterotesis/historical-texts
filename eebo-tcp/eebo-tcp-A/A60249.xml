            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here appeared of late at <hi>White-hall</hi> a <hi>Philistin</hi> in black, defying the Armies of the living God. His strength was in his Tongue, not in his Arme: His weapons, Breath, and his combat, an houres Boast. Yet as to his own conceit, a huge <hi>Goliah:</hi> he blew down <hi>Mount Sion</hi> at a puffe, and split in pieces the Rock, against which the Gates of Hell shall never prevaile. In that conjuncture, because no adversary could securely be seen, the applause flew high, victory and triumph rebounding from all the hills of great <hi>Britany.</hi> Yet, God knowes, all was but wind. <hi>Flaverunt venti.</hi> The windes blew: <hi>Sion</hi> stands still immoveable, and the <hi>Rock</hi> unshaken.

But indeed there needed no such Gyant to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat that <hi>Goliah:</hi> the least of <hi>Iesse</hi>'s Family, the Church, supported by the power of his Cause, may hope for successe in such a Duell. Upon which account I was encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to trace out another way of answer, tending to disable his proofs, by stripping his arguments, and shewing them in <hi>cuerpo.</hi> Now the Doctor's Sermon having been both Preached and published under a Royall shadow, I come with an humble suit, prostrate at your Majesties feet, that I may shelter this Answer under your graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous protection: whose name, as it is most renowned in the Christian world, for zeal of Religion, so upon your Royall assent, 'twill render all-secure the Author of this slender work,</p>

               </hi> Am onely to advertise thee of three things in the perusall of this Treatise. First, that <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor Pierce</hi> having in his <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory</hi> to the King pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the publick confessions of our abl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>st Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, in favour of his erronrs, clogs both Margin and Text with our profest enemies: as <hi>Goldastus, Armacanus, John Hus, Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome Prague, Chemnitius, Bishop Hall, Cook, Nilus, Balsamon,</hi> and others: or with Authors of suspected faith, whose works are forbidden by the Church, as <hi>Erasmus, Cassander, Thuanus,</hi> and <hi>Polidor Virgil de inventione rerum,</hi> enlarged and corrupted by Protestants: or if he cites any Orthodox VVriters, they differ not in point of faith, but in things indifferent, or practises alterable upon just occasion. Secondly, that we alledge against them in our behalf, the very prime Pillars of their pretended Church, as <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Calvin, Jewell, Whitaker,</hi> and the
<pb facs="tcp:102135:4"/>
like, and that not onely in matters of indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, but of the very substance of Faith. Thirdly, that <hi>Doctor Pierce</hi> knowing, that we for our belief rest onely upon the Churches definition, or interpretation of <hi>Scripture,</hi> as an infallible ground, and not upon this or that Schooleman, Historian, or Grammari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans speeches, yet he hath wearied his sides in declaiming against us upon the fancied credit of a few private mens words, which were they truly cited, would weigh nothing with us to the main cause of Religion. Finally, I professe, my intent in this short work, to be, not so much a proof of our Catholick <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,</hi> as to shew the unconvincivg weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the <hi>Preacher's Arguments,</hi> which he mistakes for Demonstrations.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ive me leave in the first place to tell you, that your application of our Saviours words: <hi>From the beginning it was not so,</hi> is no less confus'd, then unconclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Confus'd; as speaking in generall of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and not distinguishing what beginning, whether of time, order, institution, or what. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concluding; because it either overshoots, or falls short of the marke, proving too much, or nothing at all. For neither were all truths revealed, or all good practises in use from the beginning: nor all heresies, or corruptions, since the beginning.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You say <hi>our Saviour was sent to reform the Iewes:</hi> that is, not to found a new Law, but to renew the old; and that <hi>he made known the rule of his reformation: From the beginning it was not so.</hi> Well then; if you take the beginning from the birth of the World, as in Marriage, then the whole <hi>Leviticus</hi> will be either superstition, or profana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for, <hi>from the beginning it was not so.</hi> The Devils denying God's veracity: <hi>You shall not die:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Genes. 3.</note>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:102135:5"/>
and <hi>Adam</hi>'s eating the forbidden fruit, or <hi>Cain</hi>'s <note place="margin">Genes. 4.</note> murdering his Brother <hi>Abel,</hi> was not heresie, or corruption, for, <hi>from the beginning it was so.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. If the rule begin with the Law it self, why should the adoring of the Golden Calf be supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, since 'tis as old as the self same Law? why all that follow'd? as <hi>David</hi>'s Psalmes and Musick; the adding seven dayes to the Passeover by King <hi>Ez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            </p>
            <p n="4">4. If to reform Christian Churches you set up your <hi>Pharos</hi> with the precise beginning of the new Law; then (since nothing with you in point of Religion was from the beginning, but what is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest in the Written word) the leaving to abstain from blood, and strangled things, commanded by the Apostles, as necessary: the use of the Crosse in Baptisme; the change of the Sabbath into Sunday; the Baptisme of Infants; the non-Rebaptization of Hereticks; the verball pronouncing the words in the form of Baptisme, as necessary to the validity of the Sacrament; the Degrees and Titles of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Deanes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will be superstition, errour, and profanation, for <hi>from the beginning it was not so.</hi> Then on the contrary, the <hi>Saduces, Cerinthians, Nicolaits, Ebionits,</hi> will not be Hereticks, (because they were from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning:) nay, nor the <hi>Papists</hi> neither, if as some

               </note> you strike first, knowing the blow to be unavoidable from us: that Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants chop up so many errours, because they first devour this, that, notwithstanding all Christs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102135:7"/>
the infallibility of the Apostles, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of that gift to preserve her from errours; yet the whole Church of Christ even in her greatest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives can erre. Thirdly, you assert without ground that the <hi>point of Infallibility is an old Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of a new Creed.</hi> Sir, there is no such Creed extant in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. A profession of Faith, I admit, was appointed in a <hi>Bull</hi> by <hi>Pius quartus</hi> to be sworn to by Pastours of Souls, and Professours of Learning only: But if that be a new Creed, much more will your thirty nine Articles make up a new Creed, stuft with so many modern negatives, and unto which not all, but some amongst you, were by your Statutes to subscribe. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever: In your S. article you receive and believe 3. Creeds; the Apostles Creed, <hi>Nice</hi> Creed, and that of S. <hi>Athanasius.</hi> Now I ask: these two last, are they new Creeds, or no? if new ones, then the Church has power to make new Creeds; if not, why should the Churches Declarations be call'd new Creeds rather now, then in those former times? Fourthly, you assert quite <hi>gratis;</hi> that <hi>in the Council of Trent the Roman Partisans were not afraid to make new Articles of Faith.</hi> As if to declare explicitely to the faithful such verities, as are contain'd implicitely or virtually in the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word of God, or what traditionary Doctrines are truely Divine, coming down from the Apostles by never interrupted succession of practice and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, were to make new Articles of Faith? Did the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> make new Articles of Faith, when it declared the Celebration of <hi>Easter,</hi> or the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102135:7"/>
of <hi>Baptisme</hi> ministred by <hi>Heretiques,</hi> or the consubstantiality of the Sonne with the Father? what the Council of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and St. <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius</hi> adde in their Creeds by way of declaration to the Apostles Creed, doth it speak new Articles of Faith? There was a time when some Canonical Books were not <hi>de fide obligante</hi> of necessary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, as the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and that of St. <hi>Iames,</hi> &amp;c. are they now after the Churches ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, new Articles of Faith? And yet be those justly anathematized, who deny any one of the aforesaid points so declared? Why then might not the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> upon occasion of emergent heresies, declare anew, what was to be held about the Sacrifice of the <hi>Mass, Purgatory, Invocation</hi> of Saints, Worship of <hi>Images,</hi> and the like? and yet no more <hi>in contempt of the Apostles denuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Gal. 1. 8. then the definitions of former Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils? When did the Church forfeit the power of defining? St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>anathema</hi> strikes at you <hi>Protestants,</hi> who adde your negative articles contrary to the word of God; not at the Church which declares, what is truly revealed in it.</p>
            <p n="9">9. What you say here about the time when the denial of Marriage to Priests began: of the date of <hi>Transubstantiation, halfe-Communion, publick prayer in an unknown tongue, and the Popes Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,</hi> shall be answered in your demonstratons.</p>
            <p n="10">10. You abuse very disingenuously the learned Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> in saying, first, that he boasted of the antiquity of <hi>Purgatory:</hi> where as in the places you quote, there is not a syllable of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102135:8"/>
that humour; only this modest expression, <hi>We do not find the beginning of this doctrine: but all the Ancients both Greek and Latine from the very time of the Apostles, constantly taught that there is a Purgatory.</hi> Secondly, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> could not give an older instance then <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian;</hi> a most palpable untruth: for <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his tenth Chapter, cited by your self, expressely alledges, for <hi>Purgatory,</hi> S. <hi>Clement</hi> the <hi>Roman,</hi> and S. <hi>Dennis,</hi> both Coetaneans to the Apos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Perhaps because these two were never noted of errour, you skipt them over to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten upon <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> thinking to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit their authority by advancing their lapses. But, sweet sir, have <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited their credit since the conference of Divines at <hi>Hampton Court</hi> before King <hi>Iames?</hi> there Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> scrupling at the use of the <hi>Crosse,</hi> the Dean of <hi>Westminster,</hi> saith <hi>Baker, shewed out of Tertullian, Cyprian, Origen, and others, that in</hi>

               <hi>their time it was used: And this the King judged antiquity enough to warrant the continuance of it still.</hi> Was <hi>Tertullian</hi> no <hi>Montanist,</hi> when in your third Page he is cited to your purpose; and is he one now in your eight Page, when <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> cites him to ours: nay, and shall be Orthodox again in your thirty one page, when he is fancied to make against us? Is <hi>Origen</hi> in your eighth page not onely an Heretick, but an Arch-Heretick, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102135:8"/>
therefore of no authority, when he is brought by <hi>Bellarmin</hi> for Purgatory? but will be Orthodox a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, when in your 27. page you call for him against prayers in an unknown tongue? Yet this very fetch proves Purgatory the more: for if their Doctrine of Purgatory had been erroneous, or heretical, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Councils, that spared them not for other heresies, would questionlesse have censur'd them for that, which never any one did. Thirdly, that the Cardinal having boasted of all the Ancients, both Greek and Latin, down from the Apostles, could not make it good, but by recourse to the Heathens, as <hi>Plato, Gorgias, Cicero, Virgil;</hi> as if those Heathens were alledged in the same Chapter, as holy Fathers of Christian times, to prove the doctrine of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory from the Apostles, albeit they lived long before the Apostles dayes. Yet not to be taken tripping, in your margin you cite also <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s 2d. Chapter, which nothing concerns either Authorities of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or the age of Purgatory. In this Chapter the Cardinal relating divers errours about Purgatory, alledges S. <hi>Austin,</hi> who in his 31. book of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God, the 13. chap. affirms it to have been the Platonicks opinion, that all punishments after death were but purging pains; and to that effect S. <hi>Austin</hi> cites <hi>Virgil.</hi> To this <hi>Bellarmin</hi> replies, that in <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>'s works, as in his Dialogues intituled <hi>Phaedon &amp; Gorgias,</hi> 3. sorts of men are sentenc'd after death: the first to the <hi>Elysian</hi> Fields; the second, whose sins are curable, to temporary pains: the third, of sins in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable, to eternal. Afterwards in the 11. chapter, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst other proofs drawn from reason, <hi>Bellarmin</hi> sayes, that Purgatory was the sence of all Nations,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102135:9"/>
               <hi>Iewes, Mahometans,</hi> &amp; <hi>Gentils,</hi> both <hi>Philosophers</hi> &amp; <hi>Poets;</hi> and proves it out of the <hi>Macchabees, Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, Plato, Cicero,</hi> &amp; <hi>Virgil.</hi> Finally, to prevent your cavils, he concludes; that things wherein all Nations agree, can hardly spring, but from the light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; whil'st other inventions forged by men, will ever alter, as Nations are divers. In all this discourse, where is there any recourse to Heathens to make up the antiquity of Purgatory from the Apostles? In the margin you bid us see <hi>Bellarmin</hi> contradicted by the Romanists themselves, and then you cite a work of <hi>Polydor Virgil,</hi> corrupted and Printed at <hi>Basil</hi> amongst the Sectaries, and forbidden by the Church. <hi>Roffensis</hi> only intends, that the name and nature of Purgatory was but very seldome mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned amongst the ancientest <hi>Grecians.</hi> But for the thing it self he sayes exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>Purgatory is affirmed by so many both Greek and Latin Fathers, 'tis not likely, but that the truth of it was made clear unto them by some sufficient proof.

sent, and received, or at most his equal.</p>

                  <p>Therefore <hi>S. Peter</hi> was either inferiour to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> or at most his equal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And reason good, for S.

                  <p n="54">54. Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> argues thus against the Title of <hi>Universal Bishop;</hi> if any one were <hi>Universal Bishop:</hi> that is, one immediate Bishop over all Diocesses: so that other Bishops were only his Deputies; there would by consequence be a failing of the universal Church, upon the failing of such √† Bishop; because there would be no true Bishop to govern the Universal Church. <hi>An argument,</hi> say you, <hi>ad homines, not easily to be answered.</hi> Hence is framed this mighty demonstration against the Pope's Headship.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If the Pope is Head of the Catholick Church, then the Catholick Church must be the Body of the Pope; because the Head and the Body are the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative and Correlative, and being such, they are convertible in</hi> obliquo.</p>
                  <p>The Consequence unavoidably following is hugely absurd: to wit, <hi>that when there is no Pope at all, the Catholick Church hath then no Head.</hi> Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What! no Head at all? At least it retaineth an invisible head, which is as much as <hi>Protestants</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Church. It follows only, good Sir, that in the interval, the Church as Universal hath no visible head: a thing nothing strange in Politick Bodies. Elective Princes, as the <hi>German</hi> Emperour, and the King of <hi>Polonia,</hi> be they not in Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment

Heads of their Princedomes. If they de, the Princedome wants a Head till another be chosen. Is this a mystery?

                  <p>Yea, but when there are many Popes, the Church is a monster with many heads. True, if with many Popes acknowledged and accepted of by the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall Church, or declared by a Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, which is impossible. Otherwise in order to the Faithfull, many Popes, no Pope. In the interim 'tis enough for them to stick to their known Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, believing in generall him to be Pope, who is Canonically chosen, without determining any in particular.</p>
                  <p>But what if the Pope be hereticall? hath not the Catholick Church such a Head, which makes her deserve to be beheaded? A dainty conceit! Are not the Bishops of <hi>England</hi> in your opinion the immediate Heads of their respective Diocesses? what if one amongst them should turn <hi>Arian,</hi> would not the crime lie upon the Diocesse, and make her deserve to be beheaded? no doubt, if you may be believed. And to come nearer your example: you once made <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. supreame head of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> If holding the Primacy he had faln into Heresie, durst you have said that the

                  <p>Therefore no Pope is Head of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Nay, <hi>the most zealous and partiall asserters of their Supreamacy,</hi> confesse that Popes have been Hereticks, and Heathens too: either by denying the Godhead of the Son, as <hi>Liberius;</hi> or lifting him above the other two Persons, as <hi>Iohn</hi> the 22. or sacrificing to Idols, as <hi>Marcellinus;</hi> or being rejected by the Church for the crime of Heresie, as <hi>Anastasius</hi> the second.

                  <p n="75">75. When two particular Divines disagree in the manner of explaining a Mystery of Faith, but agree both in the truth and Faith of the Mystery it self: then all those that joyn with them in the belief of the same Mystery, <hi>are made asham'd of their Doctrine.</hi>

                  <p>Therefore all that joyn with them in the belief of the same mystery, as all Romanists doe, are made asham'd of their Doctrine.</p>
                  <p n="76">76. Surely this Demonstration will shame none but the owner of it. A Schollar and not blush to argue so? How many Mysteries doe Christians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,

The <hi>Scotists</hi> hold the Mystery impossible without a certain distinction, which they call <hi>Ex natura rei,</hi> betwixt the Divine essence and the three personalities or Relations.

But in very deed S. <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> differ not about the manner of Christs being in the Sacrament, as you would make your Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours believe. They both agree that Christ is there definitively, all in all, and all in every part of the sacred Hoste: which way of existing S. <hi>Thomas</hi> calls Sacramentall: Their difference is in a philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophicall Question, whether a Body can be in two places at once circumscriptively: that is, with all it's locall dimensions, answering to the extensive parts of the place. S. <hi>Thomas</hi> holds it cannot, as implying a division of the body from it self. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lermine</hi> replies with great respect to S. <hi>Thomas: Haec ratio, pace tanti Doctoris dixerim, non est so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lida.

What is here to shame the Catholicks? Where is <hi>Bellarmine's anger?</hi> Where his <hi>revenge</hi> upon the Angelical Doctor? I see nothing here but your vanity, seeking at the cost of others wrong to purchase applause to your self.</p>
                  <p n="78">78. You seem likewise to be unvers'd in School affairs, seeing that <hi>Bellarmine's</hi> inference in that question, is common to all Schoolmen, that defend the local existence of a body in two places. Had your intent been, to evince the impossibility of the Real Presence from the cross opinions of those two Doctors: you might perhaps have argued thus.</p>
                  <p>According to S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> Christs body cannot be locally in two places at once.</p>
                  <p>But according to <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> if it cannot be locally, it cannot be Sacramentally in two places at once.</p>
                  <p>Therefore according to both, it can neither be locally nor Sacramentally in two places at once: and consequently not at all in many Hostes.</p>

                     </gap>rt it; but not a word of proofe: which to make good, you must demonstrate first, that the Apostle by preferring the gift of prophecy before unknown tongues in the Church, the only intent of that Chapter, speakes of tongues in the publick service, and administration of Sacraments proper to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours;
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:102135:49"/>
and not rather and solely of tongues in mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual conferences, when the first Christians met for edification to communicate with one another their miraculous gifts, as inspired Canticles, Prophecies, Tongues, and other graces imparted above Nature, both to men and women in those dayes. In which assemblies the <hi>Corinthians</hi> seem to have committed some disorders, turning Gods gifts, especially that of tongues, which was the least, to pride and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. But in the <hi>Liturgy</hi> or <hi>Publick Service,</hi> which amongst the <hi>Corinthians</hi> was in <hi>Greek,</hi> there was no abuse at all, nor occasion to complain. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, you must demonstrate, that the Apostle means every kind of tongue unknown to the vulgar, though known to most of the better sort. For if so, he would have contradicted himself by writing in <hi>Greek</hi> to the <hi>Romans</hi> a long Epistle of Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. As therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> cannot be rightly said to have spoken to the <hi>Romans</hi> in an unknown Tongue, because <hi>Greek</hi> was known to most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons well bred, though not to the common people: So for the same reason is not our <hi>Latin</hi> an unknown Tongue in the sense of the Apostle. Thirdly, you must demonstrate that the Apostle speaks even of Tongues that may be learn'd by industry, and not of Tongues divinely inspired, which neither the Pastours of the Church, nor the people, nay nor the Speaker himself did understand. And so St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith in that Chapter, <hi>He that speaks Tongues, speaks not to men, but to God.</hi> And again, <hi>He that speaks Tongues, let him pray, that he may interpret.</hi> Why pray for the gift of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:102135:49"/>
if he understood the Tongues? for so he might of himself interpret by the help of his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Language. And again: <hi>If I pray with the Tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is without fruit:</hi> namely, the Spirit that is in me maketh me to pray; but my understanding, not knowing what is said, remaines fruitlesse. Now that the Apostle did not wholly dislike the speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of unknown Tongues in the Church, but onely preferre the gift of Prophecy (to wit of expounding hard points of Religion) before it; he co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p n="100">100.

Otherwise no man wifelesse could be made Bishop, without disobeying the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles command, or counsel. Yet the words by their tenour sound a precept; but of what? that a Bishop may be a husband of one wife? that's a permission never dream't of by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> not a precept. Is it then, that he must not have, or have had two wives together? that's a Law common to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.

Therefore Priests may have wives, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary was not from the beginning. Nay, according to S. <hi>Paul, 1 Tim. 4. 3.

133. Now, Sir, by what hath hitherto been said, you may peradventure have seen, if passion, interest, or self-conceit doe not blinde you, that you neither spoak like a Preacher, nor demonstrated like a Schollar. 'Tis the office of a Preacher, to teach, move, and delight: to teach sacred verities: move to holinesse of life, and delight with the fair descriptions of Christian duties and rewards. You taught indeed, but what? Falsities and Errours: you sent not a word to the heart, nor moved to ought but hatred of truth, and persecution of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents: at least you endeavoured it. If you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted any, 'twas very likely your self, or such as love vanity, and seek lyes, not your best and wisest Auditours.</p>
                  <p>As to your demonstrative faculty, I appeale to any unpartiall judge, whether a few scraps, or texts of Scripture, torn from their Context, taken upon the credit of the bare Letter, devested of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, wrackt, and wrested to the sense of every wilde fancy, can ever aspire to rigorous evidence, the sole essence of demonstration. Much lesse then, a heap of quotations, some falsifi'd, others of open enemies, or suspected friends, none at all precisely to the matter in question. Wherefore 'twas great weaknesse in you, if not worse then weaknesse, first to boast of demonstrations against us in your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and then to cover the shame of your non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>performance, tell your Reader in the Dedicatory, that your marginal citations are the <hi>evidence and warrant of all the rest:</hi> And why? because for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth,

As if <hi>Polydor Virgil,</hi> and <hi>Erasmus,</hi> two Grammarians, <hi>Thuanus</hi> a Lawyer, <hi>Cassander</hi> a prohibited Authour, and such like Riffe-Raffe, were the stoutest Champions of Gods Church. But let us suppose they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of the ablest Pens, do's the Catholick Faith depend upon single mens opinions? Are Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks obliged upon their honour to defend every particular Doctor's abberrations? Cannot we be safe in Conscience, if we stand immoveably to the Scriptures expounded by the Church, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinitions of Generall Councils, as the infallible rule of our Faith, but we must of necessity allow of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry private man's sayings? If so, then think, in what a pittifull case you are, by declaiming against the Novelties of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, for the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of whose Doctrines, a world of prime Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Writers apologize in the <hi>Protestants Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy.</hi> And truly, you that acknowledge no pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick infallible authority to decide matters of Faith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

this judgement he still persevered even after his return to Protestants. For answering his own motives, he retracts it not, but sayes onely that, <hi>Iliacos intra muros peccatur &amp; extra: Papists are more guilty of this fault then Protestants.</hi> We approve as just, his imputation of falsity and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny laid upon Protestants, but deny his parity as most false, till it be proved.</p>
                  <p>Now, for a farewell, tell me in good earnest, for the Novelty of what point of our Faith have you quoted truly any one of our ablest <hi>Hyperaspistae,</hi> as you arepleas'd to call them? In what leafe, page, line or margin may we find him? you confesse, pag. 31. that Corruptions in point of practice cannot justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a separation. Well then, amongst the eleven points you object as Novelties, let us set aside the Celibacy of the Clergy, the Communion under one kind, the Scriptures and publick Service in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Tongue: for these concern practice, and are dispensible by the Church. There remain eight other Doctrines of Faith: direct me now to one approved Catholick Authour cited in your Sermon, clearly testifying, that the <hi>Pope's Supreamacy,</hi> the <hi>Churche's Infallibility, Transubstantiation, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Masse, Purgatory, Worship of Images, Invocation of Saints,</hi> and the lawfulnesse of a <hi>Tempory Divorce</hi> for other causes besides <hi>Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> are all, or any of them, really and truly in their own notions abstracting from the words they are signified by, a meer Novelty, and not revealed from the beginning. This I am sure you can never doe. But if you could, that mans, or mens autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:102135:64"/>
must by your own confession be <hi>the evidence and warrant of all the rest:</hi> that is, of what ever you assert in your whole Sermon.</p>
                  <p>This then supposed, can you possibly perswade any rationall man, that the particular authority of one, or more private Doctors, how able soever, is a rigorous evidence, convincing the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Church of errour in Faith, and such an evidence, as will in the eyes of God and Man justifie a Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from that Mother Church, though thousands of others no less able assert and believe the contrary?
