            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  </gap>yd</hi> and Party, have endeavoured to caſt a Miſt before the People to make them believe, That there is no difference in Doctrine betwixt them and <hi>George Keith.</hi> But on the 11th of the 10th Month, 1692. being the firſt Day of the Week, in the Publick Meeting at <hi>Philadelphia</hi> before ſeveral Hundred People, <hi>John Delavall</hi> ſilenced that pretence, by accusing me <hi>of being guilty of Works of the Fleſh, in two particulars,</hi> viz. <hi>Hereſie and Hatred;</hi> using this as an Argument why I ſhould not be heard, but my Miniſtry ſtopt and denyed: The Hereſie whereof he accuſed was, <hi>That I have been heard to affirm, That the Light within is not ſufficient to Salvation without ſomething elſe.</hi> This he undertook to prove to be a <hi>Hereſie,</hi> but not from any one place of Scripture, but from Friends Books, and particularly from a paſſage in <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s part of the Book called, <hi>The Christian Quaker,</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>The Talent is in it ſelf ſufficient.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next, he undertook to prove me guilty of <hi>Hatred,</hi> becauſe, as he ſaid, <hi>I had revi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed Friends, and falſly accuſed them in divers things.</hi> But did not prove his Charge in any one particular.</p>
            <p>And the ſaid <hi>John Delavall</hi> hath divers times accuſed me in publick Meeting, <hi>That he would prove me to be no</hi> Quaker, <hi>both from my own Books and the Books of Friends.</hi> To which I replyed, That to prove me to be guilty of <hi>Hereſie,</hi> and to be no <hi>Quaker,</hi> he ought firſt to begin with the Scripture, and prove me guilty of Hereſie from the Scripture, and then let him proceed to prove it from my own and Friends Books.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sam. Jenings</hi> replyed in the publick Meeting, <hi>We are not to prove it from Scripture, but from Books Friends; for the Queſtion betwixt us and</hi> G. K. <hi>is not, who is the beſt</hi> Chriſtian, <hi>but who is the beſt</hi> Quaker.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:95819:3"/>
               <hi>G. K.</hi> anſwered, If I am a good <hi>Chriſtian</hi> I am a good <hi>Quaker,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Quakers</hi> own themſelves to be nothing elſe but true <hi>Christians.</hi> And alſo ſeeing, that we profeſs to own the Scriptures, and prefer them to all other Writings, ye ought to begin with the Scriptures, and from them prove me to be guilty of Hereſie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Delavall</hi> did further accuſe me, <hi>That my Hereſie and Error was in a Fundamental Doctrine of the</hi> Quakers, <hi>in ſaying, The Light within is not ſufficient without ſomething elſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>G. K.</hi> anſwered, I am glad to find the Controverſie at laſt come to this plain iſſue, that ye and we differ in Doctrine, which ye would not acknowledge publickly before, but generally ſaid, ye had nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my Doctrine, but againſt my Paſſion, &amp;c. But now it plainly appeareth, that ye have againſt my Doctrine, and that ye and I differ <hi>Fundamentally.</hi> But however, <hi>John Delavall</hi> hath not proved it from any Friends Books, that I am guilty of Hereſie; for tho' <hi>William Penn</hi> ſaith in the <hi>Coriſtian Quaker, That the Talent or Light within is ſufficient in it ſelf to Salvation,</hi> yet he doth not ſay, it is ſufficient without the Man Chriſt Jeſus, and what he did and ſuffered for us on Earth, and without his preſent Interceſſion and Mediation for us in Heaven, which is that ſomething elſe that I have affirmed to be neceſſary to our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, together with the Light within, as one entire cauſe of our Salvation; and I can and dare appeal to <hi>William Penn</hi> in the caſe, who I hope is a living man, Whether his words bear any ſuch ſence, as J. D. would impoſe upon them, to prove me guilty of Hereſie in a Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Doctrine of the <hi>Quakers?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for his Charge of <hi>Hatred,</hi> I told them, That it was no sin nor evil to hate mens Errors and Hypocriſie, and to bear a zealou. Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt them; nor is it any Reviling to uſe ſharp words of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof againſt the Guilty, unleſs ye will prove that I have falſly accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you in any thing, which ye can never do, tho' they have falſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed me, as I can prove; and therefore both the <hi>Hereſie</hi> and <hi>Hatred</hi> lyeth at your door. And ye have not been ſhort in giving hard words againſt me, but have far exceeded me, as can well be proved.</p>
            <p>It may be further obſerved, that ſeveral firſt Days one after another <hi>John Delavall</hi> brought to the publick Meeting his Pocket full of Books, interrupting me in my Teſtimony, and read paſſages out of the ſame, pretending he would prove by my own Books, that I contradicted my former Doctrine. To which I have anſwered, That it was an act of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95819:3"/>
incivility that both <hi>J. Delavall</hi> and his Brethren were guilty of, (as well as a Breach of the chief Fundamental Law of this Province, that requireth, That no man be diſturbed in the practice of his Religion, tho' of a differing Perſwaſion, if he profeſs to believe in Almighty God) for them firſt to leave us, and then again to come in upon us, and in ſuch a rude manner to interrupt and oppoſe me in my peaceable Teſtimony (ſometimes crying out, We have heard an old Prieſt handle ſuch a ſubject better than thou does; other times, Who does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this? what need thou preach this to us? And then again at other times, many of them at once calling out, This is airy Doctrine <hi>George,</hi> this is not according to antient Friends.) though I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted none of them, nor intend to do; but on the contrary we ſent a propoſal to their Monthly Meeting, for them and us-to confer about it, and ſee if we could accomodate the matter ſo as to prevent ſo great Confuſion; and all the anſwer we could get, was, <hi>That the Spirit of the Lord could not be limitted;</hi> thereby making the Spirit of God the Author of ſo great Confuſion as hath happened amongſt us, that a Perſon of Note, living in <hi>New-York</hi> Province coming into the Meeting, compared it to a Bull-baiting.</p>
            <p>And I then told them further, That ſeeing <hi>John Delavall</hi> did proffer to prove me to contradict my former Doctrine, and to be no <hi>Quaker,</hi> I was moſt willing, and did deſire that a day might be appointed for a Publick Diſpute, wherein he might have opportunity to prove his Charge, if he could. To which <hi>John Delavall</hi> poſitively aſſented, without any reſervation, reſtriction, or proviſo; but ſometime after being put in mind of it by me, in a Letter to him, he declined it, by making excuſe, that he would diſpute with me in publick, providing he had the conſent of his Brethren. And on a Firſt Day, ſome time after I preſſing <hi>J. D.</hi> to perform his Promiſe, <hi>Thomas Lloyd</hi> ſaid, He would not permit a publick Diſpute, leſt it ſhould occaſion a Tumult. But let the impartial Reader judge, whether this was not a meer Evaſion, ſeeing they ſo conſtantly on a firſt day made Interruptions and Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions to me and my Teſtimony, which cauſed greater Confuſion than ever was like to happen at a Diſpute.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſeeing that they declined a Diſpute, to prove their Charge, I writ a few lines to <hi>J. Delavall,</hi> That whereas he had charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to be guilty of Hereſie and Hatred, deſired him to make good his Charge againſt me. In anſwer to which he writes a Letter, dated
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95819:4"/>
the 16 of 10 Month, 1692. in which he doth acknowledge (but very mineingly) that he had charged me with <hi>Hereſie</hi> and <hi>Hatred,</hi> and doth poſitively ſay, [This being a Difference in a Fundamental Doctrine] withal promiſing to ſend in writing, what he had to ſay on the firſt head, <hi>viz. That the Light within as not ſufficient without ſomething elſe,</hi> which he calls Hereſie.</p>
            <p>And in another Letter of his, bearing date the 3d of 11 Month, (referring to his Paper he ſent me the 24th of 10 Month,) he ſaith, <q>Wherein I have fully proved thee to differ in a Fundamental Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine from thy former, and other Friends Writings.</q> And further to prove me guilty of Hereſie, in the ſaid Letter, he giveth his ſence of the word <hi>Hereſie,</hi> as intended by him, when mentioned in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Meeting. <q>It is the ſame (ſaith he) as the Fathers (ſo called) defined it: <hi>Hereſie</hi> is a miſ-belief of ſome points of Faith, contrary to the Doctrine univerſally received in the Church.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this his Definition of Hereſie, out of the Fathers (ſo called) as he alledged, I replyed to him, in a Letter bearing date the 2d of 12th Month, That his Definition of <hi>Hereſie</hi> ſeemeth rather to be taken out of ſome <hi>Popiſh Writer,</hi> than any approved antient Fathers (ſo called) further adding, That the beſt way to know what Hereſie is, is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine it by the Spirit of Truth within, and the Teſtimony of the Scripture without, and to lay moſt weight on theſe two. But what hath been the univerſal Teſtimony of the Church in all Ages, or what it is at preſent, is far more hard and difficult in many things to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and too tedious to enquire into. But however, I doubt not but I have more the Conſent of the Univerſal Church for me, than againſt me, in this particular.</p>
            <p>And in his ſaid Paper, bearing date 24 of 10 Mo. 92. wherein he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, That he hath fully proved me to differ in a Fundamental Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine from my former and other Friends Writings, he ſpendeth moſt of his Paper, containing about a Sheet and a half in Writing, citing particular Teſtimonies out of mine and other Friends printed Books, and Particularly my Book of <hi>Univerſal Grace,</hi> pag. 7, 3, 4, 18, 56, 83, 94. and G. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>'s</hi> Book, called, <hi>The Myſtery of the great Whore,</hi> Epiſt to the Reader, by <hi>E. B.</hi> &amp; p. 19, 20, 21. and <hi>W.

            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:95819:4"/>
To this I replyed in two Sheets of Writing, in a very Friendly way, in complyance with <hi>J. D</hi>'s expectation, having ſaid in his Paper, <hi>That he expected my Friendly Reply,</hi> wherein I tell him, that I have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently read over again and again all theſe Teſtimonies collected by him, out of mine and other Friends Books, and have diligently weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bd and conſidered them, and find not the leaſt inconſiſtency with them, and my late or preſent Doctrine, either in print or by word of mouth, nor with the Aſſertions he draweth from them, rightly underſtood; As <hi>1st,</hi> That this Light wherewithal every man is enlightened with, is Chriſt Jeſus; <hi>2dly,</hi> That it is the very Grace of the Goſpel, and Object of the Faith thereof <hi>(viz.</hi> chiefly, as with reſpect to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Miniſtration thereof, the which lyeth hid within the firſt) <hi>3dly,</hi> That by Belief in the Light, and Obedience thereunto, Salvation is obtained. And I further ſaid, As I can freely appeal to ſuch of them as are alive in the Body, whether their ſenſe of their words bear <hi>J. D</hi>'s Conſtruction, ſo I can ſincerely ſay, it is a groſs miſtake of his, the Conſtruction he puts upon my words, cited by him out of my ſaid Book of <hi>Univerſal Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for a Proof that <hi>John Delavall</hi> had put a wrong Conſtruction upon my words, as if my preſent Aſſertion, <hi>(viz. That the Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is not ſufficient without the Man Chriſt Jeſus, and his Death and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and Mediation, &amp;c.</hi> which is that ſomething elſe (as <hi>J.

And becauſe the ſaid places to which I have referred for my Vindication, are ſo plain and evident. I earneſtly recommend them to the Reader to weigh and conſider at their full length, and only ſhall give a hint of things therein contained at preſent, for brevity's ſake. In the 3d perticular of the firſt part, <hi>I</hi> treat largely of the <hi>Two inward Ministrations</hi> of the Light within, <hi>viz Law</hi> and <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and that both in <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> univerſally, and how the Goſpel lay hid within the Law, as within a Vail, even as the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies was within the outward Court But this Diſtinction given by me of the <hi>Two inward Miniſtrations</hi> of the Light, as laid down in my ſaid Book that hath been in print about 22 Years paſt, J. D. accuſeth as a <hi>Novelty,</hi> as alſo my other Diſtinction of <hi>Salvation begun</hi> and <hi>perfected,</hi> according to the firſt and ſucceeding
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95819:5"/>
meaſures of more Light and Grace, further to be given, ſufficiently hinted at, <hi>N.</hi> 6. 1 <hi>part</hi> of ſaid Book. And in the anſwer to <hi>Obje.</hi> 25. of ſaid Book, I am ſo far from aſſerting the ſufficiency of the Light within, ſo as to exclude the Man Chriſt, and the benefit of his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Coming, Obedience, Death and Sufferings from having a part in our Salvation (together with the Light within) that I do expreſly joyn them together, plainly affirming, That they are both ſufficient and uſeful and neceſſary in their own kind and way, conſummating, and being conſummated in one another. It can hardly be conſtrued to be inadvertency in J. D. but rather a winfull &amp; deliberate Omiſſion in him, thus to paſs by what made ſo clearly to vidicate me, in my ſaid Book, that ſo he might ſeem to have ſome Colour to pervert my words to a contrary ſence from what was ever intended by me.</p>
            <p>And whereas J. D. hath ſaid in his Paper, <hi>That he doth friendly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat me, not to put a wrong Conſtruction on his words, for accuſing me of Hereſie, as <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> he and his Brethren did exclude the Man Christ Jeſus from having any part in our Salvation;</hi> and doth oft earneſtly affirm, both in his firſt and ſecond Paper, <hi>That neither he nor his Brethren exclude the Man-Chriſt from having a part in our Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I did anſwer, in my firſt Paper, That ſeeing he doth blame my Aſſertion, as being a Hereſie, That the Light within is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to Salvation without ſomething elſe, he muſt needs hold the Antitheſis, or Contradictory, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Light within is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent without any thing elſe, that is to ſay, in other equivolent Terms, without any thing <hi>[beſide] [more]</hi> or <hi>[other]</hi> as the Engliſh Particle <hi>[Elſe]</hi> doth ſignifie: but this Aſſertion excludes wholly the Perſon of Chriſt, both the body, and Fullneſs of Light, Grace and Truth that dwelleth in him, and his Death and Sufferings, &amp;c. all which are ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what elſe, <hi>i. e</hi> ſome-what other, or beſide, or more, than the meaſure of Light in us, tho' Chriſt within and without is ſtill but one Chriſt. And I did inform or put him in mind, that Contradictory Propoſitions lie not betwixt two Particulars, as ſome and ſome, but betwixt one Particular and the other Univerſal, the one affirming and the other denying. And therefore for J. D. to ſay, The Light within is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient without ſome-what elſe, is no Contradiction, for the Light within is ſufficient without Thouſands of ſome things elſe, but yet not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any or every thing elſe, for then it would exclude the Man Chriſt, and his Death and Sufferings, from having any part in our Salvation.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95819:5"/>
I further told him, That it could not be ſaid, that the Man Chriſt was the Light in us, otherwiſe than by a figurative Speech of a <hi>Synecdoche</hi> or <hi>Netonyme</hi> or <hi>Allegory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas <hi>John Delavall</hi> did mainly blame my Aſſertion, <hi>That the Light within is not ſufficient without ſomething elſe, i. e.</hi> the Man Chriſt Jeſus, 1ſt. Becauſe I ſaid in my Book of Univerſal Grate, <hi>That the Light</hi> (viz. within) <hi>is the immediate Object of the Christian Faith: 2dly,</hi> That I ſaid, <hi>It is inſeperable from God and Chriſt, as the Beams of the Sun are inſeperable from the Sun.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I replyed, That I did not ſay, the Light within is the <hi>[Only]</hi> Object; and tho' the Light within, and the Man Chriſt without, and the Fullneſs of Light that dwelleth in him, be inſeperable one from another, yet the one is not the other; for things may be inſeperable, and yet the one not be the other, whereof I gave divers Inſtances, as Faith and Repentance are inſeperable, yet Faith is not Repentance: Remiſſion of Sin and Sanctification are inſeperable, yet Sanctification is not Remiſſion of Sin, but ſome-what elſe; and Chriſts glorified Soul and Body are inſeperable, yet his Body is not his Soul: The Godhead and Manhood of Chriſt are inſeperable, yet the Godhead of Chriſt is not his Manhood: The Meaſure and Fullneſs are inſeperable, yet the Meaſure is not the Fullneſs: The River and Ocean are inſeperable, yet the River is not the Ocean: The Beams and the great Body of the Sun are inſeperable, and yet the Beams are not the great Body of the Sun: Alſo, the glorified Saints in Heaven and Chriſt are inſeperable, yet they are not Chriſt, but Chriſt is ſome-what elſe. Moreover, I told him in my former Paper, that <hi>G. F. E. B.</hi> and <hi>W. P.</hi> do all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh betwixt the Meaſure and Fullneſs in the Teſtimonies men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, withall citing a Paſſage in <hi>T. Ellwood's</hi> Book, called, <hi>The Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Tythes ſhaken,</hi> pag. 238. ſaying, <hi>Nor do the</hi> Quakers <hi>aſcribe Salvation to the following the Light within, but they aſcribe Salvation to Chriſt Jeſus, to whom the Light within leads thoſe that truly follow it.</hi> And he hath another obſervable Paſſage, pag. 240. <hi>If any one expects Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sins by any other way than the Death of Chriſt, he renders the Death of Chriſt uſeleſs.</hi> Thus <hi>T. Ellwood.</hi> And ſurely the Death of Chriſt is ſomething elſe than the Light within. And <hi>W. Penn</hi> in anſ. to <hi>Faldo,</hi> p. 192. ſaith, <hi>The Light within is not God, but of God.</hi> And neither <hi>R. Barclays</hi> words, cited by J. D. nor any others hold forth the ſufficiency of the Light, without the Man Chriſt Jeſus, that ſomething
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95819:6"/>
eiſe that I always affirmed to be concerned in our Salvation, together with the Light within.</p>
            <p>And whereas J. D. in the laſt Leaf his firſt Paper layeth down ſix Heads, which he ſaith, he is willing to controvert with me. To this I replyed, that the four firſt of theſe Heads I will not controvert with him, for they are a part of my Teſtimony, and always owned by me, rightly underſtood; and for the two laſt, I will readily controvert with him, after the Controverſie about the Light is ended.</p>
            <p>And in my firſt Paper I did further inform J. D. That my aſſertion, <hi>viz. That the Light within is not ſufficient without ſomething elſe;</hi> that ſomething elſe being the Man Chriſt Jeſus, and his Obedience, Death and Sufferings, Reſurrection, Aſcention and Mediation for us in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, doth no wiſe infer the Light its being not ſufficient; and for J. D. to think it doth ſo infer, proceedeth from either his great Weakneſs or Inadvertency, not conſidering the Signification of ſuch or the like enunciative Propoſitions, giving divers full Examples, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly he that ſaith, Man is not ſufficient without the Grace of God, to work out his Salvation, doth not deny man to be ſufficient or able to do it, with and by the help of Gods Grace; and therefore, he who ſaith, the Grace of Chriſt or Light within is not ſufficient to ſave us without the Man Chriſt, doth not deny the Grace and Light of Chriſt is ſufficient, together with him. I further ſaying, That as God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely wiſe hath ordained divers concurring Natural Cauſes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce one Natural Effect, all ſubordinate to him, the firſt and higheſt Cauſe; ſo to effect our Salvation he hath ordained divers concurring Cauſes, ſome without us and ſome within us, and every one ſufficient and able in their manner and way of working, to anſwer to the end and effect, all in Harmony together.</p>
            <p>And becauſe J. D. in his former Papers had not ſtated aright the matter of Difference betwixt him and me, as concerning the ſufficiency of the Light within to Salvation, therefore I did ſtate my Perſwaſion concerning the ſufficiency of the Light, and alſo concerning the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures being ſufficient to afford us words whereby to expreſs our Faith in all matters of Chriſtian Doctrine, in twelve ſeveral particulars. To which, as yet, J. D. hath ſent no particular Reply; therefore as to that the matter reſts at preſent. And this is a brief account of the moſt material Paſſages in the firſt Paper that J. D. ſent to me, and in the Reply that I made unto his ſaid firſt Paper.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:95819:6"/>
In anſwer to my firſt Paper, which was writ in a very fair &amp; friendly manner to <hi>John Delavall,</hi> he ſendeth me a ſecond Paper, by way of Reply, containing many bitter Expreſſions, unfriendly Reflections and falſe Accuſations, too tedious here to relate, but which will ſufficiently appear, if the Paper happen to be printed, moſt groſly miſ-applying that place of Scripture to me, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 24. as if I were turned a wicked man; And why? Becauſe of my zealouſly oppoſing his and their Anti-chriſtian Doctrine, and detecting their Hypocriſie, Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Errors, even as Friends in <hi>England</hi> were called wicked men for their oppoſing and detecting the Ignorance, Errors and Hypocriſie of their Oppoſers.</p>
            <p>To my former Reply, that I ſaid, The Light, <hi>(viz.</hi> within) is not the <hi>[Only]</hi> Object of Faith, J. D. doth anſwer, in his ſecond Paper, <hi>That little leſs is affirmed by me, pag.</hi> 6. where I blame our Adverſaries, that they do not hold it <hi>(viz.</hi> the divine Illumination of Chriſt within) to be the <hi>immediate Object of the Chriſtian Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I anſwered, in my 2d Paper, That to ſay the Light within is the <hi>immediate Object of the Christian Faith,</hi> is not to ſay, it is the <hi>Only Object of the Chriſtian Faith,</hi> excluding the Man Chriſt Jeſus, and his Death and Sufferings, Reſurrection, Aſcention, and Mediation for us in Heaven, which are owned generally by Friends, yea, and by J. D. though in Contradiction to himſelf, to be alſo the Objects of our Chriſtian Faith, ſeeing he expreſly granteth, That he and his Brethren do believe in the Man Chriſt Jeſus, and citeth <hi>R. Barclay,</hi> ſaying, <hi>It is damnable Unbelief not to believe theſe things where declared.</hi> ☞ <hi>Note, R. B.</hi> in his printed Letter to <hi>H. Paets,</hi> a <hi>Dutch-man,</hi> doth diſtinguiſh betwixt the <hi>material</hi> and <hi>formal Object</hi> of Faith, granting that Chriſts Death and Sufferings, Reſurrection, Aſcention and Interceſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with other parts of Chriſts Doctrine, are the <hi>material Object of Faith,</hi> but affirming, that the divine Revelation of the Light within is the <hi>formal Object</hi> thereof: And therefore if J. D. were not blinded with Prejudice, he would ſee there is not the leaſt Inconſiſtency here. And tho' the word <hi>Object</hi> is not a Scripture word, yet it is uſed not only by <hi>R. Barclay,</hi> but by <hi>J. Burnet,</hi> ſee his Collection, printed 1691. in his Anſwer to <hi>Ja. Barry,</hi> pag. 212. where he ſays expreſly, <hi>Therefore we expect he ſhould inform in what Goſpel he hath to preach to them Christ dyed not for, and what Object of Faith he hath to lay down for them to believe in; for Faith must have an Object: Or whether they do not preſs it as a Duty</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:95819:7"/>
               <hi>upon all to believe? and then let us know their Method of Distinction, who preach not the Goſpel to every one; for ſure there can be no Goſpel of Glad Tidings to them Chriſt dyed not for.</hi> Thus <hi>John Burnyeat:</hi> Where it is plain, that he underſtandeth Chriſts dying for all to be the <hi>Object of our Faith,</hi> and a Doctrine of the Goſpel, as well as that he doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly enlighten all, as it was of that Goſpel which <hi>Paul</hi> preached, as it doth plainly appear from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 1, 23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 8, 9. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 23, 24, 25. and many other places. And I put J. D. in mind how at the School-houſe Meeting, about 12 Months paſt, he brought the fore-cited place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 9, 8. in oppoſition to <hi>T. Lloyd,</hi> his Father-in-Law, to prove that it was not ſufficient to Salvation, to believe only in the Light within, but to believe alſo that Chriſt dyed &amp; roſe again; And to this, as to other things, I expect his particular Anſwer.</p>
            <p>And I ſay ſtill, that Chriſts inwardly enlightening all, is a Doctrine of the Goſpel, and the Object of our Faith, as well as that Chriſt dyed for all. But I was ſo far from denying Chriſts coming the Fleſh, and his Death and Sufferings, to be any part of the Object of the Chriſtian Faith, in that Treatiſe of <hi>Univerſal Grace,</hi> cited by J. D. that pag. 92. I particularly mention <hi>Chriſts Coming in the Fleſh, his Miraculous Birth, his Doctrine, Miracles, Sufferings, Death, Reſurrection, Aſcention, &amp;c.</hi> as being things of the Chriſtian Faith and Religion, which the Light within brings us to own; and the ſame upon the matter is confeſſed by J. D. in both his Papers: How then am I guilty of Hereſie, for ſaying the ſame that J. D. ſaith?</p>
            <p>To my ſaying, that J. D. his blaming my Aſſertion, as being Hereſie, (viz. <hi>That the Light within is not ſufficient without ſomething elſe)</hi> doth oblige him to hold the Antitheſis or Contradictory Aſſertion, <hi>That the Light within is ſufficient without any thing elſe.</hi> J. D. Replyeth, <hi>That is but my Conſequence, and none of his words.</hi> To which I replyed, That ſome affirm, they heard him ſay ſo, in ſo many words; but ſuppoſe he did not ſay it, yet ſeeing he hath accuſed me of the former, the neceſſary &amp; unavoidable Conſequence of his words makes it to be his, and to deny this, is to be guilty of the greateſt Trifflig and Non-ſence that ever I knew in any pretending to common Reaſon. His ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous Reflection upon me, as abuſing my School-Craft, as he calls it, I paſs over, not valuing it, being conſcious of my ſincerity, and which I freely leave to the Impartial to judge.</p>
            <p>For a Proof that <hi>W. Penn</hi> layeth not our whole Salvation upon the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95819:7"/>
Light within only, as ſufficient without the Man Chriſt Jeſus, I did cite <hi>W. P.</hi> in anſwer to <hi>J. Faldo,</hi> part 1. pag. 243. <hi>J. Faldo</hi> charging it upon the <hi>Quakers, That they expect to be ſaved by the Light within only. W. P.</hi> anſwers in behalf of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> This is a wicked Suggeſtion againſt us; ſee alſo his following words. And as I ſaid to J. D. in my 2d Paper, Now let the Impartial Reader judge, who hath any thing of common Reaſon, Whether by theſe words <hi>W. Penn</hi> doth not plainly declare his Mind, <hi>That we are not ſaved by the Light within without ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe?</hi> For as the word <hi>Only</hi> is excluſive, ſo are the words <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſomething elſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here let it be noted, that <hi>John Delavall</hi> finding that he could not make good his Charge againſt me, <hi>viz.</hi> his accuſing me of Hereſie for ſaying, <hi>The Light within is not ſufficient without ſomething elſe,</hi> he goeth about (moſt ſillily) to change the ſtate of the Queſtion; for whereas the ſtate of the Queſtion was, <hi>Whether the Light within was ſufficient to Salvation without ſomething elſe,</hi> viz. <hi>without the Man Chriſt Jeſus, and his Death and Sufferings, and preſent Interceſſion for us in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> he goeth about (not ſo ſlyly as ſillily) quite to alter and change it to another Queſtion, altogether different from the former, as <hi>Whether any can be perfectly ſaved &amp; made perfectly happy without all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and faith of the Man Chriſt Jeſus without us, and of his Death and Sufferings, &amp;c?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I have anſwered him in my ſecond Paper, That theſe two are quite differing Queſtions; for if this laſt ſhould be granted, yet it ſtill remaineth, that the Light within only, without the Man Chriſt Jeſus, doth not ſave any; for even many who do not know him, nor believe in him (having ſome meaſure of ſincerity under the firſt Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Light within them) receive the benefit of his Death, and Sufferings, and Mediation (by the general acknowledgment of all that ever I have formerly known of the People called <hi>Quakers)</hi> at leaſt in ſome meaſure to begin a good work in them, as is clear in the caſe of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> before he received the Knowledge and Faith of Chriſt crucified and raiſed again; and therefore, as I have told <hi>J. D.</hi> he will ſooner waſh an <hi>Ethiopian</hi> until he be white, than he can prove me guilty of <hi>Hereſie</hi> or <hi>Error,</hi> for affirming, <hi>The Light is not ſufficient with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſomething elſe,</hi> either according to Scripture or ſound Friends. But to ſay, <hi>The Knowledge and Faith of Christ, both as he is God and Man, and as he dyed for our ſins, and roſe again for our Juſtification, and is our</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:95819:8"/>
               <hi>Mediator in Heaven, even the Man Chriſt Jeſus, is neceſſary to finiſh and perfect the Salvation and Eternal Happineſs of all that ſhall be Eternally ſaved,</hi> This doth no wayes derogate from the ſufficiency of the <hi>Light within,</hi> for the Light within being God and Chriſt, is abundantly ſufficient to reveal this Knowledge and Faith in all them who ſhall be ſaved, and that either without or with means, as God pleaſeth, tho' in Gods ordinary way of working, he maketh uſe of outward means; and therefore if any have not the <hi>Knowledge and Faith of Christ cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,</hi> as outwardly, this doth no more prove, that the <hi>Light is not ſufficient in it ſelf,</hi> than if any have not the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Obedience of the Light inwardly,</hi> doth prove that the Light is not ſufficient; for as J. D. hath confeſſed in his firſt Paper, <hi>Faith and Obedience are the bleſſed Effects produced by the ſufficiency of this Light in all his true Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers;</hi> So that <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> with reſpect to the Light, are not the Cauſe of its Sufficiency, tho' it Then only comes to be ſufficient to us, when we believe in it, and obey it. And thus, what J. D. affirms with reſpect to the <hi>Light within,</hi> I affirm alſo, with reſpect to <hi>the Man Christ without us, as he dyed and roſe again, and is our Interceſſor in Heaven;</hi> for, as not to believe in the Light within, is no argument of its <hi>Inſufficiency,</hi> ſo not to believe in the <hi>Man Christ without us,</hi> is no argument <hi>that the Light within is not ſufficient to mens Salvation uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally,</hi> becauſe the Light within being a real meaſure of the eternal Word, <hi>Christ Jeſus,</hi> can as eaſily reveal the <hi>Faith of the Man Chriſt without, and of his Death and Sufferings, &amp;c.</hi> as it can reveal the <hi>Faith of Chriſt within,</hi> both which J. D. doth acknowledge to be neceſſary to all ſuch to whom it is preached or declared, for their Eternal Salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Delavall</hi>'s ſilly Taunt and Reflection, <hi>That I cauſe him not to ſtaggar by my profound Logick,</hi> (as he terms it) I regard not, furd<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r, (as I told him in my 2d Paper) but to take notice of his ſcoffing Spirit, more like <hi>Iſhmael</hi> than a true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> or <hi>true Minister of Chriſt:</hi> I uſed no profound Logick in the caſe, but one or two of the eaſieſt and plaineſt Rules in that called Logick, belonging to the Rudiments of it, and as I told him, true Reaſon teacheth it, without all Art of Logick; but J. D. in meddling with that he calleth my Logick, hath ſhewed his profound <hi>Ignorance</hi> in common Reaſon.</p>
            <p>His accuſing me of <hi>Pride, Fury and Rage,</hi> I told him, is one of the Unclean Streams that flow from his Unclean Fountain; &amp; ſo I paſs it,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95819:8"/>
with other his ſcurrilous Reflections and falſe Accuſations.</p>
            <p>I alſo told him, his poſitively charging me with that he calleth <hi>my late modelled Doctrine of the Revolutions,</hi> is a baſe and vile Forgery and Calumny, which I have ſufficiently anſwered in my printed Treatiſe, called, <hi>Truth and Innocency, &amp;c.</hi> I never made that (vulgarly) call'd the <hi>Revolutions,</hi> any matter of my <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> and no man living can juſtly ſay, that ever I did: I can defend my <hi>Chriſtian Faith</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>Doctrine of the Revolutions,</hi> as well as all other true <hi>Christians</hi> can, who are of the ſame Faith with me concerning the <hi>Neceſſity of the Knowledge and Faith of Christ crucified, to mens perfect Salvation.</hi> Nor hath the Doctrine of the <hi>two Miniſtrations,</hi> and of <hi>Salvation begun,</hi> and <hi>Salvation perfected,</hi> a dependance on the <hi>Revolutions,</hi> ſo called, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true or falſe; for what hath a dependance on another, is the Effect of that other; but the <hi>two Miniſtrations of the Light within,</hi> and the <hi>Work of our Salvation,</hi> both in its beginning and finiſhing, have no other Cauſe but <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and therefore wholly depend thereupon. And I freely at any time proffer to defend my Perſwaſion and Faith concerning the <hi>Two Miniſtrations,</hi> and <hi>Salvation begun</hi> and <hi>finiſhed,</hi> without running either to the <hi>Papiſt's Purgatory,</hi> or the Hypotheſis of the <hi>Revolutions;</hi> and let <hi>John Delavall</hi> or any of his Aſſociates, try their ſtrength, whether they can drive me, by the force of their Arguments to any ſuch pinch or ſtrait, as he doth baſely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finuate againſt me in his 2d Paper. And his Accuſations in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular do not only ſtrike againſt me, but <hi>G. F. E. B. W. P.</hi> all whom I can prove to hold the diſtinction of <hi>two inward Miniſtrations of the Light,</hi> and <hi>two ſtates of Men,</hi> anſwering thereunto, the firſt of which G. F. calleth, <hi>The ſtate of the first</hi> Adam, <hi>which he was in before he fell,</hi> which he calleth, <hi>A ſtate of danger, where he may fall again, but to come to Chriſts stature, and to him before the World began, who is first and laſt, beginning and ending, ſuch ſhall know a state that will never fall;</hi> ſee his printed Epiſtle, 1666. directed, <hi>To be read in all the Aſſemblies of the Righteous;</hi> and concerning this ſecond ſtate he ſaith further, <hi>Chriſt that never fell is a ſtate beyond</hi> Adam, <hi>and he is to be heard and folowed that never fell, and in him are People to ſit down, who is the Reſt, and Peace, and Life, who destroyeth the Devil and his Works, and maketh an end of Sin; now this being manifeſt and known in all, then the Lamb is known to have the Victory.</hi> And a little after, ſpeaking of this ſecond ſtate, he ſaith, <hi>And here, as you live in the Seed, Chriſt Jeſus, your Election you</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:95819:9"/>
               <hi>know before the World began, and Reprobation ſince the World began.</hi> And theſe two ſtates <hi>W. Penn</hi> plainly diſtinguiſheth in his part of the <hi>Chr. Quaker,</hi> calling the one that of the <hi>Law,</hi> the other that of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> the one that of a <hi>Servant,</hi> the other that of a <hi>Son;</hi> and <hi>E. Burrough</hi> ſaith, pag. 56. of his Works in folio, <hi>The Law muſt have its thorow O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, before the Goſpel be witneſſed.</hi> It is therefore manifeſt that <hi>John Delavall</hi> is greatly Ignorant, as in the holy Scriptures, ſo in the <hi>Quakers</hi> Principles, ſo to fault my Teſtimony concerning the <hi>two Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations,</hi> and <hi>Salvation begun</hi> and <hi>Salvatiom finiſhed,</hi> which <hi>perfect Salvation</hi> (according to G. F.) belongeth only to the ſecond State and Miniſtration.</p>
            <p>And whereas J. D. in his 2d Paper maketh an Eſſay to ſhow, <hi>That Propoſitions may be Inconſiſtent, that are not ſtrictly Contradictory the one to the other,</hi> giving an Inſtance in four Examples. To this I have anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered, That all theſe are Contradictory, being either betwixt <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Particulars,</hi> or ſuch as contain neceſſary matter of Truth and Falſhood, and therefore are ſtrictly Contradictory; but Propoſitions betwixt <hi>Indefinite Particulars,</hi> as <hi>ſome</hi> and <hi>ſome,</hi> are never Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory nor Contrary, nor have the leaſt Inconſiſtency, when the matter of them is not any neceſſary Truth and Falſhood, but are both True, as is the preſent caſe in our Debate; for as it is true, <hi>That the Light within is [Not] ſufficient without ſomething elſe,</hi> that ſomething elſe being the Man Chriſt Jeſus, and his Death and Sufferings, and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for us in Heaven, ſo is it alſo true, <hi>That the Light within [Is] ſufficient without thouſands of ſome other things elſe.</hi> And if <hi>Jo. Delavall</hi> think not himſelf obliged (by the Law of Diſpute) to ſhow the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis</hi> or <hi>strict Contradictory Propoſition</hi> held by him, (which is moſt proper) if he have not renounced all uſe of common Reaſon, he muſt ſhow the Propoſition that is (if not Contradictory) at leaſt contrary or inconſiſtent therewith; but it hath none other than that I mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him in my firſt Paper, viz. <hi>That the Light [is] ſufficient without [Any] thing elſe;</hi> and this he muſt needs hold, unleſs he reſolveth wholly to unman himſelf; for it is the nature of all <hi>Indefinite particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Propoſitions,</hi> that they have no contrary but what is ſtrictly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory, as is our preſent Caſe. And in my 2d Paper I put him in mind of the common Proverb, <hi>Let not the Shoe-maker go beyond his Laſt,</hi> not that I upbraid him with his Ignorance in the Art of Logick, but for his <hi>Pedantick Vanity,</hi> that he would ſeem to know what he is as ignorant of as a Child.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:95819:9"/>
To his ſaying, <hi>We never differed about the meaning of the Particle [Elſe]</hi> I told him, he is groſly diſ-ingenuous; for he knoweth the contrary in his Conſcience; and he may remember, how that not long ago, when I was declaring in the publick Meeting, <hi>That the meaſure of Chriſts Light in us, was not ſufficient without the Fullneſs, that dwells in the Man Christ Jeſus, and the Fullneſs was ſomething more than the Meaſure, Sam. Jenings,</hi> in the publick Meeting interrupted me, moſt uncivilly, as he hath at other times done, (tho' I have never interrupted him, nor any of them) and he cryed out, <hi>Thou ſayest,</hi> George, <hi>the Fullneſſ is ſomething [more] but is it ſomething [elſe?]</hi> To which I anſwered, Yea, it is ſomething elſe; and therefore if <hi>J. Delavall</hi> had any thing of ſhame-facedneſs left in him, he might be aſham'd of his Diſ-ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and diſſimulation in this particular.</p>
            <p>To his blaming me for ſaying, <hi>The Man Christ was the Light in us, was a figurative Speech of Synecdoche, Netonyme or Allegory.</hi> I anſwered him, That ſeeing he blames me for this, according to him, the Man Chriſt is within us, wholly, both Soul and Body, without all figure, with all his Fullneſs; which is as groſs a Doctrine as the <hi>Papists</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Man Chriſt being in the conſecrated Cake. And I told him, that Chriſt, as God, was in us, without a figure, but not as Man, without ſome figure or figurative Speech of <hi>Synecdoche, Netonyme</hi> or <hi>Allegory.</hi> And as to his Citation out of one of my Books, <hi>That where it is ſaid in Scripture, that Rock was Christ, I denyed it to be a Figure;</hi> my ſence is plain, being in oppoſition to them who ſay, <hi>That Rock was not really Christ, but only a Type or Figure of him:</hi> Whereas I affirmed, That Chriſt was really with the Church in the Wilderneſs, and not only Typically &amp; Symbolically or Figuratively; and ſo is Chriſt really now with and in his Church. And he blames me for giving ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the Figure <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> uſed in common Speech, as if <hi>I did apply them to Chriſt in us;</hi> but I made no Application, and yet if I had, the Scripture, I told him, uſeth the like; for what is to be underſtood in Scripture by the Revelation of the <hi>Lords Hand</hi> or <hi>Arm</hi> in us, but the meaſure of his Life? And as in Scriptare, Chriſt is compared to a <hi>Garment that the Saints put on,</hi> and is their <hi>Cloathing from Head to Feet,</hi> ſo he is ſaid to put them on; and <hi>Shoes</hi> in Scripture have a ſpiritual ſignification, as in <hi>Cant.</hi> 7. 1. <hi>How Beautiful are thy Feet with Shoes!</hi> And the Prodigal at his Return to his Fathers Houſe, had <hi>Shoes</hi> put upon him, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 22. And it was the Life of Chriſt that cloathed

the Prodigal at his Return to his Fathers Houſe, from his <hi>Head to his Feet;</hi> and therefore the Scripture uſeth the Figure of <hi>Shoes</hi> in a very high ſence, tho' this is as a ſtrange Doctrine to <hi>John Delavall</hi>'s pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Ignorance, who yet profeſſeth himſelf to be a Maſter in the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of his Ignorant Aſſociates and Hearers, who (belike) is the beſt and ableſt they can find to controvert with G. K. to prove him a Heretick, for his ſound Chriſtian Doctrine, well warranted both by Scripture, and ſound <hi>Quakers,</hi> yea, and all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> every where; for let all Profeſſions in <hi>Christendom</hi> be ſearched, and it will not be found that ever any of them (owned to be true <hi>Chriſtians)</hi> condemned it as an <hi>Hereſie</hi> or <hi>Error,</hi> to ſay, <hi>The Light within is not ſufficient to Salvation without ſomething elſe,</hi> to wit, the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> for as I told J. D. I never knew any hold Salvation by the Light within only, excluding the Man Chriſt Jeſus, but <hi>Jeffery Bullock,</hi> whom <hi>G.

               </gap>. where he ſays, <hi>Thou who ſeeſt not the Conſistency betwixt Salvation by the Light within, and the Man Christ Jeſus, art gone from the Light into Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> and ſo (by <hi>G. W</hi>'s Judgment) are <hi>John Delavall</hi> and his Brethren that call it <hi>Hereſie</hi> to ſay, <hi>The Light within is not ſufficient to Salvation without the Man Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> wherein <hi>John Delavall</hi> and his Apoſtate Brethren fall in with <hi>Jeff. Bullock,</hi> for proof of which ſee the Judgment of their Monthly Meeting at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> that cleareth <hi>T. Fitzwater</hi> and condemneth me, for ſaying, <hi>The Light is not ſufficient without ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe,</hi> which we have cauſed to he printed, with our Anſwer to it. Now I do boldly ſay, theſe men are fallen from the Fundamental Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of the <hi>Quakers</hi> in this very particular, and are guilty of Hereſie themſelves, and yet would lay their Brat (Whore like) at my door, but I return it to him and them.</p>
            <p>And notwithſtanding that <hi>John Delavall</hi> hath made an abſolute and poſitive Appeal to antient Friends in <hi>Old England,</hi> to determine in this caſe, I cannot eaſily be perfwaded, that after they have fully heard the Caſe truly ſtated betwixt J. D. and me, that ever they will approve his Doctrine, but on the contrary, if they hold to their former Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, as I am charitable they do, they will condemn it, and blame his ſo medling, and all them that adhear to him, notwithſtanding of his Fawning and Flattery, whereby he ſeeketh to have their favour for his profeſſed Subjection to their Determination, which if it prove a Contradiction to what he at preſent thinketh is the dictate of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible

Spirit in himſelf, it ſhall be ſeen what manner of Perſon he is, and how unfit to teach others, that is not truly taught himſelf in one of the firſt Principles of the <hi>Chriſtian Doctrine.</hi> And notwithſtanding his fawning to have favour with Friends in <hi>England,</hi> he could not do a worſe thing to render Friends Odious, both in <hi>England,</hi> and every where elſe, to aſſert it as the <hi>Quakers</hi> Principle, <hi>To be a Hereſie and Error in a Fundamental Doctrine, to ſay, The Light within is not ſufficient without ſomething elſe,</hi> that ſomething elſe (as confeſſed by him) being the <hi>Man Christ Jeſus without us, and his Death and Sufferings, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion;</hi> for if the generality of Profeſſors in <hi>Christendom</hi> believe this to be the <hi>Quakers</hi> Doctrine, there cannot be a more miſchievous Stumbling block laid in their way, to hinder People generally fróm joyning in Society with them. Therefore I hope God will put it into the hearts of faithful Friends in <hi>England,</hi> and elſe-where, zealouſly to withſtand this moſt pernicious Anti-chriſtian Doctrine of <hi>J. Delavall</hi> and his Aſſociates, that ſay, <hi>It is a Hereſie to aſſert</hi> (this ſound Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrine) <hi>That the Light within is not ſufficient to ſave men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Man Christ without us;</hi> for if fo, then either there is no Man Chriſt without us, or he is no Saviour to us at all, and hath only the bare and empty Title of a Saviour, to wit, the <hi>Man Jeſus of Nazareth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And tho' J. D. hath again and again aſſerted, <hi>That by his ſo accuſing me, he doth not exclude the Man Chriſt Jeſus in the Outward, from having a part in our Salvation;</hi> yet who can believe him, but he that can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the greateſt Contradiction, which no man ever can do, that has not loſt his common Senſe and Reaſon, and is not become a Brute in Underſtanding. Beſide, if he doth not exclude him from having a part in our Salvation, as neither do I, but include him, then in what part of my Aſſertion lodgeth the <hi>Hereſie,</hi> that he hath charged upon me, for ſaying, <hi>The Light is not ſufficient without ſomething elſe,</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing, that by ſomething elſe, I neither underſtand Humane Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, nor the Letter of the Scripture, nor outward Preaching, as abſolutely and univerſally neceſſary, but the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus?</hi> And as great a Contradiction is it in J. D. to blame me for charging him, <hi>That he holdeth the Meaſure to be ſufficient without the Fullneſs;</hi> for if he holds not this, he muſt needs hold, <hi>That the Light within is not ſufficient without the Fullneſs,</hi> that is ſomething elſe than the meaſure of the Light within, or then he muſt hold two Contradictory Propoſitions to be falſe, as thus,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:95819:11"/>
               <hi>It is falſe to ſay, The Light is [Not] ſufficient without the Fullneſs,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is falſe to ſay, The Light [is] ſufficient without the Fullneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which is an abſolute Contradiction to all common Reaſon of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and I do ſolemnly ſay, that of all the Adverſaries I ever had to do with in Diſpute, I never met with a more Ignorant or more Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Adverſary. And tho in a Letter to me (wherein he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned with ſome others) he falſly chargeth me, <hi>as being either Craſed, &amp;c.</hi> I appeal to all Impartial Readers of common Reaſon, Whether ever they heard or knew a man that ſeemeth more Craſed than he. And to me it ſeemeth a Judgment of God upon him, to be ſo bewildered and confounded in his common Senſe and Reaſon as a man, for daring to oppoſe ſo great a Chriſtian Truth aſſerted by me, a poor Servant of the Lord, and to call it Hereſie, he having ſignally, and more than ordinary appeared but of late to joyn with me in the ſame Teſtimony, as I told him in my former Paper, how by his charging me with He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, he had unminiſtred himſelf. To which he returns not any thing of ſollid Anſwer, but inſtead thereof a ſilly jeſt, not worth mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing And thus the Scripture is fullfilled in him, <hi>Becauſe they received not the Truth in Love, God gave them up to ſtrong Deluſions, to believe Lyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To his ſaying, in his ſecond Paper to me, <hi>My Anſwer, that things which are inſeperable, yet are diſtinct, giveth me no Relief.</hi> I anſwered him, I need no Relief in the Caſe, my Examples were proper and pertinent, as that <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> are inſeperable, and yet we are not ſaved by <hi>Faith</hi> without <hi>Repentance,</hi> which he in his Ignorance la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth to render Ridiculous, by the Addition of his own words, making them a Tautology. But he altogether paſſeth by my Example how <hi>Chriſts Godhead</hi> and <hi>Manhood</hi> are inſeperable; and yet it is moſt congruous and proper to ſay, <hi>The Man Chriſt cannot ſave us without his Godhead,</hi> which Chriſt taught himſelf, expreſly ſaying, <hi>I can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of my ſelf, i. e.</hi> without my Father. Alſo, it doth no more infer that I deny the ſufficiency of the Light within becauſe I ſay it is not ſufficient without the Man Chriſt without us, than it inferreth, that he that ſaith, <hi>John Delavall</hi> is not a Man without his Soul, denyeth J. D. to be a Man; Or, J. D. is not ſufficiently honeſt without honeſt dealing, denyeth J. D. to be ſufficiently honeſt; Or, becauſe <hi>Rich.</hi>

               <hi>Hubberthorn</hi> ſaid, <hi>Chriſt is not Chriſt without God,</hi> that Chriſt is not Chriſt; ſee his Collection, pag. 29.</p>
            <p>As for his other Collections of Teſtimonies out of mine and other Friends Books, in his ſecond Paper, added to theſe in his former, as I ſaid before, I find none of them inconſiſtent with my preſent Doctrine, and if he think they do, I ſhall freely conſent to it, if he pleaſe, that he may expoſe them to the World in Print, or any other Papers he hath ſent me, that ſo Impartial Readers may judge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us.</p>
            <p>To his charging me, with <hi>Gratifying ſome ill affected to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and my Contentious Behaviour in Church and State;</hi> I have anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered him, His Accuſation i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> groſly falſe and malitious, and I reject it as ſuch; I have no way medled with the Government, but have born my faithful Teſtimony to Friends antient Principle, againſt the uſe of outward Weapons. It is no new thing for innocent men to be charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with being Enemies to Government, by men of his and their Spirit and Stamp; ſo were Friends charged in old <hi>England,</hi> at their firſt appearance, and particularly <hi>G. F.</hi> and ſo were the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and elſe-where, by the <hi>Papiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a third Paper I ſent <hi>John Delavall,</hi> in anſwer to his Letter, bearing date the 3d of the 11 Month, I did argue with him at great length, That if becauſe Chriſt without and Chriſt within are inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perably one Chriſt, therefore it may be ſaid (according to him) that it is ſufficient to preach Chriſt within; as he and many of his Brethren argue, and that it is a Hereſie to ſay, <hi>The Light within is not ſufficient without ſomething elſe,</hi> viz. <hi>the Man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> By the ſame Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, It is ſufficient to preach Chriſt without, and it is a Herefie to ſay, <hi>The Man Chriſt is not ſufficient to Salvation without ſomething elſe,</hi> viz. <hi>the Light within.</hi> And therefore by <hi>John Delavall</hi> and his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns way of Argument, all theſe who have only preached Chriſt without, have been in the right, and all Friends who have blamed them, for not preaching Chriſt within, are blame-worthy; Why? Becauſe Chriſt within and Chriſt without are inſeperably one Chriſt. But to this, and many other things in my three Papers, I have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved no Return. And as I have told him, I deſire not further to Diſpute with him thus in private, that is to little purpoſe, but am willing to commit to publick View, partly what is already paſt betwixt us, or what may further paſs, reſerving ſome other weighty
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95819:12"/>
things, I ſent him in my former Anſwer, to another occaſion, as I may have Convenience.</p>
            <p>In the mean time let it be remembred, that he hath not brought one place of Scripture, in all his Papers, whereby to convince me, that I am guilty of Hereſie in the matter he accuſeth me.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing the matter is come to this plain Iſſue, that they have now publickly charged me and my Friends joyned with me, of being <hi>Guilty of Hereſie,</hi> which formerly they did rather whiſper and mutter in Corners, and that it now openly appeareth in the face of the World, that they accuſe that to be Hereſie, which is a Fundamental Doctrine of the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> received, as we can prove, by <hi>Geo Fox, George Whitehead, William Penn,</hi> and the beſt of Friends, as well as by all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the whole World, it evidently appeareth, and moſt neceſſarily followeth, that the Hereſie is theirs, and they are Hereticks, and therefore our Seperation from them is juſt, and is a neceſſary Duty, we having oft admoniſhed them before, in private Conferences and Meetings, the Scripture ſaying, <hi>An Heretick, after the firſt and ſecond Admonition, Reject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus having cleared my ſelf of <hi>Hereſie,</hi> the <hi>Hatred</hi> (no more than the Hereſie (he ſought to fix on me) doth not at all belong to me, and therefore I return both upon him, as his Due, until he Repent, which I can truly ſay, I ſincerely wiſh and deſire.</p>
