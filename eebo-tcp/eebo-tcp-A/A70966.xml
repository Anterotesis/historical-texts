            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A ready was to prevent <hi>Bribery,</hi> and to make good the Prince of <hi>ORANGE</hi>'S Declaration, humbly preſented to the Honorable <hi>Convention.</hi>
            </head>
            <byline>By a Lover of his Country.</byline>
            <p>THE Uſe of the <hi>Balloting-Box</hi> being a ſure way to prevent <hi>Bribery,</hi> and to make every Man give his Vote according to the beſt of his Judgment, becauſe he can get nothing by doing otherwiſe, no Man can ſell his Vote, when it cannot be known how he gives it.</p>
            <p>That this is neceſſary to be conſidered at this time; do but remember what hath been the conſtant practice here in <hi>England</hi> of our Court, City, Country, Weſtminſter-Hall, and Parliament Houſe.</p>
            <p>We will here only ſet down in a few Lines ſomewhat of the practick Part (for it is uſed in ſome Caſes with more nicety than in others) in great Councils of State; we will mention the moſt facil here.</p>
            <p>The Electors being aſſemble in ſome convenient place, as a great Hall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Doors are ſhut up, and the prime Officers who aſſemble or call together the Electors, keep the Keys till the Election be over.</p>
            <p>The chief Officer choſen for that purpoſe, takes the Ballot-Box, and opens it in the view of all the Company, to ſee that it is empty, and without ſecret conveyances; then placeth it on the Table for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe at one end of the Room, and calls ſuch of the Company as ſet next one by one, and gives to each a Ball in the ſight of the People, a little Ball made of fine Linnen, as at <hi>Venice</hi>
               <note>place="inter" n="*" In ſome places they uſe Beans.</note>; he puts it into the Box, either the Affirmative or Negative, and ſo departs to one ſide from the reſt; and then he calls the next, and does the like to him; and ſo of the reſt, till and are called: All who have Voted ſtand on one ſide the Room apart by themſelves till the Voting is over.</p>
            <p>The Box is ſomewhat long, and hath a Partition in the middle, the which hath two Holes to drop the Ball in, which are Taper-wiſe, broader at the top and narrow at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, the Right-hand Hole is for the<note>place="inter" n="†" They may alſo be diſtinguiſh'd by the Colours <hi>Black</hi> and <hi>White.</hi>
               </note> Affirmative, and the Left for the Negative.</p>
            <p>And becauſe that no man ſhall know on which ſide a Man puts his Ball, (who is giving his Vote) there is a place roundiſh made in the Box, to put in the Hand and Arm almoſt half way to the Elbow, ſo as the Hand being in, the Party may let his Ball drop as he pleaſeth.</p>
            <p>When all have done Balloting, the Box is opened, and what is in the Affirmative noted down.</p>
            <p>Then the next Competitor is Balloted for as the former, and ſo of the reſt and he who hath moſt Votes in the Affirmative is elected.</p>
            <p>All very eaſily performed, as in <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> and other Companies and Societies, both here and ſome other Governments, in a ſhort time, without Noiſe, without Tumult, without Animoſities; and the moſt deſerving is always endeavoured to be elected.</p>
