            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Volume II.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>ALcibiades,</hi> as it is ſuppos'd, was anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently <note place="margin">His Family and Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> deſcended from <hi>Euryſaces,</hi> the Son of <hi>Ajax,</hi> by his Fathers ſide, and by his Mothers ſide from <hi>Alcmeon,</hi> for <hi>Dino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nache,</hi> his Mother, was the Daughter of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>acles.</hi> His Father <hi>Clinias,</hi> having fitted out a Gally at his own expence, gained great Honour in a Sea-fight near <hi>Artimiſium,</hi> and was afterwards ſlain in the Battel of <hi>Coronea,</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:35952:5"/>
fighting againſt the <hi>Baeotians. Pericles</hi> and <hi>Ariphron,</hi> the Sons of <hi>Xantippus,</hi> being nearly related to <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> were his Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians. 'Tis ſaid, and not untruely, that the Kindneſs and Friendſhip which <hi>Socrates</hi> ſhewed to him, did very much contribute to his Fame. Hence it is, that tho' we have not an account from any Writer, who was the Mother of <hi>Nicias</hi> or <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> of <hi>Lamachus</hi> or <hi>Phormio,</hi> of <hi>Thraſybulus</hi> or <hi>Theramenes,</hi> notwithſtanding they were all of them Illuſtrious Perſons, and of the ſame Age; yet we know even the Nurſe of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibiades,</hi> that her Countrey was <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and her Name, <hi>Amyclas;</hi> and that <hi>Zopyrus</hi> was his Schoolmaſter; the one being recorded by <hi>Antiſthenes,</hi> and the other by <hi>Plato.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not perhaps material to ſay any thing <note place="margin">His Beauty.</note> of the Beauty of <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> only that it laſted with him in all the Ages of his Life, in his Infancy, in his Youth, and in his Manhood; and thereby rendred him lovely and agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to every one. For it is not univerſal what <hi>Euripides</hi> ſaith, that,
<q>Of all Fair things the Autumn is moſt Fair.</q>
But this happened to <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> amongſt few others, by reaſon of his happy Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and the natural Vigor of his Body. It
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:35952:5"/>
is ſaid, that his Liſping, when he ſpoke, <note place="margin">He liſped.</note> became him well, and gave a Grace to his Pronunciation. <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> takes notice, that he liſped in thoſe Verſes wherein he jeers <hi>Theorus,</hi> becauſe <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> ſpeaking of him, inſtead of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> pronounced <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and ſo called him Flatterer unawares to himſelf. From whence the Poet takes oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to obſerve,
<q>How very luckily he liſp'd the Truth.</q>
                  <hi>Archippus</hi> alſo makes mention of it, thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon the Son of <hi>Alcibiades:</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>His Father he will imitate in all;</l>
                     <l>Like one diſſolv'd in Eaſe and Luxury,</l>
                     <l>His long looſe Robe he ſeems to draw with pain,</l>
                     <l>Careleſly leans his Head, and in his Talk Affects to liſp.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>His Manners were very different, nor is it ſtrange that they varied according to the many and wonderful Viciſſitudes of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
               <p>He was naturally ſubject to great Paſſions, but the moſt prevailing of all was his Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Deſire to be eſteem'd the firſt: <note place="margin">He was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious.</note> which appear'd by ſeveral memorable Things ſpoken by him whilſt he was a Child. Once being hard preſs'd in Wraſtling, and fearing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35952:6"/>
to be thrown, he got the Hand of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who ſtrove with him to his Mouth, and bit it with all his ſorce; his Adverſary loos'd his hold preſently, and ſaid, <hi>Thou biteſt,</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibiades, <hi>like a Woman: No,</hi> replied he, <hi>I bite like a Lion.</hi> Another time as he play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Cockal in the Street, being then but a Boy, a loaded Cart came that way, when it was his Turn to throw; at firſt he requir'd the Driver to ſtay, becauſe he was to caſt in the way over which the Cart was to paſs; but the rude Fellow did not hearken to him, and driving on ſtill, when the reſt of the Boys divided and gave way, <hi>Alcibiades</hi> threw himſelf on his Face before the Cart, and ſtretching himſelf out, bid the Carter drive on, if he would: This ſo ſtartled the Man, that he put back his Horſes, while all that ſaw it were terrified, and crying out, ran to aſſiſt <hi>Alcibiades.</hi> When he began to ſtudy, he obeyed all his other Maſters with great Reſpect, but refuſed to learn upon the Flute, as a ſordid thing, and not becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">He refuſes to learn to play on the Flute.</note> a Gentle man; for he would ſay, To play on the Lute or the Harp, does not diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Poſture of a man's Body, or the Air of his Face; but one is hardly to be known by his moſt intimate Friends, when he play on the Flute. Beſides he who plays on th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> time; but the uſe of the Flute does ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35952:6"/>
the Mouth, that the Voice is intercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and all Speech taken away. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid he, let the <hi>Theban</hi> Youths pipe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they know not how to diſcourſe; but we <hi>Athenians,</hi> (as our Anceſtors have told us,) have <hi>Minerva</hi> for our Patroneſs, and <hi>Apollo</hi> for our Protector, one of which threw away the Flute, and the other ſtripped off his Skin who play'd upon it. Thus between Raillery and good Earneſt, <hi>Alcibiades</hi> not only kept himſelf but others from learning upon that Inſtrument; for it preſently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Talk of the young Gentlemen, that <hi>Alcibiades</hi> with good Reaſon deſpis'd the Art of playing on the Flute, and ridicul'd thoſe who ſtudied it. Whereupon it quickly ceas'd to be reckon'd amongſt the Liberal Arts, and became univerſally exploded.</p>
               <p>It is reported in the Invective which <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi> wrote againſt <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> That once when he was a Boy, he fled to the Houſe of <hi>Democrates,</hi> one of his Lovers, and that <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phron</hi> had determin'd to cauſe Proclamation to be made for him, had not <hi>Pericles</hi> diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him from it, by ſaying, That if he were dead, the Proclaiming of him could only cauſe it to be diſcover'd one day ſooner, and if he were ſafe, it would be a Reproach to him whilſt he liv'd. <hi>Antiphon</hi> does alſo ſay, That in the publick Place of Exerciſes in <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burtius,</hi> he ſlew one of his own Servants with
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35952:7"/>
the blow of a Staff. But it may be unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to give Credit to all that is objected by an Enemy, who makes profeſſion of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to defame him.</p>
               <p>It was manifeſt, that the many Perſons of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>The ground of</hi> Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes<hi>'s love to</hi> Alcibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades.</note> Quality who were continually waiting upon him, and making their Court to him, were ſurpriz'd and captivated by his extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Beauty only. But the Affection which <hi>Socrates</hi> expreſs'd for <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> was a great Evidence of his Vertue and good Diſpoſition, which <hi>Socrates</hi> perceiv'd to appear and ſhine through the Beauty of his Perſon; and fearing leſt his Wealth and Quality, and the great Number both of Strangers and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians,</hi> who flatter'd and careſs'd him, might at laſt corrupt him, he therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to interpoſe, and take care to preſerve ſo hopeful a Plant from periſhing in the Flower, and before its Fruit came to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. For never did Fortune ſurround and encloſe a Man with ſo many of thoſe things which we vulgarly call Goods, whereby to keep him from being touch'd or approach'd, by the free and clear Reaſonings of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, as ſhe did <hi>Alcibiades:</hi> who from the beginning was ſoftned by the Flatteries of thoſe who convers'd with him, and hindred from hearkning to ſuch as would adviſe or inſtruct him. Yet ſuch was the happineſs of his Genius, that he diſcern'd <hi>Socrates</hi> from
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35952:7"/>
the reſt, and admitted him, whilſt he drove <note place="margin">
                     <hi>His Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rente for</hi> Socrates.</note> away the Wealthy and the Noble who made Court to him. And in a little time they grew into a Familiarity; <hi>Alcibiades</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that his Diſcourſes aimed not at any effeminate Pleaſures of Love, nor ſought any thing wanton or diſhoneſt, but laid open to him the Imperfections of his Mind, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd his vain and fooliſh Arrogance.
<q>Then like the Craven Cock he hung his Wings.</q>
Eſteeming theſe Endeavours of <hi>Socrates,</hi> as Means which the Gods made uſe of, for the Inſtruction and Preſervation of Youth. So that he began to think meanly of himſelf, and to admire <hi>Socrates;</hi> to be pleas'd with his Kindneſs, and to ſtand in awe of his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: and unawares to himſelf there was form'd in his Mind an Idea of Love, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of that mutual Affection whereof <hi>Plato</hi> ſpeaks. Inſomuch that all men won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> when they ſaw <hi>Socrates</hi> and him eat together, do their Exerciſes together, and lodge in the ſame Tent, whilſt he was reſerv'd and rough to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who made their Addreſſes to him, and carried himſelf with great Inſolence to ſome <note place="margin">His Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> of them. As in particular to <hi>Anytus</hi> the Son of <hi>Anthemion,</hi> one who was very fond of him, and invited him to an Entertainment which he had prepared for ſome Strangers: <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:35952:8"/>
refuſed the Invitation; but having drank to exceſs at his own Houſe with ſome of his Companions, he went thither to play ſome Frolick; and as he ſtood at the Door of the Room where the Gueſts were treated, and perceiv'd the Tables to be cover'd with Veſſels of Gold and Silver, he commanded his Servants to take away the one half of them, and carry them to his own Houſe; and then diſdaining ſo much as to enter into the Room himſelf, as ſoon as he had done this, he went away. The Company was extreamly offended at the Action, and ſaid He behav'd himſelf rudely and inſolently to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Anytus:</hi> But <hi>Anytus</hi> made Anſwer, That he had uſed him kindly and with great Humanity, in that he left him part, when he might have taken all. He behav'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf after the ſame ſort to all others who cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, except only one Stranger, who (as it is reported) having but a ſmall Eſtate, ſold it all for about a 100 Staters, which he preſented to <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> and beſought him to accept: <hi>Alcibiades</hi> ſmiling and well pleas'd at the thing, invited him to Supper, and after a very kind Entertainment, gave him his Gold again, withall requiring him, not to fail to be preſent the next day, when the publick Revenue was offer'd to Farm, and to out-bid all others. The Man would have excus'd himſelf, becauſe the Farm was ſo
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:35952:8"/>
great, and would be lett for many Talents; but <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> who had at that time a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Picque againſt the old Farmers, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to have him beaten if he refus'd. The next morning the Stranger coming to the Market-place, offer'd a Talent more than the old Rent: The Farmers were enrag'd at him, and conſulting together, call'd upon him to name ſuch as would be Sureties for him, concluding that he could find none. The poor Man being ſtartled at the Propoſal, began to retire; but <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> ſtanding at a diſtance, cryed out to the Magiſtrates, <hi>Set my Name down, he is a Friend of mine, and I will undertake for him.</hi> When the old Farmers heard this, they perceiv'd that all their Contrivance was defeated; for their way was, with the Profits of the preſent year, to pay the Rent of the year preceding; So that not ſeeing any other way to extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate themſelves out of the Difficulty, they began to entreat the Stranger, and offer'd him a Sum of Money. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> would not ſuffer him to accept of leſs than a Talent; but when that was paid down, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to relinquiſh the Bargain, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by this Device reliev'd his neceſſity.</p>
               <p>Tho <hi>Socrates</hi> had many and powerful <note place="margin">Alcibiades <hi>addicted to pleaſure.</hi>
                  </note> Rivals, yet he ſtill prevail'd moſt with <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> by reaſon of the excellency of his natural Parts. His Diſcourſes maſter'd
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:35952:9"/>
him to that degree, as not only to draw Tears from his Eyes, but to change his very Soul. Yet ſometimes he would abandon himſelf to Flatterers, when they propoſed to him varieties of Pleaſure, and would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert <hi>Socrates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> who then would purſue him, as if he had been a fugitive Slave. The truth is, <hi>Alcibiades</hi> deſpis'd all others, and did reverence and ſtand in awe of him alone. And therefore it was that <hi>Cleanthes</hi> ſaid, He had given his Ears to <hi>Socrates,</hi> but to his Rivals, other Parts of his Body, with which <hi>Socrates</hi> would not meddle. For <hi>Alcibiades</hi> was certainly very much addicted to Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and that which <hi>Thucidides</hi> ſays, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Exceſſes in his courſe of Living, gives occaſion to believe ſo. But thoſe who endeavour'd to corrupt <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> took ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage chiefly of his Vanity and Ambition, and thruſt him on to undertake unſeaſonably great things, perſwading him, that as ſoon as he began to concern himſelf in publick Affairs, he would not only obſcure the reſt of the Generals and Stateſmen, but exceed the Authority and the Reputation which <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricles</hi> himſelf had gain'd in <hi>Greece.</hi> But in the ſame manner as Iron which is ſoftned by the Fire, grows hard with the Cold, and all its Parts are clos'd again; ſo as often as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> obſerv'd. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> to be miſled by Luxury or Pride, he reduc'd and corrected
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:35952:9"/>
him by his Diſcourſes, and made him hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and modeſt, by ſhewing him in how many things he was deficient, and how very far from perfection in Vertue.</p>
               <p>When he was paſt his Childhood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he went once to a Grammar School, and ask'd the Maſter for one of <hi>Homer</hi>'s Books; and he making Anſwer, that he had nothing of <hi>Homers, Alcibiades</hi> gave him a Blow with his Fiſt, and went away. Another School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter telling him, that he had <hi>Homer</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by himſelf; <hi>How,</hi> ſaid <hi>Alcibiades, and do you imploy your time in teaching Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to read? You who are able to amend.</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <hi>may well undertake to inſtruct Men.</hi> Being once deſirous to ſpeak with <hi>Pericles,</hi> he went to his Houſe, and was told there, that he was not at leiſure, but buſied in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how to give up his Accompts to the <hi>Athenians; Alcibiades</hi> as he went away, ſaid, <hi>It were better for him to conſider how he might avoid giving up any Accompts at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilſt he was very young, he was a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier <note place="margin">His firſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearng in Arms.</note> in the Expedition againſt <hi>Potidaea,</hi> where <hi>Socrates</hi> lodg'd in the ſame Tent with him, and ſeconded him in all Encounters. Once there happen'd a ſharp skirmiſh, wherein they both behav'd themſelves with much Bravery; but <hi>Alcibiades</hi> receiving a Wound there, <hi>Socrates</hi> threw himſelf before him to defend him, and moſt manifeſtly
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:35952:10"/>
ſav'd him and his Arms from the Enemy, and therefore in all Juſtice might have challeng'd the Prize of Valour. But the Generals appearing earneſt to adjudge, the Honour to <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> becauſe of his Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, <hi>Socrates,</hi> who deſir'd to increaſe his Thirſt after Glory, was the firſt who gave Evidence for him, and preſs'd them to Crown him, and to decree to him the compleat Suit of Armour. Afterwards in the Battel of <hi>Delium,</hi> when the <hi>Athenians</hi> were routed, and <hi>Socrates</hi> with a few others was retrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on Foot, <hi>Alcibiades</hi> who was on Horſe-back obſerving it, would not paſs on, but ſtay'd to ſhelter him from the danger, and brought him ſafe off, tho' the Enemy preſs'd hard upon them, and cut off many of the Party. But this happened ſome time after.</p>
               <p>He gave a Box on the Ear to <hi>Hipponicus,</hi> the Father of <hi>Callias,</hi> whoſe Birth and Wealth made him a Perſon of great Power and Eſteem. And this he did unprovok'd by any Paſſion or Quarrel between them, but only becauſe in a Frolick he had agreed with his Companions to do it. All men were juſtly offended at this Inſolence, when it was known through the City: But early the next Morning <hi>Alcibiades</hi> went to his Houſe, and knock'd at the Door, and being admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, ſtripp'd off his Garment, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting his naked Body, deſir'd him to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:35952:10"/>

Upon this <hi>Hipponicus</hi> forgot all his Reſentment, and not only pardon'd him, but ſoon after gave him his Daughter <hi>Hipparete</hi> in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. <note place="margin">His Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</note> Some ſay, that it was not <hi>Hipponi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> but his Son <hi>Callias,</hi> who gave <hi>Hippa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rete</hi> to <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> together with a Portion of 10 Talents, and that after, when ſhe had a Child, <hi>Alcibiades</hi> forc'd him to give 10 Talents more, upon pretence that ſuch was the Agreement if ſhe brought him any Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And yet after, <hi>Callias</hi> for fear of being aſſaſſinated by him, in a full Aſſembly of the People did declare, that if he ſhould happen to die without Children, <hi>Alcibiades</hi> ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit his Houſe and all his Goods. <hi>Hippa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rete</hi> was a vertuous Lady, and fond of her Husband; but at laſt growing impatient of the injuries done to her Marriage-bed, by his continual entertaining of Curtezans, as well Strangers as <hi>Athenians,</hi> ſhe departed from him, and retir'd to her Brother's Houſe. <note place="margin">His Wife leaves him.</note>

no one all this while daring to oppoſe him, nor to take her from him. And ſhe continu'd with him till her death, which happened not long after, when <hi>Alcibiades</hi> made his Voyage to <hi>Epheſus.</hi> Nor was this Violence to be thought ſo very enormous or unmanly. For the Law, in making her who deſires to be divorc'd, appear in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick, ſeems to deſign to give her Husband an opportunity of diſcourſing with her, and of endeavouring to retain her. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> had a Dog which coſt him 70 Mina, and was a very great one, and very handſom; his Tail, which was his principal Ornament, he caus'd to be cut off; and his Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance childing him for it, and telling him, that all <hi>Athens</hi> was ſorry for the Dog, and cried out upon him for this Action; he laugh'd, and ſaid, <hi>It is then come to paſs as I deſir'd, for I would have the</hi> Athenians <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain themſelves with the Diſcourſe of this, leſt they ſhould be talking ſomething worſe of me.</hi>

               <p>It is ſaid, that the firſt time he came into <note place="margin">The occaſion of his firſt Appearance in Publick.</note> the Aſſembly, was upon occaſion of a Largeſs of Money which he made to the People. This was not done by Deſign, but as he paſs'd along he heard a Shout, and enquiring the Cauſe, and having learn'd that there was a Donative made to the People, he went in amongſt them, and gave Money alſo. The
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:35952:11"/>
Multitude thereupon applauding him, and ſhouting, he was ſotranſported at it, that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got a Quail which he had under his Robe and the Bird being frighted with noiſe, fled from him: Thereupon the People made louder Acclamations than before, and many of them roſe up to purſue the Bird; but one <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> a Pilot, caught it, and reſtor'd it to him, for which he was ever after very dear to <hi>Alcibiades.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He had great Advantages to introduce <note place="margin">Alcibiades <hi>eloquent.</hi>

But above all the reſt, he choſe to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Conſiderable to the People by his Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: That he was a Maſter in the Art of Speaking the Comick Poets bear him witneſs; and <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> the moſt eloquent of men, in his Oration againſt <hi>Midias,</hi> does allow, that <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> among other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, was a moſt exact Orator. And if we give Credit to <hi>Theophraſtus,</hi> who of all Philoſophers was the moſt curious Enquirer, and the moſt faithful Relator, he ſays, that <hi>Alcibiades</hi> was very happy at inventing Things proper to be ſaid upon the Occaſion. Nor did he conſider the Things only which ought to be ſaid, but alſo what Words and what Expreſſions were to be us'd; and when
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:35952:12"/>
thoſe did not readily occur, he would often pauſe in the middle of his Diſcourſe for want of apt words, and would be ſilent and ſtop till he could recollect himſelf, and had conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd what to ſay.</p>

He was lik'd by no body, yet the People made frequent uſe of him, when they had a mind to diſgrace or calumniate any Perſons in Authority. At this time the People by his Perſwaſions were ready to proceed to pronounce the Sentence of ten years Baniſhment, which they called <hi>Oſtraciſm.</hi> This was a way they made uſe of to leſſen and drive out of the City ſuch Citizens, as exceeded the reſt in Credit and Power, therein conſulting their envy rather than their fear.

And it was commonly ſaid in <hi>Greece,</hi> that the War was begun by <hi>Pericles,</hi> and that <hi>Nicias</hi> made an end of it, and therefore as being his Work, this Peace was by moſt men called the <hi>Nician</hi> Peace. <hi>Alcibades</hi> was extreamly troubled at this, and being full of Envy, ſet himſelf to break the League. Firſt therefore obſerving that the <hi>Argives,</hi> as well out of fear as hatred to the <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians,</hi> ſought for protection againſt them, he gave them a ſecret Aſſurance of a

League offenſive and defenſive with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> And tranſacting as well in Perſon as by Letters, with thoſe who had moſt Authority amongſt the People, he encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged them neither to fear the <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians,</hi> nor ſubmit to them, but to betake themſelves to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who, if they would expect but a little while, would repent of the Peace, and ſoon put an end to it. And afterwards when the <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi> had made a League with the <hi>Bae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otians,</hi> and had not delivered up <hi>Panactum</hi> entire, as they ought to have done by the Treaty? but defac'd and ſlighted it, which gave great offence to the People of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, Alcibiades</hi> laid hold of that oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to exaſperate them more highly. He exclaim'd fiercely againſt <hi>Nicias,</hi> and accus'd him of many things, which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed probable enough: As that when he was General, he would not ſeize upon thoſe men who were deſerted by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies Army, and left in the Iſle of <hi>Spha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteria;</hi> and that when they were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards made Priſoners by others, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd them to be releaſed, and ſent back to the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> only to get favour with them; that he would not make uſe of his Credit with them, to prevent their entring into this Confederacy with the <hi>Baeotians.</hi> and <hi>Corinthians;</hi> and yet on the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:35952:15"/>
other ſide he ſought to hinder thoſe <hi>Grecians</hi> who were inclined to make an Alliance and Friendſhip with <hi>Athens,</hi> if the <hi>Lacedaemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were not pleaſed with it.</p>
               <p>It happen'd at the very time when <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias</hi> was by theſe Arts brought into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace with the People; that Ambaſſadours arrived from <hi>Lacedaemon,</hi> who at their firſt coming ſaid what ſeemed very ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, declaring that they had full power to concert all Matters in difference upon equal terms. The Council received their Propoſitions, and the People was to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble on the morrow to give them Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> grew very apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of this, and ordered Matters ſo, that he had a ſecret Conference with the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors. When they were met, he ſaid; <hi>What is it you intend, you Men of</hi> Sparta? <hi>Can you be ignorant, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil always carry themſelves with Moderation and Reſpect towards Ambaſſadors, but that the People are haughty, and affect great things? So that if you let them know what full Powers your Commiſſion gives you, they will urge and preſs you to yield to unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Conditions. Quit therefore this indiſcreet Method, if you expect to obtain equal Terms from the</hi> Athenians, <hi>and would not have things extorted from you contrary to your Inclination; and begin to treat with the</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:35952:15"/>
                  <hi>People upon ſome reaſonable Articles, not owning at the firſt that you are Plenipotentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and I will be ready to aſſiſt you, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very zealous to ſerve the</hi> Lacedaemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. When he had ſaid thus, he gave them his Oath for the performance of what he promiſed, and by this way drew them from <hi>Nicias</hi> to rely entirely upon himſelf, and to admire him as a Perſon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary for Wiſdom and Dexterity in Affairs. The next day when the People were aſſembled, and the Ambaſſadors intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, <hi>Alcibiades</hi> with great Civility deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of them, with what Powers they were come? they made anſwer, That they were not come as Plenipotentiaries.</p>
               <p>Inſtantly upon that <hi>Alcibiades</hi> with a loud Voice, (as tho' he had receiv'd, and not done the wrong) began to call them faithleſs and inconſtant, and to ſhew that ſuch men could not poſſibly come with a purpoſe to ſay or do any thing that was ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere. The Council was highly incens'd, the People were in a rage, and <hi>Nicias,</hi> who knew nothing of the Deceit and the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, was in the greateſt Confuſion imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, being equally ſurpriz'd and aſham'd at ſuch a Change in the Men. So that without more ado, the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors were utterly rejected, and <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades</hi> was declar'd General, who preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:35952:16"/>
drew the <hi>Argives,</hi> the <hi>Elians,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Mantinoea,</hi> into a Confederacy with the <hi>Athenians.</hi>

               <p>No man commended the Method by which <hi>Alcibiades</hi> effected all this, yet it was a great reach in the Politicks, thus to divide and ſhake almoſt all <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> and to bring together ſo many men in Arms againſt the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> in one day before <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinoea;</hi> thereby removing the War and the Danger ſo far from the Frontier of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians,</hi> that even ſucceſs would profit the Enemy but little ſhould they be Conquerors, whereas if they were defeated, <hi>Sparta</hi> it ſelf was hardly ſafe.</p>
               <p>After this <hi>Battel</hi> at <hi>Mantineoea,</hi> the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Army of the <hi>Argives</hi> attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Alcibiades <hi>reſtores the Democracy et</hi> Argos.</note> to deſtroy the Government of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in <hi>Argos,</hi> and make themſelves Maſters of the City; and by the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> they aboliſhed the Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy. But the People took Arms again, and having gain'd ſome Advantage, <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades</hi> came in to their Aid, and made their Victory compleat. Then he perſwaded them to build long Walls, and by that means to joyn their City to the Sea, that ſo at all times they might more ſecurely receive Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour from the <hi>Athenians.</hi> To this purpoſe he procur'd them many Maſons and Hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Stone from <hi>Athens,</hi> and in all things
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:35952:16"/>
made ſhew of the greateſt Zeal for their Service, and thereby gain'd no leſs Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Power to himſelf, than to the Common-wealth of <hi>Athens.</hi> He alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the <hi>Patroeans</hi> to joyn their City to the Sea, by lengthening their Walls; and when they were warn'd, That the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> would ſwallow them up at laſt; <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades</hi> made Anſwer, that poſſibly it might be ſo, but it would be by little and little, and beginning at the Feet, whereas the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedoemonians</hi> will begin at the Head, and devour you all at once. He did alſo adviſe the <hi>Athenians</hi> to make themſelves ſtrong at Land, and often put the young Men in mind of the Oath which they had made at <hi>Agraulos,</hi> and excited them to the effectual performance of it; for there they were wont to ſwear, that they would repute Wheat and Barley, and Vines and Olives, to be the Limits of <hi>Attico;</hi> by which they were taught to claim a Title to all Lands that were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nured and fruitful.</p>
               <p>But with all theſe excellent Things which he ſaid and did, with all this Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <note place="margin">His Luxury.</note> and Eloquence, he intermingled ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant Luxury in his Eating and Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in his Loves, joyn'd with great Inſolence, and Effeminacy. He wore a long purple Robe, which dragg'd after him as he went through the Market-place.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:35952:17"/>
He caus'd the Planks of his Galley to be cut away, that ſo he might lye the ſofter, his Bed not being plac'd on the Boards, but hanging upon Girths. And his Shield, which was richly gilded, had not the uſual En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> but a <hi>Cupid</hi> holding a Thunderbolt in his Hand, was painted upon it; which when thoſe of the beſt Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the City ſaw, they did not only deteſt it, and reſent it highly, but were afraid of his diſſolute Manners, and inſolent Contempt of Laws, as things monſtrous in themſelves, and tending to a Change of the Government. <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> has well expreſs'd in what manner the People ſtood affected towards him:
<q>
                     <l>They hate him, yet they love to ſee him too,</l>
                     <l>Still Popular amidſt his wild Debauches.</l>
                  </q>
And in another place he doth more plainly diſcover the Jealouſie which was conceiv'd of him:
<q>
                     <l>'Tis folly to breed up an infant Lion,</l>
                     <l>But to provoke him after, downright Madneſs.</l>
                  </q>
The truth is, his Liberalities, his publick Shews, and other Munificence to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, (which were ſuch as nothing could exceed,) the Glory of his Anceſtors, the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:35952:17"/>
Force of his Eloquence, the Lovelineſs of his Perſon, his Strength of Body, joyn'd with his great Courage, and extraordinary Knowledge in Military Affairs, prevail'd upon the <hi>Athenians</hi> to endure patiently his Exceſſes, to indulge many things to him, and to give the ſofteſt Names to his Faults, attributing them only to his Youth and good Nature. He kept <hi>Agatharcus</hi> the Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Priſoner, till he had painted his whole Houſe, but then diſmis'd him with a Reward. He publickly ſtruck <hi>Taureas,</hi> who exhibited certain Shews in oppoſition to him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with him for the Prize. He took to himſelf one of the captive <hi>Melian</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and had a Son by her, whom he took care to educate. This the <hi>Athenians</hi> ſtyl'd great Humanity: and yet he was the principal Cauſe of the Slaughter of all the Inhabitants of the Iſle of <hi>Melos,</hi> who were of Age to bear Arms, by ſpeaking in favour of that cruel Decree. When <hi>Ariſtophon</hi> the Painter had drawn <hi>Nemea</hi> the Curtezan, ſitting and holding <hi>Alcibia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> in her Arms, the Multitude ſeem'd pleaſed with the Piece, and throng'd to ſee it, but the graver ſort were highly offended, and looked on theſe things as great Enormities, and ſavouring of a Tyranny. So that it was not ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs by <hi>Archeſtratus,</hi> that <hi>Greece</hi> could

themſelves Maſters of the Iſland. To this purpoſe he poſſeſs'd the People with great Hopes, whilſt he himſelf had much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and the Conqueſt of <hi>Sicily,</hi> which was the utmoſt Bound of their Ambition, was but the beginning of thoſe things which he thought of. <hi>Nicias</hi> endeavour'd to divert the People from this Expedition, by repreſenting to them, that the taking of <hi>Syracuſe</hi> would be a work of great Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. But <hi>Alcibiades</hi> dreamt of nothing leſs than the Conqueſt of <hi>Carthage</hi> and <hi>Lybia,</hi> and by the Acceſſion of theſe, fancied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf already Maſter of <hi>Italy</hi> and of <hi>Pelopon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſus;</hi> ſo that he ſeemed to look upon <hi>Sicily</hi> as little more than a Magazine for the War. The young Men were ſoon rais'd with theſe Hopes, and heark'ned gladly to thoſe of riper years, telling them ſtrange things of this Expedition; ſo that you might ſee great Numbers ſitting in Rings in the Places of Exerciſe, ſome deſcribing the Figure of the Iſland, and others the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of <hi>Lybia</hi> and <hi>Carthage.</hi> But it is ſaid, that <hi>Socrates</hi> the Philoſopher, and <hi>Meton</hi> the Aſtrologer, never hop'd for any good to the Common wealth from this War: The one, (as 'tis probable,) preſaging what would enſue, by the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of his <hi>Daemon,</hi> who converſed with him familiarly; and the other, either

contradicted him, and carried his Point with the People. And one <hi>Demoſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> an Orator, propoſing to them, that they ought to give the Generals abſolute Power, both as to the greatneſs of the Preparations, and the management of the War, it was preſently decreed ſo. But juſt when all things were fitted for the Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, many unlucky Omens appear'd. At that very time the Feaſt of <hi>Adonis</hi> happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in which the Women were uſed to expoſe in all Parts of the City, Images reſembling dead men carried out to their Burial, and to repreſent Funeral Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by their Lamentations and mournful Songs. The maiming alſo of the Images of <hi>Mercury,</hi> moſt of which in one night had their Faces broken, did terrifie many perſons who were wont to deſpiſe things of that nature. It was given out, that this was done by the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> for the ſake of the <hi>Syracuſans,</hi> who were a Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theirs, in hopes that the <hi>Athenians</hi> obſerving ſuch Prodigies, might be induc'd to repent of the War. Yet this Report gain'd not any Credit with the People, nor the Opinion of thoſe, who would not believe that there was any thing ominous in the Matter, but that it was only an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Action, committed by ſome wild young men coming from a Debauch; but
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:35952:20"/>
they were both enrag'd and terrifi'd at the thing, looking upon it to proceed from a Conſpiracy of perſons, who deſign'd ſome great Commotions in the State. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as well the Council, as the Aſſembly of the People, which upon this Occaſion was held frequently in a few days ſpace, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd diligently every thing that might adminiſter ground for Suſpicion. During this Examination, <hi>Androcles,</hi> one of the <hi>Demogogues,</hi> produc'd certain Slaves and Strangers before them, who accus'd <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades</hi> and ſome of his Friends for defacing <note place="margin">Is ſuſpected of breaking the Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and accus'd for prophaning the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> other Images in the ſame manner, and for having prophanely acted the ſacred My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries at a drunken Meeting. Wherein one <hi>Theodorus</hi> repreſented the Herald, <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytion</hi> the Torch-bearer, and <hi>Alcibiades</hi> the Chief Prieſt, and that the reſt of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions were preſent, as perſons initiated in the holy Myſteries, and acting the Part of Prieſts. Theſe were the Matters contain'd in the Accuſation, which <hi>Theſſalus</hi> the Son of <hi>Cimon,</hi> exhibited againſt <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> for his impious Mockery of the Goddeſſes, <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Proſerpina.</hi> The People were highly exaſperated and enrag'd againſt <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibiades</hi> upon this Accuſation, which being aggravated by <hi>Androcles,</hi> the moſt malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of all his Enemies, at firſt diſorder'd him exceedingly. But when he perceiv'd
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:35952:20"/>
that all the Sea-men deſign'd for <hi>Sicily,</hi> were fond of him, and that at the ſame time the Forces of the <hi>Argives</hi> and the <hi>Mantineans,</hi> which conſiſted of a 1000 men at Arms, ſpar'd not to ſay openly, that they had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken this tedious maritime Expedition for the ſake of <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> and that if he was ill us'd, they would all preſently be gone, he recover'd his Courage, and became eager to make uſe of the preſent opportunity for juſtifying himſelf. At this his Enemies were again diſcourag'd, as fearing leſt the People ſhould be more gentle towards him in their Sentence, by reaſon of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Occaſion which they had for his Service. Therefore to obviate this Miſchief, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd that ſome other Orators, who did not appear to be Enemies to <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> but really hated him no leſs than thoſe who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow'd themſelves to be ſo, ſhould ſtand up in the Aſſembly, and ſay, that it was a very abſurd thing, that one who was created Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of ſuch an Army with abſolute Power, after his Troops were compleated, and the Confederates were come, ſhould loſe the preſent Opportunity, whilſt the People were chooſing his Judges by Lots, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing times for the hearing of the Cauſe. And that therefore he ought to ſet Sayl preſently, (and may good Fortune attend him,) but when the War ſhould
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:35952:21"/>
be at an end, he might then in Perſon make his Defence according to the Laws.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Alcibiades</hi> ſoon perceiv'd the Malice of this Delay, and appearing in the Aſſembly, repreſented to them, that it was a very grievous thing to him, to be ſent forth with the Command of ſo great an Army, when he lay under ſuch Accuſations and Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, that he deſerv'd to die, if he could not clear himſelf of the Crimes objected to him. But when he had purg'd himſelf, and appear'd to be innocent, he ſhould then chearfully apply himſelf to the War, as ſtanding no longer in fear of falſe Accuſers. But he could not prevail with the People, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Departs for</hi> Sicily.</note> who commanded him to ſail immediately. So he departed together with the other Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, having with them near 140 Galleys, 5100 men at Arms, and about 1300 Archers, Slingers, and light arm'd men, and all the other Proviſions were anſwerable, and every way compleat.</p>
               <p>Arriving on the Coaſt of <hi>Italy,</hi> he landed at <hi>Rhegium,</hi> and there propos'd his Advice in what manner they ſhould manage the War.

But afterwards in his abſence his Enemies attack'd him more fiercely, and confounded together the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Images with the pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

The truth is, his Accuſers alledg'd nothing that was certain or ſolid againſt him. One of them being ask'd, How he knew the men who defac'd the Images; when he ſaid, He ſaw them by the light of the Moon, was groſly miſtaken, for it was juſt New Moon when the Fact was committed. This made all men of Underſtanding cry out upon the thing as a Contrivance, but the People were as eager as ever to receive fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Accuſations, nor was their firſt Heat at all abated, but they inſtantly ſeiz'd and impriſon'd every one that was accus'd. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe who were detain'd in Priſon in order to their Tryals, there was <hi>Andocides</hi> the Orator, whom the Hiſtorian <hi>Hella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus</hi> reports to be deſcended from <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes.</hi> He was always look'd upon to hate the Popular Government, and to affect an Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garchy. The chiefeſt ground of cauſing him to be ſuſpected for defacing the Images, was becauſe the great <hi>Mercury</hi> which was plac'd near his Houſe, and was an ancient Monument of the Tribe of the <hi>Aegeides,</hi> was almoſt the only Statue, of all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable ones, which remain'd entire.

For this Cauſe it is now call'd the <hi>Mercury</hi> of <hi>Andocides,</hi> all men giving it that Name, tho' the Inſcription is an Evidence that it belongs to another Tribe.

So that it was better for him, if he regarded himſelf, to ſave his Life by a Falſity, than to ſuffer an infamous Death, as one really guilty of the ſame Crime.

For indeed they fear'd a Mutiny and a Sedition in the Army in an Enemy's Countrey, which they knew it would be eaſie for <hi>Alcibiades</hi> to effect, if he had a mind to it. For the Souldiers were diſpirited upon his departune, expecting for the future tedious delays, and that the War would be drawn out into a lazy length by <hi>Nicias,</hi> when <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> who was the Spur to Action, was taken away.

               <p>This was the Colour and the Pretence made uſe of by thoſe, who deſir'd to reduce <note place="margin">

hands without oppoſition, while the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> engag'd in Civil Wars, deſtroy'd one another within the Circuit of their own Walls. It was <hi>Alcibiades</hi> principally who prevented all this Miſchief, for he did not only uſe Perſwaſions to the whole Army, and inform them of the Danger, but appli'd himſelf to them one by one, entreating ſome, and forcibly reſtraining others. And herein he was much aſſiſted by <hi>Thraſybulus</hi> of <hi>Stira,</hi> who having the loudeſt Voice of all the <hi>Athenians,</hi> went along with him, and cry'd out to thoſe who were ready to be gone. Another great Service which <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibiades</hi> did for them was, his undertaking that the <hi>Phaenician</hi> Fleet, which the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemonians</hi> expected to be ſent to them by the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> ſhould either come in Aid of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> or otherwiſe ſhould not come at all. He went on board with all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition in order to perform this, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd the thing with <hi>Tiſaphernes,</hi> that tho' thoſe Ships were already come as far as <hi>Aſpendos,</hi> yet they advanc'd no farther, ſo that the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> were diſappointed of them. It was by both ſides agreed that this Fleet was diverted by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement of <hi>Alcibiades.</hi> But the <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi> openly accus'd him, that he had advis'd this <hi>Barbarian</hi> to ſtand ſtill, and ſuffer the <hi>Graecians</hi> to waſte and deſtroy

one another, For it was evident that, the Acceſſion of ſo great a Force to either Party, would have enabled them to have raviſh'd entirely the Dominion of the Sea from the other ſide. Soon after this the 400 Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers were driven out, the Friends of <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades</hi> vigorouſly aſſiſting thoſe who were for the popular Government.

However he diſdain'd to owe his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the meer Grace and Commiſeration of the People, and therefore reſolv'd to come back with Glory, and upon the Merit of ſome eminent Service. To this end he ſail'd from <hi>Samos</hi> with a few Ships, and cruis'd on the Sea of <hi>Gnidos,</hi> and about the Iſle of <hi>Coos,</hi> and got Intelligence there that <hi>Mindarus,</hi> the <hi>Spartan</hi> Admiral, was ſail'd with his whole Army into the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> in purſuit of the <hi>Athenians.</hi> Thereupon he made haſte to ſuccour the <hi>Athenian</hi> Commanders, and by good fortune arriv'd with 18 Galleys at a critical time.

But one of the Conſpirators beginning to repent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the Deſign, the reſt for fear of being diſover'd, were driven to give the ſignal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the appointed hour. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> as ſoon as he ſaw the Torch lifted up in the Air, tho' his Army was not in readineſs to march, ran inſtantly towards the Walls, taking with him about 30 Men only, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the reſt of the Army to follow him with all poſſible Diligence. When he came thither, he found the Gate open'd for him, and entred with his 30 Men, and about 20 more light arm'd Men, who were come up to them. They were no ſooner fallen into the City, but he perceiv'd the <hi>Selybrians</hi> all arm'd coming down upon him: ſo that there was no hope of eſcaping if he ſtay'd to receive them; and on the other ſide, having been always ſucceſsful till that day, wherever he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, his Glory would not ſuffer him to fly. But on the ſudden he thought of

this Device: he requir'd Silence by ſound of a Trumpet, and then commanded one of his Men to make Proclamation, that the <hi>Selybrians</hi> ſhould not take Arms againſt the <hi>Athenians.</hi> This cool'd ſuch of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants as were fierceſt for the Fight, for they ſuppos'd that all their Enemies were got within the Walls, and it rais'd the hopes of others who were diſpos'd to an Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. Whilſt they were parlying, and Propoſitions made on one ſide and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Alcibiades</hi> whole Army came up to the Town. But then conjecturing rightly that the <hi>Selybrians</hi> were well inclin'd to Peace, and fearing leſt the City might be ſack'd by the <hi>Thracians,</hi> (who came in great Numbers to his Army to ſerve as Volunteers, out of their particular Kindneſs and Reſpect for him) he commanded them all to retreat without the Walls. And upon the Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>Selybrians,</hi> he ſav'd them from being pillag'd, and only taking of them a Sum of Money, and placing an <hi>Athenian</hi> Garriſon in the Town, he departed.</p>

and without tillage, and the time of War allowing them no means or leiſure to fetch in Proviſion from other Countries, there was an extreme ſcarcity of things in <hi>Rome:</hi> The Movers of the People then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that there was neither Corn brought into the Market, or if there had been Grain to ſupply them, yet they wanted Money to buy it, began to calumniate the Wealthy with falſe ſtories, and whiſper it about, as if they out of an old grudge,, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge themſelves, had purpoſely contrived it thus to bring a Famine upon them.

Now this ſad neceſſity of the <hi>Velitrani,</hi> was conſider'd by the more prudent ſort as a ſeaſonable relief unto themſelves, and ſeemed to happen very opportunely for the preſent ſtate of their Affairs; for not only the dearth of Victuals had made it needful to eaſe and unburden the City of its ſuperfluous Members, but they were

in hope alſo at the ſame time, and by this means to ſcatter and diſſolve the Faction which now threatned them, through a purgation and diſcharge of the more reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and inflamed Party, that like a redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy of morbid humours, put them all into ſo dangerous a ferment. Such as theſe therefore the Conſuls ſingled out to ſupply the deſolation at <hi>Velitrae,</hi> and gave notice to others that they ſhould be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to march againſt the <hi>Volſcians,</hi> which was politickly deſign'd to prevent inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine Broyls by employing them abroad.

               <p>But <hi>Siſinius</hi> and <hi>Brutus,</hi> a couple of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious <hi>Tribunes,</hi> did preſently interpoſe here, crying out, That the <hi>Conſuls</hi> went about to diſguiſe the moſt cruel and barbarous action in the World, under that ſo mild and plauſible name of a <hi>Colony,</hi> for no other end, but that they might precipitate ſo many poor Citizens,

               <p>By which kind of diſcourſes, the people were ſo fill'd with averſion and inſolence, that none of them would appear upon the Conſular Summons to be liſted for the War, and they did as little reliſh the Propoſal for a new Plantation; This put the Senate into ſuch perplexity that it was utterly at a loſs what to ſay, or do.

The majority therefore of the Senators ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to new Meaſures and a milder Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, the Conſuls proceeded to beſpeak and pacifie the People in the beſt manner they were able, anſwering gently to ſuch Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Charges as had been caſt upon the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and uſing much Tenderneſs and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty in thoſe Admonitions and Reproofs they gave them for their late exorbitant Demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.

People to become their Judges, and aſſume the Authority of pronouncing Capital Sentence upon any of the <hi>Patricians;</hi> but then the moſt aged and moſt inclin'd to Popularity, did alledge on the other ſide, and deliver it as their Opinion that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple wou'd not be ſo harſh and ſevere upon them, as ſome were pleas'd to imagine, but rather become more gentle and courteous through the conceſſion of that Power, ſince it was not their contempt of the Senate, but the fear of being deſpis'd by it, which made them pretend to ſuch a Prerogative of judging, the allowance whereof wou'd be a Teſtimony of Reſpect, and a means of Conſolation to them; inſomuch, that at the very time of receiving a liberty to Vote in theſe Caſes, they wou'd preſently diſmiſs and let fall their Animoſities and Diſpleaſures.</p>
               <p>When therefore <hi>Coriolanus</hi> ſaw that the Senate was in no little pain and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence upon his account, divided as it were betwixt the kindneſs they had for him, and their apprehenſions from the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he deſir'd to know of the <hi>Tribunes,</hi> what the Crimes were they did intend to charge him with, and what the Heads of that Indictment they wou'd oblige him to plead to before the People; and being told by them, that he was to be Impeacht for a
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:35952:65"/>
tyrannical Uſurpation, and that they wou'd <note place="margin">His Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> prove him guilty of deſigning to introduce Arbitrary Government; Stepping forth hereupon, let me go then, ſays he, to clear my ſelf from that Imputation before an Aſſembly of them, and as I do freely expoſe my perſon to any ſort of Cognizance touching this Article, ſo neither will I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe any kind of Puniſhment whatſoever, if I be convicted of it; only, ſays he, let what you now mention, be made the true Title of my Accuſation, and be ſure you do not falſifie or impoſe upon the Senate in this matter: when they gave conſent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and promis'd they wou'd ſtick to that as the chief ground of their proſecution; he came to his Tryal upon theſe terms. But the People being met together, the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes,</hi> contrary to all former practice, did extort and obtain firſt, that Voices ſhou'd be given, not according to their Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, but their Tribes; by which Inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Order, the indigent and factious Rabble, that had no reſpect for Honeſty and Juſtice, and wou'd be ſure to carry it by Number at the Poll, were to have a Precedency in Voting before the rich and eminent, and military ſort of men, who did ſerve and ſupport the Publick with their Lives and Fortunes: And then in the next place, whereas they had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:35952:66"/>
to proſecute <hi>Marcius</hi> upon no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther head but that of Tyranny (which cou'd never be made out againſt him) they did wave and relinquiſh this Plea, and inſtead thereof, fell to repeat and aggravate ſome words of his which had been formerly ſpoken in the Senate; as, that he did there oppoſe and diſſwade an abatement of the price of Corn, but adviſe and encourage them to reſume the <hi>Tribunitian</hi> Power; adding further as a new Impeachment, the diſtribution that was made by him of the ſpoyl and booty he had taken from the <hi>Antiates,</hi> when he over-run their Country, which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own head, and to gain the Souldiery, he had divided among thoſe that were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieſt to follow him; whereas it ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to have been brought into the publick Store-houſe, and diſpos'd of by Authority of the Senate for the common Intereſt; which laſt Accuſation did, they ſay, more ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize and diſcompoſe <hi>Marcius</hi> than all the reſt, as not expecting he ſhou'd ever be queſtion'd upon that ſubject, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leſs provided to give a plauſible and ſatisfactory Anſwer to it on the ſudden; but when, by way of excuſe, he began to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the Merits of thoſe who had been Partakers with him in the Action, ſuch as ſtaid at home being more numerous than
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:35952:66"/>
the other, and not enduring to hear them commended, did ſo diſturb him by the noiſe they made, that he cou'd not proceed upon that Argument: In concluſion, when they came to Vote, there were three intire Tribes that did condemn him more than thoſe that gave their Suffrage in his Favour, and the Penalty they adjudg'd him to, was perpetual baniſhment. The Sentence of his Condemnation being pronounc'd, <note place="margin">He is ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</note> the People went away with greater joy and triumph, and exaltation of mind, then they had ever ſhewn for any Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry againſt their Enemies: But the Senate was all in heavineſs, and a deep de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, repenting now and vexed at the very Soul that they had not done and ſuffer'd all things rather than give way to the inſolence of the People, and permit them to aſſume and abuſe ſo great an Authority: there was no need then to look upon their habit or other marks of diſtinction, for diſcerning a Senator from any vulgar Citizen, for it did plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear that the brisk and jocund were all <hi>Plebeians,</hi> and you might preſently know a Noble-man by his ſad Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; only <hi>Marcius</hi> himſelf was not ſtruck or humbled in the leaſt by that ſevere Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which had paſt upon him, appearing ſtill by his geſture and motion, and aſpect to

Antium, <hi>in that welcome Preſent you do here make us of your ſelf, and you may look for all manner of Civility and reſpectful <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage from the</hi> Volſcians; and ſo for that time he did only feaſt and entertain him with great Kindneſs, but for ſeveral days after they held private Conference, and were in cloſe Deliberation touching the Means and Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites of a War. While this Deſign was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there were great Troubles and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions at <hi>Rome,</hi> from the Animoſity of the Senators againſt the People, which came to be heightned too at preſent by a new Grudge, for the late Condemnation of <hi>Marcius;</hi> beſide that their Soothſayers and Prieſts, and even private Perſons, brought in fearful tidings of Signs and Prodigies, that were very much to be regarded, one whereof I ſhall mention here, which they report to have happen'd in this manner. <hi>Titus Latinus,</hi> one of ordinary Condition, but yet a ſober and vertuous man, free from all ſuperſtitious Fancies on one hand, and much more from Vanity and Boaſting on the other, had an Apparition in his Sleep, as if <hi>Jupiter</hi> came within view and bid him tell the Senate, that they had ſent a very uncouth and diſagreeable Dancer, to march before the Pomp of that Supplication they deſign'd him; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving beheld the Viſion, he ſaid, he did not much mind it, or the words ſpoken at the firſt Appearance, and having ſeen and ſlighted
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:35952:70"/>
it a ſecond and third time, he then ſaw the moſt hopeful Son he had, expire before his Eyes, and his own Body was ſo ſtruck and looſen'd on a ſudden, that himſelf became utterly impotent. Theſe things he related, being brought haſtily into the Senate on a Couch, and the Story goes, that he had no ſooner deliver'd his Meſſage there, but he preſently felt his Strength and Vigour to return, inſomuch that he got upon his Legs, and went home alone, without need of any aſſiſtance or ſupport, which the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators much wondring at, made a diligent ſearch into the Matter. Now that which his Dream alluded to was this: A Perſon whoſe Name I know not, had for ſome hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Offence, given up a Servant of his to the reſt of his Fellows, with charge to whip him firſt through the Market, and then to kill him; while they were executing this Command, and ſcourging the poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that skrew'd and turn'd himſelf into all manner of Shapes and unſeemly Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, through the Pain and Torture he was in, a ſolemn Proceſſion made in Honour of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> chanc'd to follow at their heels; ſeveral of the Aſſiſtants therein were very much ſcandaliz'd at ſuch a ſight, the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ſufferings and the indecent poſtures of that Wretch, being equally offenſive to the Spectators, and deteſted by them; yet no
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:35952:70"/>
body would interpoſe, or call the Actors to account for it, they did only ſpend ſome Reproaches and Curſes on the Maſter, who was ſo bitter and barbarous in his Inflictions: for the <hi>Romans</hi> treated their Servants with much Humanity in thoſe days, becauſe they did then work and labour themſelves, and live together among them, and ſo were apt to be more gentle and familiar with their own Domeſticks; for it was one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Pennances for a Servant who had highly miſdemean'd himſelf to take up that piece of Wood upon his ſhoulders wherewith they did ſupport the Thill of a Waggon, and carry it round about through the Neighbourhood, and he that had once undergone the ſhame of this, and was ſeen by thoſe of the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold and other Inhabitants of the place, with that infamous burden, had no longer any truſt or credit among them, but was ſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Furcifer</hi> by way of ignominy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; for what the <hi>Greeks</hi> in their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage call <hi>Hypoſtates, i. e.</hi> a Prop or Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter, is by the <hi>Latins</hi> termed <hi>Furca,</hi> from the forked Figure of that ruſtical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument.</p>
               <p>When therefore <hi>Latinus</hi> had given in ſuch a Relation of his Dream, and all the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators were deviſing who this diſagreeable and ungainly Dancer ſhould be, ſome of the Company (having been much affected with
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:35952:71"/>
the ſtrangeneſs of his puniſhment) did call to mind and mention the miſerable Slave which was laſht through the Streets, and afterward put to death; the Prieſts then being conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Caſe, did all unanimouſly agree, that this muſt be the ſame ungraceful and odious Tripper, which <hi>Jupiter</hi> complain'd of; whereupon his Maſter was puniſht, and they renew'd the Supplication to their God, with all the Shows and Solemnities of that Performance. By which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that <hi>Numa</hi> was both in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects a very wiſe Author of what did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to holy Offices, and that this in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular was an excellent inſtitution of his, to make the People attentive at their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Ceremonies; for when the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates or Prieſts do perform any Divine Worſhip, there is a Herald goes before, and proclaims with a loud voice, <hi>Hoc age,</hi> which ſignifies, Do this you are about, and ſo warns them heedfully to mind what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Sacred Action they are engag'd in, not ſuffering any other buſineſs, or world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly avocation to come in between, that may diſturb their thoughts, and interrupt the Exerciſe; and this he judg'd to be the more neceſſary here, inaſmuch as moſt of the things which men do, eſpecially of this kind, are in a manner forc'd from them, and effected by conſtraint. Now
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:35952:71"/>
it is uſual with the <hi>Romans</hi> to begin their Sacrifices, and Proceſſions, and Sights afreſh, not only upon ſuch a Cauſe as this, but for any ſlighter reaſon; for if but one of the Horſes which drew the Chariots call'd <hi>Tenſae,</hi> upon which the Images of their Gods were plac'd, did happen to fail and falter, or if the Coach-man took hold of the Reins with his left hand, they made a Vote that the whole Operation ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence anew; and in latter ages one and the ſame Sacrifice was perform'd thirty times over, becauſe there ſeem'd always to be a defect or miſtake, or ſome vitious and offenſive Accident in that Service; ſo great was the Reverence and Caution which the <hi>Romans</hi> then ſhew'd towards the Deity in all things.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Marcius</hi> and <hi>Tullus</hi> did now ſecretly diſcourſe of their Project before the chief men of <hi>Antium,</hi> adviſing them to invade the <hi>Romans</hi> while they were at odds among themſelves, and embroyl'd in Diſſentions and Conteſts with each other; and when the Reſpects of Shame and Decency did hinder them from embracing the motion, inaſmuch as they had agreed and ſworn to a Truce and Ceſſation of Arms for the ſpace of two years, the <hi>Romans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> themſelves ſoon fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht them with a Pretence, by making Proclamation (out of a certain jealouſie,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:35952:72"/>
or ſlanderous report) in the midſt of their Shews and Exerciſes, that all the <hi>Volſcians</hi> who came thither to ſee them, ſhou'd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the City before Sun-ſet: there are ſome who affirm, that all this was a Contrivance and Trick of <hi>Marcius,</hi> who ſent one pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately to the Conſuls that ſhould falſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the <hi>Volſcians,</hi> as if they did intend to fall upon the <hi>Romans</hi> while they were at their Plays and Paſtimes, and ſet the City on fire. Now ſo publick an Affront did extremly nettle thoſe of that Nation, and diſpoſe them more than ever to Hoſtility and hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Romans;</hi> which <hi>Tullus</hi> perceiving, made his advantage of it, much aggravating the Fact, and working on their preſent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, till he did provoke and perſwade them at laſt to diſpatch Embaſſadors to <hi>Rome,</hi> that ſhould require them to reſtore that part of their Country, and thoſe Towns which they had taken from the <hi>Volſcians</hi> in the late War: When the <hi>Romans</hi> heard ſuch a Meſſage, they were in great wrath, and ſmartly reply'd, That if the <hi>Volſcians</hi> were the firſt that did take up Arms, the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhou'd be the laſt that would lay them down. This Anſwer being brought back, <hi>Tullus</hi> made a General Aſſembly of the <hi>Volſcian</hi> States, in which Convention the Vote paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing for a War; he did propoſe that they ſhould call in <hi>Marcius,</hi> laying aſide the

remembrance of former grudges, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring themſelves that the Services they ſhould now receive from him as a Friend and Aſſociate, would abundantly out-weigh any harm or damage he had done them when he was their Enemy: <hi>Marcius</hi> having made his Entrance, and ſpoken to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he was thought to be a ſhrewd War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour no leſs by his Diſcourſe than by his Deeds, and to excel in Prudence as well as Courage; whereupon they joyn'd him in Commiſſion with <hi>Tullus,</hi> to have full Power as General of their Forces in all that related to the War; who fearing leſt the time that would be requiſite to bring all the <hi>Volſcians</hi> together, with their Ammunition and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page for that Service, might be ſo long as to make him loſe the opportunity of ſome conſiderable Action; he left order with the chief Perſons and Rulers of the City to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide and furniſh out other things, while he himſelf, prevailing upon the moſt brisk and forward, to aſſemble themſelves, and march out with him as Voluntiers, without ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be enroll'd, made a ſudden Inroad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Roman</hi> Confines when no body did expect him, by which nimble ſurprizal he poſſeſt himſelf of ſo much Booty, that the <hi>Volſcians</hi> were incumber'd with their Prey, as unable to drive away and carry it all off, or when they had done ſo, to conſume and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:35952:73"/>
ſpend it in their Camp; but the abundance of Proviſion which he gain'd, and that waſte and havock of the Country which he made, were of themſelves and in his account, the ſmalleſt things in that Invaſion, the great miſchief he intended, and for the ſake where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he did all the reſt, was to increaſe at <hi>Rome</hi> their ſlanders and jealouſies of the Nobles, and to make them ſtill upon worſe terms with the People; for which end, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>poyling all the Fields, and deſtroying the Goods of other men, he took ſpecial care to preſerve their Farms and Villages un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toucht, and would not allow his Souldiers to ravage there, or ſeize upon any thing which belong'd to them; from whence their Invectives and Quarrels againſt one another, broke out afreſh, and roſe to a greater height than heretofore; the Senators reproaching thoſe of the Commonalty, with their late injuſtice to <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> as if they were rightly ſerv'd for baniſhing a man of ſo great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; while the <hi>Plebeians</hi> on their ſide did not ſtick to accuſe them for having, out of meer ſpite and revenge, ſolicited <hi>Marcius</hi> to this Enterprize, and that, when others were involv'd in the miſeries of a War by their means, they ſate like unconcern'd Spectators, as being ſecure themſelves, and furniſht with a Guardian or Protector a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad of their own Wealth and Fortunes,

in the very perſon of him who was a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Enemy to the People. After this Incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Exploit which was of great uſe and ſingular advantage to the <hi>Volſcians,</hi> inaſmuch as they learnt by it to grow more hardy, and then firſt of all to contemn thoſe Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies they ſo much dreaded before, <hi>Marcius</hi> drew them off, and return'd in ſafety. But when the whole ſtrength of the <hi>Volſcians</hi> was with great Expedition and Alacrity brought together into the Field, it appear'd ſo conſiderable a body, that they agreed to leave part thereof in Garriſon for the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their Towns, and with the other Moyety to march againſt the <hi>Romans: Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riolanus</hi> then deſired <hi>Tullus</hi> to conſider which of the two Charges would be moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him, and that he would chooſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; to which <hi>Tullus</hi> make anſwer, That ſince he knew <hi>Marcius</hi> to be equally valiant with himſelf, but far more fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in all Rencounters, he would have him take the Command of thoſe that were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out to the War, while he made it his care and buſineſs to defend their Cities at home, and provide all Conveniences for the Army abroad. <hi>Marcius</hi> therefore, being thus rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd, and much ſtronger than before, mov'd firſt toward the City call'd <hi>Circaeum,</hi> that was a <hi>Roman Colony,</hi> which being freely deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd up, he did not the leaſt harm there to
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:35952:74"/>
the Place or its Inhabitants: And paſſing thence, he enter'd and laid waſte the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the <hi>Latins,</hi> where it was expected the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould have come in to their aſſiſtance, and fought againſt him in behalf of the <hi>Latins,</hi> who were their Confederates and Allies, and had often ſent to demand Succours from them; but becauſe as well the People on their part ſhew'd little inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Service, and the <hi>Conſuls</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were unwilling now to run the hazard of a Battle, when the time of their Office drew ſo near its end, and was almoſt ready to expire, they diſmiſt the <hi>Latin</hi> Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors without any effect: So that <hi>Marcius</hi> finding no Army to oppoſe him, marcht up to their very Cities themſeives, and having taken by force that of the People call'd <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerienſes,</hi> and of the <hi>Vicani</hi> and <hi>Pedani,</hi> and of the <hi>Belani</hi> too, who ſtood it out againſt him; he not only plunder'd their Houſes, but made a Prey likewiſe of their Perſons: But he had a particular regard for all ſuch as came over to his Party, and was ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of them, that for fear they might ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain any damage againſt his will, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campt ſtill at the greateſt diſtance he could, and wholly abſtain'd from the Lands of thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

with great Treaſure, and put almoſt all to the Sword that were of an age to carry Weapons; the other <hi>Volſcians</hi> that were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to ſtay behind as a ſafeguard to their Cities, hearing of his Atchievements and Succeſs, had not the patience to remain any longer at home, but came running with their Arms to <hi>Marcius,</hi> and ſaying, that he alone was their General, and the ſole perſon they would own as a Commander in Chief over them; upon which he had a mighty Name, and the Renown of him ſpread throughout all <hi>Italy,</hi> with a marvellous Opinion of his ſingle Proweſs; who, by changing ſides, had himſelf alone given that ſudden turn to the Affairs of two Nations, and made ſuch a ſtrange and notable altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the ſtate of things.</p>
               <p>All was at <hi>Rome</hi> now in very great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, for they were utterly averſe from Fighting, and ſpent their whole time in Cabals and Conſpiracies, and ſeditious words, and perpetual Bandyings againſt each other; until News was brought that the Enemy had laid cloſe Siege to <hi>Lavinium,</hi> wherein were all the Images and Sacred things of their tutelar Gods, and from whence they did derive the Original of their Nation, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt City which <hi>Aeneas</hi> built in <hi>Italy;</hi> which tidings did produce great variety of Sentiments, and wrought a wonderful dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:35952:75"/>
all at once as to the Thoughts and Inclinations of the People, but a very odd and unexpected change of Mind among the <hi>Patricians;</hi> for the former now was for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing the Sentence againſt <hi>Marcius,</hi> and calling him back into the City; whereas the Senate, being aſſembled to deliberate and reſolve upon that Point, did finally diſlike and oppoſe the Propoſition; either out of a croſs humour, to contradict and withſtand the People in what-ever they ſhould motion, or becauſe they were unwilling perhaps, that he ſhould owe his Reſtoration to their Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; or having now conceived a Diſpleaſure againſt <hi>Marcius</hi> himſelf, who did haraſs and plague them all alike, though he had not been ill treated by all, and was become a declar'd Enemy to the whole Countrey, though he knew well enough that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Men, and all the better ſort, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dole with him, and ſuffer in his Injuries.</p>
               <p>This Reſolution of theirs being made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, the People was utterly at a loſs, and could proceed no further, as having no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to paſs any thing by Suffrage, and enact it for a Law, without a previous Decree from the Senate. But when <hi>Marcius</hi> came to hear of that Vote for prohibiting his Return, he was more exaſperated than ever, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that quitting the Siege of <hi>Lavinium,</hi> he march'd furiouſly towards <hi>Rome,</hi> and

The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſent by the Senate with this Meſſage, were choſen out of his Kindred and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, who did therefore expect a very kind

When the Embaſſadors were come back and had acquainted the Senate with this reſolute Anſwer, ſeeing the whole State now threatned as it were by a Tempeſt, and the Waves ready to overwhelm them, they were forc'd as we ſay, in extream Perils, to handle and let down the Sacred Anchor; for there was a Decree made, that the whole Order of their <hi>Prieſts,</hi> with ſuch as did initiate in <hi>Myſteries,</hi> or had the care and cuſtody of <hi>Holy Things,</hi> or the skill of <hi>Prophecying</hi> by Birds (an ancient way of <hi>Divination</hi> among the <hi>Romans)</hi> ſhould all and every one of them go in full Proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to <hi>Marcius</hi> with their Pontifical Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray, and the ſame Dreſs and Habit which they reſpectively us'd in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Functious or Religious Ceremonies;

When there was no better effect of ſuch a ſolemn Application, (the <hi>Prieſts</hi> too returning unſucceſsful) they determin'd to ſit ſtill within the City, and keep Watch about their Walls, intending only to repulſe the Enemy, ſhould he offer to attack them, and placing their hopes chiefly in the ſtrange and extraordinary Accidents of Time and Fortune: for as to themſelves, they had neither the Wit to contrive, nor the Courage to undertake ought for their own deliverance, but confuſion and terror, and ill-boding Reports run through the whole City; till a certain thing did arrive, not unlike thoſe we ſo often read of in <hi>Homer,</hi>

Yet notwithſtanding this, if it be your opinion that we may do any good here, vouchſafe to make uſe of our ſervice, and lead us to him, who, if we fail of every thing elſe, at leaſt can die for, though not redeem our Countrey, and</hi>

The Senate then very much commending the Forwardneſs and Bounty of their Minds, caus'd the Temple to be built, and a Statue to be ſet up therein at the publick Charge; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs they would needs make a Purſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, for another Image of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which as the <hi>Romans</hi> ſay, at the time of Dedication and placing of it, ſpoke to this purpoſe: <hi>O ye Ladies, great is your Piety and Devotion in the Preſent you have made of me.</hi> And they fabulouſly report that the ſame words were repeated a ſecond time, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to make us believe things that were never done, and ſo like Impoſſibilities, that it is very hard to credit them. For I think it poſſible enough, that Statues may ſeem both to ſweat, and to run with Tears, yea, and ſtand with certain dewy drops of a ſanguine Dye; for Timber and Stones are frequently ſeen to contract a kind of Scurf and Rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that does produce moiſture; and they do not only ſend forth many different Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of themſelves, but receive variety of Tinctures from the ambient Air, by which it is not abſurd to imagine, that the Deity may advertiſe and forewarn us of ſeveral things. It may happen alſo, that theſe Images and Statues ſhall ſometimes make a

noiſe not unlike that of a Squeak or Groan, through a rupture at the bottom, or the violent ſeparation of their inward Parts; but that articulate Voice, and ſuch expreſs words, and ſo clear and accurate, and even Language, ſhould be thus formed by inanimate beings, is, in my judgment, a thing utterly unfeaſible; ſeeing it was never known, that either the Soul of Man, or even God himſelf, did utter vocal Sounds and Diſcourſe alone, without an organiz'd Body, and Inſtruments fitted for Elocution. But where Hiſtory does in a manner force our Aſſent by the Concurrences of many cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Witneſſes, in this Caſe we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that an Impreſſion not unlike that which does affect Senſe, falling then upon the Fancy, draws in the Imaginative part to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply therewith, and take it for a true Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; juſt as it happens to us when we are faſt aſleep, our Eyes and Ears ſeem to be entertain'd with thoſe things which we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſee nor hear.

Motive and Support to the belief thereof. For God has no manner of Reſemblance, either as to his Nature, or his Motion, or his Skill, or his Ability, with what is humane, and therefore it is no wonder at all if he ſhould deviſe and perform that, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be contriv'd or accompliſh'd by any Mortal; and though he differs from, and does infinitely excel us in all things elſe, yet the diſſimilitude and diſtance betwixt Him and Men appears no where ſo much, as in the Prodigiouſneſs of his Working, and the ſtrange Effects of his Omnipotence; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a conſiderable part of the Divine Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations (as <hi>Heraclitus</hi> affirms) do paſs by unobſerv'd, and eſcape our Knowledge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are Infidels in the Point, and have not Faith enough to believe them.</p>
               <p>But let us now look after <hi>Marcius,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire how he was treated upon his Return to <hi>Antium;</hi> where we ſhall find <hi>Tullus,</hi> a Man that did perfectly hate him, and could not longer endure one he was ſo much afraid of, conſulting how he might immediately diſpatch him, who, if he did eſcape at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, was never like to afford him ſuch another Advantage for that purpoſe. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving therefore got together, and ſuborn'd ſeveral <hi>Partiſans</hi> againſt him, he requir'd <hi>Marcius</hi> to reſign his Charge, and give the <hi>Volſcians</hi> an account of his Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:35952:86"/>
of Affairs; who apprehending the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of a private Condition, if <hi>Tullus</hi> ſhould be made Commander in Chief, that of all others had the greateſt Power and Intereſt with thoſe of <hi>Antium,</hi> made Anſwer, That he was ready to lay down his Commiſſion, whenever the <hi>Volſcian</hi> States, from whoſe common Authority he had receiv'd it, ſhould think fit to command him, and that in the mean time he did not refuſe to give the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiates</hi> ſatisfaction, as to all Particulars of his Conduct, if they were deſirous of it.</p>
               <p>An Aſſembly then being call'd, there aroſe certain Orators, appointed for that Deſign, who by their popular Harangues did exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and incenſe the Multitude; but when <hi>Marcius</hi> ſtood up to anſwer thoſe Objections and Impeachments they had brought againſt him, the more unruly and tumultuous part of the People waxed calm and quiet on the ſudden, and out of Reverence to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, gave him liberty to ſpeak without the leaſt diſturbance; beſide that all the better ſort of <hi>Antium,</hi> and ſuch as were moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with a Peace, made it evident by their whole Compoſure, that they would give him a favourable Hearing, and then judge and pronounce according to Equity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tullus</hi> therefore began to dread his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, and ſuſpect the iſſue of that Defence he was going to make for himſelf; for he was
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:35952:86"/>
an excellent Spokeſ-man, and one of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Eloquence; and the former Services he had done the <hi>Volſcians,</hi> did procure and ſtill preſerve for him a much greater Kindneſs, than could poſſibly be out-weigh'd by that new Diſpleaſure, and the Blame of his late Conduct; yea, the very Crime and Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation it ſelf, was a proof and teſtimony of the greatneſs of his Merits, for that People could never have complain'd or thought that he had been injurious to them, becauſe <hi>Rome</hi> was not then brought into their Power, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a plain Confeſſion, that by his means only they were ſo near taking it. For theſe Reaſons the Confederates judg'd it prudent not to make any further Delays, or At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts upon the Vulgar, and ſo the boldeſt of their Faction crying out, that they ought not to liſten to a Traytor, nor allow him ſtill to bear Rule, and play the Tyrant among them, fell upon <hi>Marcius</hi> in a Body, and ſlew him there, none of thoſe that were preſent ſo much as offering to defend him. But it quickly appear'd, that this baſe and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Action was in no wiſe approv'd by the Majority of the <hi>Volſcians,</hi> for they came run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out of their ſeveral Cities, to ſhew Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto his Corps, which they did by an honourable Interment of it, adorning his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre with Arms and Trophies, as the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of a noble Hero and a famous Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:35952:87"/>
When the <hi>Romans</hi> heard tidings of his death, they gave no other ſignification either of Honour or of Anger towards him, but only granted this Requeſt of the Women, that they might put themſelves into Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and bewail him for ten Months, as their Cuſtom was upon the loſs of a Father, or a Son, or a Brother; that being a period ſet for the longeſt Lamentation in ſuch Caſes, by the ancient Laws of <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> as it is more amply related in what I have written of his Life and Actions. Now <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> was no ſooner deceaſed, but the <hi>Volſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> came to need his Aſſiſtance, and wiſh for him again; for they fell to ſwabble firſt with the <hi>Sicani,</hi> (their Confederates and their Friends) about the nomination of a <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="2 letters">

After this they were defeated by the <hi>Romans</hi> in a pitch'd Battle, where not only <hi>Tullus</hi> loſt his Life, but the principal Flower of their whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was cut in pieces; ſo that they were forc'd to ſubmit, and accept of Peace upon very diſhonourable terms, promiſing to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the <hi>Roman</hi> Orders, and obey their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in whatever he ſhould impoſe.</p>

of theſe great Men are as a Looking-glaſs, by which I learn how I ought to order and adorn my own Life. For by this means I enjoy the greateſt Familiarity, and am no leſs converſant with them all by Turns, than if the ſame Table and Bed were common to us both. When I read their Story, each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Vertue and Excellence makes a deep Impreſſion in my Mind, and hence I gather, how great and valuable the Owner of theſe Accompliſhments muſt needs have been, and with Care collect the moſt beautiful and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Paſſages of their Lives, as Patterns for Imitation. A greater Pleaſure than which, the Gods can ſcarce grant us, or a more ready way to teach us Vertue. <hi>Democritus</hi> laid it <note place="margin">Democri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus <hi>his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Phantaſms.</hi>

But my Method is, by daily converſing with Hiſtory, and a diligent Collection of what I read, to fix in my Mind things worthy Memory of the beſt and moſt vertuous of Men. For thus am I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to free my ſelf from that Contagion of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:35952:89"/>
Idleneſs &amp; Vice, which I may have contracted from the ill company I am ſometimes forc'd to converſe with; it being a powerful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, with a ſedate and quiet Mind, ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to conſider ſuch noble Examples.

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:35952:94"/>
of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which was now a general Oppreſſion to the World. But being vanquiſh'd in a pitch'd Battel by <hi>Titus Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius,</hi> near to <hi>Scotuſa,</hi> his Reſolution was daſh'd, and he yielded himſelf and all that he had to the Mercy of the <hi>Romans,</hi> well contented that he could eſcape with pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſmall Tribute. Yet afterwards recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting himſelf, he bore it with great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, and thought he liv'd rather like a Slave that was pleas'd with eaſe, than a Man of Senſe and Courage, whilſt he held his Kingdom at the pleaſure of his Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, which made him reſolve upon a War, and prepare himſelf with as much Cunning and Privacy as poſſible. To this end, he left his Cities on the high-Roads and Sea-Coſt ungarriſon'd, and almoſt deſolate, that they might ſeem inconſiderable; in the mean time furniſhing his mid-land Caſtles, ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds and Towns, with Arms, Money, and Men fit for Service, he provided himſelf for War, and yet kept his Preparations cloſe.

But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could put theſe things into motion, and bring his Deſigns to effect, he died
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:35952:95"/>
for grief and anguiſh of Mind, being ſenſible he had put his innocent Son <hi>Demetrius</hi> to death upon the Calumnies of one that was far more guilty. <hi>Perſeus</hi> his Son that ſurviv'd inherited his Hatred to the <hi>Romans</hi> as well as his Kingdom, but was very unfit to carry on his Deſigns, through his want of Courage, and the viciouſneſs of his Manners, eſpecially when amongſt the Vices and Diſeaſes of his Mind of all ſorts, Covetouſneſs bore the chief ſway. There is a Report alſo of his not being legitimate, but that the Wife of King <hi>Philip</hi> took him from his Mother <hi>Grathania,</hi> (a Woman of <hi>Argos,</hi> that earn'd her living by Botching) as ſoon as he was born, and brought him up privately as her own.

               <p>Notwithſtanding all this, and tho' his Spirit was ſo mean, and temper ſo ſordid, yet truſting to the ſtrength of his Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he engaged in a War with the <hi>Romans,</hi>

under ground, dug a great many Holes and Wells in the ſide of the Mountain, which were preſently fill'd with pure Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by the current and force of that, which being freed from reſtraint, had now ſpace to unite. Although ſome deny, that <note place="margin">Of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal of Springs.</note> there are any Sources of Water ready pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided and concealed in the Places from whence they flow, which by their courſe are diſcovered and break forth; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that they owe their Being and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to the Matter that then grows li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid: now this change is made by Denſity and Cold, when the moiſt Vapour by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cloſely preſs'd together, becomes fluid. As Womens Breaſts are not like Veſſels full, of Milk, always prepar'd and ready to flow from them; but their Nouriſhment being chang'd in their Breaſts, is there made Milk, and from thence ſtrain'd. In like manner, the Places of the Earth that are cold and ſtor'd with Fountains, do not contain any hidden Waters or Receptacles which are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as from a Source always ready and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, to ſupply ſo many Brooks, and the depths of ſo great Rivers; but preſſing by crowding together, and condenſing the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours and Air, they turn them into that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Whence thoſe Places that are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, by that means do flow and afford more plenty of Water, as the Breaſts of Women

do Milk by their being ſuck'd) by moiſtning the Vapour, and rendring it fluid; whereas the Earth that remains idle and undug, is not capable of producing any Water, whilſt it wants that motion which is the true Cauſe of it. But thoſe that aſſert this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, give occaſion to the doubtful to argue, that on the ſame ground there ſhould be no Blood in living Creatures, but that it muſt be form'd by the Wound, ſome ſort of Spirit or Fleſh being chang'd into a Matter that is liquid, and proper to flow. Moreover, theſe are refuted by ſuch, who digging deep in the Earth to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine ſome ſtrong-Hold, or ſearch for Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, meet with Rivers, which are not collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by little and little, (which muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be, if they had their Beings at the very inſtant the Earth was open'd) but break out at once with violence; and upon the cutting through a Rock, there often guſhes out great quantities of Water, and then as ſuddenly ceaſes.

                     <hi>This News miralouſly convey'd to</hi> Rome.</note> an unexpected Report at the entrance of the Theatre, that <hi>Emilius</hi> had overcome
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:35952:108"/>
                  <hi>Perſeus,</hi> and brought all <hi>Macedonia</hi> under his Power, and from thence, when the Rumour was ſpread amongſt the People, there was a general Joy, with Shoutings and Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations for that whole day through the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But when no certain Author was found of the News, and every one alike had taken it on truſt, it vaniſh'd for the preſent and came to nothing, till within a few days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe tydings came certainly confirm'd, and then the firſt Intelligence was look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as no leſs than a Miracle, whilſt it could be no other than feign'd, though it contain'd in it what was real and true. It is reported <note place="margin">Examples of the like.</note> alſo, that the News of a Battel that was fought in <hi>Italy,</hi> near the River <hi>Sagra,</hi> was carry'd into <hi>Peloponneſus</hi> the ſame day, and of that nigh <hi>Mycala,</hi> againſt the <hi>Medes,</hi> to <hi>Platee.</hi> When the <hi>Romans</hi> had defeated the <hi>Tarquins,</hi> who were combin'd with the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins,</hi> there were almoſt at the ſame time at <hi>Rome</hi> ſeen two goodly tall Men, who them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves brought the News from the Camp. The firſt Man that ſpake to them in the Market-place near the Fountain, where they were refreſhing their Horſes which were all of a Fome, much wondred at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Victory, when, 'tis ſaid they both ſmil'd and gently ſtrok'd his Beard with their hands, the Hairs of which from being black, was on the Spot chang'd to be yellow.
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:35952:109"/>
This Circumſtance gave credit to what they ſaid, and fix'd the Name of <hi>Enobarbus</hi> (which is as much as yellow Beard) on the Man. But that which happen'd in our own Time, will make all theſe credible? for when <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony</hi> rebell'd againſt <hi>Domitian,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> was in a Conſternation, expecting great Wars in <hi>Germany,</hi> all on a ſudden, and no body knows upon what account, the People ſpread abroad a Rumour of the Victory, and the News ran current through the City, that <hi>Antony</hi> himſelf was ſlain, his whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my deſtroy'd, and that not ſo much as a part of it eſcap'd: nay this belief carry'd with it ſuch Clearneſs and Force, that many of the Magiſtrates offer'd up Sacrifices. But when at length the Author of this Report was ſought, and none was to be found, it vaniſh'd by degrees, whilſt every one ſhifted it off, from himſelf to another, and at laſt was loſt in the numberleſs Crowd, as in a vaſt Ocean, and having no ſolid Ground to ſupport its Credit, was in a ſhort time not ſo much as nam'd in the City. Nevertheleſs when <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> march'd out with his Forces to the War, he met with Meſſengers and Letters, that gave him a Relation of the Victory; and the Fame of this Conqueſt came the very day it was gain'd, though the diſtance of the places was more than 2500 miles. The truth of this no Man amongſt us can be ignorant of.</p>

                  </note> joyn'd in Command with <hi>Emilius,</hi> came to an Anchor with his Fleet under <hi>Samothrace,</hi> where out of his Devotion to the Gods, he permitted <hi>Perſeus</hi> to enjoy the benefit of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, but took care that he ſhould not eſcape by Sea. Notwithſtanding <hi>Perſeus</hi> ſecretly practis'd with <hi>Oroandes</hi> of <hi>Crete,</hi> who was Maſter of a Bark, to convey him and his Treaſure away. He, making uſe of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Arts of his Country, took in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and advis'd him to come in the Night with his Wife, Children, and neceſſary At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, to the Port call'd <hi>Demetrius,</hi> but as ſoon as it was Evening, ſet Sayl with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him. Miſerable was now the Fate of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus,</hi> who was forc'd to let down himſelf, his Wife and Children, through a narrow Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow by a Wall, People altogether unaccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom'd to hardſhip and Flying. But that which yet fetch'd deeper Sighs from his Heart was, when he was told by one, as he wondred on the Shore, that he ſaw <hi>Oroandes</hi> under Sayl in the Main Sea, for now it was Day. So that there being no Hopes left of Eſcaping, he fled back again to the Wall, which he and his Wife recover'd (though they were ſeen by the <hi>Romans)</hi> before they could reach them. His Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren he himſelf had deliver'd into the hands of <hi>Ion,</hi> one that had been his Favourite, but
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:35952:110"/>
now prov'd his Betrayer, and was the chief Cauſe that forc'd him (and tis no other than Beaſts themſelves will do when their young ones are taken) to come and yield himſelf up to thoſe that had them in their Power. His greateſt Confidence was in <hi>Naſica,</hi> and 'twas to him he call'd, but he not being there, he bewayl'd his Misfortune, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there was no poſſible Remedy, ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred himſelf to <hi>Octavius.</hi> And here it was that he made it manifeſt, that he was poſſeſs'd with a Vice more ſordid than Covetouſneſs it ſelf, to wit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the fondneſs of Life; by which he depriv'd himſelf even of Pity, the only thing that Fortune never takes away from the moſt wretched: for he deſir'd to be brought to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milius,</hi> who aroſe from his Seat, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd with his Friends, went to receive him with Tears in his Eyes, as a great Man fallen by the Anger of the Gods, and his own ill Fortune; whilſt <hi>Perſeus,</hi> which was the moſt ſcandalous of Sights, threw himſelf at his Feet, embrac'd his Knees, and utter'd ſuch unmanly Cryes and Petitions, as <hi>Emilius</hi> was not able to bear, or would vouchſafe to hear: but looking on him with a ſad and angry Countenance; <q>What <note place="margin">Emilius <hi>his Speech to</hi> Perſeus.</note> (ſays he) miſerable as thou art, doſt thou thus diſcharge Fortune, of what might ſeem her greateſt Crime? for by theſe Actions thou appeareſt worthy of thy

Calamity, and that it is not your preſent Condition, but your former Happineſs, that was more than your Deſerts. What! do you thus take away from my Victory, and make my Conqueſt little, by proving your ſelf a Coward and a Foe below a <hi>Roman?</hi> The moſt unhappy Valour chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges a great Reſpect, even from Enemies; but Cowardiſe, though never ſo ſucceſsful, from the <hi>Romans</hi> always met with Scorn.</q> Yet for all this he took him up, gave him his Hand, and deliver'd him into the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody of <hi>Tubero.</hi>

               <p>After this, he carry'd his Sons, his Sons-in-law, and others of the chiefeſt Quality, eſpecially thoſe of the younger ſort, back with him into his Tent, where for a long time he ſate down without ſpeaking one word, inſomuch that they all wondred at him.

when that of Victory it ſelf muſt chiefly force us to dread our own Fortune, and a little Conſideration of the Fate of Things, and how all are hurry'd round, and each man's Station chang'd, will introduce Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the midſt of greateſt Mirth?

No, young Men, caſt off that vain Pride, and empty Boaſt of Victory; ſit down with Modeſty, and always think on what's to come, and what, through the ſpite of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, may be yet the end of this our preſent Happineſs.</q> 'Tis ſaid, <hi>Emilius</hi> having ſpoke much more to the ſame purpoſe, diſmiſs'd the young Men well chaſtiz'd, and with this Oration, as with a Bridle, curb'd their Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory and Inſolence.</p>

with ſuch a juſt liberty, that they knock'd againſt one another as they were drawn along, and made a harſh and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble noiſe, ſo that the very Spoils of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd could not be beheld without dread. After theſe Waggons loaden with Armour, there follow'd 3000 Men, who carried the Silver that was coyn'd, in 750 Veſſels, each of which weigh'd three Talents, and was carried by four Men. Others brought ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Bowls, and Goblets, and Cups, all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd in ſuch Order as to make the beſt Show, and all valuable, as well for their bigneſs as the thickneſs of their engraved Work.

                  </note> which at firſt ſeem'd hazardous; and although after a while it prov'd without Danger, yet was it very troubleſom and difficult to be cur'd: ſo that by the Advice of his Phyſicians he ſayl'd to <hi>Velia,</hi> a Town in <hi>Italy,</hi> and there dwelt a long time near the Sea, where he enjoy'd all poſſible Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs. The <hi>Romans</hi> in the mean while long'd for his Return, and often times by their Speeches in the Theaters, gave pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Teſtimonies of their great Deſire and Impatience to ſee him. When therefore the time drew nigh, that a ſolemn Sacrifice was of neceſſity to be offer'd, and he found, as he thought, his Body ſtrong enough, he came back again to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd the Holy Rites with the reſt of the Prieſts, the People in the mean time crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about him, and congratulating his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.

and ſet him down to Dinner, when all on a ſudden, and when no Change was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, he fell into a raving Fit, and being quite depriv'd of his Senſes, the third day after ended his Life, in which he had wanted no manner of thing, which is thought to conduce to Happineſs. Nay, his very Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Pomp had ſomething in it remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and to be admir'd, and his Vertue was grac'd with the moſt ſolemn and happy Rites at his Burial; for theſe did not conſiſt of Gold and Ivory, or in the uſual Sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Splendor of ſuch Preparations, but in the Good-will, Honour and Love, not only of his fellow-Citizens, but of his Enemies themſelves. For as many <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, Ligurians,</hi> and <hi>Macedonians,</hi> as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to be preſent at the Solemnity, that were young, and of vigorous Bodies, took up the Bed and carry'd it, whilſt the more aged follow'd, calling <hi>Emilius</hi> the Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor and Preſerver of their Countries.

               <p>IF we conſider theſe two Heroes, as Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians have repreſented them to us, without doubt in the Compariſon very little difference will be found between 'em. They made War with two powerful Enemies: The one againſt the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and t'other againſt the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and the Succeſs was glorious. One conquer'd <hi>Macedon</hi> from the ſeventh ſucceeding Heir of <hi>Antigonus;</hi> the other freed <hi>Sicily</hi> from uſurping Tyrants, and reſtor'd that Iſle to its former Liberty. Unleſs this be diſputed for, that <hi>Emilius</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd with <hi>Perſeus,</hi> when his Forces were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and compos'd of ſuch Men as had often with Succeſs fought with the <hi>Romans:</hi> And that <hi>Timoleon</hi> found <hi>Dionyſius</hi> in a deſpairing condition, his Affairs being reduc'd to the laſt Extremity. On the contrary, this may
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:35952:122"/>
be ſaid in favour of <hi>Timoleor:</hi> That he van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd ſeveral Tyrants, and a powerful <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian</hi> Army, with an inconſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Men gather'd together from all Parts: Not with ſuch an Army as <hi>Emilius</hi> had, of well diſciplin'd Souldiers, experienc'd in War, and accuſtom'd to obey; but ſuch as through the hopes of Gain reſorted to him, unskill'd in Fighting and ungovernable. And when Actions are equally glorious, and the means to compaſs them unequal, the greateſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem is certainly due to that General who conquers with the ſmaller Power.</p>
               <p>Both have the Reputation of behaving themſelves with an uncorrupted Integrity, in all the Affairs they manag'd: But <hi>Emilius</hi> had the advantage of being from his Infancy, by the Laws and Cuſtoms of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, brought up to the well management of publick Affairs, which <hi>Timoleon</hi> wanted, but by uſe brought himſelf to. And this is plain; for at that time all the <hi>Romans</hi> were educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the greateſt Modeſty and Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and paid an inviolable Obſervance to the Laws of their Country: Whereas 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that not one of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Generals commanding in <hi>Sicily,</hi> cou'd keep himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted, except <hi>Dion,</hi> and of him they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a Jealouſie, that he wou'd eſtabliſh a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy there after the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> manner. <hi>Timaeus</hi> writes, that the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> ſent <hi>Gylippus</hi>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:35952:122"/>
home loaden with infamy, for his unſatiable Covetouſneſs, and the many Bribes he took when he commanded the Army. Divers Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians mention, that <hi>Pharax</hi> the <hi>Spartan,</hi> and <hi>Calippus</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> committed ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral wicked and treacherous Acts, deſigning to make themſelves Kings of <hi>Sicily.—</hi>But what were theſe Men, and what ſtrength had they to nouriſh ſo vain a Thought? For the firſt of them was a Follower of <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> when he was expell'd <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> and the other a hired Captain of Foot under <hi>Dion,</hi> and came into <hi>Sicily</hi> with him.—But <hi>Timoleon</hi> at the Requeſt and Prayers of the <hi>Syracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> was ſent to be their General, not ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Command, but when plac'd in his hands, managing it to the beſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and no ſooner had he reſtor'd <hi>Sicily</hi> to her Liberty, but he willingly reſign'd his Charge.</p>
               <p>This is truly worthy our Admiration in <hi>Emilius,</hi> That though he conquer'd ſo great and ſo rich a Realm as that of <hi>Macedon,</hi> yet he wou'd not touch, nor ſee any of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, nor did he advantage himſelf one far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by it, though he was very generous of his own to others.—This is not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd to reflect on <hi>Timoleon,</hi> for accepting of a fair Houſe and handſom Eſtate in the Countrey, which the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> preſented him with; for on that occaſion it was not
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:35952:123"/>
diſhoneſt to receive 'em: But yet there is greater glory in a Refuſal; and that is the ſupremeſt Vertue, which lets the praiſe of good Men be the Reward of its actions, and refuſes all gifts, how well ſoever it may have deſerv'd them. And as that Body is without doubt, the moſt ſtrong and health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, which can the eaſieſt ſupport extream Cold, and exceſſive Heat, in the change of Seaſons; and that the moſt firm and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected Mind, which is not puff'd up with Proſperity, nor dejected with Adverſity: ſo the Vertue of <hi>Emilius</hi> was eminently ſeen, in that his Countenance and Carriage was the ſame upon the loſs of two dear Sons, as when he atchiev'd his greateſt Victories and Triumphs. But <hi>Timoleon,</hi> after he had juſtly puniſh'd his Brother, a truly heroick Action, let his Reaſon yield to a cauſleſs Sorrow, and, dejected with Grief and Remorſe, he forbore for 20 years to appear in any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Place, or meddle with any Affairs o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THE Affairs of the <hi>Syracuſians,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Timoleon</hi> was ſent into <hi>Sicily,</hi> were in this poſture: After <hi>Dion</hi> had dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the Tyrant, he was ſlain
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:35952:125"/>
by Treachery, and thoſe that had aſſiſted him in delivering <hi>Syracuſe</hi> were divided among themſelves, ſo that the City, by a continual change of Governours, and a train of Miſchiefs that ſucceeded each other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came almoſt deſolate and forſaken. As for the reſt of <hi>Sicily,</hi> part thereof was now utterly deſtroy'd and ruin'd, through a long continuance of the Wars, and moſt of the Cities that had been left ſtanding, were ſeiz'd upon by a mix'd Company of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,</hi> and Souldiers under no Pay, that were ready to embrace every Turn of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Such being the ſtate of Things, <hi>Dionyſius</hi> takes the Opportunity, and in the tenth year of his Baniſhment, by the help of ſome foreign Troops he had got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, forces out <hi>Nyſaeus,</hi> then Maſter of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racuſe,</hi> recovers all afreſh, and was again ſettled in his Dominion. And as he had been at firſt ſtrangely depriv'd, of the greateſt and moſt abſolute Power that ever was, by a very ſmall Party, ſo now after a more wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manner, being an Exile, and of mean condition, he became the Soveraign Lord of thoſe that did eject him. All therefore that remain'd in <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> were made to ſerve under a Tyrant, who at the beſt was of an ungentle Nature, and that exaſperated them to a greater degree of Savageneſs, by the late Misfortunes and Calamities he had ſuffer'd
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:35952:125"/>
But thoſe of the better ſort, and ſuch as were of Note and Eminence, having timely retir'd thence to <hi>Icetes,</hi> that bore ſway over the <hi>Leontines,</hi> put themſelves under his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and choſe him for their General in the War; a Perſon hardly preferrable to any of thoſe that were open and avowed Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants: but they had no other Sanctuary at preſent, and it gave them ſome ground of confidence, that he was both of a <hi>Syracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Family, and had an Army beſides able to encounter that of <hi>Dionyſius.</hi> In the mean time the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> appear'd before <hi>Sicily</hi> with a great Navy, watching when and where they might make a Deſcent upon the Iſland; the terror of which Fleet, made the <hi>Sicilians</hi> incline to ſend an Embaſſy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Greece,</hi> that ſhould demand Succours from the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> whom they did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to and confide in rather than any others, not only upon the account of their near Kindred, and by reaſon of the great Benefits they had often receiv'd by truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them heretofore, but becauſe <hi>Corinth</hi> had ever ſhewn her ſelf an entire Lover of Freedom, and the moſt averſe from Tyranny, by the many noble Wars ſhe had engag'd in, not upon the ſcore of Empire and Avarice, but for the ſole Liberty of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> But <hi>Icetes,</hi> who made it the buſineſs of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, not ſo much to deliver the <hi>Syracuſians</hi>

But the foreſaid Embaſſadors being now arriv'd, and their Requeſt known, the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who were wont to have a particular Concern for all their Colonies and Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but eſpecially for that of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> ſince by good fortune too there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to moleſt them in their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, but they enjoy'd Peace and leiſure at that time, did readily and with one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord paſs a Vote for their Aſſiſtance.

when they were deliberating about the choice of a Captain for that Expedition, and the Magiſtrates of their City did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate and propoſe ſeveral Perſons, that had made it their Care and Study to be eſteem'd among them, one of the <hi>Plebei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ſtanding up, happen'd to name <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon,</hi> the Son of <hi>Timodemus,</hi> who had long ago left off to concern himſelf in publick Buſineſs, and had neither any hopes of, nor the leaſt pretenſion to an Employment of that nature; inſomuch that the thing was thought to proceed from a divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, and that ſome God or other had put it in the man's heart to mention him; ſo great an indulgence of Fortune did then immediately appear at his Election, and ſo much of her Favour did accompany his following Actions, as it were on purpoſe to recommend his worth, and add ſome grace and ornament to his perſonal Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. If you regard his Parentage, both <hi>Timodemus</hi> his Father, and his Mother <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mariſte,</hi> were of a Noble and Illuſtrious Rank in that City; as for himſelf, he was a mighty Lover of his Country, and one of admirable Meekneſs towards all, excepting that extream hatred he bore to Tyrants and wicked men. His Natural Abilities for the War were ſo happily temper'd, and of that excellent and even mixture, that, as a
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:35952:127"/>
rare and extraordinary Prudenee might be ſeen in all the Enterpriſes of his younger years<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo a ſtrange firmneſs of Mind, and the moſt undaunted Courage did attend him ſtill, even to the laſt Exploits of his declining Age. He had an Elder Brother, whoſe Name was <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mophanes,</hi> one of a different Make, and every way unlike him, being indiſcreet, and raſh, and corrupted with a Love of Monarchy, by the ſuggeſtion of ſome lewd Friends and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Souldiers, which he kept always about him. He ſeem'd to have a certain Force and Vehemence in all Attempts, and even to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in Dangers, whereby he took much with the People, and upon that account did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſpire, but was advanc'd to the higheſt Charges, as a vigorous and effective Warriour; for the obtaining of which Offices and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, <hi>Timoleon</hi> did very much aſſiſt him, who either help'd wholly to conceal his Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and Defaults, or at leaſt to leſſen and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh thoſe he was thought guilty of, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide this, took care to magnifie and adorn whatever was commendable in him, and ſet off his good Qualities to the beſt advantage.

While this Diſcovery was made, he that kill'd the other Conſpirator, had been fetch'd down from his Sanctuary of the Rock, who loudly and often proteſted as he came along, that there was no Injuſtice in the Fact, for he only took righteous Vengeance for his Father's Blood, of a Man that had murder'd him before in the City of

now as it were a Camp of theſe <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</hi> By this means the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that kept the Caſtle, found themſelves brought into great Danger and Hardſhip; for beſide that their Proviſion grew ſcarce, and they began to be in want, becauſe the Havens were ſtrictly guarded and block'd up, the Enemy did excerciſe them ſtill with Skirmiſhes and Combats about their Walls, and they were not only oblig'd to be continually in Arms, but to divide and prepare themſelves for Aſſaults and Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of every kind, and to ſuſtain the ſhock of all thoſe forcible Engines and Inſtruments of Battery, which are devis'd and made uſe of by ſuch as beſiege Cities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Timoleon</hi> however made a ſhift to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them in theſe Straits, ſending Corn from <hi>Catana</hi> by ſmall Fiſher-Boats and little Skiffs, which commonly got a Paſſage through the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Galleys in the moſt tempeſtuous ſeaſon, creeping over the Waves and Billows, and ſtealing up to the Caſtle, when thoſe other were driven and diſpers'd by the ſtreſs of weather: which <hi>Mago</hi> and <hi>Icetes</hi> obſerving, they agreed to fall upon <hi>Catana,</hi> from whence theſe Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies were brought in to the Beſieged, and accordingly put off from <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> taking with them their prime choſen Men, and the ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Souldiers in their whole Army.

the <hi>Corinthian,</hi> (who was Captain of thoſe that kept the Cittadel) taking notice that the Enemies which ſtay'd there behind, were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry negligent and careleſs in keeping Guard, made a ſudden Sally upon them as they lay ſcatter'd, wherein killing ſome, and putting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to Flight, he took and poſſeſs'd that Quarter which they call <hi>Acradina,</hi> and was thought to be the beſt and ſtrongeſt, and the moſt entire part of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> a City made up and compacted as it were of ſeveral Towns put together: having thus ſtor'd himſelf with Corn and Money, he did not abandon the Place, nor retire again into the Caſtle, but fortifying the Precincts of <hi>Acradina,</hi> and joyning it by certain Works to the Cittadel, he undertook the defence of both. <hi>Mago</hi> and <hi>Icetes</hi> were now come near to <hi>Catana,</hi> when a Horſe-man diſpatch'd from <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> brought them tidings that <hi>Acradina</hi> was taken; upon which they return'd in all haſte with great Diſorder and Confuſion, having neither been able to reduce the City they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, nor to preſerve that they were Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of.</p>

vacant hours, and upon any ceſſation of Arms; who being all <hi>Greeks,</hi> and having no Cauſe of private Enmity to each other, as they would venture bravely in Fight, ſo in the times of Truce, they did meet and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe amicably together; and at that ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, happening to be employ'd about the common buſineſs of Fiſhing, they fell into va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Conference, ſome expreſſing their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration as to the nature and fruitfulneſs of that Sea, and others telling how much they were taken with the Convenience, and commodious ſcituation of the adjacent Places, which gave a hint to one of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthian</hi> Party to demand thus of the others: <hi>And is it poſſible that you who are</hi> Grecians <hi>born, ſhould be ſo forward to reduce a City of this Greatneſs, and endu'd with ſo many rare Advantages, into the ſtate of Barbariſm? and lend your Aſſiſtance to plant</hi> Carthaginians, <hi>that are the worſt and bloodieſt of men, ſo much nearer to us; whereas you ſhould rather wiſh there were many more</hi> Sicilies <hi>to lye between them and</hi> Greece: <hi>have you ſo little ſenſe as to believe, that they come hither with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my from</hi> Hercules his Pillars, <hi>and the</hi> At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantick Sea, <hi>to hazard themſelves for the eſtabliſhment of</hi> Icetes? <hi>who if he had had the Conſideration which becomes a General, would never have thrown out his Anceſtors and Founders, to bring in the Enemies of his</hi>

                  <hi>Countrey in the room of them, but might have enjoy'd all ſuitable Honour and Command, with conſent of</hi> Timoleon <hi>and the reſt of</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth. The <hi>Greeks</hi> that were in Pay with <hi>Icetes,</hi> noiſing theſe Diſcourſes about their Camp, gave <hi>Mago</hi> ſome ground to ſuſpect (who had long ſought for a Pretence to be gone) that there was Treachery contriv'd againſt him; ſo that albeit <hi>Icetes</hi> entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to tarry, and made it appear how much ſtronger they were than the Enemy, yet conceiving they came far more ſhort of <hi>Timoleon,</hi> both as to Courage and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, than they did ſurpaſs him in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, he preſently went aboard, and ſet Sayl for <hi>Africa,</hi> letting <hi>Sicily</hi> eſcape out of his hands with diſhonour to himſelf, and for ſuch unknown Cauſes, that no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Reaſon could give an account of his departure. The day after he went away, <hi>Timoleon</hi> came up before the City, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for a Battel; but when he and his Company both heard of their ſudden Flight, and ſaw the Haven empty, they could not forbear laughing at the Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe of <hi>Mago,</hi> and by way of Mockery caus'd Proclamation to be made through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, that he ſhould have a good Reward for his Intelligence, who could bring them tidings whither it was that the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Fleet had convey'd it ſelf from them.
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:35952:145"/>
However <hi>Icetes</hi> reſolving to fight it out alone, and not quitting his hold of the City, but ſticking cloſe to thoſe Quarters he was in poſſeſſion of, as Places that were well fortifi'd, and not eaſie to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd, <hi>Timoleon</hi> divided his Forces into three parts, and fell upon that ſide himſelf, where the River <hi>Anapus</hi> run, and which was moſt ſtrong and difficult of acceſs, commanding others that were led by <hi>Iſias,</hi> a <hi>Corinthian</hi> Captain, to make their Aſſault from the Poſt of <hi>Acradina,</hi> while <hi>Dinarchus</hi> and <hi>Demaretus,</hi> that brought him the laſt Supply from <hi>Corinth,</hi> ſhould with a third Diviſion attempt that Quarter which is call'd <hi>Epipolae.</hi> So that a forcible Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion being made from every ſide at once, by which the Souldiers of <hi>Icetes</hi> were beaten off and put to flight, that the City now came to be taken by Storm, and fall ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly into their hands, upon ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat and Receſſion of the Enemy, we muſt in all juſtice aſcribe this to the Valour of the Combatants, and the wiſe Conduct of their General; but that not ſo much as a Man of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> was either ſlain or wounded in the Action, that the Good Fortune of <hi>Timoleon</hi> ſeems to challenge for her own Work, and boaſt of the Protection, as ſtriving out of a jealous Fondneſs, to exceed and obſcure his Fortitude by her
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:35952:145"/>
extraordinary Favours, that thoſe who hear him commended for his noble Deeds, may rather admire the Happineſs, than the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of them: for the Fame of what was done, did not only paſs through all <hi>Sicily,</hi> and run over <hi>Italy</hi> in a trice, but even <hi>Greece</hi> it ſelf after a few days came to ring alſo with the greatneſs of his Exploit, inſomuch that thoſe of <hi>Corinth,</hi> who could hardly believe their Auxiliaries were yet landed on the Iſle, had tidings brought them at the ſame time that they were ſafe and Conquerors; in ſo proſperous a courſe did Affairs run, while Fortune added haſte and quickneſs as a new Ornament, to ſet off the native Luſtres of that Performance. <hi>Timoleon</hi> being Maſter of the Cittadel, did avoid the Error which <hi>Dion</hi> had been guilty of before; for he ſpar'd not that Place for the beauty and ſumptuouſneſs of its Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, but declining the Cauſes of that Suſpicion, which did firſt ſlander, and then deſtroy him, he made a publick Cryer give notice, that all the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> who were willing to have a hand in the Work, ſhould bring Pick-axes and Mattocks, and other Inſtruments, and help him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh that Fortreſs of Tyranny. When they all came up with one accord, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon that order and that day, as the ſureſt foundation of their Liberty, they
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:35952:146"/>
not only pull'd down the Caſtle, but over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd the Palaces and Monuments adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and whatever elſe might preſerve any Memory of former Tyrants. Having ſoon levell'd and clear'd the Place, he there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently erected a Common-Hall, for the Seat of Judicature, gratifying the Citizens by this means, and building Popular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment on the Fall and Ruine of Tyranny. But ſince he had recover'd a City, that was now deſtitute of Inhabitants, ſome of them periſhing in their Civil Wars and Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, and others being fled to eſcape Tyrants, through Solitude and want of People, the great Market-place of <hi>Syracuſe</hi> was overgrown with ſuch quantity of rank Herbage, that it became a Paſture for their Horſes, the Grooms lying along in the Graſs as they fed by them; inaſmuch alſo as other Towns, (very few excepted) were become full of Stags and Wild Boars, and ſuch as had nothing elſe to do, went fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a Hunting, and found Game in the Suburbs and about the Walls: but not a Man of thoſe who had poſſeſs'd themſelves of Caſtles, or made Gariſons in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, could be perſwaded to quit their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Abode, or would accept an Invitation of returning back into the City, ſo much did they all dread and abhor the very Name of Aſſemblies, and Corporations, and Tribunals,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:35952:146"/>
that did produce the greater part of thoſe Uſurpers, which had ſucceſſively aſſum'd a Dominion over them. <hi>Timoleon</hi> therefore, with the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> that remain'd, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that vaſt Deſolation, and how little hope there was to have it otherwiſe ſupplied, thought good to write unto the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> that they would ſend a Colony out of <hi>Greece</hi> to re-people <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> for elſe the Land about it would lye fallow and unimprov'd; and beſide this Inconvenience, they did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be involv'd in a greater War, from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,</hi> having News brought them, that when <hi>Mago</hi> had kill'd himſelf, the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> out of Rage for his ill Conduct in the late Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, did cauſe his Body to be nail'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Croſs, and that they were raiſing a mighty Force, with deſign to make their Deſcent upon <hi>Sicily</hi> the next Summer. Theſe Letters from <hi>Timoleon</hi> being deliver'd at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> and the Ambaſſadours of <hi>Syracuſe</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching them at the ſame time, that they would take upon them the Care of their poor City, and once again become the Founders of it, the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were not tempted by a greedy Humour to lay hold of that Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, nor did they ſeize and appropriate ſuch a famous City to themſelves, but going about firſt to thoſe Games and Exerciſes, which they term ſacred in <hi>Greece,</hi> and their ſolemn Meetings of greateſt Confluence,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:35952:147"/>
they made Publication by Heralds, that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> having deſtroy'd the Uſurpation that was at <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> and driven out the Tyrant, did thereby call home the <hi>Syracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Exiles, and any other <hi>Sicilian</hi> that would come and dwell in the City, to an enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of freedom under their own Laws, with promiſe that the Land ſhould be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided among them in juſt and equal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions. And after this, ſending Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers into <hi>Aſia,</hi> and the ſeveral Iſlands, where they underſtood that moſt of the ſcatter'd Fugitives did then reſide, they made it their Requeſt, that they would all repair to <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> upon aſſurance that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> would afford them Veſſels, and Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and a ſafe Convoy, at their own Charges; which noble Atchievment of theirs, and ſuch a generous Propoſal, being thus ſpread about, they had the due Tribute, and moſt honourable Recompence of Praiſe and Benediction, for delivering the Countrey from Oppreſſors, and ſaving it from <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,</hi> and reſtoring it at length to the rightful Owners of the Place; who whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Syracuſe</hi> being thus happily reviv'd, and repleniſh'd again by a general Concourſe of its Inhabitants from all Parts, <hi>Timoleon</hi> was deſirous now to reſcue other Cities from the like Bondage, yea even wholly and once for
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:35952:148"/>
all to extirpate Arbitrary Government out of <hi>Sicily;</hi> and for this purpoſe, marching into the Territories of thoſe that us'd it, he compell'd <hi>Icetes</hi> firſt to renounce the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian</hi> Intereſt, and further to conſent, that, demoliſhing the Fortreſſes which were held by him, he ſhould live among the <hi>Leon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinians</hi> as a private Perſon. <hi>Leptines</hi> alſo, the Tyrant of <hi>Apollonia,</hi> and divers other little Towns, after ſome Reſiſtance made, ſeeing the danger he was in to be taken by Force, ſurrender'd himſelf; wherupon <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moleon</hi> ſpar'd his Life, and ſent him away to <hi>Corinth,</hi> counting it a very glorious thing both for himſelf and Countrey, that their Mother-City ſhould expoſe thoſe <hi>Sicilian</hi> Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants to the view of other <hi>Greeks</hi> living now in an Exil'd, and a low condition. After this he return'd to <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> that he might have leiſure to attend the Conſtitution of their Community, and aſſiſt <hi>Cephalus</hi> and <hi>Dionyſius</hi> (who were ſent from <hi>Corinth</hi> to make Laws) in eſtabliſhing the principal Things, and the beſt Orders for a publick Settlement. In the mean while, having a mind that his hired Souldiers ſhould not want Action, but rather enrich themſelves by ſome Plunder from the Enemy, he diſpatch'd <hi>Dinarchus</hi> and <hi>Demaretus</hi> with a ſelect Body of them, into a certain Province that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> who obliging
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:35952:148"/>
ſeveral Cities to revolt from the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> did not only live in great abundance them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but rais'd Money from their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and their Prey to carry on the War. But when theſe Matters were tranſacting, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> landed at the Promontory of <hi>Lilybaeum,</hi> bringing with them an Army of 70000 Men, aboard 200 Galleys, beſides a 1000 other Veſſels, laden all with En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines of Battery, and Chariots, and quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Corn, and other military Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as if they did intend not to manage the War by piece-meal, and in parts as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, but to drive the <hi>Grecians</hi> altogether and at once out of all <hi>Sicily.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was a Force ſufficient to ſeize and ſubdue the <hi>Sicilians,</hi> though they had then had the Entireneſs and the Strength of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Union among themſelves, and much more when they were ſo infeebled through their own Diſtempers, and haraſs'd in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by one another. Hearing therefore that a Territory of their Dependance was laid waſte, they preſently made toward the <hi>Corinthians</hi> with great Fury, having. <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> and <hi>Hamilcar</hi> for their Generals; the report of whoſe multitude and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach flying ſuddenly to <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> they were ſo terrifi'd there at the greatneſs of ſuch a Power, that hardly 3000, among ſo many Myriads of them, had the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:35952:149"/>
to take up Arms, and joyn themſelves with <hi>Timoleon.</hi> The Strangers that ſerv'd for Pay, were not above 4000 in all, and about a 1000 of thoſe grew faint-hearted by the way, and forſook <hi>Timoleon</hi> in his March toward the Enemy, looking on him as a frantick and diſtracted Perſon, deſtitute of that Senſe and Conſideration, which might have been expected from one of his Age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who muſt needs venture out againſt an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of 70000 Men, with no more than 5000 Foot, and a 1000 Horſe, and when he ſhould have ſtay'd to defend the City with the ſmall Forces which he had, choſe rather to remove them eight days journey from <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> ſo that if they were beaten out of the Field, there was no Place of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat whither they might retire with ſafety, or, if they happen'd to die upon the ſpot, there would be none to take care of their Burial. <hi>Timoleon</hi> however reckon'd it ſome kind of Advantage, that they had thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd themſelves before the Battel, and encouraging the reſt, he led them with all ſpeed to the River <hi>Crimeſus,</hi> where it was told him the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were drawn together; and as he was march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up an Aſcent, from the top of which they might take a view of the Army, and ſtrength of the Enemy, there met him by chance a company of Mules
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:35952:149"/>
loaden with Parſly, that which his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers conceiv'd to be an ominous Occurrence or ill-boding Token, becauſe this is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Herb wherewith we uſually adorn the Sepulchres of the Dead, which Cuſtom gave birth to that deſparing Proverb, when we pronounce of one who is dangerouſly ſick, that he has need of nothing but Parſly, which is in effect to ſay, He is a dead Man, and ready for his Grave. Now that <hi>Timoleon</hi> might eaſe their Minds, and free them from theſe ſuperſtitious Thoughts, and ſuch a fearful Expectation, he put a ſtop to his March, and having alledg'd many other things in a Diſcourſe ſuitable to the Occaſion, he concluded it by ſaying, That a Garland of Triumph was here luckily brought them, and had fallen into their hands of its own accord, as an Anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Victory; inaſmuch as the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> do crown thoſe that get the better in their <hi>Iſthmian</hi> Games, with Chaplets of Parſly, accounting it a ſacred Wreath, and proper to their Countrey; for Parſly was ever then the conquering Ornament of the <hi>Iſthmian,</hi> as it is now of the <hi>Nemean</hi> Sports, and it is not very long that Branches of the Pine-tree came to ſucceed, and be made uſe of for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Timoleon</hi> therefore, as I ſaid, having thus
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:35952:150"/>
beſpoke his Souldiers, took part of the Parſly, wherewith he made himſelf a Chaplet firſt, and then his Captains and their Companies did all crown themſelves with it, in imitation of their Leader. The Soothſayers then obſerving alſo two Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles on the wing toward them, one of which bore a Dragon ſtruck through with her Talons, and the other, as ſhe flew, made a great and terrible kind of noiſe, which argu'd Boldneſs and Aſſurance, they preſently ſhew'd them to the Souldiers, who with one conſent fell to ſupplicate the Gods, and call them in to their Aſſiſtance. It was now about the beginning of Summer, and concluſion of the Month call'd <note n="*" place="margin">

When the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> were mounted and ſtood upon it, and had laid down their Bucklers to take breath and repoſe themſelves, the Sun coming about, and drawing up the Vapours from below, the groſs foggy Air that was now gather'd and condens'd above, did
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:35952:150"/>
overcloud the Mountains, and all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Places being clear and open, the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Crimeſus</hi> appear'd to them again, and they could eaſily deſery the Enemies paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing over it, who mov'd in this order: Firſt with their warlike Chariots, that were ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly appointed for the Conflict; after theſe came 10000 Foot-men, with white Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets on their Arms, whom they gueſs'd to be all <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> from the ſplendour of their Weapons, and the ſlowneſs of their motion, and the order of their March; and when ſeveral other Nations, flowing in behind them, did throng for Paſſage in a turbulent and unruly manner, <hi>Timoleon</hi> perceiving that the River gave them op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to ſingle out as many of their Enemies, as they had a mind to engage at once, and bidding his Souldiers obſerve how their Forces were divided into two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Bodies by the intervention of the Stream, ſome being already got over, and others ſtill to ford it, he gave <hi>Demaretus</hi> Command to fall in upon the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> with his Horſe, and diſturb their Ranks, before they ſhould be caſt into a form of Battel: and coming down into the Plain himſelf, he made up his right and left Wing of other <hi>Sicilians,</hi> intermingling a few Strangers in each, but plac'd the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of <hi>Syracuſe</hi> in the middle, with the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:35952:151"/>
ſtouteſt Mercenaries he had, about his own Perſon, and then ſtay'd a little to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Action of his Horſe; but when he ſaw they were not only hindred from grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> by thoſe armed Chariots that run to and fro before their Army, but forc'd continually to wheel about, to avoid the danger of having their Ranks broken, and then to make frequent Careers, as they had means to return upon them, he took his Buckler in his hand, and crying out to the Foot, that they ſhould follow him with Courage and Confidence, he ſeem'd to ſpeak with a more than humane Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and a Voice ſtronger than ordinary; whether he ſtrain'd it to that loudneſs, through an apprehenſion of the preſent danger, and from the vehemence and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of his mind to aſſault the Enemy, or elſe (as many then were of opinion) ſome God or other did exclaim with him in ſuch a thundring Utterance. When his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers gave a dreadful Eccho thereto, and beſought him to lead them on without any further delay, he made a ſign to the Horſe, that they ſhould draw off from the Front where they had plac'd the Chariots, and fetching a ſide compaſs, attack the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in the Flank; then making his Vant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard firm, by joyning Man to Man, and Buckler to Buckler, he caus'd the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:35952:151"/>
to ſound, and ſo bore in with the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians;</hi> who did ſtoutly receive and ſuſtain his firſt Onſet; for having their Bodies arm'd with Breaſt-plates of Iron, and Helmets of Braſs, beſide great Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers to cover and ſecure them, they could eaſily repel the force of their Javelins: but when the buſineſs came to a deciſion by the Sword, where Maſtery depends no leſs upon Art than Strength, all on a ſudden there broke out terrible Thunders and fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Flaſhes, darting forth from the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain tops; after which, the Gloomineſs that hover'd about the upper Grounds and the rocky Cliffs, deſcending to the Place of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, and bringing a Tempeſt of Rain, and of Wind and Hail along with it, was driven upon the <hi>Greeks</hi> behind, and fell only at their Backs, but diſcharg'd it ſelf in the very Face of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and through the ſtormy Showers, and continual Flames pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down together from the Clouds, did dazle and confound their ſight: in which Accident, there were many things that did ſorely afflict them all, but chiefly their unexperienc'd Men, who had not been us'd to ſuch Hardſhips, among which the very Claps of Thunder, and the ſounding noiſe of their Weapons, beaten with the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of Rain and Hail-ſtones, were not their leaſt Annoyance, as that which kept them

But there happen'd a ſtrange Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and Diſpute among the Officers of <hi>Timoleon,</hi> which did a little retard the Conflict, for there was none of them that would let another paſs over before him to engage the Enemy, but every one did challenge it as a Right, to venture firſt and begin the Onſet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that their fording over was like to be tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous and without order, while they did mutually juſtle and preſs forward, ſtriving which ſhould be the foremoſt. <hi>Timoleon</hi> therefore deſiring this Controverſie might be decided by Lot, took a Ring from each of the Pretenders, which he caſt into his own Robe, and having ſhak'd them together, the firſt he drew out and expos'd to view, had by good Fortune the Figure of a Trophy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven for the Seal of it, which when the younger Captains ſaw, they all ſhouted for

It was not long after that <hi>Timoleon</hi> marching up to the City of <hi>Leontium,</hi> took <hi>Icetes</hi> alive, and his Son <hi>Eupolemus,</hi> and <hi>Euthymus</hi> the Commander of his Horſe, that were bound and brought to him by their own Souldiers: <hi>Icetes,</hi> with the Stripling his Son, were then executed as Tyrants and Traytors; and <hi>Euthymus,</hi> though a brave Man, and one of ſingular Courage, was ſlain without Mercy, being charg'd with ſome contemptuous Language that had been us'd by him, in diſparagement of the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> for it is ſaid, that when they firſt ſent their Forces into <hi>Sicily,</hi> he told the People of <hi>Leontium</hi> in a Speech of his, <hi>That the News did not ſound terrible, nor was any great danger to be fear'd—If the</hi> Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian <note place="margin">N.</note>

who ſeizing on his Perſon, and bringing his Children from School into the Theatre, to be entertain'd as it were with the moſt goodly Spectacle of a Tyrant puniſhed, they firſt publickly ſcourg'd, and then put him to death.

he did ſo civilize, and quiet, and reform the Country, and render it ſo deſirable to all men, that even Strangers now came by Sea to inhabit thoſe Towns and Places, which their own Citizens had forſaken and left deſolate: for <hi>Agrigentum</hi> and <hi>Gelo,</hi> two famous Cities, that had been ruin'd and laid waſte by the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> after the <hi>Attick</hi> War, were then peopled again, the one by <hi>Megellus</hi> and <hi>Pheriſtus,</hi> that came from <hi>Elea</hi> in <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> the other by <hi>Gorgus</hi> from <hi>Cea,</hi> one of the Iſles called <hi>Cyclades,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving pick'd up ſome of the old Inhabitants among other Company, brought them back with the reſt to their former Dwellings; to all which <hi>Timoleon</hi> did not only afford a ſecure and peaceable Abode in their new Settlement, after ſo obſtinate a War, but making proviſion of other Neceſſaries, and giving them a chearful Aſſiſtance in all things, he had the ſame Love and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect from them, as if he had been their Founder; which Inclination and Eſteem for him running through all the reſt of the <hi>Sicili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> there was no Propoſal for Peace, nor Sanction by Law, nor Aſſignation of Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, nor any Form and Order of Government, which they did acquieſce in, or could think well of, unleſs he were at the end of it, as a chief Architect to finiſh and adorn the Work, ſupperadding ſome graceful Touches

                  <hi>Sicily</hi> from its old Grievances and Miſchiefs, and inteſtine Diſtempers, and given it up free to the native Inhabitants, his Eyes began to fail him, as he grew in Age, and a while after he became perfectly blind; not that he had done any thing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf which might occaſion this Defect, or was depriv'd of his Sight by any outrage of Fortune, but it ſeems to have been ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred and hereditary weakneſs that was foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in natural Cauſes, which by length of time came to diſcover it ſelf; for it is ſaid, that divers of his Kindred and Family were ſubject to the like gradual Decay, and loſt all uſe of their Eyes, as he did, in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining years, but <hi>Athanis</hi> the Hiſtorian tells us, that even during the War againſt <hi>Hippo</hi> and <hi>Mamercus,</hi> while he was in his Camp at <hi>Myloe,</hi> there appear'd a white Speck within his Eye, from whence all did foreſee the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Blindneſs that was coming on him; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this did not hinder him then from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing the Siege, and proſecuting that War, till he got both the Tyrants into his power; but upon his coming back to <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently reſign'd the Authority of ſole Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and beſought the Citizens to excuſe him from any further Service, ſeeing things were already brought to ſo fair an iſſue. Now it is not ſo much to be wondred, that he himſelf ſhould bear the Misfortune without any

marks of Trouble, but that Reſpect and Gratitude which the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> ſhow'd him when he was ſtark blind, may juſtly deſerve our Admiration, going themſelves to viſit him in Troops, and bringing all the Strangers that travel'd through their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, to his Houſe and Mannor, that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo might have the pleaſure to ſee their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Benefactor; making it the great matter of their Joy and Exultation, that, when, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo many brave and happy Exploits, he might have return'd with Triumph into <hi>Greece,</hi> he ſhould deſpiſe all the glorious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations that were there made to receive him, and by a ſtrange kind of Endearment, choſe rather to abide there, and end his days among them: whereas therefore ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things were decreed and done in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Timoleon,</hi> I reckon this Vote of the <hi>Syracuſians,</hi> to be a ſignal Teſtimony of their value for him, <hi>viz.</hi> that when-ever they did happen to be at War with any foreign Nation, they ſhould make uſe of none but a <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> General; and the method of their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Council, was a handſome demonſtration of the ſame Deference for his Perſon; for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining Matters of leſs Conſequence them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they ever called him to adviſe in the more difficult Caſes, and ſuch as were of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er moment; who being carry'd through the Market-place in a Litter, and that brought with

him ſitting into the Theatre, the People with one Voice ſaluted him by his Name; then returning that Civility, and pauſing for a time, till the noiſe of their Gratulations and Bleſſings began to ceaſe, after hearing the Buſineſs in Debate, he deliver'd his Opinion, which being confirm'd by a general Suffrage, his Servants went back with the Litter through the midſt of their Aſſembly, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple waiting on him out with Acclamations and Applauſes, and ſo returning to conſider of ſuch publick Cauſes, as they us'd to diſpatch in his abſence; being thus cheriſh'd in his old Age, and with that Honour and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence as if he had been their common Father, he was ſeiz'd with a very ſlight In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition, which however did aſſiſt and enable Time to put a period to his Life. There was an Allotment then of certain days given, within the ſpace whereof the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> were to provide what-ever ſhould be neceſſary for his Burial, and all the neighbouring Inhabitants and Sojourners were to make their Appearance in a Body; ſo that the Funeral Pomp was ſet out with great Splendor and Magnificence in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reſpects, and the Herſe being deck'd with rich Ornaments and Trophies of War, was born by a ſelect number of young Gentlemen, over that Ground where the Palace and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> ſtood, before they were

<pb n="318" facs="tcp:35952:164"/>
Fellow, but of an ill Complexion, and very meager; and the King asking the Cauſe of his Paleneſs, and underſtanding from him that 'twas a ſecret Diſeaſe, he ſtrictly commanded his Phyſicians to imploy their utmoſt Skill, and recover him, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: but this brave Fellow being cur'd, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver afterward ſought Danger, never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd venturous in a Battel; inſomuch that <hi>Antigonus</hi> wondred, and upbraided him with his Change: but the Man told him the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſaid, <hi>Sir, You are the Cauſe of my Cowardiſe, by freeing me from thoſe Miſeries, which made me deſpiſe Life.</hi> And upon the ſame account, the <hi>Sybarite</hi> ſeems to have ſaid concerning the <hi>Spartans, That 'twas no commendable thing in them to die in the Wars, ſince by that they were freed from ſuch hard Labour, and miſerable Diet;</hi> but in truth the <hi>Sybarites,</hi> a ſoft and diſſolute People, might imagine that they hated Life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in their eager purſuit of Vertue and Glory they were not afraid to die: yet the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> eſteem it a Vertue to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling either to die or live, as that <hi>Epicedium</hi> teſtifies:
<q>
                     <l>They dy'd, but not as laviſh of their Blood,</l>
                     <l>Or thinking Death it ſelf was ſimply good;</l>
                     <l>Or Life, both theſe the ſtricteſt Vertue try'd,</l>
                     <l>And as that call'd, they gladly liv'd, or dy'd.</l>
                  </q>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:35952:164"/>
For an Endeavour to avoid Death is not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendable, if we do not baſely deſire to live; nor willingneſs to die good and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, if it proceeds from a Contempt of Life: and therefore <hi>Homer</hi> always takes care to bring his brave and ſtout Men well arm'd into the Battel; and the <hi>Greek</hi> Law-givers puniſh'd thoſe that threw away their Shields, but not him that loſt his Sword or Spear, intimating, that they ſhould be more careful to defend themſelves, than of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their Enemies. This every one ought to mind, but eſpecially a Governour of a City, or a General; for if, as <hi>Iphicrates</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides, the light arm'd are the Hands; the Horſe the Feet; the Infantry the Breaſt; and the General the Head; when he puts himſelf upon danger, he doth not only venture his own Perſon, but all thoſe whoſe ſafety de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on his; and ſo on the contrary. And therefore <hi>Callicratides,</hi> though in other things a great Man, did not anſwer the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur</hi> well, who advis'd him, the Sacrifice being unlucky, to be careful of his Life; <hi>Sparta,</hi> ſays he, <hi>doth not conſiſt in one Man:</hi> 'tis true, <hi>Callicratides</hi> in any Engagement either at Sea or Land, was but a ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but being General, he ſeem'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Life of all, and ſo muſt be more than one, ſince by his Death ſo many muſt be ruin'd. But better was the Saying of
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:35952:165"/>
old <hi>Antigonus,</hi> who when he was to fight at <hi>Andros,</hi> and one told him, <hi>The Enemies Ships are more than ours;</hi> reply'd, <hi>For how many then wilt thou reckon me?</hi> intimating, that a ſtout and experienc'd Commander is highly to be valued, whoſe principal care it is to ſave him that preſerves the reſt: and therefore I applaud <hi>Timotheus,</hi> who when <hi>Chares</hi> ſhow'd the Wounds he had receiv'd, and his Shield pierc'd by a Dart, told him, <hi>Indeed I ſhould have been aſham'd, if when I fought againſt</hi> Samos, <hi>a Dart ſhould have fallen near me, as behaving my ſelf more raſhly than became a General of ſuch an Army.</hi> Indeed where the General's hazarding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf will do a great deal of good, there he muſt fight and venture his Perſon, and not mind their Maxims; who would have a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſtill die with Age, or at leaſt an old Man; but when the Advantage will be but ſmall if he gets the better, and the Loſs conſiderable if he falls, who then would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that good which a common Souldier might perform, with the danger of the Commander? This I thought fit to premiſe before the Lives of <hi>Pelopidas</hi> and <hi>Marcellus,</hi> who were both great Men, but both ruin'd by their Raſhneſs; for being ſtout Men, and having gotten their Countrey great Glory and Reputation by their Conduct, and fighting againſt terrible Enemies, the
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:35952:165"/>
one (as Hiſtory delivers) overthrew <hi>Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi> who was till then invincible; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a ſet Battel beat the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> the Commanders at Sea and Land; but they ventur'd too far, and were heedleſly prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal of their Lives, when there was the greateſt need of ſuch Men, and ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders: and this Agreement in their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and their Deaths, is the Reaſon why I compare their Lives.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pelopidas,</hi> the Son of <hi>Hippoclus,</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, as likewiſe <hi>Epaminondas</hi> was, from an honourable Family in <hi>Thebes;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Pelopidas <hi>of a good Family.</hi>
                  </note> bred in Gallantry, and having a fair Eſtate left him whilſt he was young, he made it his buſineſs to relieve the good and deſerving amongſt the Poor, that he might ſhew himſelf Lord and not Slave to his Eſtate. For amongſt Men, (as <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> obſerves) ſome are too narrow-minded to uſe their Wealth, and ſome are looſe, and abuſe it; and theſe live perpetual Slaves to their Pleaſures, the others to their Gain. Others permitted themſelves to be oblig'd by <hi>Pelopidas,</hi> and thankfully made uſe of his Liberality and Kindneſs; but amongſt all his Friends, he could never perſwade <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas</hi> to be a ſharer in his Wealth; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſtepp'd down into his Poverty, and pleas'd himſelf in mean Attire, ſpare Diet, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied diligence in labour, and plain-dealing
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:35952:166"/>
in the Art of War: like <hi>Capaneus</hi> in <hi>Euripi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> who had abundance of Wealth, but no Pride with it; he was aſham'd any one ſhould think that he ſpent more upon his Body than the meaneſt <hi>Theban. Epaminondas</hi> made his familiar and hereditary Poverty more light and eaſie, by his Philoſophy and ſingle Life, but <hi>Pelopidas</hi> was match'd to a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of a good Family, and got Children; but yet ſtill forgetful of the main Chance, <note place="margin">Careleſs of his Eſtate.</note> and ſpending all his time on the Publick, he ruin'd his Eſtate; and when his Friends ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd him, and told him, <hi>That Money, which he now neglected, was a neceſſary thing; Yes,</hi> he reply'd, <hi>'tis neceſſary to that ſame</hi> Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus, <hi>pointing to a Cripple.</hi> Both ſeem'd equally born to all ſorts of Vertue, but Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe chiefly delighted <hi>Pelopidas,</hi> Learning <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> and the one ſpent his ſpare hours in Hunting, and the <hi>Paleſtra,</hi> the other in hearing Lectures or Philoſophizing.

Confuſion, what Envy, what mutual Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie appears? And then if he caſts an eye on the Kindneſs and Reverence that <hi>Pelopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> ſhew'd <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> he muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that theſe are more truely and more juſtly ſtyl'd Companions in Government and Command than the others, who ſtrove rather to overcome one another, than their Enemies. But the true cauſe of this was their Vertue; upon whoſe account they did not make their Actions aim at Wealth and Glory, which troubleſome and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Envy neceſſarily attends, but both from the beginning being inflam'd with a divine deſire of ſeeing their Countrey glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious by their Endeavours, they us'd to that end one anothers Excellencies as their own. Many indeed think, this ſtrict and entire Friendſhip is to be dated from the Battel at <hi>Mantinea,</hi> where they both fought being part of thoſe Succors that were ſent from <hi>Thebes</hi> to the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> their then Friends and Allies; for being plac'd together amongſt the Infantry, end enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> when the <hi>Lacedaemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Wing, in which they fought, gave Ground, and many fled, they joyn'd one another, and reſiſted the Invaders. <hi>Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidas</hi> having receiv'd ſeven Wounds in the fore-part of his Body, fell upon an heap of ſlain Friends and Enemies; but <hi>Epaminondas,</hi>

The Meſſenger's Name was <hi>Clidon,</hi> who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home preſently, and bringing out his Horſe, ask'd for the Bridle; but his Wife being at a Stand, and when it could not be found, telling him ſhe had lent it to a Friend, firſt they began to chide, then curſe one another, and his Wife wiſh'd the Journey might prove ill to him, and thoſe that ſent him; inſomuch that <hi>Clidon</hi>'s paſſion made him ſpend moſt of the day in theſe Brawls, and then looking on this Chance as an Omen, he laid aſide all thoughts of his Journey, and heeded other Buſineſs: ſo near had theſe great and glorious Deſigns, even in their very Birth, loſt their opportunity. But
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:35952:169"/>
                  <hi>Pelopidas</hi> and his Companions dreſſing themſelves like Clowns, divided, and whilſt it was yet day, entered at ſeveral Quarters of the City; beſides it was a ſtormy day, and it began to ſnow, which contributed much to their Concealment, becauſe moſt of the Citizens kept within doors to avoid the Weather; but thoſe that were concern'd in the Deſign, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd them as they came, and preſently conducted them to <hi>Charon</hi>'s Houſe, and together with the Exiles made up forty eight in number. Now the Tyrants Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs ſtood thus: Secretary <hi>Philidas</hi> (as I have already obſerv'd) was an Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice in, and privy to all the Contrivance of the Exiles, and he a while before had invited <hi>Archias</hi> with others to an Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on that day, to drink freely, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſome married Whores, on purpoſe that when they were drunk, and ſoftned with Pleaſures, he might deliver them over to the Rage of the Conſpirators. But before <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias</hi> was throughly heated, notice was <note place="margin">Archias <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd that the Exiles were come.</hi>
                  </note> given him that the Exiles were privately in Town; a true Report indeed, but obſcure, and not well confirm'd: nevertheleſs though <hi>Philidas</hi> endeavoured to divert the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, <hi>Archias</hi> ſent one of his Guard to <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> and commanded him preſently to attend. Now it was Evening, and <hi>Pelopidas,</hi> and
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:35952:170"/>
his Friends with him in the Houſe, were putting themſelves into a fit poſture for Action, having their Armour on already, and their Swords girt: but at the ſudden knocking at the door, one ſtepping forth to enquire the Matter, and learning from the Serjeant that <hi>Charon</hi> was ſent for by the Officers, in great confuſion he return'd, and acquainted thoſe within; and this made all preſently conjecture, that the whole Plot was diſcover'd, and they ſhould be cut in pieces, before any Action worthy Men of their Bravery was perform'd; yet all agreed that <hi>Charon</hi> ſhould obey, and attend the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, to prevent Suſpicion. Now tho' <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> was a Man of Courage and Reſolution in all Dangers, yet in this Caſe he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly concern'd, leſt any ſhould ſuſpect that he was the Traytor, and the Death of ſo many and ſo brave Citizens be laid on him. And therefore when he was ready to depart, he brought his Son out of the Womens Apartment, a little Boy as yet, but very pretty, and ſtronger than his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals, <note place="margin">Charon<hi>'s bravery.</hi>
                  </note> and deliver'd him to <hi>Pelopidas</hi> with theſe words: <hi>If you find me a Traytor, uſe that Boy as an Enemy, and be cruel in the Execution.</hi> This Concernment and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Charon</hi> drew Tears from many: but all were extreamly troubled, that any one of them ſhould be thought ſo mean ſpirited,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:35952:170"/>
and grown ſo baſe, at the appearance of approaching danger, as to ſuſpect or blame him; and therefore deſir'd him not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve his Son, but ſet him out of harms way, that ſo ſcaping the Tyrants Power, he might live to revenge his City, and his Friends. But he refus'd to remove him, and ſaid, <hi>What Life, what Safety can be more honourable, than to die bravely with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſuch generous Companions?</hi> Thus imploring the Protection of the Gods, and ſaluting and encouraging them all, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, conſidering with himſelf, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing his Voice and Countenance, that he might look like one not at all concern'd in the Deſign. When he was come to the Door, <hi>Archias</hi> with <hi>Philidas</hi> came out to him, and ſaid, <hi>I have heard,</hi> Charon, <hi>that there are ſome come to Town, and lurk here, and to whoſe Cabal ſome of the Citizens reſort. Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> was at firſt diſturb'd, but preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd, <hi>who are they? and who conceals them?</hi> But finding <hi>Archias</hi> did not throughly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Matter, he conjectur'd, that none that was privy to the Deſign, had made this Diſcovery, and therefore told them, <hi>Perhaps 'tis an empty Rumour that diſturbs you, yet however I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="332" facs="tcp:35952:171"/>
ſtill prolonging the Entertainment with the hopes of the Womens Company at laſt. But when <hi>Charon</hi> was return'd, and found the Men prepar'd, not as if they hop'd for Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Succeſs, but to die bravely, and with the Slaughter of their Enemies, he told <hi>Pelopidas</hi> the truth, but deceiv'd the reſt, pretending that <hi>Archias</hi> diſcours'd him about other Matters. This Storm was juſt blown over, when Fortune brought another; for a Meſſenger came with a Letter from one <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

The Meſſenger being brought in to <hi>Archias,</hi> who was now pretty well drunk, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Letter, ſaid to him, <hi>He that ſent this, deſires you to read it preſently, for it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Matters of Concern;</hi> but <hi>Archias</hi> ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly return'd, <hi>Matters of Concern to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row:</hi> and ſo receiving the Letter, he put it under his Pillow, and then fell to his ordinary Diſcourſe with <hi>Philidas;</hi> and theſe words of his are a Proverb to this day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Greeks.</hi> Now when the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity ſeem'd convenient for Action, they march'd out in two Companies; <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopidas</hi> and <hi>Damoclides</hi> with their Party went againſt <hi>Leontidas</hi> and <hi>Hypates,</hi> that

liv'd near together; <hi>Charon</hi> and <hi>Melon</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Archias</hi> and <hi>Philip,</hi> having put on Womens Apparel upon their Armour, and thick Garlands of Fir and Pine to ſhade their Faces; and therefore as ſoon as they came to the Door, the Gueſts clapp'd and gave an Huzza, thinking thoſe had been the Women they expected. But when the Conſpirators had look'd about the Room, and diligently view'd all that were at the Entertainment, they drew their Swords, and making at <hi>Archias</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Archias <hi>and</hi> Philip <hi>kill'd.</hi>

But <hi>Pelopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> and his Party met with a harder Task; for they attempted <hi>Leontidas,</hi> a ſober and ſtout Man, and when they came to his houſe, they found his Doors ſhut, he being already gone to Bed: they knock'd a long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any one would anſwer, but at laſt a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant that heard them, coming out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barring the Door, as ſoon as the Gate gave way, they ruſh'd in, and over-turning the Man, made all haſte to <hi>Leontidas</hi> his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. But <hi>Leontidas</hi> gueſſing at the Matter by the noiſe and running, leap'd from his Bed, and drew his Dagger, but forgot to put out the Lights, and by that means

make them fall foul on one another in the dark. But now being eaſily ſeen by reaſon of the Light, he received them at his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-door, and ſtabb'd <hi>Chephiſidorus,</hi> the firſt Man that entered: he falling, the next that he engag'd was <hi>Pelopidas;</hi> between whom, the Paſſage being narrow, and <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſidorus</hi> his Carkaſs lying in the way, there was a fierce and dangerous diſpute.

                  <hi>Leontidas,</hi> he and his Companions went in purſuit of <hi>Hypates,</hi> and after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner broke into his Houſe; but he perceiving the Deſign, and flying to his Neighbours, they cloſely follow'd, and caught and kill'd him. This done, they joyn'd <hi>Melon,</hi> and ſent to haſten the Exiles they had left in <hi>Attica:</hi> they proclaim'd Liberty to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, and taking down the Spoyls from the Porches, and breaking open all the Shops of Armoury that wear near, they arm'd thoſe that came to their Aſſiſtance. <hi>Epaminondas</hi> and <hi>Gorgidas</hi> came in provided with a gallant Train of young Men, and beſt of the old. Now the City was in a ſtrange Confuſion, a great noiſe and hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Lights ſet up in every Houſe, Men run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning here and there; yet the People did not gather into a Body, but all amaz'd at the Actions, and not clearly underſtanding the Matter, waited for the Day.

the <hi>Spartan</hi> Officers are to be blam'd for not falling on preſently, ſince their Garriſon conſiſted of about 1500 Men, and many of the Citizens ran to them; but terrify'd with the noiſe, the Fires, and the confus'd Running of the People, they kept quietly within the <hi>Cadmea.</hi> As ſoon as day appear'd, the Exiles from <hi>Attica</hi> came in arm'd, and there was a general Aſſembly of the People: <hi>Epaminondas</hi> and <hi>Gorgidas</hi> brought forth <hi>Pelopidas</hi> and his Party, incompaſs'd by the Prieſts, who held out their Garlands, and exhorted the People to fight for their Countrey and their Gods.

But the following change of Affairs made this Action the more famous; for that War which brake the <hi>Spartan</hi>'s Power, and for ever ruin'd their Pretenſions to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, proceeded from that night, in which <hi>Pelopidas</hi> not ſurprizing any Caſtle, Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or Town, but coming the twelfth Man to his own private Houſe, loos'd and broke (if we may ſpeak Truth in Metaphor) the Chains of the <hi>Spartan</hi> Government, which before ſeem'd Adamant, and indiſſoluble.

One <hi>Sphodrias,</hi> a Man famous indeed for Martial Exploits, but of no ſound Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, full of ungrounded Hopes and fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Ambition, was left with an Army at <hi>Theſpia,</hi> to receive and ſuccour the <hi>Theban</hi> Renegades. <hi>Pelopidas</hi> privately ſent a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, a Friend of his, to carry him Money, and what prov'd more prevalent, advice, that it more became a Man of his Worth, to ſet upon ſome great Enterprize; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <note place="margin">Sphodrias <hi>the</hi> Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan <hi>deſigns againſt the</hi> Athenians</note> a ſudden Incurſion on the unprovided <hi>Athenians,</hi> ſurprize the <hi>Pireum;</hi> for nothing could be ſo grateful to <hi>Sparta,</hi> as to take <hi>Athens,</hi> and to be ſure, the <hi>Thebans</hi> would not ſtir to their Aſſiſtance, whom they now hated, and look'd upon as Traytors. <hi>Spho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drias</hi> being at laſt wrought upon, with his Army march'd into <hi>Attica</hi> by Night, and advanc'd as far as <hi>Eleuſina;</hi> but there his Souldiers Hearts failing, and his Deſign diſcover'd, when by this Action he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd the <hi>Spartans</hi> in a dangerous War, he retreated to <hi>Theſpia:</hi> for upon this the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi> very readily ſent Supplyes to <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes,</hi> and putting to Sea themſelves, ſail'd to many Places, and receiv'd and engag'd thoſe who were willing to revolt.

<pb n="342" facs="tcp:35952:176"/>
an Engagement, though on equal terms. But this Battel firſt taught the other <hi>Greeks</hi> that not only <hi>Eurotas,</hi> or the Countrey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Bubace</hi> and <hi>Cnacion,</hi> breeds Men of Courage and Reſolution; but where-ever the Youth is aſham'd of Baſeneſs, and would venture in a good Cauſe; where-ever they fly Diſgrace more than Danger, there are the ſtouteſt Men, then the moſt dreadful to their Enemies. <hi>Gorgidas</hi> (as ſome report) firſt form'd the ſacred Band of three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred choſen Men, to whom being a Guard for the Caſtle, the City allow'd Proviſion, and all things neceſſary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for Exerciſe: and hence they were call'd the City Bands, for Caſtles of old were uſually call'd Cities.

<pb n="343" facs="tcp:35952:176"/>
and Reaſon good, ſince they have more Regard for their abſent Lovers than others preſent; an Inſtance of which that Man gave, who, when his Enemy was ready to kill him, earneſtly requeſted to run him through the Breaſt, that his Lover might not bluſh to ſee him wounded in the Back. 'Tis reported likewiſe, that <hi>Iolaus,</hi> being the Lover of <hi>Hercules,</hi> aſſiſted him in his Labours: and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſerves, that even in his Time, the Lovers plighted their Faith at <hi>Iolaus</hi> his Tomb. 'Tis likely there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Band was call'd ſacred on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; as <hi>Plato</hi> calls a Lover, a divine Friend; and Fame ſays, that it was never beaten till the Battel at <hi>Cheronaea:</hi> and when <hi>Philip</hi> after the Fight took a view of the ſlain, and came to that Place where the three hundred that fought his Phalanx, lay dead together, he wondred, and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that 'twas the Band of Lovers, he wept, and ſaid, <hi>Let them be damn'd, who ſuſpect that theſe Men either did or ſuffer'd any thing that was baſe.</hi> Indeed it was not the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſter of <hi>Laius,</hi> as the Poets imagine, that firſt rais'd theſe Lovers amongſt the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans,</hi> but their Law-givers, who deſigning to ſoften, whilſt they were young, their natural Fierceneſs, brought the Pipe into great Eſteem both in ſerious and ludicrous Concerns, and encourag'd an excellent Love
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:35952:177"/>
in their Paleſtra's, to temper the Manners of the Youth: and therefore they did ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well to make Harmony, the Daughter of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> their Tutelar, becauſe where Force and Courage is joyn'd with Gracefulneſs, and winning Behaviour, the moſt admirable and beſt contriv'd Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is fram'd. All things being then Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniouſly diſpos'd, <hi>Gorgias</hi> dividing this ſacred Band into the Front Ranks of his Infantry, their Courage ſeem'd not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous; for not being order'd in one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, they were weakned, by being mingled with others of leſſer Reſolution.

                  <hi>Tegura,</hi> and that they kept their Ground, and fought well, he never after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards divided them, but keeping them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, as one Body, he gave the firſt Charge in the greateſt Battels: for as Horſes run brisker in a Chariot than ſingle, not that their joynt Force divides the Air with greater eaſe, but becauſe they run together, and their Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion raiſeth their Courage; thus he thought, ſtout Men provoking one another to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable Actions, would prove more uſeful, and more reſolv'd, in an Enterprize where they were all concern'd. Now when the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaemonians</hi> had made Peace with the other <hi>Greeks,</hi> and warr'd upon the <hi>Thebans</hi> only, and their King <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> march'd with 10000

                  </hi> but Captain of the ſacred Band, and a Man in Truſt, as 'twas fit he ſhould be, who had given his Countrey ſo great proof of his ſincere Endeavours for their Freedom.

                  </note> Viſion, which very much diſcompos'd him: for in that Plain lye the Bodies of the Daughters of one <hi>Scedaſus,</hi> call'd from the Place, <hi>Leuctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dae,</hi> for there they were bury'd, having been raviſh'd by ſome <hi>Spartan</hi> Strangers.

<pb n="346" facs="tcp:35952:178"/>
of the Place, becauſe there was a little ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime Town of <hi>Laconia</hi> call'd <hi>Leuctron,</hi> and near <hi>Megalopolis</hi> in <hi>Arcadia</hi> a Place of the ſame Name; and the Villany was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted long before this Battel. Now <hi>Pelopidas</hi> being aſleep in the Camp, thought he ſaw the Maidens weeping about their Tombs, and curſing the <hi>Spartans,</hi> and <hi>Scedaſus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, if they deſir'd the Victory, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice a red Virgin to his Daughters. <hi>Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidas</hi> looking on this as an harſh and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Injunction, roſe, and told it to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and Commanders of the Army, ſome of which contended, that 'twas fit to obey, and brought for Examples from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, <hi>Meneceus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Creon; Maca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi>

But ſome on the other ſide urg'd, that ſuch a barbarous and impious Oblation could not be pleaſing to any of thoſe above: that Typhons and Giants did not preſide over the World, but the Father of the Gods and Men: that 'twas abſurd to imagine, any Daemons delighted in Slaughter and Sacrifices of Men; or if there were any ſuch, they were to be neglected, as weak and unable to aſſiſt; for unreaſonable and impious Deſires could only proceed from, and live in weak and deprav'd Minds.

thoſe Crimes that were laid to his charge, went to him, and tho' they knew very well that he was profligate and cruel, yet they imagin'd that the Authority of <hi>Thebes,</hi> and their own Dignity and Reputation, would ſecure them from Violence.

Now when ſhe came into the Priſon, and, as a Woman, could not preſently perceive his Greatneſs in his Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, but gueſſing by the meanneſs of his Attire and Proviſion, that he was us'd baſely and not befitting a Man of his Reputation, ſhe wept. <hi>Pelopidas</hi> at firſt not knowing who ſhe was, ſtood amaz'd; but when he underſtood her Quality, he ſaluted her by her Father's Name, for <hi>Jaſon</hi> and he had been Friends and Familiars; and ſhe ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>I pity your Wife, Sir;</hi> he reply'd, <hi>And I you, that being not in Chains, can endure</hi> Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. This touch'd the Woman, for ſhe already hated <hi>Alexander</hi> for his Cruelty and Injuſtice, for his other Debaucheries, and for abuſing her younger Brother to his Luſt; and therefore going often to <hi>Pelopidas,</hi> and ſpeaking free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Indignities ſhe ſuffer'd, ſhe grew more enrag'd, and more exaſperated againſt <hi>Alexander.</hi> The <hi>Theban</hi> Generals that were ſent into <hi>Theſſaly</hi> did nothing, but being both unskilful and unfortunate, made a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable Retreat, for which the City

fin'd each of them 10000 Drachma's, and ſent <hi>Epaminondas</hi> with their Forces.

But <hi>Epaminondas</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more ſolicitous for the Safety of <hi>Pelopidas</hi> than his own Glory, and fearing that if things came to Extremity, <hi>Alexander</hi> would grow deſperate, and like a wild Beaſt, turn and worry him, did not vigorouſly proſecute the War: but hovering ſtill over him with his Army, he ſo handled the Tyrant, as not to make him deſpair, nor exaſperate his Fury; for he underſtood his Savageneſs, and the <note place="margin">Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vageneſs</hi>

               <p>THey ſay, that MARCUS CLAUDIUS, who was five times Conſul of the <hi>Romans,</hi> was the Son of <hi>Marcus:</hi> and that he was the Firſt of his Family called MARCELLUS, that is, <hi>Martial, Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donius</hi> affirms. For he was by long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence skilful in the art of War, of a ſtrong
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:35952:191"/>
body, valiant of his hands, and by natural inclination addicted to War. This great fierceneſs therefore, and heat he brought with him to battels: in other things modeſt, obliging, and ſo far ſtudious of Greek and Learning Diſcipline, as to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and admire thoſe that were therein ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent; but he attained not to a proficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in them equal to his deſire, by reaſon of his imployments. For if God ever deſtined any other men, as <hi>Homer</hi> ſaith,
<q>To be from their firſt years to their laſt day, Viers'd in fierce War;</q>
he certainly deſtined the <hi>Roman</hi> Princes of that time. Who in their youth had War with the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> in their middle age in <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> with the <hi>Gauls</hi> in the defence of <hi>Italy</hi> it ſelf; at laſt, being now grown old, ſtrugled again with <hi>Hannibal</hi> and the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and wanted in their old age, what is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Vulgar, vacation from the toils of War; becauſe they were according to their Nobility and Vertue, advanced to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of Wars, and to Empire: And <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus,</hi> ignorant or unskilful of no kind of fighting, contending in ſingle Combat upon a Challenge, overcame himſelf. Wherefore by whomſoever he was challenged, he declined not the provocation, and killed
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:35952:191"/>
all by whom he was challenged. His Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Oracilius</hi> circumvented in <hi>Sicily,</hi> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected and ſaved, and ſlew the Enemies that preſs'd him; for which facts he was by the Generals, while he was yet but young, preſented with Crowns and other honourable Rewards. But when his Vertue more and more ſhined forth, the people cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated him <hi>Aedilis Curulis;</hi> and the High-Prieſts, <hi>Augur</hi> (which is that Prieſthood to which chiefly the Law aſſigns the procuration and obſervation of Auguries) In his Aedility, by a certain miſchance he was brought to a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of commencing a Suit, and bringing an impeachment into the Senate. He had a Son named <hi>Marcus,</hi> both of excellent beauty in the flower of his Age, and of ſuch ſweet manners, and rare Erudition, that the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens admired him. This Youth, one <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitolinus,</hi> a laſcivious and audacious man, <hi>Marcellus</hi> his Collegue, vehemently loved, and attempted. Whoſe temptation the Lad at firſt by himſelf rejected: but when the other again ſollicited him, he diſcover'd the thing to his Father. <hi>Marcellus</hi> highly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with the indignity, accuſes the man in the Senate. Who having appeal'd to the Tribunes of the people, endeavoured by various ſhifts, and various exceptions to elude the impeachment: and the Tribunes not receiving the appeal, by flat denial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:35952:192"/>
the charge. But becauſe there was no witneſs of the fact, <hi>Capitolinus</hi> having attempted the Youth privately and alone; therefore the Senate thought fit to call the Youth himſelf before them. Whoſe bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and tears, and baſhfulneſs mix'd with higheſt indignation, when the Fathers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, ſeeking no farther evidence of the Crime, they condemn <hi>Capitolinus,</hi> and ſet a fine upon him according to the eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the injury; of the money of which mulct, <hi>Marcellus</hi> cauſed to be made a Silver Table, <note n="*" place="margin">

But after the end of the firſt <hi>Punic</hi> War, that laſted one and twenty years, the Seeds of the <hi>Gallic</hi> tumults ſprang up, and began again to trouble <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Iberes,</hi> a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple inhabiting the Subalpine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of <hi>Italy,</hi> ſtrong in their own forces, raiſed out of the reſt of the <hi>Gauls</hi> aids of mercenary Souldiers, which are called <hi>Goe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatoe</hi> [from the heavy Darts or Javelins u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by them in Fights.] And it was a miracle, and the good fortune of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the <hi>Gallic</hi> War was not coincident with the <hi>Punic,</hi> but that they had with fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity ſtood quiet as Spectators, while the <hi>Punic</hi> war continued, that they might with their whole power ſet upon the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour;
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:35952:192"/>
and deferr'd their invaſion till the <hi>Romans</hi> were at leiſure to reſiſt them. Yet the Neighbourhood and ancient renown of the <hi>Gauls</hi> ſtruck no little fear into the minds of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who were about to undertake a War ſo near home and upon their own bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. For that they fear'd more than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nation the <hi>Gauls,</hi> becauſe they had once taken their City, is apparent. From which time it was by a ſpecial Law provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the High Prieſt ſhould enjoy an exemption from all military Offices, except onely in <hi>Gallic</hi> inſurrections.</p>
               <p>The great preparations made by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> for War (for it is not reported that the people of <hi>Rome</hi> ever had at one time ſo many Legions in Arms, either before or ſince) and their extraordinary Sacrifices, were plain arguments of their fear at that time. For though they were moſt averſe from the Inſtitutions and Rites of barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and cruel Nations, and above all had with the <hi>Grecians</hi> pious and reverent Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of the Gods; yet when this year was coming upon them, they then, from ſome Propheſies in the <hi>Sibyls</hi> Books, put alive under ground a pair of <hi>Greeks,</hi> one male, the other female; and likewiſe two <hi>Gauls,</hi> one of each Sex, in the Market call'd the Beaſt-market: continuing even to this day the ſame ſecret and abominable Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:35952:193"/>
of <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Gauls,</hi> in the month of <hi>November.</hi> In the beginning of this War, when the <hi>Romans</hi> ſometimes obtain'd remarkable Victories, ſometimes were ſhamefully beaten; nothing was done toward the final determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Conteſt, until <hi>C. Quintius Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius,</hi> and <hi>P. Furius Philo</hi> being Conſuls, brought mighty forces againſt the <hi>Inſubres,</hi> a people of <hi>Gallia</hi> on the farther ſide of the River <hi>Po.</hi> Then they ſaw the River that runs through the Countrey of <hi>Picenum,</hi> flowing with blood. There was a report, that three Moons had been ſeen at once at <hi>Ariminum.</hi> And in the Conſular Aſſembly, the Augurs declared, that the Conſuls had been unduly created. The Senate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore immediately ſent Letters to the Camp, recalling the Conſuls to <hi>Rome</hi> with all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpeed; and commanding them to deſiſt from acting farther againſt the Enemies, and to abdicate themſelves from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhip on the firſt opportunity. Theſe Letters being brought to <hi>Flaminius,</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to open them till having defeated and put to flight the Enemies forces, he waſted and ravaged their borders: Wherefore the people went not forth to meet him retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with huge ſpoils; nay, becauſe he had not inſtantly obeyed the command in the Letters, by which he was recalled, but ſlighted and contemned them, they
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:35952:193"/>
wanted not much of denying him the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a Triumph. Nor was the Triumph ſooner paſs'd, than they depoſed him with his Collegue from the Magiſtracy, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them to the ſtate of private Citizens. So much did all things at <hi>Rome</hi> depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Religion. Though the courſe of their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs were ſmooth and proſperous, yet if their Enterprizes met not with ſucceſſes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py enough to anſwer their wiſhes; preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they gave out, that the Auſpices and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Rites were neglected; thinking it to be of more importance to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Safety, if the Magiſtrates reverenced the Gods, than if they overcame their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. And ſo <hi>Tiberius Sempronius,</hi> whom for his probity and Vertue the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens highly eſteem'd, created <hi>Scipio Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fica</hi> and <hi>Caius Martius</hi> Conſuls, ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors [to thoſe that had been exauctora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.] When theſe were gone into their Provinces, he lighted upon books concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Religion of the people, where he found ſomewhat he had not known be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; which was this. When the Conſul made his ſolemn Auſpice, he ſate without the City in a houſe, or Tabernacle hired for that occaſion: but if it hapned that he, for any emergent cauſe, return'd into the City having not yet ſeen any certain ſigns; he was obliged to leave that firſt Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:35952:194"/>
and to ſeek another, out of which he might ſurvey the Heaven round about, and finiſh his Contemplation. This having (as I conceive) deceiv'd <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who twice uſed one and the ſame Tabernacle; he renounced or proteſted againſt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls, [as not legitimately and with due Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies elected.] And afterwards underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his errour, he referr'd the matter to the Senate: nor did the Senate neglect this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute fault, but ſoon wrote expreſly of it to <hi>Scipio Naſica</hi> and <hi>C. Martius;</hi> who lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Provinces, and without delay returning to <hi>Rome,</hi> laid down their Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy. But theſe things followed afterward. At the ſame time the Prieſthood was taken away from two men of very great honour, <hi>Cornelius Cethegus</hi> and <hi>Q. Sulpitius:</hi> from the former, becauſe he had not rightly held forth the entrails of a Beaſt ſlain for Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; from the latter, becauſe while he was immolating, the little woollen tuft, which the <hi>Flamens</hi> wear on the top of their Cap, had faln from his head. <hi>Minutius</hi> the Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who had named <hi>C. Flaminius</hi> Maſter of the Horſe, they depoſed from his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, becauſe the noiſe of a gnawing Rat was heard: and they put others into their places. And yet notwithſtanding, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving ſo anxiouſly theſe punctillios and little niceties, they ſtumbled not upon any
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:35952:194"/>
Superſtition, becauſe they neither varied nor exceeded the Inſtitutes of their Anceſtors. So ſoon as <hi>Flaminius</hi> with his Collegue had reſign'd up the Conſulate, <hi>M.

And the <hi>Gallic</hi> Horſe being ſingularly skillful in Horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, and therefore thought to be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in excellent; and at preſent in number alſo exceeding <hi>Marcellus,</hi> made no account of him. Inſtantly therefore they ruſh upon him, as if they would trample him under their Horſes feet, threatning all kind of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties. Before their Enſigns rode the King. But <hi>Marcellus</hi> becauſe his Men were few, that they might not be encompaſſed and charged on all ſides by the Enemy, extended his wings of Horſe, and riding about, made thinner and drew forth in length his wings of Foot, till he came near to the Enemy. Then, while he directed his Van-guard to charge the Enemy, his Horſe, frighted by their yelling and ſhouts, gave back, and by force carried <hi>Marcellus</hi> aſide. He fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leſt this accident, converted into an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, might diſcourage his Souldiers; quickly turning his Horſe to the left, again confron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Enemy, and adored the Sun, as if he had wheel'd about his Horſe, not by chance, but out of Devotion. For it was cuſtomary to the <hi>Romans,</hi> when they ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:35952:195"/>
the Gods, to turn themſelves round in a circle. When they came up now to charge, 'tis reported he vowed the beſt of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Arms to <hi>Jupiter Feretrius</hi> or the <hi>Help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi> Then the King of the <hi>Gauls</hi> beholding <hi>Marcellus,</hi> and from the ſigns or badges of his Authority, conjecturing him to be the General, advanced far before his embattled Army, and with a loud voice challenged him, and brandiſhing his Lance, fiercely ran with a full carreer at him; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the reſt of the <hi>Gauls</hi> in ſtature, and by reaſon of his Armour, that was adorned with gold and ſilver, and painted with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious colours, ſhining like lightning. Theſe Arms ſeeming to <hi>Marcellus,</hi> while he view'd the Enemies Army drawn up in Battalia, to be the beſt and faireſt, and he thinking them to be thoſe he had vowed to <hi>Jupiter;</hi> inſtantly ran upon the King, and pierced through his Breaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>plate with his Launce; then preſſing upon him with the weight of his Horſe, threw him to the ground, and with two or three ſtrokes more ſlew him. Immediately he leaped from his Horſe, laid his hand upon the dead Kings Arms, and looking up toward Heaven, thus ſpake: <q>O <hi>Jupiter Feretrius,</hi> Arbiter of the remarkable Exploits of Captains, and of the acts of Emperours in War and Battels,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:35952:196"/>
thou being witneſs, I a General have ſlain a General, I a Conſul have ſlain a King with my own hand: to thee I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate theſe firſt and moſt excellent of the Spoils. Give thou to us now proceeding to diſpatch the reliques of the War, the ſame courſe of Fortune.</q> Then the <hi>Roman</hi> Horſe joyning Battel not onely with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies Horſe, but alſo with the Battalion of Foot charging upon them; obtain'd a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, and even now a new and ſtupendous Victory. For never before or ſince have ſo few Horſe and Foot defeated ſo numerous forces; at leaſt no ſuch atchievement is recorded in Hiſtory. The Enemies being to a great number ſlain, and the Spoils col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, he returns to his Collegue: who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging the War againſt the Enemies at the greateſt and moſt populous City of <hi>Gallia</hi> (they call it <hi>Millan)</hi> had ill ſucceſs. This City the <hi>Gauls</hi> on this ſide the Alps have for their Head City. Wherefore fighting vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly in defence of it, they were not ſo much beſieg'd by <hi>Cornelius,</hi> as they beſieg'd him. But <hi>Marcellus</hi> return'd and the <hi>Gaeſatae,</hi> ſo ſoon as they were certified of the death of the King, and the defeat of his Army, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring; <hi>Milan</hi> is taken.

was granted to the <hi>Gauls. Marcellus</hi> alone by a decree of the Senate triumphed. The triumph was in magificence, opulency, ſpoils, and the gigantic Bodies of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, exceeding noble and memorable. But the moſt grateful and moſt rare Spectacle of all was the General himſelf, who carried the Arms of the barbarous King to the God [to whom he had vowed them.] Of a tall and ſtraight ſtock of an Oak lop'd off, he had prepared a bearer ſhaped like a Trophy. Upon this he bound, and hung round about the Arms of the King, fitly and decently <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The pomp advancing ſolemnly before, he carrying this Trophy aſcends the Chariot; and being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the faireſt and moſt graceful triumphant Image, was carried into the City. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my adorned with ſhining Armour followed in order, and with Verſes on that occaſion compoſed, and with ſongs of Victory, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated the praiſes of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and of their General. Then entering the Temple of <hi>Jupiter Feretrius,</hi> he dedicated his gift: the third, and to our memory the laſt that ever did ſo. The firſt, <hi>Romulus,</hi> who having ſlain <hi>Acron</hi> King of the <hi>Coeninen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> brought home and dedicated rich ſpoils: the ſecond, <hi>Cornelius Coſſus,</hi> from <hi>Volumnius</hi> the Hetruſcan: after them <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus,</hi> from <hi>Viridomarus</hi> King of the <hi>Gauls;</hi>

This Victory and the ending of the War was ſo highly grateful to the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they ſent to <hi>Apollo</hi> of <hi>Delphos,</hi> in teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their gratitude, a Preſent, a gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Cup of an hundred pound weight; and gave a great part of the prey to their aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Cities, and took care that many Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents ſhould be carried alſo to <hi>Hiero</hi> King of the <hi>Syracuſans</hi> their Friendand Allie.

Doſt thou think that we are unwilling to requite with favour thoſe who have well deſerved, and who are honoured e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by our Enemies?</hi> Beſides this obliging courteſie of Speech, embracing the young Gentleman, he gave him an excellent Horſe, and five hundred <hi>Bigates</hi> [that is, pieces of money ſtamp'd with a Chariot drawn by two Horſes.] From that time <hi>Bantius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a moſt faithful Aſſiſtant and Allie of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> and a moſt ſharp Diſcoverer and Delator of thoſe that attempted Innovation and Sedition. Theſe were many, and had enter'd into a Conſpiracy to plunder the Waggons and other Carriages of the <hi>Romans</hi> when they ſhould make an eruption againſt the Enemy. Wherefore <hi>Marcellus,</hi> having marſhal'd his Army within the City, placed the baggage near to the Gates, and by an Edict forbad the <hi>Nolans</hi> to go to the Walls. Without the City no Arms appear'd, by
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:35952:199"/>
which prudent device he allured <hi>Hannibal</hi> to move with his Army in ſome diſorder, to the City, thinking that there all things were full of tumult. Then <hi>Marcellus,</hi> the next Gate being, as he had commanded, thrown open, iſſuing forth with the flower of his Horſe in front, fights with the Enemy. By and by the Foot ſallying out of another Gate, with a loud ſhout ran up to them. And while <hi>Hannibal</hi> oppoſes to theſe part of his forces, the third Gate alſo is opened, out of which the reſt break forth, and on all quarters charge the Enemies ſurprized with fear at this unexpected encounter, nor ſtrongly enough reſiſting thoſe with whom they had been firſt engaged, becauſe of their attack by others that ſallied later. Here it was that <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Souldiers with huge conſternation and many wounds beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en back even to their Camp, firſt turned their backs to the <hi>Romans</hi> purſuing them. There fell in this Action, as it is related, of them more than five thouſand; of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> not above five hundred. <hi>Livy</hi> affirms, that neither the Victory, nor the ſlaughter of the Enemies, was ſo great: but certain it is, that the adventure brought great glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to <hi>Marcellus,</hi> and to the <hi>Romans</hi> mighty confidence after their Calamities; becauſe they now conceived a ſtrong hope, that the Enemy with whom they contended,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:35952:200"/>
was not invincible, but obmoxious to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feats. Therefore, the other Conſul being deceas'd, the people recall abſent <hi>Marcellus,</hi> that they might put him into his place, and in ſpight of the Magiſtrates obtained, that the Conſular Aſſembly ſhould be prorogued till his arrival; and that he was by all the Suffrages created Conſul. But becauſe it happen'd to thunder, the Augurs muttering that he was not legitimately created, and yet not daring, for fear of the people, to declare this their Sentence openly; <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi> voluntarily reſigned the Conſulate, but declined not the Sovereign Command of the Army. So being created Proconſul, and returning to the Camp at <hi>Nola;</hi> he with fire and Sword waſted the fields of thoſe that followed the Party of the <hi>Carthaginian.</hi> Who coming with ſpeed to ſuccour them, <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus,</hi> though provoked by <hi>Hannibal,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined fighting a ſet Battel with him. But when <hi>Hannibal</hi> had ſent forth a Party to plunder, and now expected no Fight; <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi> brake forth upon him with his incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Army. He had diſtributed to the Foot long Lances, ſuch as are commonly uſed in Naval fights; and inſtructed them to throw them with great force at convenient diſtance againſt the Enemies unexperienced in that way of Darting, and uſed to Fight with ſhort Darts. Which ſeems to have
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:35952:200"/>
been the cauſe why in that conflict the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians,</hi> as many as were engaged, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their backs, and ſhamefully fled. There fell of them five thouſand. Of Elephants four were killed, two taken. But what was of greateſt moment, on the third day after more than three hundred Horſe, <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Numidians</hi> mix'd, fled over to him, a diſaſter that had never to that Day hapned to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who had long kept together in higheſt Concord a fierce Army gathered out of the ſink and dregs of diſſonant and diſagreeing Nations. <hi>Marcellus</hi> and his Succeſſors in all this War made good uſe of the faithful ſervice of theſe Horſemen. Now he a third time created Conſul ſailed over into <hi>Sicily.</hi> For the ſucceſs of <hi>Hannibal</hi> had excited the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> to lay claim to that whole Iſland; chiefly becauſe after the murther of the Tyrant <hi>Hieronymus,</hi> all things had been in tumult and confuſion at <hi>Syracuſe.</hi> For which reaſon the <hi>Romans</hi> alſo had ſent before to that City ſome Legions under the conduct of <hi>Appius,</hi> Praetor. While <hi>Marcellus</hi> was receiving that Army, the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers in great numbers caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at his feet, upon occaſion of this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity. Of thoſe that ſurviv'd the Battel at <hi>Cannae,</hi> ſome had eſcaped by flight, ſome were taken alive by the Enemy, in ſo great a multitude, that it was thought there were

not remaining <hi>Romans</hi> enough to defend the walls of the City. And yet the magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and conſtancy of the City was ſo great, that it would not redeem the Captives from <hi>Hannibal,</hi> though it might have done ſo for little ranſom; nay by a decree of the Senate denied it, and choſe rather to leave them to be kill'd by the Enemy, or ſold out of <hi>Italy:</hi> and commanded that all who had ſaved themſelves by flight, ſhould be tranſported into <hi>Sicily,</hi> nor permitted to return into <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly,</hi> until the War with <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſhould be ended.

This Decree pinched <hi>Marcellus,</hi> who being return'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> after the <hi>Sicilian</hi> War was ended, ſmartly upbraided the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that they had denied to him, who had ſo highly deſerved of the Republick, Liberty to relieve ſo great a number of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens in great calamity. About the ſame time <hi>Marcellus</hi> firſt incenſed by injuries done him by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> Praetor of <hi>Syracuſe</hi> (who to give proof of his good affection to the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and to acquire the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny to himſelf, had made a great ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Romans</hi> upon the borders of the <hi>Leontins)</hi> beſieged and by force took the City of the <hi>Leontins:</hi> yet violated none of the Townſmen.

                  <pb n="392" facs="tcp:35952:202"/>
the City began to be oppugned both by Land and by Sea. All the Foot, <hi>Appius</hi> brought up. <hi>Marcellus</hi> with LX. Gallies each with five Oars in a Seat, furniſh'd with all ſorts of Arms and Weapons to be thrown, and a huge Bridge of Planks laid upon eight Ships chain'd together, upon which he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Engin to caſt ſtones and Darts, aſſaulted the Walls: animated with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence by the abundance and magnificence of his preparations, and by his own glory. All which were eaſily eluded by <hi>Archimedes</hi> and his Machines. Of theſe he had deſign'd and contriv'd none as worth the pains and coſt, but to divert and ſport himſelf in the exerciſe of his skill in Geometry. A good while before King <hi>Hiero</hi> had courted and induced <hi>Archimedes</hi> to put into practice ſome part of his admirable ſpeculations in this Art, to ſhew ſome example of the power of it, and to exhibit to the ſenſe an experiment accommodated to uſe. For <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxus</hi> and <hi>Archytas</hi> had firſt begun to ſet on foot this celebrated and admired Machinal Science, by this elegancy illuſtrating Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry and Propoſitions by demonſtration, that may be explicated by reaſon and clear evidence; and confirming the more remote by examples of Organs or Inſtruments ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to Senſe. As both of them brought to light that abſtruce and by demonſtration inexplicable Propoſition of two middle
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:35952:202"/>
lines (an Element neceſſary to delineate many things) by contriving Inſtruments, by certain intermediate lines deflecting from Curve Lines and Sections. But as <hi>Plato</hi> being offended ſharply inveighed againſt theſe eminent Geometricians, ſaying, that they corrupted and deſtroy'd the good of Geometry, which leaving thoſe things that are free from body, and conſiſt only in notion of the mind, was now converted to things obnoxious to ſenſe, and forced to reaſſume bodies, where much of odious and ſordid idleneſs would be required: So the <hi>Mechanics</hi> or Art of making Engines came to be rejected and ſeparated from Geometry, and being deſpiſed by Philoſophers, lay long hid among Arts military. But <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi> wrote to King <hi>Hiero,</hi> whoſe near kinſman and friend he was, that by little force any weight how great ſoever might be moved. He boaſted alſo, relying on the ſtrength of Demonſtration, that if there were another Earth, he going into it would remove this out of its place. <hi>Hiero</hi> ſtruck with amazement at this, and intreating him to make good this Problem by ſome effect, and ſhew ſome great weight to be moved by a ſmall Engine: he fix'd upon a Ship of burthen bought out of the Kings Arcenal, which could not be drawn out of the Dock without mighty labour and many men; and loading her with many Paſſengers and a
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:35952:203"/>
full fraight, ſitting himſelf the while far off, with no great endeavour, but onely holding the head of the Pully in his hand, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Cord by degrees, he drew the Ship in a ſtreight line, without ſtop or ſticking, nay ſwiftly ſliding along, as if ſhe had been in the Sea. The King aſtoniſh'd at this, and convinced of the power of the Art; prevail'd upon <hi>Archimedes</hi> to make for him Engines accommodate to all ways of aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an Enemy, by which he might either beat off danger, or Batter Cities. Theſe the King himſelf never made uſe of, becauſe he ſpent almoſt all his life in a profound quiet and higheſt affluence of fortune. But then this apparatus was in a moſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune time ready at hand for the <hi>Syracuſans,</hi> and with it alſo the Engineer himſelf. When therefore the <hi>Romans</hi> aſſaulted the Walls in two places at once, fear and conſternation ſo ſtupified the <hi>Syracuſans,</hi> that nothing was able to reſiſt that violence and thoſe forces. But when <hi>Archimedes</hi> play'd his Engines, he at once ſhot againſt the Land-forces all ſorts of miſſile Weapons, and huge ſtones with horrible noiſe and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: againſt which no man could ſtand, but they knock'd down thoſe in heaps, upon whom they fell, and brake their Ranks and Files. The arms of Main-ſail Yards ſuddenly put forth from the Walls, [and catching hold of Ships] they ſunk

ſome by mighty weight let down from on high upon them; others they lifted up into the Air by an iron hand or beak like a Cranes beak, and when they had hung them up by the Prow, and ſet them an end upon the Poop, they plu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

A Ship ſeveral times lifted up to a great height in the Air (a dreadful thing to behold) was rowl'd to and fro, and kept ſwinging, until the Marriners being thrown down and ſtruck againſt the Wall, at length it was daſh'd againſt the Rocks, or let fall. At the Engine that <hi>Marcellus</hi> brought upon the Bridge ('twas call'd <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buca</hi> from ſome reſemblance it had of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of Muſick, [in reſpect chiefly of the many chords by which it was bent]) when it was from afar d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So <hi>Marcellus,</hi> doubtful what counſel to purſue, drew off his Ships to a ſafer diſtance, and ſounded a retreat to his forces on Land. Then they took up
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:35952:204"/>
a reſolution of coming up cloſe under the Walls, if it were poſſible in the night; thinking that becauſe <hi>Archimedes</hi> was neceſſitated to uſe Ropes ſtretch'd at length in playing his Engines, the Souldiers would be under the ſhot, and the Darts would, for want of ſufficient diſtance to throw them, fly over their heads without effect. But he had long before framed for that purpoſe Engines accommodate to any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and ſhorter Weapons, but ſuch that might be thrown thicker, to give many and frequent wounds at a blow. He had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy provided alſo ſmall Scorpions, not to be perceived by the eyes of the Enemies, by which they might be wounded near at hand. As they therefore, who thought then to deceive the Defendants, came cloſe up to the Walls; inſtantly a ſhower of Darts and other miſſile Weapons was again caſt upon them. And when ſtones tumbled down as it were perpendicularly upon the heads of the Aſſailants, and Arrows from all parts of the Wall were ſhot at them; they retired. Of whom, as they were going off, by Arrows and Darts diſcharged at greater diſtance great ſlaughter was made, and their Ships knock'd one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; while themſelves were not able to offend their Enemies in the leaſt. For <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimedes</hi> had provided and fix'd moſt of

For if you ſeek, you will not by your ſelf find a demonſtration of his Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions: but when you have once learned it, you will think that you might by your own Wit have found it; ſo plain and ſmooth is the way, by which he leads to what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to demonſtrate. Wherefore thoſe things are not to be rejected, which are reported of him; that he was perpetually

ſoothed and charmed by a certain familiar <hi>Siren,</hi> ſo that he was wont to forget his food, and neglect the care of his body, and when he was now and then carried againſt his will to have his body Anointed and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, he would draw Geometrical Figures in the aſhes, and lines with his finger; ſo much was he taken with the ſweetneſs of the Art, and his mind ſo raviſh'd with the intellectual delight of the Theorems there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

Coming often thither, and entertaining Conferences [with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners about the Redemption of <hi>Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſippus]</hi> the height of the Tower was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly calculated, and Ladders prepared.

Who looking down from higher places upon the moſt beautiful and very great City below, is ſaid to have wept much, commiſerating the calamity that hung over it, when his thoughts repreſented to him, how diſmal and foul the face of the City would in a few hours be, when plunder'd and ſack'd by the Souldiers. For among the Praefects [or chief Officers of his Army] there was not one man that durſt deny the plunder of the City to the Souldiers demanding it; nay, many were inſtant that the City might be ſet on fire and laid level to the ground. But this <hi>Marcellus</hi> plainly denied. Yet he granted, but with great unwillingneſs and reluctancy, that the money and bond-men ſhould be made prey. And he ſent forth an Edict, that none ſhould violate any free body, nor kill any Citizen, nor raviſh or drag any into ſervitude. Though he had uſed this moderation, yet he eſteemed the condition of that City to be miſerable, and even in ſo great a congratulation of his friends for the Victory, expreſſed grief of mind and ſorrow, beholding all the riches <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="402" facs="tcp:35952:207"/>
diſſipated in a moment of an hour. For it is related tbat no leſs of prey and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was taken here, than afterward in <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage.</hi> For not long after, they furiouſly plunder'd alſo the other parts of the City, taken by treachery, leaving nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touch'd but the Kings money, which was brought into the publick Treaſury. Of all theſe doleful events nothing afflicted <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi> his generous Soul ſo much as the death of <hi>Archimedes.</hi> Who was [then as Fate would have it] with his mind intent upon ſome Diagramms or Geometrical figures: and having fix'd not onely his mind upon that Speculation, but his eyes alſo upon the lines he was drawing, perceiv'd not the hurry of the <hi>Romans,</hi> nor that the City was taken. In this tranſport of ſtudy and Contemplation, a Souldier unexpectedly coming up to him, commanded him to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him to <hi>Marcellus:</hi> which he declining to do before he had finiſh'd his Probleme or Propoſition, and fitted it to demonſtration; the Souldier, inraged with anger, drew his Sword, and ran him through. Others write, that a <hi>Roman</hi> Souldier running upon him with a drawn Sword offer'd to kill him; and that <hi>Archimedes,</hi> looking back, earneſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him to hold his hand a little while, that he might not leave what he was then ſearching for, imperfect and rude; but the
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:35952:207"/>
Souldier, nothing moved by his intreaty, inſtantly kill'd him. Others again relate, that as <hi>Archimedes</hi> was carrying to <hi>Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> Mathematical Inſtruments, Horologes, or Dialls, Sphears, Angles, by which the magnitude of the Sun might be meaſured to the ſight; ſome Souldiers ſeeing him, and thinking that he carried Gold in a Veſſel, ſlew him. Fer certain it is, that his death was highly afflicting to <hi>Marcellus,</hi> and that <hi>Marcellus</hi> ever after hated him that kill'd him as a nefarious Murtherer, and having ſought for his kindred honoured them with ſignal favours. Indeed foreign Nations held the <hi>Romans</hi> to be excellent Souldiers and formidable in fights; but ſince they had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven no memorable example of gentleneſs, or humanity, or civility, <hi>Marcellus</hi> ſeems firſt to have ſhewn to the <hi>Grecians</hi> that the <hi>Romans</hi> were more illuſtrious for their juſtice. For ſuch was his moderation to all with whom he had any thing to do, and ſuch his benignity alſo to many Cities and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Men; that if any thing too hard or ſever was decreed concerning the <hi>Aetnen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> or <hi>Megarenſians,</hi> or <hi>Syracuſans,</hi> the blame thereof ſeems to belong rather to them upon whom the ſtorm fell, than to thoſe who brought it upon them. One example of many I will commemorate. In <hi>Sicily</hi> there is a Town, called <hi>Enguium,</hi> not great

indeed; but very ancient and ennobled by the preſence of the Goddeſſes call'd the <hi>Mothers.</hi> The Temple, they ſay, was built by the <hi>Cretians;</hi> and they ſhew ſome Spears and brazen Helmets, partly of <hi>Merion,</hi> part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> who conſecrated them to the Goddeſſes. This City highly favouring the party of the <hi>Carthaginians, Nicias</hi> the moſt eminent of the Citizens counſelled them to make a defection to the <hi>Romans;</hi> to that end acting moſt freely, and openly in Harangues to their Aſſemblies, arguing the Adverſaries guilty of imprudence and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. They fearing his wealth, power, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, reſolv'd to deliver him in bonds to the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> This their deſign when he had ſmelt out, and knew it to be kept ſecret: he ſpake irreligiouſly to the vulgar of the <hi>Mothers,</hi> and ſhewed many ſigns of diſreſpect, as if he denied and contemned the receiv'd Opinion of the preſence of thoſe Goddeſſes; his Enemies the while rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, that he of his own accord ſought the deſtruction hanging over his head. When they were juſt now about to lay hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, the people were aſſembled together to hear him haranguing.

This Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory <hi>Poſidonius</hi> the Philoſopher hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to memory. <hi>Marcellus</hi> at length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call'd by the people of <hi>Rome</hi> to a near and ſuburban War, to illuſtrate his Triumph, and adorn the City, carried away with him very many and the moſt beautiful Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Syracuſe.</hi> For before that, <hi>Rome</hi> neither had, nor had ſeen any thing of thoſe polite and exquiſite Rarities; nor were there any pieces of workmanſhip of the like Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy and Skill.

He triumphed in <hi>monte Albano,</hi> thence enter'd the City in <hi>Ovation;</hi> but in this Ovation, he was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther carried in a Chariot, nor crown'd with Lawrel, nor uſher'd by Trumpets ſounding; but went a foot with ſhoes on, many Flutes or Pipes ſounding in conſort the while he paſſed along, wearing a Garland of Myrtle; as peaceable, with an aſpect raiſing rather love and reſpect than fear. Whence I am by conjecture led to think, that heretofore the difference betwixt <hi>Ovation</hi> and <hi>Triumph</hi> was, not from the greatneſs of Atchievements, but from the manner of performing them. For they who having fought a ſet Battel, and ſlain the Enemies, returned Victors; led that Martial, and (in my judgment) cruel Triumph, and as the cuſtom then was, in luſtrating the Army, adorned their Arms and Souldiers with a great deal of Lawrel: but they who without force, by benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, favour, and civil Language had done the buſineſs (and prevented ſhedding of human blood) to theſe Captains cuſtom gave the honour of this Pacate and plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Ovation. For a Pipe is the Enſign or badg of Peace, and Myrtle the plant

                  </gap>. But the thing is otherwiſe. For it was the cuſtom for Emperours in their triumph to immolate an Ox, but in their Ovation, a Sheep: hence they named it <hi>Ovation.</hi> But it is worth our labour to contemplate the <hi>Laconic</hi> Legiſlator, who inſtituted Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces contrary to the <hi>Roman.</hi> For at <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> a Captain, who had performed the work he undertook, by cunning or courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Treaty, laying down his Command, immolated an Ox; he that did the buſineſs by Battel, offer'd a Cock: the <hi>Lacedaemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> though moſt warlike, thinking an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit performed by Eloquence and ſubtilty, to be more excellent and more congruous to man, than one effected by meer force and courage. But whether of theſe two is to be preferr'd, I leave to the determination of others. <hi>Marcellus</hi> being the fourth time Conſul, his Enemies ſuborned the <hi>Syracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſans</hi> to come to <hi>Rome</hi> to accuſe him, and to complain that they had ſuffer'd indignities
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:35952:211"/>
and hoſtile wrongs, contrary to the League. It hapned that <hi>Marcellus</hi> was in the <hi>Capitol</hi> offering Sacrifice, when the <hi>Syracuſans</hi> pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned the <hi>Senate</hi> yet ſitting, that they might have leave to accuſe him and preſent their grievances. <hi>Marcellus</hi>'s Collegue put them out of the Court, taking it extreamly ill, that the buſineſs was moved <hi>Marcellus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abſent. Which when he underſtood, he made haſte thither. And firſt preſiding as Conſul, he referr'd to the Senate the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of other matters: but when that charge againſt him came to be explicated, riſing from his Seat, he paſſed as a private man into the place where the accuſed were wont to make their defence, and gave free liberty to the <hi>Syracuſans</hi> to impeach him. But they ſtruck with vehement conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by his Majeſty and confidence, ſtood aſtoniſh'd: and the power of his preſence now in his Robe of Eſtate appear'd far more terrible and ſevere, than it had done when cover'd with Armour. Yet reanimated at length by <hi>Marcellus</hi>'s Rivals, they began their impeachment, and made an Oration compoſed of Lamentation and Complaint, whereof this was the ſum. That being Allies and Friends of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> they had notwithſtanding ſuffer'd thoſe things, which other Emperours had ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain'd from inferring upon many Enemies.
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:35952:211"/>
To this <hi>Marcellus</hi> anſwers; That though they had committed many acts of hoſtility againſt the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet they had ſuffer'd nothing but what Enemies conquer'd by War, and by force taken Captives, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be defended from ſuffering. That it was their own fault they had been made Captives, becauſe they refuſed to give ear to him attempting all fair and gentle means; neither were they by the power of Tyrants drawn into War, but rather impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon the Tyranny, to the end they might make War. The Orations ended, and the <hi>Syracuſans,</hi> according to the cuſtom turned out of the Court; <hi>Marcellus</hi> left his Collegue to ask the Sentences [of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators] and together with the <hi>Syracuſans</hi> went out of the Temple, and ſtaid expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the folding Doors of the Court; not in the leaſt diſcompoſed in Spirit, either by the accuſation, or by anger againſt the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racuſans;</hi> but with high civility and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty attending the iſſue of the cauſe. The Sentences at length all ask'd, and a decree of the Senate made in Vindication of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus,</hi> the <hi>Syracuſans</hi> with tears flowing from their eyes, caſt themſelves at his knees, beſeeching him to forgive them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and to be moved by the miſery of the reſt of their City, which would ever be mindful of and grateful for his benefits. Thus
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:35952:212"/>
                  <hi>Marcellus</hi> ſoftned by their tears and diſtreſs, was not onely reconcil'd to them, but moſt generouſly received the reſt of the <hi>Syracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſans</hi> into his faith and protection. The Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which he had reſtored to them, and their Rights, Laws, and Goods that were left, the <hi>Senate</hi> confirmed. Upon which account the <hi>Syracuſans</hi> both decreed other Honours to <hi>Marcellus,</hi> and made a Law, that if <hi>Marcellus</hi> ſhould at any time come into <hi>Sicily,</hi> or any of his Poſterity, the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racuſans</hi> crowned ſhould offer Sacrifices to the Gods. After this he moved againſt <hi>Hannibal.</hi> Now whereas the other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls and Emperours ſince the defeat receiv'd at <hi>Cannae,</hi> had all made uſe of the ſame ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem againſt <hi>Hannibal,</hi> namely to decline coming to a Battel with him; and that none had the courage to encounter him in the Field, and put themſelves to the deciſion by the Sword: <hi>Marcellus</hi> enter'd into a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe way of Counſel, thinking that <hi>Italy</hi> would be deſtroy'd by the very ſame thing, <hi>viz.</hi> delay, by which they looked to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume <hi>Hannibal;</hi> and that <hi>Fabius</hi> who was exceſſively cautious, expecting that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies forces by length of time waſting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, the War would at length fall of it ſelf without blows, after the manner of ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid and fearful Phyſicians, who dreading fo adminiſter opportune Remedies, ſtay

This <hi>Marcellus</hi> ſeeing, pours in his Horſe with great force upon the diſordered Elephants; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands terrour to be added to their confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that they might tread and cruſh each other under their feet. The Horſe making a fierce impreſſion, purſued the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> home to their Camp, cutting down a great number in the purſuit. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephants alſo wounded and running upon their own Party, made a very great ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Enemies. 'Tis ſaid; more than eight thouſand were ſlain; of the <hi>Roman</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my three thouſand were ſlain, and almoſt all wounded. This was the thing that gave <hi>Hannibal</hi> opportunity to diſlodge in the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Night, and to remove to great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er diſtance from <hi>Marcellus;</hi> whom care and ſolicitude for his wounded men kept from purſuing him, though he vehemently deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſo to do. Wherefore by ſoft and ſmall Marches he removed into <hi>Campania,</hi> and to refreſh his Souldiers, he kept them during the heat of the Summer lodged in Houſes But becauſe <hi>Hannibal,</hi> having diſentang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led himſelf from <hi>Marcellus,</hi> rambled with his Army round about the Countrey,
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:35952:215"/>
and waſted <hi>Italy,</hi> as now free from all fear; at <hi>Rome Marcellus</hi> was evil ſpoken of. Whoſe Detractors induced <hi>C. Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius Bibulus</hi> Tribune of the People, a man Eloquent and fierce, to undertake his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation. He by aſſiduous Harangues prevail'd upon the People to abrogate from <hi>Marcellus</hi> the command of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; <q>Seeing that <hi>Marcellus,</hi> ſaith he, a little time exerciſed in the War, hath retired himſelf to take care of his Body, as if from the wreſtling place to hot Baths.</q> 
                  <hi>Marcellus</hi> hereof advertiſed, appointed Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants to govern his Camp, and haſted to <hi>Rome</hi> to refute the Crimes charged upon him: and he there found ready drawn up againſt him an Impeachment conſiſting of thoſe Calumnies. At the Day prefix'd, in the <hi>Flaminian Circus,</hi> into which place the people had aſſembled themſelves, <hi>Bibulus</hi> from a higher place accuſed him. <hi>Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> anſwered, uſing a ſuccinct and plain Speech. But the Lords and Princes of the City diſcourſed many things of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Exploits and Atchievements, very freely adviſing the People not to ſhew themſelves worſe Judges than the Enemy, condemning <hi>Marcellus</hi> of timidity, from whom alone of all their Captains the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy fled, and perpetually endeavour'd, not to come to blows with him, but to
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:35952:216"/>
fight with the reſt. When they made an end of ſpeaking, the Accuſer's hope to obtain Judgement [on his ſide] ſo far deceiv'd him, that <hi>Marcellus</hi> was not onely abſolved, but the fifth time created Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul. No ſooner had he entred upon the Conſulate, but he ſurpreſſed a huge com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion in <hi>Hetruria,</hi> that had proceeded near to a Defection, and entring the Towns ſoftned the minds of the Citizens. Hence, when the dedication of the Temple, which he had vowed out of the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Spoils to Honour and Virtue, was hinder'd by the Prieſts, becauſe they denied that one Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple could be lawſully dedicated to two Gods; he began to adjoyn another to it, highly reſenting the Prieſts Objection, and almoſt converting the thing into an Omen. And truly many other Prodigies alſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted him; as ſome Temples ſtruck with Lightning, and that in <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s Temple Mice had gnawn the Gold. It was reported alſo, that an Ox had ſpoke, and that a Boy born with a head like an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant's was yet living. All which Predigies were indeed expiated, but no Attonement ſucceeded, nor was peace and reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion obtain'd from the Gods. Wherefore the <hi>Aruſpices</hi> [or Diviners from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails and vital parts of the Sacrifices] de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd him at <hi>Rome</hi> glowing and burning (with
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:35952:216"/>
deſire to return to the War.) For no man was ever inflamed with ſo great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of any thing, as that man was to fight a Battel with <hi>Hannibal.</hi> That was the Object of his Dreams in the Night, the ſubject of all his Diſcourſes with his friends and familiars, nor did he preſent to the Gods any other wiſh, but that he might take <hi>Hannibal</hi> in fight. And I think, that he would moſt gladly have ſet upon him, both Armies being invironed with a Wall or Trench. Had he not been even load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Honours, and given proofs many ways of his maturity [of judgment] and prudence above other Emperours; you might have ſaid, that he was agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a juvenile ambition, above what became a man of that age: for he had paſſed the ſixtieth year of his life when he began his fifth Conſulſhip. The Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices offered, and all things that belong to the propitiation of the Gods, performed according to the preſcript of the Diviners; he with his Collegue went to carry on the War. Many ways he provoked <hi>Hannibal</hi> at that time having a ſtanding Camp betwixt <hi>Bantia</hi> and the City <hi>Venuſia</hi> [in <hi>Apulia.]</hi> But he held it not ſafe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Diſpute to the hazard of a Battel. And when he had gotten intelligence, that ſome Foot-Companies were ſent to the <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cri</hi>
                  <pb n="422" facs="tcp:35952:217"/>
                  <hi>Epizephyrii</hi> [a people of the <hi>Brutii</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> ſeated near the Promontory of <hi>Zephyrium,</hi> whence they are call'd <hi>Epize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyrii,</hi> i. e. the Weſtern <hi>Locrians]</hi> placing an ambuſh under the little Hill of <hi>Pite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> [a City of the <hi>Brutii,</hi> now call'd <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtro]</hi> he ſlew two thouſand five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Souldiers. This incenſed <hi>Marcellus</hi> to revenge. Wherefore he removed his Camp nearer to <hi>Hannibal.</hi> Betwixt the two Camps was a little Hill, affording a ſtation not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough ſecure, but woody, and having watch-Towers overlooking both ſides: and below were Fountains of Rivulets ſliding down in ſight of the Spectators from above. This place ſo fit and advantageous, the <hi>Romans</hi> admired that <hi>Hannibal,</hi> come thither before them, had not ſeiz'd upon, but left it to the Enemies. But to him the place ſeem'd commodious indeed for a Camp, yet more commodious for an Ambuſcade: and to that uſe he choſe to put it. So in the lawns of the Wood and the hollows he hid a great power of Archers and Spear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, moſt confident that the commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the place would allure the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> Nor was he deceived in his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For preſently in the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp they mutter'd and diſputed as if they had all been Captains, that that place was to be feiz'd, and how great opportunities they
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:35952:217"/>
ſhould thereby ſnatch from the Enemies before-hand, chiefly if they transferr'd their Camp thither, and ſtrengthen'd the place with a fortreſs: and they moved <hi>Marcellus</hi> to go with a few Horſe to view it. He, having call'd a Diviner to him, ſacrificed. In the firſt ſlain Beaſt the <hi>Aruſpex</hi> ſhew'd him the Liver without a head; in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond the head appear'd grown above mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure great, and all the reſt fair and highly promiſing good ſucceſs. When theſe ſeem'd to free them from the dread of the former, the Diviners declared that they were more terrified by the latter: becauſe entrails too fair and promiſing, when they appear after maimed and monſtrous, render the Novity of the change of doubtful ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. But
<q>Nor fire nor braſen Wall can keep out fate;</q>
as <hi>Pindarus</hi> obſerves. <hi>Marcellus</hi> therefore taking with him his Collegue <hi>Criſpinus,</hi> and his Son a Tribune of Souldiers, with two hundred and twenty Horſe at moſt, among whom there was not one <hi>Roman,</hi> but all were <hi>Hetruſcans,</hi> beſides forty <hi>Fregellans,</hi> of whoſe courage and fidelity he had in all occaſions receiv'd full proof; goes to view the [inviting] place. The Hill was full of high woods, and darkſom; on the
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:35952:218"/>
top of it ſate a Centinel, cover'd from the ſight of the Enemy, but having the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp expoſed to his eyes. Upon a ſign receiv'd from him, they that were placed in Ambuſh, ſtirr'd not till <hi>Marcellus</hi> came near. Then all riſing up in an inſtant, and encompaſſing him from all ſides, they fell to invade him with Darts, to ſtrike, and wound the backs of thoſe that fled, to preſs upon thoſe who bravely reſiſted. Theſe were the forty <hi>Fregellans.</hi> And though the <hi>Hetruſcans</hi> fled in the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the fight, the <hi>Fregellans</hi> caſt themſelves into a Ring, bravely defending the Conſuls, till <hi>Criſpinus,</hi> ſtruck with two Darts, turned his Horſe to fly away; and <hi>Marcellus</hi>'s ſide was pierced through with a Lance with a broad head. Then the <hi>Fregel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans</hi> alſo, the few that remain'd alive, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fallen Conſul, and reſcuing young <hi>Marcellus,</hi> wounded alſo, got into the Camp by flight. There were ſlain not many above forty; five Lictors, and twelve Horſemen came alive into the Enemies hands. <hi>Criſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> alſo died of his wounds a few days after. This Defeat, in which both Conſuls fell together, was the firſt of that kind that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver befell the <hi>Romans. Hannibal</hi> little valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the other events, ſo ſoon as he was told of <hi>Marcellus</hi>'s death, immediately haſted to the Hill. From him viewing the Body,
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:35952:218"/>
after he had long conſider'd the ſtrength and ſhape thereof, there fell not a word expreſſing the leaſt of pride or arrogancy, nor did he ſhew in his countenance any ſign of gladneſs, as another perhaps would have done, when his fierce Enemy had been taken away: but amazed by the ſo ſudden and unexpected fall of ſo great a man, and taking off his Ring, gave order to have the Body, moſt magnificently clad and adorned, honourably burned. The Reliques, put into a ſilver Urn, with a Crown of Gold to cover it, he ſent back to his Son. But ſome of the <hi>Numidians</hi> ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon thoſe that were carrying the Urn, took it from them by force, and caſt away the bones. Which being told to <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal, How impoſſible is it,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing againſt the will of God!</hi> Then he puniſhed the <hi>Numidians</hi> with Death: but took no farther care of ſending or recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the bones; conceiving that <hi>Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> ſo raſhly fell, and lay unburied, by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fate.

               <p>THESE are the memorable things I have found in Hiſtorians of <hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Pelopidas.</hi> Betwixt which two [great Men] though in Wit, Inclinations, and Manners they nearly reſembled each other; becauſe both were valiant, and diligent, and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and haughty: there was yet ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity in this, that <hi>Marcellus</hi> in many Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that he reduced into his Power, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted great ſlaughter; but <hi>Epaminondas</hi> and <hi>Pelopidas,</hi> when they had gotten a Victory, never kill'd any Man, nor deprived the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of their Liberty. They report, that the <hi>Thebans</hi> alſo would not, when they were preſent, have ſo reſolved againſt the <hi>Orcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians. Marcellus</hi>'s Exploits againſt the <hi>Gauls</hi> are admirable and ample: when guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a few Horſe he defeated and put to flight a vaſt number of Horſe and Foot together (an action you cannot eaſily in Hiſtorians find to have been done by any other Captain) and took their King Priſoner. To which honour though <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopidas</hi> aſpired, he attain'd not to it, but was kill'd by the Tyrant, and prevented. But to theſe you may perhaps oppoſe thoſe two moſt noble and very great Battels,
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:35952:220"/>
the one at <hi>Leuctra,</hi> the other at <hi>Tegyrae.</hi> But there is extant no Memoir of any At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievement of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> by ſtealth, or treachery, or Ambuſcade: ſuch as were thoſe of <hi>Pelopidas,</hi> when he returned from Exile, and kill'd the Tyrants at <hi>Thebes.</hi> But in this he ſeems to be worthy of commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, more than for all his Atchievements performed in the dark and by cunning and ſtratagems. Now <hi>Hannibal,</hi> a terrible E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, and a hard, urged the <hi>Romans:</hi> as in truth the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> did then the <hi>Thebans.</hi> But that theſe were in the Fights of <hi>Leuctra</hi> and <hi>Tegyrae</hi> beaten and put to flight by <hi>Pelopidas;</hi> is confeſs'd. <hi>Polybius</hi> writes, that <hi>Hannibal</hi> was never ſo much as once vanquiſhed by <hi>Marcellus,</hi> but remain'd in all Encounters invincible until <hi>Scipio</hi> (managed the War againſt him.) But we believe rather <hi>Livius, Caeſar, Cornelius Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos,</hi> and among the <hi>Greeks</hi> King <hi>Juba,</hi> who all expreſly affirm, that the whole Army of <hi>Hannibal</hi> was in ſome Fights routed and put to flight by <hi>Marcellus,</hi> though theſe defeats conduced little to the ſum of the War. And it appears, that the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> cunning and ſtratagems deceived him in thoſe Conflicts. But this may ſeem truly admirable, that <hi>Marcellus</hi> made the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> after the defeat of ſo many Armies, the ſlaughter of ſo many Captains, and
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:35952:220"/>
in fine, the confuſion of almoſt the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, valiant ſtill, and of courage equal to their loſſes, and fit to engage in new Battels. For <hi>Marcellus</hi> was the only man, that took from them that great and inveterate fear and dread, and revived, raiſed, confirmed the Spirits of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers fighting with the Enemies for Glory and Victory, to that degree of bravery, that they would not eaſily yield the Victory, but contend for it [to the laſt.] For the ſame men, whom aſſiduous Defats had accuſtomed to think themſelves happy, if they coud but ſave themſelves by running from <hi>Hnnibal;</hi> Theſe he taught to eſteem it baſe and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious to return ſafe after a loſs of the Victory; leſt thereby they ſhould impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly confeſs, that they had given back in the ardor of the Fight; and to grieve to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, they had not forced the Palm out of the Enemies hands. Truth is, though <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopidas</hi> was never overcome in any Battel, where himſelf was preſent, and commanded in Chief; and <hi>Marcellus</hi> referr'd many Victories to his equals: truly he that could not be eaſily overcome<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> was of right to be compared with the moſt invincible. But <hi>Marcellus</hi> took <hi>Syracuſe;</hi> whereas <hi>Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidas</hi> was fruſtrated of his hope to reap the ſpoils of <hi>Sparta.</hi> But in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 'twas more difficult to advance
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:35952:221"/>
his Standard even to the Walls of <hi>Sparta,</hi> and to be the firſt of Mortals that ever paſſed the River <hi>Eurotas</hi> in Arms, than it was to tame <hi>Sicily;</hi> unleſs it be your judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that that Adventure, is with more of right to be attributed to <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> as was alſo the <hi>Leuctrick</hi> Battel. Whereas <hi>Marcellus</hi>'s Renown, and the glory of his brave Actions came intire and undiminiſhed to him alone. For he alone took <hi>Syracuſe;</hi> and without a Companion or Rival, fought with <hi>Hannibal;</hi> and quite changing the face of the War, was the firſt Captain that durſt attempt any thing memorable upon him, even at a time when all other Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains declined to fight him. The <hi>Gauls</hi> in like manner he routed and put to moſt ſhameful flight, without his Collegue. I commend not the death of either of theſe, nay rather I ſigh and groan, and am truly afflicted for their ſudden and unexpected fall. But I much admire, that in ſo many ſharp Conflicts, more than can be reckon'd in one day, <hi>Hannibal</hi> received not ſo much as one wound. I commend alſo <hi>Chryſantes</hi> (in <hi>Xenophon</hi>'s <hi>Cyrot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

as <hi>Euripides</hi> teacheth. For then no incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity is offer'd, but Death is called the action of him going off. Now the end of <hi>Pelopidas</hi>'s Victory, which conſiſted in the ſlaughter of the Tyrant, beſides the flame preſenting it ſelf to his eyes, did not wholly carry him away unadviſedly: becauſe it was not eaſie to lay hold of another glorious occaſion conjoyned with matter ſo honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and ſplendid. But <hi>Marcellus,</hi> when it made little to his advantage, and when no violent ardour (as it uſually falls out in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent danger) tranſported him to paſſion, throwing himſelf into danger, fell into an unexplored Ambuſh: he who had born five Conſulates, three Triumphs, won the ſpoils and glories of Kings and Victories, to act the part of a fore-runner, Scout, or Centinel, and to expoſe all his Atchievements to be trod under foot by the mercenary <hi>Spaniards</hi> that ſerved the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and by <hi>Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians;</hi> ſo that even themſelves envied to themſelves that unhoped ſucceſs, that they had oppreſs'd among a few <hi>Fregellans,</hi> that were Scouts, the moſt Valiant, the moſt Potent, and moſt Renowned man among the <hi>Romans.</hi> Let no man think that we

have ſaid theſe things out of deſign to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, but of freely reprehending, in their names, thoſe and their Virtue and Courage, or to which when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe Life, and refer the reſt of their noble Endowments; they periſhed not more to their Countrey, Allies and Friends, than to themſelves. After <hi>Pelopidas</hi> his death, his friends, for whom he died, made a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral for him; the Enemies, by whom he had been kill'd, made one for <hi>Marcellus.</hi> That was to be wiſh'd for, and fortunate. For he that honours Virtue purſuing him with enmity, is more noble and excellent, than he that requites a benefit. Since virtue alone challenges to it ſelf the honour of the former: but in the latter, profit and private advantage is rather beloved, than Virtue.</p>

For <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> whom all the World knows was Educated and lived in much poverty, and <hi>Plato</hi> the Philoſopher exhibited very Magnificent ſhews, the one ſetting forth an Entertainment of Flute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, the other of the Singers of <hi>Dithi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grambicks: Dion</hi> the <hi>Syracuſian</hi> ſupplying the expences of the latter, and <hi>Pelopidas</hi>

thoſe of <hi>Epaminondas.</hi> For good men are not irreconcileable Enemies to the receiving Preſents from their friends, but looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe that are taken to hoard, and with an avaritious intention as ſordid and mean, refuſe not ſuch as are had on the ſcore of Ambition and Splendour whence no gain accrueth. But <hi>Panaetius</hi> ſheweth that <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi> was miſtaken concerning the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pode</hi> through the likeneſs of the Name. For from the <hi>Perſian</hi> War to the end of the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopenneſian</hi> there are upon Record onely two by the Name of <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> who have ſet ſorth Plays and carried the Prize, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which was the ſame Son of <hi>Lyſima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus;</hi> but the Father of the one was <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylus,</hi> and the other much more modern; As the way of writing by the Grammar in uſe ſince the time of <hi>Euclid,</hi> and the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Name of <hi>Archeſtratus</hi> prove, whom in the time of the Wars with the <hi>Medes</hi> no one Writer mentions, but ſeveral during thoſe of <hi>Peloponneſus</hi> Chronicle as a Dramatick Poet. But this of <hi>Panaetius</hi> ought to be more nearly conſidered. As for the <hi>Oſtraciſm;</hi> every one was liable to it, who for his Reputation, Quality, or Eloquence; was eſteemed above the common Level; In ſo much as even <hi>Damon</hi> Praeceptor to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricles</hi> was baniſhed thereby becauſe he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a man of more than ordinary Senſe. And
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:35952:225"/>
more <hi>Idomeneus</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Ariſtides</hi> was not made Archon by the lot of the Bean but the free Election of the People. And if he governed after the Battel of <hi>Plateae,</hi> as <hi>Demetrius</hi> himſelf hath written, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry probable that by reaſon of his ſo great Reputation and ſucceſs in the Wars, he was preferred to that for his Virtue which others received in conſideration of their wealth. But <hi>Demetrius</hi> manifeſtly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth not only to exempt <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> but <hi>Socrates</hi> likewiſe from Poverty as a great Ill; for he ſaith the latter had not onely an Houſe of his own, but alſo ſeventy <hi>Minae</hi> put out to uſe with <hi>Crito.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Ariſtides</hi> being the familiar acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of that <hi>Cleſthenes,</hi> who ſetled the Government after the Expulſion of the thirty Tyrants, and above all Politicians imitating and admiring <hi>Lycurgus</hi> the <hi>Lacedaemonian,</hi> adhered to the Ariſtocratical way of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; but had <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> Son to <hi>Neocles</hi> his Adverſary in behalf of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulacy. Some ſay that, being Boys and bred up together from their Infancy, they were always at variance with each other in all their Words and Actions as well ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious as divertive, and that from this their contention they ſoon made diſcovery of their natural Inclinations; the one being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, adventurous and ſubtle, ſoon and with
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:35952:225"/>
much eaſe carried to any thing: the other a ſtayed and ſetled Temper and intent on the exerciſe of Juſtice, not admitting in any degree falſifying, ill language or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, no not ſo much as at his play. <hi>Ariſto</hi> of <hi>Chios</hi> ſaith, their Enmity had its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from Love, and thence encreaſed to ſo great an height; for being both enamou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of <hi>Steſilaus</hi> of <hi>Cea,</hi> the moſt beautiful of Youths, they were paſſionate beyond all moderation, neither laid they down their Rivalſhip even with the decaying Beauty of the Boy; but as it were exerciſed therein, they immediately applied themſelves to publick buſineſs with Heats and Differences.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> therefore joyned to a Party fortified himſelf with no inconſiderable ſtrength, inſomuch as to one who told him were he impartial he would govern <hi>Athens</hi> well; <hi>I wiſh,</hi> replied he, <hi>I may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſit on that Tribunal where my Friends ſhall not plead a greater Priviledg than ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</hi> But <hi>Ariſtides</hi> was in a manner ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in his Politicks, being unwilling in the firſt place to go along with his Aſſociates in ill doing, or by not gratifying them therein to become diſpleaſing to them; ſecondly, obſerving that many were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by the Authority of their Friends to act injuriouſly; he was cautious; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Opinion that the integrity of
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:35952:226"/>
of his Words and Actions was the onely ſecurity to a good Citizen. Howbeit <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtocles</hi> making many dangerous alterations, and withſtanding and interrupting him in the whole Series of his Actions, he alſo was neceſſitated to ſet himſelf againſt all <hi>Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocles</hi> did, partly in conſideration of his Revenge, and partly to impede his Power ſtill increaſing by the favour of the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; eſteeming it better to forget ſome publick conveniences rather than he by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing ſhould be powerful in all things. In fine, when he once oppoſed <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> in an Action that was expedient and had the better of him, he could not refrain ſaying when he left the Aſſembly, that unleſs they ſent <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> and himſelf to the <note n="*" place="margin">A Priſon or Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</hi>

                  <hi>Bara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrum</hi> there could be no ſafety for the Affairs of <hi>Athens.</hi> Another time moving a certain matter to the people, though there were oppoſition and ſtirring againſt it, yet he carried it. But the Preſident of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly being about to put it to the Vote, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving by the Debates the inconvenience thereof, he let it fall. Alſo he often brought in his Bills by other perſons, leſt <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtocles,</hi> through his ſtrife with him, ſhould be any hinderance to the good of the Publick.</p>
               <p>In any alteration of Affairs his Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy was admirable, as not being puffed up
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:35952:226"/>
with Honour, and demeaning himſelf undiſturb'd and ſedately in Adverſity, and alſo of Opinion that he ought to offer himſelf to the ſervice of his Countrey un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercinary and without the Reward not onely of Riches but even glory it ſelf. Whence it is likely, at the recital of theſe Verſes of <hi>Aeſchylus</hi> in the Theatre relating to <hi>Amphiaraus.</hi>

               </q>
               <p>The eyes of all the Spectators were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted on <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> as if this Vertue did in a moſt eſpecial manner appertain unto him. For he was a moſt ſtrong Champion for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, not onely againſt Friendſhip and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour but wrath and malice. Therefore it is reported of him that proſecuting the Law againſt one who was his Enemy, and the Judges after accuſation refuſing to hear the Criminal, but immediately proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to paſs Sentence upon him, he roſe in haſte from his Seat, and joyned in Petition with him for a hearing, and that he might enjoy the priviledge of the Law. Another time Judging between two private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the one declaring his Adverſary
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:35952:227"/>
had very much injured <hi>Ariſtides; Relate rather good Friend,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>what wrong he hath done thee. For it is thy cauſe, not my own, which I now ſit Judge of.</hi> Being cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen publick Treaſurer, he made it appear, that not onely thoſe of his time, but the preceeding Officers had alienated much Treaſure, and eſpecially <hi>Themiſtocles.</hi> For he was a wiſe Man, but <hi>light fingered.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>[Themiſtocles]</hi> aſſociating ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons againſt <hi>Ariſtides</hi> and impeaching him when he gave in his Accounts, cauſed him to be condemned of robbing the Publick; but the beſt and chiefeſt men of the City ill reſenting it, he was not only exempt from the Fine impoſed upon him, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe again deſigned to the ſame Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But pretending to repent him of his former practices, and carrying himſelf with more remiſſneſs, he became accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſuch as had pillaged the Treaſury, by not detecting or calling them to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act account. So that thoſe who had had their fill of the publick Caſh began highly to applaud <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> and ſued to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, making it their buſineſs to have him once more choſen Treaſurer. But being upon the point of Election he reproved the <hi>Athenians. When I diſcharged you my Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice well and faithfully,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I had dirt thrown in my face; but now I paſs over</hi>
                  <pb n="441" facs="tcp:35952:227"/>
                  <hi>many things in thoſe who rob the Treaſury, I ſeem an admirable Patriot. I am more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed therefore of this preſent Honour than the former Sentence, hut I commiſerate your condition, with whom it is more praiſe-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to oblige ill men, than conſerve the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of the Publick.</hi> By ſaying thus and diſcovering their Thefts, he ſtopped the mouths of thoſe who cryed him up and vouched for him, but gain'd a real com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation from the beſt men.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Datis</hi> (being ſent by <hi>Darius</hi> under pretence of revenging upon the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians.</hi> their burning of <hi>Sardis,</hi> but in reality to ſubjugate the <hi>Grecians</hi> to his Dominion) put in at <hi>Marathon</hi> and laid waſte the Countrey, among the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders ſet over the <hi>Athenians</hi> to manage the War. <hi>Miltiades</hi> was of the greateſt Authority; but the ſecond place, both for Reputation and Power, was poſſeſſed by <hi>Ariſtides:</hi> and when his Opinion to joyn Battel was added to that of <hi>Miltiades,</hi> it did not a little incline the Ballance. Every Leader by his Day having the Command in chief: When it came to <hi>[Ariſtides]</hi> his turn, he delivered it into the hands of <hi>Miltiades,</hi> giving his Fellow-Officers to underſtand that it is not diſhonourable to obey and follow men of good Conduct, but the contrary and ſafe. So appeaſing

their contention, and exho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

For now every one quitting their Day of Command had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to him onely. During the Fight the the main Body of the <hi>Athenians</hi> being the hardeſt put to it, the <hi>Barbarians</hi> for a long time making oppoſition there againſt the Tribes <hi>Leontis,</hi> and <hi>Antiochis, Themiſtocles</hi> and <hi>Ariſtides</hi> being ranged together fought vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly; for the one was of the Tribe <hi>Leontis,</hi> the other of <hi>Antiochis.</hi> But after the had beaten the <hi>Barbarians</hi> back to their Ships, and perceived that they ſailed not for the Iſles, but were driven in by the force of Sea and Wind towards the Countrey of <hi>Attick;</hi> fearing leſt they ſhould take the City [of <hi>Athens]</hi> unprovided of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, they ſpeeded away thither with nine Tribes, and reached it the ſame Day. But <hi>Ariſtides</hi> being left with his Tribe at <hi>Marathon</hi> to guard the Plunder and Priſoners deceived not the Opinion they had of him. For the abundance of Gold and Silver, of all ſorts of Apparel, and an infinite number of other things that were in the Tents and Veſſels they had taken, he had no deſire to meddle with himſelf, nor ſuffered any elſe to do it, unleſs there were ſuch who took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

Although the Divinity (to whom they deſire to compare and aſſimilate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) excels in three things, Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Power, and Vertue; but the moſt venerable and Divine is Vertue. For the Elements and Vacuum have Immortality; Earthquakes, Thunders, Storms, and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, have great power; but as for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Equity, nothing participates there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of except what is Divine, by the means of Sapience and Ratiocination. Wherefore there being three ways the Vulgar ſtand affected towards the Deity, an eſteem of his happineſs, a fear and honour of him; they ſeem to think him bleſt and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py for his want of Death and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: to fear and reverence him for his Power and Dominion: But to love, honour, and adore him for his Juſtice.

that Immortality which our Nature is not capable of, and that Power the greateſt part of which is at the diſpoſal of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; but fooliſhly poſtpone the onely Divine good in us, Vertue: For as much as Juſtice makes ſuch as are in Proſperty, Power and Authority to lead the life of a God, the contrary that of a Beaſt. <hi>Ariſtides</hi> therefore had, at firſt, the fortune to be belov'd for this ſurname, but at length envied.

For it was not the puniſhment of any flagitious Act, but ſpeciouſly term'd the Depreſſion and Reſtraint of exceeding Greatneſs and Power.

After this skirmiſh of the Horſe they kept from fighting a long time; for the Sooth ſayers by the Sacrifices foretold the Victory both to <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> if they ſtood upon the defenſive part onely, but if the Aggreſſors the contrary.

for them, which was not to be given in Publick, but of great advantage and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity to the City; they commanded <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtides</hi> onely to hear and conſider of it with him.

               <p>Being ſent in joint Commiſſion with <hi>Cimon</hi> to the Wars, he took notice that <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanias</hi> and the other <hi>Spartan</hi> Captains were moroſe and crabbed to the Confederates, and by being himſelf gentle and courteous in his Converſation, and making <hi>Cimon</hi> agreeable and ſociable in his Expeditions, he ſtole away the chief Command from the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> neither by Weapons, Ships, or Horſes, but by his civility and good behaviour.

Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, both the Sea Captains and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of the Land Army of the <hi>Grecians</hi> coming to <hi>Ariſtides</hi> perſwaded him to be their General, and receive the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates into his Command who had long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to relinquiſh the <hi>Spartans</hi> and come over to the <hi>Athenians.</hi> But he anſwered, that he ſaw both Equity and Neceſſity in what they ſaid, but their fidelity ſtood in need of ſome Action, the performance of which might keep the multitude from chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their minds, <hi>

<pb n="477" facs="tcp:35952:245"/>
furiouſly threatned ſoon to make them know that they had not attempted upon his Gally, but their own natural Countrey, they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him to depart and thank Fortune that fought for him at <hi>Plateae;</hi> for hitherto in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to that the <hi>Grecians</hi> did not inflict condign puniſhment upon him.

For when they perceived that their Generals were corrupted by the greatneſs of their Authority, they voluntarily laid down the chief Command, and left off ſending any more of them to the Wars, chooſing rather to have Citizens of Moderation and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in their Cuſtoms and Manners than to poſſeſs the Dominion of all <hi>Greece.</hi>

               <p>Now even during the Command of the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> the <hi>Grecians</hi> paid a certain Contribution towards the maintenance of the War; and being deſirous to have all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, Perſons, Town by Town, rated their due proportion, they deſired <hi>Ariſtides</hi> of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and gave him Command, ſurvey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Countrey and Revenue, to Seſſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one according to their ability and what they were worth.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated the age of <hi>Saturn;</hi> ſo did the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates of <hi>Athens, Ariſtides</hi> his Taxation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> terming it the happy Time of <hi>Greece,</hi> and that more eſpecially, the ſame being in a ſhort time doubled, and ſoon after trebled. For the Aſſeſsment which <hi>Ariſtides</hi> made was four hundred and ſixty Talents. But to this <hi>Pericles</hi> added very near one third part more, for <hi>Thucydides</hi> ſaith, that in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the <hi>[Peloponneſian]</hi> War, the <hi>Athenians</hi> had coming in from their Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates ſix hundred Talents. But after <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricles</hi> his death, the <hi>Demagogues</hi> encreaſing by little and little, raiſed it to the ſum of thirteen hundred Talents, not through the Wars being ſo expenſive and chargeable, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the length or ill ſucceſs thereof, as by their exciting the people to <hi>Largeſſes,</hi> Play-Houſe-expences, and the erecting of Statues and Temples. <hi>Ariſtides</hi> therefore acquiring a wonderful and great Reputation by his levying the Tribute, <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> is ſaid to deride him as if this were not the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a Man but a Money-bag, making a diſlike return to the free ſpeech of <hi>Ariſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</hi> For he, when <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> once was ſaying, that he thought the chiefeſt Vertue of a General was to underſtand and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know the Meaſures the Enemy would take,
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:35952:246"/>
replied, This indeed, <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, but abſtinence from bribes is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent thing and truly worthy a General.</p>
               <p>Moreover, <hi>Ariſtides</hi> made all the people of <hi>Greece</hi> ſwear (to keep the League) and himſelf took the Oath in the name of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians,</hi> flinging Wedges of red hot Iron into the Sea after Curſes [pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them that ſhould make breach of their Vow.] But afterwards, it ſeems, when things were at ſuch a paſs as conſtrained them to govern with a ſtronger hand, he adviſed the <hi>Athenians,</hi> throwing the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury upon him, to manage Affairs as their convenience required. Upon the whole matter <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> tells us, this Perſon was in his own private affairs, and thoſe of his fellow Citizens nicely juſt, but that in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick matters he did many things according to the ſtate and condition of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, as frequently requiring acts of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice. It is reported of him, that he ſhould ſay to one who was in debate whether he ſhould convey the Treaſure from <hi>Delos</hi> to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> contrary to the League at the perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>Samians, that the thing indeed was not juſt but expedient.</hi>

Nor did he ever buy a Slave for above 1500 Drachms, or ſeek for effeminate handſome ones, but able, ſturdy Workmen, ſuch as are Oſtlers and Neat-herds: And theſe he thought ought to be ſold again, when once they grew old; nor wou'd he allow them ſo much as Victuals, when they became uſeleſs.

body made as if it were intollerable that ever the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould promiſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> a Reward for their Aſſiſtance; but <hi>Cato</hi> ſaid, There was no diſcredit or harm in it; for if they overcame, they would pay them out of the Enemies Purſe, and not out of their own; but if they were overcome, there wou'd be no body left to demand the ſaid Reward. But he ſtoutly won that Battel, and after that, all his other affairs ſucceeded ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly; for <hi>Polybius</hi> ſays, That by his command the Walls of all the Cities, on this ſide the River <hi>Baetis,</hi> were in one days time demoliſhed, and yet there were a great many of them full of ſtout and warlike men. <hi>Cato</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſays, That he took more Cities than he ſtay'd days in <hi>Spain.</hi> Neither is this a Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domantado, if it be true, that the number was Four hundred.

               <p>Now he had five ſervants with him in the Army; one of them, called <hi>Paccus,</hi> bought three Boys, out of thoſe who were taken Captive; which <hi>Cato</hi> coming to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, the poor fellow, rather than he would venture into his preſence, hang'd himſelf, ſo that <hi>Cato</hi> again ſold the ſaid Boys, and carried the Price he got for them into the publick Exchequer.</p>

a ſpectatour of the Beauty and Greatneſs of their City. But this is not true; for he ſpoke to the <hi>Athenians</hi> by an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, though he was able to have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken himſelf; but his intention thereby was to keep up the Faſhion of his own Countrey, and as it were ſcornfully laugh at thoſe who admired nothing but what was in <hi>Greek.</hi> Wherefore jeſting upon <hi>Poſthumius Albinus,</hi> who had written a <hi>Greek Hiſtory,</hi> and begg'd pardon for doing ſo, he ſaid, <hi>Pardon indeed ought to have been given him had he not undertook the Work by the Votes or Order of the Amphictyones.</hi> The <hi>Athenians,</hi> they ſay, did admire the quickneſs and celerity of his Speech, for an Interpreter wou'd be very long a repeating what he expreſſed with a great deal of brevity. In ſhort, he made them believe, that the words of the <hi>Greeks</hi> came onely from their Lips, whilſt thoſe of the <hi>Romans</hi> came from their Hearts.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Antiochus</hi> having guarded with his Army the narrow paſſages about the Mountains, called <hi>Thermopyloe,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Trenches and Walls to the natural Fortifications of the place, ſate down there thinking he had done enough to divert the War from thence, ſo that the <hi>Romans</hi> ſeem'd wholly to deſpair of forcing the Paſſage; but <hi>Cato</hi> calling to mind the Compaſs and Circuit which the <hi>Perſians</hi>

did they perceive all this while that they were near the Enemy. And now the day began to give ſome light, when they ſeem'd to hear a noiſe, and preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſee the <hi>Greek</hi> Trenches and Guard at the foot of the Rock. Here therefore <hi>Cato</hi> ſtaid his Forces, and commanded the <hi>Firmians</hi> onely without the reſt to ſtick by him, for them he had found always faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ready, and ſtreight they ſtood round him at their cloſe order, whilſt he thus ſpoke to them.

The Enemy perceiving them thus tumbling as it were upon them from the Precipices, flew to their <hi>Main Guard,</hi> and put all things into Diſorder. In the mean time whilſt <hi>Manlius</hi> was forcing the Works below, and pouring the thickeſt of his Forces into the narrow Paſſages, <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> was hit in the mouth with a ſtone, ſo that his teeth being beaten out thereby, he felt ſuch exceſſive pain, that he was fain to turn tail with his Horſe; nor did any part of their Army ſtand the ſhock of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now though there ſeem'd no hopes of Fight by reaſon of the inacceſſible ways and By-paths, as alſo of the deep Mariſhes and ſteep Rocks, which look'd as if they were ready to receive thoſe who ſhou'd tumble down; the <hi>Athenians</hi> neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs crowding and preſſing together in the ſtrait Paſſages, deſtroy'd even one another whilſt they ſeem'd afraid of the Swords and Blows of the Enemy. <hi>Cato</hi> (as it plainly appears) was never over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparing of his own Praiſes, and ſeldom ſhunn'd boaſting of any Exploit, which

After the Fight he was ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> that he himſelf might be the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of it; ſo that with a favourable Wind he ſail'd to <hi>Branduſium,</hi> and in one day got from thence to <hi>Tarentum;</hi> and having tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd four days more, upon the fith, count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the time he came from Sea, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſo he himſelf brought the firſt news of the Victory; whereby he fill'd the whole City with Joy and Sacrifices; and the People with an opinion, that they were able to conquer both Sea and Land.</p>
               <p>Now theſe are almoſt all the Eminent A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of <hi>Cato,</hi> relating to military Affairs: but as to Civil Policy, he was of opinion, that a great part of it ought to be employ'd in accuſing and enditing Malefactours; for he himſelf did proſecute many, and wou'd

But neither did he himſelf 'ſcape ſcot-free in his Managery of Affairs; for if he gave his Enemies but the leaſt Hold, he was ſtill in danger, and ready to be brought to Juſtice, for he is reported to have eſcap'd at leaſt 50 Enditements; and one above the reſt, which was the laſt, when he was fourſcore and ſix years old, about which time, he had this remarkable Saying, <hi>That it was hard for him who had liv'd contemporary with others a great while ago, to plead now before a new Race of Men.</hi>

<pb n="519" facs="tcp:35952:267"/>
in the preſence of his Daughter, and in open day he was a little too ſweet upon his own Wife. He wou'd uſe to ſay too, That his Wife never hugg'd him ſo cloſe as when there was a great Thunder; therefore when he had a mind to rally, he wou'd add, That he was happy when <hi>Jupiter</hi> thunder'd. <hi>Lucius</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the Brother of <hi>Scipio,</hi> and one who had been honour'd vvith a Triumph, occaſion'd ſome Envy againſt <hi>Cato</hi> for taking his Horſe from him, and ſeeming to do it vvith a deſign of putting an affront on <hi>Scipio Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus;</hi> but moſt of all he chock'd the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by retrenching from their Luxury, though (moſt of the youth being thereby already corrupted) it ſeem'd almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to take it away vvith an open hand and directly; vvherefore going, as it were, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely round the hedge, he caus'd all Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, Voitures, Womens Apparel, Utenſils of Houſevvifery, whoſe price exceeded a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and five hundred Drachms, to be rated at ten times as much as they vvere vvorth; intending by thus making the ſaid Rates grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to make greater alſo the publick Tributes.

<pb n="520" facs="tcp:35952:268"/>
prodigality. Hereby, on the one ſide, not onely they were diſguſted at <hi>Cato</hi> who bore the Taxes for the ſake of their Luxury, but thoſe too who on the other ſide lay'd by their Luxury for fear of the Taxes; for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people reckon, That an Order not to ſhew their Riches, is equivalent to the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away their Riches; becauſe Riches are ſeen much more in ſuperfluous, than in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary things, though this made <hi>Ariſto</hi> the Philoſopher, much wonder that we ſhou'd account them who poſſeſs'd ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous things more happy than thoſe who abounded with what was neceſſary and uſeful. In troth, reply'd he, in theſe unuſeful and unneceſſary things am I happy and rich. Thus the ardent deſire of Riches, proceeds not from any natural Paſſion within us, but ariſes rather from ſome vulgar and extrinſick opinion. <hi>Cato</hi> notwithſtanding being little ſollicitous as to thoſe who exclaim'd againſt him, grew more ſtiff in his Auſterity: He therefore caus'd the Pipes, through which ſome perſons brought the publick Water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their own Houſes and Gardens to be cut, and threw down all the Porches which jet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out into the common ſtreets. He beat down alſo the price of publick Works, and, on the other ſide, rais'd the Impoſts on all things that were ſold; by which proceedings he contracted a great deal of
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:35952:268"/>
hatred to himſelf. Now thoſe who were of <hi>Titus Flaminius</hi>'s Cabal, vacated in open Council all the Bargains and Contracts made by him for the repairing and carrying on of the ſacred and publick Buildings, as bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no profit to the Commonwealth: They did incite alſo the boldeſt of the Tribunes of the people to accuſe him to the Rabble, and to fine him two Talents. They did likewiſe very much oppoſe him in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Palace which he caus'd to be erected at the common charge, juſt by the Senate-houſe, in the Market-place, and call'd it by his own name, <hi>Porcia</hi> Houſe. However the people it ſeems did like his Cenſourſhip wondrous well, for ſetting up a Statue for him in the Temple of the Goddeſs of Health, they put an Inſcription under it, not of his War-like Feats and Triumphs, but ſuch a one as ſignify'd, <hi>That this was</hi> Cato <hi>the Cenſour, who by his good Diſcipline and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances reclaim'd the Roman Common-wealth when it was declining and ſupinely tumbling into Vice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now before this Statue-honour was done to himſelf, he us'd to laugh at thoſe who lov'd ſuch kind of things, ſaying, They were not ſenſible that they glory'd chiefly in the Workmanſhip of Engravers and Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but that the Citizens bore about his fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Image in their Breaſts. When any ſeem'd to
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:35952:269"/>
wonder at him, that he ſhould have never a Statue, when many ordinary perſons had one; I wou'd (ſaid he) much rather be ask'd why I have not one, than why I have one. In ſhort, He would not have any honeſt Citizen endure to be prais'd, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it might prove advantageous to the Common-wealth; yet ſtill he moſt of all commended himſelf; for he would often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, that they who were of an ill life, and found fault with, us'd to ſay, <hi>It was not ſure ſo great a feat to blame them, for they preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not all to be</hi> Cato<hi>'s.</hi> He wou'd alſo add, That they who did awkardly mimick ſome <note place="margin">

Theſe things are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed too teſtify'd of him by others; for he had a great Authority in the City, both for his Life, Eloquence and Age. He was alſo a good Father, an excellent Husband to his Wife, and an extraordinary Oeconomiſt; nor did he manage all theſe his Affairs careleſly, and as things of little moment. Wherefore I think I ought to run over a little farther, whatever was commendable in him.</p>
               <p>He marry'd a Wife more noble than rich; being of opinion nevertheleſs, that both of
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:35952:269"/>
them ſo qualify'd are uſually haughty and proud: but yet that thoſe of noble blood, wou'd be more aſham'd of baſe things, and conſequently more obedient to their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands in all that was fit and handſome for them. Him that beat his Wife or Child, he eſteem'd as one that laid violent hands on what was moſt ſacred; and a good Husband he reckon'd worthy of more Praiſe than a great Senatour; wherefore he did in nothing more admire old <hi>Socrates,</hi> than that with a ſcolding Wife and block-headed Children, he liv'd contented and quiet.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as ever his Son was born, though he had never ſuch urgent buſineſs upon his hands, (if it related not to the Publick) he wou'd be by when his Wife did unſwaddle and waſh it; for ſhe her ſelf ſuckled it, nay did often too give her Breaſt to her Servants Children, to beget by ſucking the ſame Milk a kind of natural Love in them to her Son. Now when he began to come to years of Diſcretion, <hi>Cato</hi> himſelf would teach him his Book, although he had a Servant, a very honeſt fellow and a good Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, called <hi>Chilo,</hi> who alſo taught a good many others; but he thought not fit, as he himſelf ſaid, to have his Son repriman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a Servant; or pull'd it may be, by the Ears when found tardy in his Leſſon: Nor wou'd he have him owe to a Servant
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:35952:270"/>
the obligation of ſo great a thing as his Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; vvherefore he himſelf (as we vvere ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) taught him Grammar, Law and Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing: Nor did he onely ſhew him too how to throw a Dart, to fight with other Arms, and to Ride, but even to play at Fiſty-cuffs, to endure both heat and cold, and to ſwim over the moſt rapid and rough Rivers. He ſays likewiſe, that he wrote Hiſtories, in great Characters, with his own hand, that ſo his Son without ſtirring out of the Houſe, might learn the Experience and vertuous Exploits of his Forefathers: Nor did he leſs abſtain from ſpeaking any thing obſcene before his Son, than if it had been in the preſence of thoſe ſacred Virgins, which we call <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtals:</hi> Nor would he ever go into the Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no with him, which ſeems to be according to the common cuſtome of the <hi>Romans;</hi> for Sons-in-Law avoided ſtill bathing with Fathers-in-Law, being aſham'd to ſee one another naked: But having in time learn'd of the <hi>Greeks</hi> to ſtrip with the Men, they have ſince taught the <hi>Greeks</hi> to doe it even with the Women themſelves.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Cato</hi> form'd and faſhion'd his Son to Vertuous Inclinations, who was not to be found fault with as to his ſpritefulneſs; but being of too weak a conſtitution for hardſhips, he requir'd not of him any auſtere or hard way of living.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="525" facs="tcp:35952:270"/>
However, though he was thus tender and delicate, he prov'd a ſtout man in the Field, and valiantly behav'd himſelf when <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> fought againſt <hi>Perſeus,</hi> where when his Sword was ſtruck from him by a blow, or rather ſlipt out of his hand by reaſon of the moiſtneſs thereof; He ſo far reſented it, that he turned to ſome of his friends about him, and taking them along with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain fell upon the Enemy; and having by along Fight and much force clear'd the place at length found it among great heaps of Arms, and the dead Bodies of his Friends as well as Enemies pil'd one upon another. Whereupon <hi>Paulus</hi> the Governour very much recommended the youth; and there is even a Letter of <hi>Cato</hi>'s to his Son, which does very highly praiſe this his honourable Exploit and Proweſs for the Recovery one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of his Sword. Afterwards he married, <hi>Tertia Paulus Aemilius</hi>'s Daughter, and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to <hi>Scipio;</hi> nor did he match into this Family leſs for his own Worth than his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's, ſo that <hi>Cato</hi>'s care in his Sons Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had an effect ſuitable. He purchas'd ſtill a great many Slaves out of the Captives taken in War, but chiefly he bought up the young ones, who were capable to be (as it were) broken and taught like little Whelps and Colts; but none of theſe ever went into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother man's houſe, except ſent either by <hi>Cato</hi>

they were found guilty. But being after all much given to an extravagant deſire of Gain, he lookt upon Agriculture rather as a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure than Profit; reſolving therefore to lay out his money in laſting and ſolid things, he purchas'd Ponds, Hot baths, Grounds full of Fullers Earth, Paſtures and Wood, whereby a great Revenue flow'd in unto him, and ſuch a one (he us'd to ſay) as <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelf cou'd not hurt. He was alſo given to a moſt blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Uſury in his Trafick by Sea; and that thus: He would that thoſe whom he put out his money to, ſhou'd have many Partners; now when the number of them and their Ships came to be Fifty, he himſelf wou'd put in but one ſhare; for which <hi>Quintion,</hi> whom he had made a Freeman, and who traded and ſail'd along with the ſaid Adventurers, was to be his Factour; ſo that thus there was no danger of loſing his whole ſtock, but onely a little part, and that with a proſpect of great profit.

to have been one of his laſt Feats of State, when indeed <hi>Scipio</hi> the younger did by his Valour give it the Necking-blow, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed chiefly by the Counſel and Advice of <hi>Cato.</hi> The War happen'd upon this occaſion, <hi>Cato</hi> was ſent to the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> and <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſſa,</hi> King of <hi>Numidia,</hi> who were at War with one another, to know the cauſe of their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.

Now he finding <hi>Carthage,</hi> not (as the <hi>Romans</hi> thought) low and in an ill condition, but well mann'd, full of Riches, all ſorts of Arms and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, and perceiving the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> thereupon carry it high, he conceiv'd that the <hi>Romans</hi> had not time to adjuſt Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs betwen them and <hi>Maſſaniſſa,</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that they themſelves wou'd fall into danger, except they kept under that ſame City, which had of old been an Enemy, and ſtill bore a grudge to <hi>Rome,</hi> and grew incredibly ſtronger and ſtronger: Wherefore returning quickly to <hi>Rome,</hi> he acquainted the Senate, That the former Defeats and Blows given to the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> had not ſo much diminiſh'd their Strength, as it had abated their Imprudence and Folly;
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:35952:276"/>
that they were not become weaker, but more experienc'd in War, and did onely skirmiſh with the <hi>Numidians,</hi> to exerciſe themſelves the better to cope with the <hi>Romans:</hi> That the Peace and League they had made was but a kind of Suſpenſion of Arms, till they expected a fairer opportunity to break again. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they ſay, That ſhaking his Gown, he took occaſion to let drop ſome <hi>Africk</hi> Figs before the Senate. Now they admiring the bigneſs and fairneſs of them, he preſently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>That the Place that bore them was but three days ſail from Rome;</hi> Nay, he never after this gave his Opinion; but at the end he wou'd be ſure to come out with this Sentence, CAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THAGE METHINKS OUGHT UTTER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY TO BE DESTROY'D. But <hi>P. Scipio Naſica</hi> wou'd always declare his opinion to the contrary, in theſe words, <hi>It ſeems requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to me that Carthage ſhould ſtill ſtand.</hi> Now <hi>P. Scipio</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Romans</hi> very haughty, and by reaſon of their proſperity, growing obſtinate and diſobedient to the Senate; as alſo drawing the whole City whither they wou'd after them. He vvould have had the Fear of <hi>Carthage</hi> to ſerve as a Bit to hold in the Contumacy of the Multitude; for though he look't upon the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> too weak to overcome the <hi>Romans,</hi> yet he thought them too Great to be deſpis'd. On the other ſide, it ſeem'd a dangerous
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:35952:276"/>
thing to <hi>Cato,</hi> that a City which had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways great, and was now grown ſober and wiſe by reaſon of its former Calamities, ſhou'd ſtill lie as it were upon the Catch with the <hi>Romans,</hi> who were now become wanton and faulty by reaſon of their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; ſo that he thought it the wiſeſt courſe to have all outward dangers remov'd when they had ſo many inward ones among themſelves.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Cato</hi> (they ſay) ſtirr'd up the third and laſt War againſt the <hi>Carthaginians:</hi> But no ſooner was the ſaid War begun, but he dy'd, prophecying of the Perſon that ſhould put an End to it (viz. <hi>Scipio</hi> the ſecond) who was then but a young man; but being a Colonel, he in ſeveral Fights gave proof of his Courage and Conduct.

When <hi>Crauſis</hi> dyed, he repay'd the Father's hoſpitable kindneſs
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:35952:284"/>
in the care of the Orphan-Sons; by which means <hi>Philopoemen</hi> was Educated by him, as <hi>Homer</hi> ſays <hi>Achilles</hi> was by <hi>Phoenix,</hi> and from his Infancy moulded to great and vertuous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations. But <hi>Ecdemus</hi> and <hi>Demophanes</hi> had the principal tuition of him, after he was paſt the years of Childhood. They were both <hi>Megalopolitans;</hi> who had been Scholars in the Academick Philoſophy, and friends to <hi>Arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilaus,</hi> and above all men of their time, apply'd Learning to Action, and State-Affairs. They had freed their Countrey from ſlavery, by the death of <hi>Ariſtodemus,</hi> whom they caus'd to be kill'd: They had aſſiſted <hi>Aratus</hi> in driving out the Tyrant <hi>Nicocles</hi> from <hi>Sycione;</hi> and at the requeſt of the <hi>Cyreneans,</hi> where the Publick was in much confuſion, went thither by Sea, inſtituted for them excellent Laws, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their Commonwealth in exact Diſcipline.

And indeed all <hi>Greece</hi> (which lookt upon him as a kind of latter brood, brought ſorth, after ſo many famous Captains in her decrepit age,) lov'd him won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully; and as his Glory grew, increas'd his Power.

His Perſon was not, as ſome fancy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd; for his Statue is yet to be ſeen at <hi>Delphos.</hi> As for the miſtake of the Hoſteſs of <hi>Megara,</hi> they ſay it was occaſioned by the meanneſs of his habit, the homelineſs of his garb, and the eaſie plainneſs of his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. This Hoſteſs having word brought her that the General of the <hi>Achaeans</hi> was coming to her Houſe in the abſence of her Husband, was all in a hurry about providing of his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. <hi>Philopoemen,</hi> in a thread-bare unfaſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable Cloak, arriving in this point of time, ſhe took him for one of his own train, and pray'd him to lend her his hand in her Houſhold-work: He preſently threw off his Cloak, and fell to Cleaving of Logs: The Husband returning, and catching him at it, Why, what, ſays he, may this mean, my Lord <hi>Philopoemen?</hi> I am, reply'd he in his <hi>Dorick</hi> dialect, paying the fine of my deformity and ungraceful preſence. <hi>Flaminius</hi> ſeeming to rally the faſhion of his body, told him one day, he had well-ſhap'd hands and feet, but no belly: And he was indeed ſlender in the waſte. But this railery was meant to the poverty of his fortune; for he had good Horſe and Foot, but often wanted money to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and pay them. And theſe pleaſant ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries go about of <hi>Philopoemen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As he was inſatiably covetous of honour, his conditions were ſomewhat rough and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick,
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:35952:285"/>
and not altogether free from cenſure. He ſtrove to be like <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> and came not much behind him in Valour, good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and uncorruptible integrity: But his boiling contentious humour not ſuffering him in civil Conteſts, to keep within the bounds of gravity, ſweetneſs and obliging condeſcendence, he was thought more proper for the Camp than for the City; for he was ſtrongly inclin'd to War, even from his childhood, he both ſtudied and practis'd things belonging to it, taking great delight in managing of Horſes, and handling of Weapons. Becauſe he was naturally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd for Wreſtling, his Friends and Tutours perſwaded him to beſtow ſome pains that way. But he would firſt be ſatisfy'd whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it would not hinder him from becoming a Souldier. They told him as it was, that the one was directly oppoſite to the other, their ways of living, and exerciſes quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent: the Wreſtler ſleeping much, and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding plentifully, punctually regular in his ſet-times of exerciſe and reſt, and apt to ſpoil all by every little exceſs, or breach of his uſual method; whereas the Souldier by all variety of irregular changes was, to bring himſelf to endure hunger, and watching without difficulty. <hi>Philopoemen</hi> hearing this, not onely laid by all thoughts of Wreſtling and contemn'd it then, but when
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:35952:285"/>
he came to be General, diſcourag'd it by all marks of reproach and infamy he could ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, as a thing which made men, otherwiſe excellently fit for War, to be utterly uſeleſs and unable to fight on neceſſary occaſions:</p>
               <p>When he left off his Maſters and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and began to bear Arms in the incurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which his Citizens us'd to make upon the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> for pillage or ſudden ſurprizes, he would always march out the firſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the laſt. When there was nothing to doe, he ſought to harden his body, and make it ſtrong and active by hunting or labouring in his ground: For he had a good Eſtate about 20 furlongs from the Town, and thither he would go every day after Dinner and Supper; and when night came, throw himſelf upon the firſt Mattras in his way, and there ſleep as one of the Labourers. At break of day he would riſe with the reſt, and work either in the Vineyard or at the Plow, from thence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again to the Town, and employ his time with his friends, or the Magiſtrates in publick buſineſs. What he got in the Wars, he laid out on Horſes, Arms, or redeeming Captives; but endeavour'd to improve his own Eſtate, the juſteſt way, by Tillage. And this not ſlightly, by way of diverſion, but thinking it preciſe duty, ſo to manage his own fortune, as to be out of the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of wronging others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="554" facs="tcp:35952:286"/>
He ſpent much time on Eloquence and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, but ſelected his Authors, and cared onely for thoſe by whom he might profit in Vertue. In <hi>Homer</hi>'s fictions he attentively minded whatever he thought apt to raiſe the Courage. But he ſtuddied principally the Commentaries of <hi>Evangelus</hi> for the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhalling of Armies. He took delight alſo in the Hiſtories of <hi>Alexander</hi> at leiſure hours, ſtill conſidering how to bring what he read into practice: For never heeding what ſuch Books uſe for ſpeculation ſake to draw out in figures; He lov'd to ſee, and diſcourſe of what the nature of places and their ſituations wou'd bear. So that he would be exerciſing his thoughts, and conſidering, as he travell'd, and arguing with thoſe about him of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties of ſteep or broken ground; what might happen at Rivers, Ditches or Straits; in marching cloſe or open; in this or that particular form of battel. The truth is, he was too much addicted to War, which he paſſionately lov'd as the means to exerciſe all ſorts of vertue, and utterly contemn'd thoſe who were not Souldiers, as Drones and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in the Commonwealth.</p>
               <p>When he was thirty years of age, <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> King of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> ſurpriz'd <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galopolis</hi> by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

through with a Thong'd Javelin. It was thrown with a good will, ſo that the head came out on the other ſide, and made a great, though not a mortal wound. There he ſtood a while, as if he had been ſhackled and unable to remove. The Thong in the middle of the Weapon hinder'd it from being drawn out, nor would any about him venture to do it. But the fight being now at the hotteſt, and like to be quickly over, he was tranſported with deſire of Combat, and ſtrugled and ſtrain'd ſo long, ſetting one leg forward, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther back, till at laſt he broke the Staff, and made the pieces be pull'd out. Being in this manner ſet at liberty, he caught up his Sword, and running through the midſt of thoſe who vvere fighting in the firſt ranks, ſtrangely animated his Men, and ſet them a fire with emulation. <hi>Antigonus,</hi> after the Victory, ask'd the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> to try them, how it hapned the Horſe had charged without or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der before the Signal?

               <p>This, as needs it muſt, brought <hi>Philopoemen</hi> into great repuration. <hi>Antigonus</hi> was earneſt to have him in his ſervice, and offer'd him very advantageous conditions both as to

Command and Pay. But <hi>Philopoemen,</hi> who knew that his nature brooked not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der another, would not accept them; yet not enduring to live idle, and hearing of Wars in <hi>Crete,</hi> he paſs'd over thither. He ſpent ſome time among thoſe very war-like, but withall ſober, temperate men, improving much by experience in all ſorts of ſervice, and then return'd with ſo much fame, that the <hi>Achoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> preſently choſe him General of the Horſe. Theſe Horſe at that time had neither expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience nor heart, having gotten a cuſtome to ſerve on pitiful Jades, the firſt and cheapeſt they could procure, when they wereto march, which too they ſeldom did, but hired others in their places, and ſtaid at home them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Their former Commanders winkt at this, becauſe it being a degree of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour among the <hi>Achoeans</hi> to ſerve on Horſe-back, they had a great deal of power in the Commonwealth, and were able to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie or moleſt whom they pleas'd. <hi>Philopoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> finding them in this condition, yielded not to ſuch reſpects, nor would paſs it over as formerly. But went himſelf from Town to Town, where ſpeaking with the young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen man by man, he endeavour'd to bring them in love with praiſe and honour, and making a handſome appearance in the Field, ſetting Fines on them who came unfurniſh'd of what was requiſite for their parade.

Where they were like to have moſt Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, there he would be ſure to exerciſe them, and make them skirmiſh in ſport one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. In a little time he made them won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful ſtrong and bold, and which is reckoned of greateſt conſequence in War, quick and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous. With uſe and induſtry they grew ſo perfect, to ſuch a command of their Horſes, ſuch a ready exactneſs in wheeling whole or half turns, and all motions, that in the change of poſtures the whole body ſeem'd as eaſily and as ſteadily mov'd as one Man. In the great Battel which they fought with the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolians</hi> and <hi>Elians</hi> by the River <hi>Lariſſus,</hi> he ſet them an example himſelf. <hi>Demophantes,</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the <hi>Elian</hi> Horſe, ſingled out <hi>Philopoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> and ran with full ſpeed at him. <hi>Philopoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> prevented, and with a violent blow of his Spear overthrew him dead to the ground: Upon whoſe fall the Enemy fled immediatly. And now <hi>Philopoemen</hi>'s name was in every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies mouth, as a man who in fighting valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with his hands yielded not to the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, nor to the oldeſt in good conduct, and than whom there came not into the Field a better Souldier or Commander.</p>

                  <hi>Grecians.</hi> Whence it hapned as in run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning waters, where when few and little bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies once ſtop, others ſtick to them, and one part ſtrengthning another, the whole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes firm and ſolid; So in a general weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when every City relying onely on it ſelf, all <hi>Greece</hi> lay expos'd to an eaſie deſtruction. The <hi>Achaeans</hi> firſt united themſelves into a body, then drawing in their neighbours round about, ſome by protection, others by Naturalization, deſign'd at laſt to bring all <hi>Peloponneſus</hi> into one Community. Yet while <hi>Aratus</hi> liv'd, they depended much on the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> courting firſt <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> then <hi>Antigonus</hi> and <hi>Philip,</hi> who had a great influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on the affairs of <hi>Greece.</hi> But when <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopoemen</hi> came to command, the <hi>Achaeans</hi> growing ſtrong enough for the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of their Enemies, would march no longer under Foreigners. The truth is <hi>Aratus,</hi> as we have written at large in his Life, was not of ſo War-like a temper, but did moſt by ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and his taking carriage and friendſhip with Foreign Princes. But <hi>Philopoemen</hi> being a man both of Execution and Command, a great Souldier, and fortunate in his firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, wonderfully heightned both the Power and courage of the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to Victory under his Conduct.</p>
               <p>But firſt he alter'd what he found amiſs in their Arms, and form of battel. Formerly they
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:35952:289"/>
us'd light, thin Bucklers, too narrow to cover the body, and Javelins much ſhorter than Pikes. By which means they were practis'd in skirmiſhing at a diſtance, but in a cloſe Fight had much the diſadvantage. Then in their form of Battel, they underſtood no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of fighting in a Ring, nor any figure but a Square; To which too not allowing front enough, nor cloſing it ſtrongly, as in the <hi>Macedonian Phalanx,</hi> where the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhoulder cloſe, and their Bucklers touch, they were eaſily opened and broken. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopoemen</hi> reform'd all this, perſuading them to change the narrow Target and ſhort Javelin, into a large Buckler and long Pike; to arm their heads, bodies, thighs and legs; and inſtead of looſe skirmiſhing, fight firmly and foot to foot. After he had brought them all to wear Armour, and by that means, into the confidence of thinking themſelves now invincible, he turn'd their wanton riotous profuſions into an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble expence. For being long us'd to vie in Cloaths, furniture of their Houſes, and ſervice of their Tables, and to glory in out-doing one another, the diſeaſe by cuſtom was grown incurable, and which there was no thinking to take quite away. But he diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the humour, and brought them, inſtead of theſe ſuperfluities, to love uſeful and more manly bravery, and ſparing from other things,
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:35952:290"/>
to take delight in appearing magnificent in their Equipage of War. Nothing then was to be ſeen in the ſhops but Plate breaking or Melting down, gilding of Backs and Breaſts, ſtudding Bucklers and Bits with Silver: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the places of Exerciſe, but Horſes managing, and young men Exerciſing their Arms: Nothing in the Ladies hands, but Helmets and Creſts, Feathers of all colours, Embroidered Coat-armours, and Capariſons for Horſes. The ſight of which bravery quickning and raiſing their Spirits, made them contemn dangers, and ready to venture on any honourable dangers.</p>
               <p>Their former Gallantry did indeed pleaſe; but withal effeminate: the tickling of the ſenſe ſlackning the vigour of the mind; but in theſe it ſtrengthned and heightned their courage, as <hi>Homer</hi> makes <hi>Achilles</hi> at the ſight of his new Arms ſpringing with joy, and on fire to uſe them. When <hi>Philopoemen</hi> had obtain'd of them to Arm, and ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out in this manner, he proceeded to Train them, Muſtering and Exerciſing them perpetually, and they obey'd him with great exactneſs. For they vvere vvonderfully pleas'd with their new form of battel, vvhich being ſo knit and cemented together, ſeem'd almoſt impoſſible to be broken. And then their Arms, vvhich for their Riches and Beauty they wore with pleaſure, becoming
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:35952:290"/>
light and eaſie with conſtant uſe, they long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for nothing more than to try them with an Enemy, and fight in earneſt.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Achaeans</hi> at that time were at War with <hi>Machanidas</hi> the Tyrant of <hi>Lacedaemon,</hi> who having a ſtrong Army, watch'd all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of becoming entire Maſter of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loponneſus.</hi> When intelligence came that he was fall'n upon the <hi>Mantineans, Philopoemen</hi> preſently took the field, and march't towards him. They met near <hi>Mantinea,</hi> and drew up in ſight of the City. Both, beſides the whole ſtrength of their ſeveral Cities, had a good number of Mercenaries in pay. When they came to fall on, <hi>Machanidas,</hi> with his hir'd Souldiers, beat the Darts and Lances which <hi>Philopoemen</hi> had placed in the Front. <note place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> But when he ſhould have charged imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately into the main Battel, which ſtood cloſe and firm, he hotly follow'd the chace; and inſtead of routing the <hi>Achaeans</hi> Army, diſorder'd his own. With ſo untoward a beginning the reſt of the Confederates gave themſelves for loſt; but <hi>Philopoemen</hi> ſeem'd to ſlight, and make it a matter of ſmall conſequence: And obſerving the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies overſight, who left his main body undefended behind, and the ground clear, would not make head againſt him, but let him purſue the chace freely, till he had run himſelf a great diſtance from his main body.
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:35952:291"/>
Then ſeeing the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> before him deſerted by their Horſe, with their flanks quite bare, he charged ſuddenly, and ſurprized them without a Commander, and not ſo much as expecting an Encounter: For when they ſaw <hi>Machanidas</hi> driving the beaten enemy before him, they thought the Victory already gain'd. He overthrew them with great ſlaughter, for they report above 4000 kill'd in the place, and then fac'd about againſt <hi>Machanidas,</hi> who was returning with his Mercenaries from the purſuit. There hapned to be a broad deep ditch between them, where both ſtrove a while, one to get over and fly, the other to hinder him. It bore a reſemblance of wild beaſts, forc'd to fight for their Lives, when preſt by ſo eager a Huntſman as <hi>Philopaemen,</hi> rather than of Generals in a field. The Tyrant's Horſe was mettled and ſtrong; and feeling the bloudy Spurs in his ſides, ventur'd to take the ditch. He had already planted his hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-feet on the bank, and rais'd his fore-feet to leap, when <hi>Simmias</hi> and <hi>Polyaenus,</hi> who us'd to fight by the ſide of <hi>Philopoemen,</hi> came up on Horſe-back to his aſſiſtance. But <hi>Philopoemen,</hi> preventing both, ſtood <hi>Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nidas</hi> himſelf; and perceiving that the Horſe with his head high rear'd, cover'd his Maſter's body; he turned his own a little, and ſtriking at the Tyrant with all his force, tumbled him dead into the ditch.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="565" facs="tcp:35952:291"/>
The <hi>Achaeans</hi> wonderfully taken with his Valour in this ſingle Combat, and conduct the whole day, ſet up his Statue in Braſs at <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos,</hi> in the poſture in which he kill'd the Tyrant. The reports goes, that at the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maean-</hi>games, a little after the Victory, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopoemen</hi> being then General the ſecond time, and at leiſure by reaſon of the ſolemnity, firſt ſhew'd the <hi>Grecians</hi> his Army, drawn up as if they were to fight, with all the motions occurring in a battel perform'd with wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful order, ſtrength and nimbleneſs. After which he went into the Theatre, while the Muſicians were ſinging for the prize, waited on by Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen in their Leaguer-cloaks, and Scarlet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arming Coats, all handſom men and in the flower of their age, and all carrying a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to their General; yet breathing out a noble confidence in themſelves, rais'd by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in many glorious Encounters.

Now it was with the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> as with young Horſes, which go quietly with their uſual riders, but boggle and grow unruly under ſtrangers. The Souldiers, when any hot ſervice was towards, and <hi>Philopoemen</hi> not at their head, grew dejected, and look't about for him; but if he once appear'd, came preſently to themſelves, and recover'd their confidence and courage. Of which their very Enemies being ſenſible, they could not endure to look him in the face; but as appear'd in ſeveral occaſions, were frighted with his very name.</p>

               <p>All hitherto makes for the praiſe and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Philopoemen.</hi> But when at the requeſt of the <hi>Gortynians</hi> he return'd again into <hi>Crete</hi> to Command for them, at a time when his own Countrey was diſtreſt by <hi>Nabis,</hi> he was taxed either of cowardiſe, or unſeaſonable ambition of honour amongſt Foreigners. For the <hi>Megalopolitans</hi> were then ſo preſs'd, that the Enemy being maſter of the Field, and encamping almoſt at their Gates, they were forc'd to keep themſelves within their Walls, and ſow their very Streets. And he flying from a War at home, and commanding in chief in a foreign Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, furniſh'd his ill-willers with matter enough for their reproaches. Some ſaid he took the offer of the <hi>Gortynians,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Achaeans</hi> choſe other Generals,
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:35952:293"/>
and left him but a private man. For he could not endure to ſit ſtill, but looking upon War, and commanding in it as his great buſineſs, always coveted to be employ'd. And this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with what he once ſaid ſmartly of K. <hi>Ptolomy.</hi> Some-body was praiſing him for keeping his Army and himſelf in perpetual exerciſe: And what praiſe, reply'd <hi>Philopoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> for a King of his years, to be always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring, and never performing? However, the <hi>Megalopolitans</hi> thinking themſelves betray'd, took it ſo ill, that they were about to baniſh him. But the <hi>Achaeans</hi> daſh't that deſign, by ſending their Praetor <hi>Ariſtanetus</hi> to <hi>Megalopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> who though he were at difference with <hi>Philopoemen</hi> about affairs of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, yet would not ſuffer him to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd. <hi>Philopoemen</hi> being upon this account out of favour with his Citizens, cajoll'd di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the little neighbouring places from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying them, putting in their heads to ſay, that from the beginning they were not ſubject to their Taxes, or Laws, or any way under their Command. In theſe pretences he openly took their part, and at the ſame time fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſeditions in the City againſt the <hi>Achaeans.</hi> But theſe things hapned a while after.</p>
               <p>While he ſtay'd in <hi>Crete,</hi> in the ſervice of the <hi>Gortynians,</hi> he made War not like a <hi>Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponneſian</hi> or <hi>Arcadian</hi> fairly in the open Field, but fought with them at their ovvn vveapon,
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:35952:293"/>
and turning their ſtrategems and tricks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt themſelves, ſhew'd them to play Craft againſt Skill, and were but Children to an experienc'd Souldier. Having manag'd it then with great bravery, and great reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to himſelf, he return'd into <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> where he found <hi>Philip</hi> beaten by <hi>T. Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> and <hi>Nabis</hi> at War both with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> and <hi>Achaeans.</hi> He was preſently choſen General againſt <hi>Nabis,</hi> but venturing to fight by Sea, ſeem'd to have ſplit upon the ſame Rock with <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> and by a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs very different from the general expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and his own fame, loſt much of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer reputation. But for <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> ſome report he was backward by deſign, to diſguſt his Country-men with the Sea, leſt of good Souldiers, they ſhould by little and little turn as <hi>Plato</hi> ſays, ill Mariners. And therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd from <hi>Aſia</hi> and the Iſlands without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing on purpoſe. Whereas <hi>Philopoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> thinking his skill in Land-ſervice would prevail likewiſe at Sea, learnt how great a part of valour experience is, and how much it imports in the management of things to be accuſtom'd to them. For he was not only put to the worſt in the fight for want of skill, but having rigged up an old Ship, which had been a famous Veſſel forty years before, and ſhip'd his Citizens in her; ſhe foundring, he had like to have loſt them all. But then finding
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:35952:294"/>
the Enemy, as if he had been driven out of the Sea, had, in contempt of him, beſieged <hi>Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theon,</hi> he preſently ſet ſail again, and taking them unexpectedly, diſperſs'd, and careleſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Victory, Landed in the night, burnt their Camp, &amp; kill'd of them a great number.</p>
               <p>A few days after, as he was marching through rough ways, <hi>Nabis</hi> came ſuddenly upon him. The <hi>Achaeans</hi> were diſmay'd, and in ſo ſtrait a place, and which was ſeiz'd by the Enemy, deſpair'd to get off with ſafety. <hi>Philopoemen</hi> made a little halt, and when he had view'd the ground, made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the greateſt thing in War is skill in drawing up an Army. For by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing onely a few paces, and without any confuſion or trouble altering his order accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the nature of the place, he preſently took away all apprehenſion from his men, and then charging, put the enemy to flight. But when he ſaw they fled not towards the City, but diſperſed every man a ſeveral way all over the Field, which for Wood and Hills, Brooks and Ditches was not paſſable by Horſe, he ſounded a retreat, and encamped by broad day-light. Then foreſeeing the enemy would endeavour to ſteal ſcatteringly into the City in the dark, he poſted ſtrong par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the <hi>Achaeans</hi> all along the Banks and Hillocks near the Walls. Many of <hi>Nabis</hi>'s men fell into their hands. For returning
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:35952:294"/>
not in a body, but as the chance of flight had diſpos'd of every one, they were caught like birds e'er they could enter into the Town.</p>
               <p>For theſe things he was wonderfully lov'd, and was alſo honour'd in all the Theatres of <hi>Greece,</hi> but got the ſecret ill-will of <hi>Titus Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius,</hi> a man covetouſly ambitious of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. For he thought it but reaſonable a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be otherwiſe eſteem'd by the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> than a Gentleman of <hi>Arcadia;</hi> eſpecially ſeeing there was no compariſon between what he, and what <hi>Philopoemen</hi> had done for them. For he by one Proclamation had reſtor'd all <hi>Greece,</hi> as much as had been under <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> to liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. After this <hi>Titus</hi> made peace with <hi>Nabis,</hi> and <hi>Nabis</hi> was circumvented and ſlain by the <hi>Aetolians.</hi> Things being then in confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion at <hi>Sparta, Philopoemen</hi> lay'd hold on that occaſion, and coming upon them with his Army, prevail'd with ſome by perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, with others by fear, till he brought the whole City over to the <hi>Achaeans.</hi> As it was no ſmall matter for <hi>Sparta</hi> to become a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Achaia,</hi> this action gain'd him infinite praiſe from the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> for ſtrengthning the Union by the addition of ſo great and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful a City, and not a little good-will from the Nobility of <hi>Sparta</hi> it ſelf, who hoped they had now procured a General who would defend their freedom.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="572" facs="tcp:35952:295"/>
Wherefore having made 120 Silver Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Above</hi> 2000 <hi>pound.</hi>
                  </note> by ſale of the Houſe and Goods of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis,</hi> they decreed him the money, and ſent ſome in the name of the City to preſent it. But here the honeſty of <hi>Philopoemen</hi> appear'd as it was, a real uncounterfeited vertue. There was not a man among them durſt mention the matter to him, but every one excuſing himſelf, and ſhifting it off to his fellow, they laid it at laſt on <hi>Timolaus,</hi> with whom he had lodg'd at <hi>Sparta. Timolaus</hi> came to <hi>Megalopolis,</hi> and was entertain'd by <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poemen,</hi> but ſtruck into admiration with his grave manner of diſcourſe, his thrifty and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right way of living, judg'd him not a man to be tempted, and, ſo pretending other buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, return'd without a word mention'd of the Preſent. He was ſent again, and did juſt as formerly. But the third time with much ado, and faltring in his words, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted <hi>Philopoemen</hi> with the good will of the City of <hi>Sparta</hi> to him. <hi>Philopoemen</hi> hark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to him obligingly and gladly, and then went himſelf to <hi>Sparta,</hi> where he advis'd them not to bribe <hi>good men</hi> and their friends, of whoſe vertue they might be ſure without charge to themſelves; but buy off and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence ill Citizens, who were perpetually diſquieting the City with their ſeditious Spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the Senate, or to the People. For it was better to bar liberty of ſpeech in Enemies,
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:35952:295"/>
than Friends. Thus it appeared how much <hi>Philopoemen</hi> was above bribery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diophanes</hi> being afterwards General of the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> and hearing the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> were bent on new commotions, reſolv'd to chaſtiſe them. They on the other ſide being ſet upon War, embroil'd all <hi>Peloponneſus. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopoemen</hi> did what he could to ſweeten <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes,</hi> and make him ſenſible that as the times went, while <hi>Antiochus</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> were diſputing their vaſt Pretenſions with vaſt Armies in the heart of <hi>Greece,</hi> it concern'd a man in his employment to keep a watchful eye over them, and diſſembling and putting up many injuries to preſerve all quiet at home. <hi>Diophanes</hi> would not be rul'd, but joyn'd with <hi>Titus,</hi> and both together falling into <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conia,</hi> march'd directly to <hi>Sparta. Philopoemen</hi> was ſo netled, that he did an action, in it ſelf not juſtifiable, but which proceeded from a great ſpirit, and involv'd in it a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. For getting into the Town him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he, a private man as he was, kept out both the Conſul of <hi>Rome</hi> and General of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaia,</hi> quieted the diſorders in the City, and re-united it once again to the <hi>Achaians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet afterwards, when he was Praetor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, upon ſome new miſdemeanour of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaemonians,</hi> he brought back thoſe who had been baniſh'd, put, as <hi>Polybius writes</hi> 80, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Ariſtocrates</hi> 350 <hi>Citizens</hi> to death, raz'd
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:35952:296"/>
the Walls, took away a good part of their Territory, and laid it to the <hi>Megalopolitans,</hi> forc'd out of the Country, and carried into <hi>Achaia</hi> all who had been made free of <hi>Sparta</hi> by Tyrants, except 3000 who would not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to Baniſhment. Thoſe he ſold for Slaves, and with the money, as if to inſult over them, built a Porch at <hi>Megalopolis.</hi> Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Unworthily trampling upon the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians</hi> in their calamities, and even glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his hatred with a moſt cruel and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane action; he aboliſh'd the Laws of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus,</hi> and forc'd them to educate their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and live after the manner of the <hi>Achae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> For while they kept to the Diſcipline of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> there was no pulling down their haughty ſpirits but now their calamities had given <hi>Philopoemen</hi> opportunity to cut the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news of their Commonwealth aſunder, they were brought low, and grew tame and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Yet this laſted not long; for applying themſelves to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and getting their conſent, they ſoon threw off their new <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaian</hi> faſhions; and as much as in ſo miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and deprav'd a condition they could, re-eſtabliſh their old diſcipline.</p>
               <p>When the War betwixt <hi>Antiochus</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> broke out in <hi>Greece, Philopoemen</hi> was a private man. At which he repin'd grievouſly, when he ſaw <hi>Antiochus</hi> lay idle at <hi>Calcis,</hi> ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his time in unſeaſonable Courtſhip and
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:35952:296"/>
Weddings, and his Men diſperc'd in ſeveral Towns without Order or Commanders, and minding nothing but their pleaſures. He us'd to tell the <hi>Romans</hi> that he envy'd their Victory; and that if he had had the fortune to be then in Command, he wou'd have ſurpriz'd the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, &amp; cut all their throats at their debauches.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Autigonus</hi> was overcome, the <hi>Romans</hi> preſs'd harder upon <hi>Greece,</hi> and ſurrounded the <hi>Achaeans</hi> with their power; The leading men in the ſeveral Cities grew out of heart; the the great ſtrength of the whole body inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly vaniſh'd, and the rowling of fortune be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſettle on the <hi>Roman</hi> baſis. <hi>Philopoemen</hi> in this conjuncture carry'd himſelf like a good Pilot in a high Sea, ſometimes ſhifting ſail, and ſometimes yielding, but ſtill ſteering ſteady; and omitting no opportunity nor earneſtneſs to keep all who were conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, whether for eloquence or riches, faſt to the defence of their Common liberty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariſtaenetus,</hi> a <hi>Megalopolitan</hi> of great credit among the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> but always a favourer of the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſaid one day in the Senate, that the <hi>Romans</hi> were not to be diſpleas'd, or refus'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing. <hi>Philopoemen</hi> heard him with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient ſilence: But at laſt, not able to hold longer, ſaid angerly to him, And why in ſuch haſte, wretched Man, to behold the <hi>Grecian</hi> ruine? <hi>Manlius,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul, after the defeat of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> moved
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:35952:297"/>
the <hi>Achaeans</hi> to reſtore the baniſh'd <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi> to their Countrey, which motion was ſeconded and ſupported by all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of <hi>Titus.</hi> But <hi>Philopoemen</hi> croſs'd it, not for any ill will to the men, but becauſe they ſhould be beholding to him and the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeans,</hi> not to <hi>Titus</hi> and the <hi>Romans.</hi> For when he came to be Praetor himſelf, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd them. So impatient was his great Spirit of doing things by command, and ſo prone his nature to ſhock and contend with men in power.</p>
               <p>Being now Threeſcore and ten, and the eighth time General, he was in hope to paſs in quiet not onely the year of his Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but his remaining life. For as diſeaſes are weaker in weaker bodies, the quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling humour of the <hi>Grecians</hi> abated much with their power. But envious Fortune threw him down in the cloſe of his life, like one who with unmatchable ſpeed runs over all the race, and ſtumbles at the Goal. 'Tis reported, that being in company where one was prais'd for a great Commander, he reply'd, There was no great account to be made of a man, who had ſuffer'd himſelf to be taken alive by his Enemies.</p>
               <p>A few days after, news came that <hi>Dino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> a <hi>Meſſenian,</hi> a particular Enemy to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopoemen,</hi> and for his wickedneſs and vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies generally hated, had brought <hi>Meſſene</hi> to revolt from the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> and was about
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:35952:297"/>
to ſeize upon a little place call'd <hi>Colonis. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopoemen</hi> lay then ſick of a Fever at <hi>Argos.</hi> Upon the news he haſted away, and reach'd <hi>Megalopolis,</hi> which was diſtant above 400 fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs <note place="margin">Fifty Miles.</note> in a day. From thence he preſently drew out the Horſe, the chiefeſt of the City, and who in the vigour of their age and mettle were forward in the matter, both for their extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary love to <hi>Philopoemen</hi> and compaſſion of the caſe. As they marched towards <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſene,</hi> they met with <hi>Dinocrates</hi> about <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>'s Tomb, charged and routed him. But five hundred freſh men, vvho being left for a guard to the Countrey came late in, hapning to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, the flying Enemy rally'd again about the hills. <hi>Philopoemen</hi> fearing to be inclos'd, and ſolicitous for his men, retreated over ground extremely diſadvantageous, bringing up the rere himſelf. As he often fac'd, and ran upon the Enemy, he drevv them all upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; yet they caracoll'd aloof, and ſhouted about him, no body daring to approach him. With care to ſave every ſingle man, he left his main body ſo often, that at laſt he vvas left himſelf alone among the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of his Enemies. Yet even then none durſt come up to him, but being pelted at a diſtance, and driven to ſtony ſteep places, he vvas fain vvith much ſpurring to vvind up and dovvn as he vvas able: His age vvas no hinderance to him, for vvith
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:35952:298"/>
perpetual exerciſe it was both ſtrong and active. But being weakned with ſickneſs, and tired with his long journey, his Horſe ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, threw him encumber'd with his arms, and faint upon a hard and rugged piece of ground. His head being grievouſly bruis'd with the fall, he lay a while ſpeechleſs, ſo that the Enemy thinking him dead, began to turn and ſtrip him. But when they ſaw him lift up his head, and open his eyes, they threw themſelves in crouds upon him, bound his hands behind him, and carry'd him off with all the provoking ſcorn and opprobrious lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of inſulting inſolence; him (I ſay) who had never ſo much as dreamt of being led in triumph by <hi>Dinocrates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Meſſenians</hi> wonderfully pufft up with the news, throng'd in ſwarms to the City gates. But when they ſaw <hi>Philopoemen</hi> in a poſture ſo unſutible to the glory of his great Actions and famous Victories, moſt of them ſtruck with grief, and curſing the deceitful vanity of humane fortune, fell a weeping with compaſſion. Their tears by little and little turn'd to kind words, and 'twas almoſt in every bodies mouth that they ought to remember what he had done for them and the Common liberty, which by driving away <hi>Nabis,</hi> he had perſerv'd. Some few, to make their court to <hi>Dinocrates,</hi>
                  <pb n="579" facs="tcp:35952:298"/>
were for tormenting, and putting him to death as a dangerous and irreconcilable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and who, if he once got looſe, <hi>Dinocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> was loſt, who had taken him priſoner, and us'd him baſely. They put him at laſt into a Dungeon under-ground, which they call'd the Treaſury, a place into which there comes no air nor light from abroad; and which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no doors, is clos'd with a great ſtone; which rowling to the entrance, they fix'd; and placing a guard about it, left him. In the mean time <hi>Philopoemen</hi>'s Souldiers recovering themſelves after their flight, and fearing he was dead when he appear'd no-where, made a ſtand, calling him with loud cries, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching one another with their unworthy and ſhameful eſcape; and, betraying their General, who to preſerve their lives, had loſt his own. Then they fell to ſearching curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly every-where, till hearing at laſt he was taken, they ſent away Meſſengers round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with the news. The <hi>Achaeans</hi> reſented the misfortune deeply, and decreed to ſend and demand him, and in the mean time drew their Army together for his reſcue.</p>
               <p>While theſe things paſt in <hi>Achaia, Dino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> fearing all delay would ſave <hi>Philopoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> and reſolv'd to be before-hand with the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> as ſoon as dark night had diſpers'd the multitude, ſent in the Executioner with poiſon, and order not to ſtir from him till
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:35952:299"/>
he had taken it. <hi>Philopoemen</hi> was then laid down, wrapt up in his Cloak, not ſleeping, but oppreſt with grief and trouble. But ſeeing light, and a man with poiſon by him, ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to ſit up; and taking the Cup, ask't the Hangman if he heard any thing of the Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, particularly <hi>Lycortas?</hi> The fellow an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvvering, that the moſt part had got off ſafe, he nodded, and looking chearfully upon him, 'Tis well, ſays he, that we are not every way unfortunate. And without a word more drank it off, and laid him down again. His weakneſs ſtrugling but little with the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it diſpatch'd him preſently.</p>
               <p>The news of his death fill'd all <hi>Achaia</hi> with grief and lamentation. The Youth, with ſome of the chief of the ſeveral Cities met at <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galopolis</hi> with a reſolution to take revenge without delay. They choſe <hi>Lycortas</hi> General, and falling upon the <hi>Meſſenians,</hi> put all to fire and ſword, till the City by common conſent yielded. <hi>Dinocrates</hi> with as many as had voted for his death; prevented their revenge, and kill'd themſelves. Thoſe who would have had him tormented, <hi>Lycortas</hi> put in Chains. They burnt his Body, and put the aſhes into an Urn, and then march'd home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, not in a diſorder'd hurry, but with a kind of ſolemn pomp, half Triumph, half Funeral, Crowns of Victory on their heads, and tears in their eyes, their Captive Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:35952:299"/>
in Fetters by them. <hi>Polybius,</hi> the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral's Son, carried the Urn, whereof there was hardly any thing to be ſeen but Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands and Ribons. The chief of the <hi>Achaeans</hi> went round about it.
