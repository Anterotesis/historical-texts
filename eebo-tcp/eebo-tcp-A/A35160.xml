         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

THE

Spiritual and Temporal,

COMMONS
In Parliament Aſſembled.</head>
            <p>THE Happineſs and Well-being of Man
does no ways conſiſt in being poſſeſs'd
of much Wealth, but in a Mediocrity;
and in the Enjoyment of the Purity of the Goſpel,
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:46632:3"/>
and of good and wholeſome Laws: And of all
Governments now extant in the World, the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Monarchy is the Nobleſt, and comes neareſt
to that Native Liberty which Man firſt enjoy'd;
and God and Nature have laid an indiſpenſable
Duty upon every Man to endeavour the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the Municipal Laws of his Country. But
notwithſtanding, Humane Frailty is ſuch, that we
have many Inſtances of Perſons (otherways pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and wiſe) either through Pride, Ambition,
or Covetouſneſs, that have had almoſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
this Noble Fabrick: but it was never in
ſuch eminent Peril as before the late Revolution;
when our Religion, Laws and Liberty, were near
being ſwallow'd up; and then God was pleas'd to
make his Majeſty the happy Inſtrument of our
Deliverance. But notwithſtanding, the Danger's
not over-paſt; for we have ever ſince been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
in a great and dangerous War, upon the
Succeſs whereof (under God) depends our future
Happineſs: therefore Men would think that all
Perſons in Publick Truſt, ſhould with great Zeal
and Affection purſue ſuch Ways and Methods as
tend to the putting a Period to the ſame, and no
ways obſtruct their Majeſties and the Publick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt;
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:46632:3"/>
but ſcorn and ſlight all thoſe little mean
Thoughts of enriching themſelves, at a time the
Safety and Honour of their Native Country lies
at ſtake. But through Covetouſneſs the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings
of Men are darkned, and ſo ſee not the
Evils they draw upon themſelves and others: And
thoſe who are in the higheſt Orb, many times diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
not (having ſublimer Thoughts) thoſe things
others do, who act in a lower Sphear. And as all
Governments are incident and liable to Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
ſo it cannot ſeem ſtrange if they have crept
in among us: But ours will be found to be (like
ſome Diſtempers) hard to be remov'd; for there
are ſo many link'd together by Intereſt, that they
will not fail to ſupport each other, and cruſh (if
not ruin) him that oppoſes them. So it's not for
any ſingle Perſon whatever, to engage with them;
and therefore for that Reaſon, I have here collected
ſuch of them as have come to my Knowledg:
Which, with all Humility, I lay before this moſt
Auguſt Aſſembly; whoſe peculiar Care has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
been to root out Corruptions, when they
have appear'd formidable and inconſiſtent with
the Safety of the Government: and that not the
Greatneſs or Power of any that have abus'd their
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:46632:4"/>
Prince's Favour, have been able to protect them
from the juſt Reſentments of the Nation. And
'tis that which hath continued this Government
ſo long upon its Baſis.</p>
            <p>There hath been a Notion induſtriouſly ſpread
abroad by ſome through the Kingdom, (and
which the Nation hath too long imbib'd) which
is, That to make Attempts upon the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
Coaſt of <hi>France</hi> were altogether impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
Which ſeemeth ſtrange, it being directly
contrary to the received Opinion of the reſt of
Mankind, and the Practice of all Ages; for the
Romans, Carthaginians, and many other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that have been ſtrong at Sea, and even the
Venetians at this day, have ſhip'd potent Armies
both Horſe and Foot, and made Deſcents upon
their Enemies; which have been attended with
good Succeſs. And although the Circumſtance
of Affairs may alter and change, yet the Nature
of things never will: But if Men ſhall land in the
midſt of Smoak and Fire, and where their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
lie intrench'd, it's no Wonder if they are
beaten off; even at that rate may the beſt-laid
Deſigns be fruſtrated.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:46632:4"/>
And <hi>France</hi> hath ſo ſtrong a Barrier on every
Side, that notwithſtanding the utmoſt Endeavours
of the Allies for ſeveral Years paſt, yet we ſee
they have not been able to break into it; and
therefore with all due Submiſſion, I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
(Humanely ſpeaking) it's impoſſible of
making any Impreſſion on the Enemy, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
than by making a Deſcent upon their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime
Coaſt with a Royal Army. Certainly there's
nothing can embarraſs them like it: the Vicinity
of their Country makes it ſo much the more
practicable; and <hi>England</hi> has been the Ballance of
<hi>Europe,</hi> and may yet, if not wanting to it ſelf.
My Deſign is not to embroil, but further their
Majeſties Affairs, and that all things may work
together for the Publick Good; which hath been
the only Scope and End of this my Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.
So doubt not but I ſhall meet with a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
Conſtruction: and if a Publick and
National Intereſt be preferable before all others,
then I cannot be much out in what I have done;
only muſt acknowledg to have handled the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
but weakly: Yet the Sincerity of my Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
will plead for me, and excuſe the many
Defects therein; and ſo hope I ſhall not only
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:46632:5"/>
find Protection, but a Reward of my Labours,
and Danger I undergo, for the Honour and Safety
of my Country.</p>

            <head>Truth brought to Light, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IT's recorded in Holy Writ, that the Children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
ſerv'd the Lord all the Days of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and of
thoſe Elders that ſurviv'd him, having a thankful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of his Mercy and Goodneſs, in giving
them Victory, and delivering them from the Hands of
their Enemies. And we the People of this Kingdom have
received as eminent and great Mercies from the Hand of
God as ever did the Jews, and ſuch as are hardly to be
parallel'd in any Age; for we were brought to the very
brink of Ruine, and even ready to be devour'd by our
Enemies, and had no Proſpect or Hope of Deliverance.
Then did God raiſe up a Prince (unthought or unforeſeen
by us) to reſcue and deliver us; and gave our Enemies a
Spirit of Fear and Trembling, and they fled when no
Man purſu'd. Theſe things have we ſeen with our Eyes,
and to the Aſtoniſhment of the World, were deliver'd
without Blood-ſhed. But we are an unthankful Nation
and People, and ſo it's no wonder that the Hand of God
hath lain heavy upon us, in afflicting us with a long and
tedious War: Therefore let us repent then, and not till
then may we expect a Bleſſing and a perfect Deliverance;
for whatever ſome Perſons may think, there yet hangs a
dark Cloud over our Heads: Do we not ſee plotting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Government, (and that by no mean Perſons)?
and how far that Poiſon's ſpread, we know not, being
back'd by a Potent and Great Monarch: And not only
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46632:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſo, but it will appear that ſome of our Brethren, who
probably in ſome Caſes may have been ſerviceable to their
Majeſties, do (making the moſt modeſt Conſtruction of
their Actions) ſacrifice the Publick Intereſt to their own
Private Lucre. This, by the Bleſſing of God, I doubt
not but evidently to make appear: And I am no ways un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible
of the Danger I undergo by this my Undertaking;
and that I run a greater Hazard than he that engages in
Battel: but I know not why I ſhould be afraid, having
Truth and Juſtice on my Side: And in former Ages (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
this may be degenerated) it was ever accounted an
Honour for a Man to venture his Life for the Publick
Good.</p>
            <p>At the firſt opening of the laſt Seſſion of Parliament, I
publiſhed a Book entituled, <hi>England</hi>'s <hi>Glory Reviv'd;</hi>
which I dedicated to their Majeſties, and both Houſes of
Parliament; but it was never preſented to the Parliament,
occaſion'd (I being ill) by the Timorouſneſs of the Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller,
who was oblig'd ſo to have done. There are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
things therein propoſed, which are now put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
as ſhall be made appear in the enſuing Diſcourſe:
And that the not rewarding Perſons that do things which
contribute to the Publick Service, is a real Injury to the
Kingdom; but at preſent I ſhall wave that, and fall upon
other Matters.</p>
            <p>I had obſerv'd, that the Collecting the Land Taxes, was
a great Charge to the Crown; the greateſt part of which
I conceiv'd might be ſav'd, and the Receiver-Generals
wholly laid aſide; ſo all that Poundage they were allow'd,
might accrue to the Government. Upon which having
made a Propoſal, preſented it to the Right Honourable
the Lords of the Treaſury, in the Month of <hi>December</hi>
laſt: And at the ſame time I deliver'd it, did acquaint
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46632:6"/>
their Lordſhips by Letter, that I did then wait their
Commands, and deſired to be heard: But they took no
notice thereof, which I attributed to their multiplicity of
Buſineſs; ſo conceiv'd my ſelf obliged to give farther Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
which I did, and humbly deſir'd I might be heard
upon thoſe Propoſals: This I did for many Days, and preſt
(as much as in Modeſty was fit to do) that I might be
heard, but all to no purpoſe; for I found it was not grateful
to them, and that they were no ways inclin'd to hear me:
Then conceiv'd I had no other way, but to petition his
Majeſty in Council; which I accordingly did, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
it to Mr. <hi>Bridgman</hi> in Secretary <hi>Trenchard</hi>'s Office,
(with the Propoſal annexed) that ſo my Propoſal might
be read, and referred to the Lords of the Treaſury, which
was the Prayer of my Petition: and when Council-Day
came, I was with him again, and he told me it was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to the Council-Office, where I found it; and the
Gentleman to whom I apply'd my ſelf, promis'd me it
ſhould be carried to the Council-Chamber. And when
the Council was actually ſitting, I went to him; and he
inform'd me, my Petition and Propoſal were before the
Council. And being afterwards to examine, whether I
had a Reference granted, found my Petition had not been
read: Upon which I asked the foreſaid Perſon, what was
the meaning that a Matter of ſo great Moment to the
King, ſhould be ſo little taken notice of? His Anſwer
was, he knew not, and ſaid, he had faithfully carried it
to the Council, (it being all was requir'd of him) and
that he ſhould not fail to do the ſame next Council-Day.
After this manner was I ſerv'd ſeveral Council-Days, and
never could obtain my Petition to be read, and found all I
did was but Labour in vain; and conceiv'd I had juſt
reaſon to believe, that ſome Perſons endeavour'd to ſtifle
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46632:7"/>
it. Upon which I addreſt my ſelf to the Earl of—,a
Privy-Counſellor, to whom I preſented a Copy of my
Propoſal, and ſometime after was to wait on him; and
his Lordſhip's Anſwer was, The thing he lik'd well, there
could nothing be objected againſt it, but ſaid, he durſt
not meddle in it, it would create him ſo many Enemies:
But notwithſtanding all this, I was reſolv'd further to
proſecute the Matter; and being acquainted with the
Duke of—his Chaplain, by his means preſented
his Grace with a Copy of it: Whoſe Anſwer to it was,
that were he a Privy-Counſellor, he would proſecute the
Matter, but as he was not, he durſt not meddle with it,
it would create him ſo many Enemies.</p>
            <p>From all which I may conclude and ſay, it's too
evident, that there is a Corrupt Party at Court (which
yet ſhall be more fully made out) that carry on a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Intereſt from that of their Majeſties and the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;
and are grown to that height, that Perſons of great
Honour, and known Loyalty, dare not encounter, as
knowing they will not leave them till they have thrown
them out of all Employments, and ſo for the future
incapacitate them to ſerve their Majeſties. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I may be cenſur'd by ſome for what I do, yet I
have the Satisfaction in my own Breaſt, that I have done
nothing but what my Duty obliges me to; and doubt not
but I ſhall have the Concurrence of all true Engliſhmen.
The Propoſal is as follows.</p>

to have all unneceſſary Officers laid aſide; and none are ſo
uſeleſs as the Receiver-Generals, there being no manner of
occaſion for them: for the Collector of the Exciſe in each
County is every way capable of acting the ſame thing,
and with greater Eaſe to the County; and more Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it would be to the Subject to ſee the Money imploy'd
to Publick Uſes, to which it was primarily intended: And
I ſhall be as brief in the Matter as poſſibly I can, and ſo
ſhall bring but one Inſtance, which I humbly conceive
will fully demonſtrate what I aſſert; <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Receiver-General for the County of <hi>Hertford</hi> goes
to four Places (as <hi>Hertford,</hi> &amp;c.) and no more; and by
his Circular-Letters to the High-Conſtables of the ſeveral
Hundreds, the Collectors of the Tax meet him at the Day
prefix'd, and pay in the Money: which creates much
Trouble to ſome of them, who bring it a great Way (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be a ſmall County) which they need not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go;
which I ſhall evidently make appear: for the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector
of the Exciſe for the ſaid County is oblig'd to go to
all Market-towns through the whole Shire, and there are
eighteen in the County: and it may with much Facility
and Eaſe be ſo order'd, that at the ſame time he may receive
the Quarterly-payment for the Land-tax, according to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46632:8"/>
the Diſtricts of the ſaid Towns, as they are now ſettled in
the Exciſe: But if it be found that Method will not do,
they can then but take the ſame Meaſures the Receiver-Generals
now do, which they will be both willing and
able to perform. There can no Objection be made againſt
this being put into practice, other than that it's a great
Truſt; and the Collectors have not given ſufficient Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
for the ſame: but it's probable they are capable of ſo
doing; if not, there's never a Receiver-General but what
will willingly embrace the Opportunity of having the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy,
and give good Security, if his Majeſty ſhall be
pleas'd to augment the Salary fifty Pounds a Year during
the War; and when all's done, it will be found his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
will be a Saver above Forty thouſand Pounds <hi>per
Annum.</hi> The Receiver-General for the County of <hi>Hert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
received in the Year 1692, Sixty odd Pounds for Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling,
and other contingent Charges: which Money I
humbly conceive would fully ſatisfy the Collector of the
Exciſe, were it given him, over and above the travelling
Charge he's uſually allow'd.</p>
            <p>I have calculated what the Poundage doth amount to
that the Receiver-Generals are allow'd; (which any Man
may eaſily do, ſuppoſing the Land-tax and Poll-bill to be
Three Millions of Money, as I cannot conjecture it to be
leſs) and it will be found to be Thirty ſeven thouſand five
hundred Pounds. And I did deſign to have offer'd ſome
thing more, which was this: It has always been the
Cuſtom to allow the Collectors of the Tax three Pence in
the Pound for Collecting; and with Submiſſion, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
if they were allow'd but two Pence in the Pound,
it would be a full Compenſation for the Trouble they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo.
It's no Argument to ſay, three Pence has always
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46632:8"/>
been allow'd: the Kingdom's in danger; and the Money
was given to publick Uſes; and as they receive no Detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by what they do, it's but reaſonable they ſhould put
forth their Helping-hand, and I think no good Engliſh-Man
would grumble at it. And by the ſame Rule, this
Penny a Pound will be found to amount to Twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
five hundred Pounds. So that if the Lords of the
Treaſury had been pleas'd to have given me a Hearing,
their Majeſties had ſav'd Fifty thouſand Pounds this Year.</p>
            <p>For the Money that the Receiver-Generals are allow'd
for Travelling and other contingent Charges, would fully
ſatisfy the Collectors of the Exciſe, as may be ſeen by the
Accompts in the Exchequer. But ſuppoſing it had not
been in their Lordſhips Power to have made the Collectors
of the Exciſe Receiver-Generals; yet with Submiſſion,
it was their Duty to have propos'd it to the Parliament,
(who would readily have received it) that an Act might
have paſt.</p>
            <p>And one thing I obſerve to be of moſt dangerous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
to the Government, (conſidering the Nature of
the Quarrel we are engaged in); that is, the Selling of
Imployments. It's too well known it has always been
practiſed; ſo it can be no Scandal to relate it: but there
are many Evils attend it; we have no <hi>Shibboleth</hi> whereby
to diſtinguiſh Men, whether Friends or Foes: and there
being now a Competitor for the Crown, and a dangerous
Faction among us, no queſtion but it's an Inlet to our
Adverſaries to all ſorts of Imployments; and by this
Means I conceive it may not be difficult for them to get
into the Admiralty, or Navy-Office, Cuſtom-Houſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and ſo may be capable of doing much Miſchief, as thus:
Suppoſe we look back to the Time the Turky-Fleet went
out, when we received that Loſs by the French in the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46632:9"/>
               <hi>Straits:</hi> and when the Lords of the Admiralty iſſue out Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
for the Fleet to ſail ſuch a time, it's not difficult for
any corrupt Perſon planted in that Office, to get a Sight
of it, (or it's not improbable but it may paſs through his
Hands): upon which he gives his Correſpondents at <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,
Falmouth,</hi> &amp;c. notice of it; and any of them may
eaſily corrupt a poor Fiſher-man, who ſails any where
without ſuſpition: So our Enemies from time to time
ſoon have Intelligence of all our Proceedings; and no
doubt we owe our Loſſes at that time to ſuch like Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as theſe. And therefore with Submiſſion, I conceive
there ought to be great Inſpection made into all that are
in Publick Imploys, and to throw out ſuch as are found
to be diſaffected: but then they ought to be Perſons of
great Integrity that are entruſted in ſuch an Affair, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
it may be made uſe of only as an Artifice to get Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
and many an honeſt Man turn'd out that hath it not,
or is not willing to part with it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed to give ſome Relation of a Matter
which has been offer'd to the Government by one Mr.
<hi>George Everett,</hi> (which he publiſhed the laſt Seſſion of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament);
wherein he propoſes to ſave their Majeſties an
Hundred thouſand Pounds a Year, in the Building and
Repairing the Royal-Navy: and it hath been before the
Right Honourable the Lords of the Admiralty (who are
the proper Judges of it) a Year and a half; yet all this
while they cannot (or will not) apprehend it, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing effectually done in it; nay, the Author has
been brow-beaten by thoſe whoſe Duty it was to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
him. It's certainly a moſt ingenuous Thing,
and not to be confuted; and were it put in practice, would
fully anſwer what he hath propos'd. What is writ, is not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46632:9"/>
to caſt Aſperſions on the Lords of the Admiralty, but
that the Nation may have Juſtice done: For there's no
Man that reads that Book, (unleſs biaſs'd by Prejudice or
Intereſt) but what will be of the Opinion, that the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of that Matter hath been greatly to the Detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their Majeſties and the Kingdom. It has been
long ſince highly approv'd on by many Perſons of Honour
and Quality: the Names of ſome of which take as follows;</p>
            <p>

a Work) have been pleas'd to ſubſcribe their Names to

            <p>Now all theſe things being ſumm'd up, which I have
here related, there's no conſiderate Man can blame me,
if I appear in ſome Heat: Has not the Kingdom ſtood up
and vindicated it ſelf; and by God's Bleſſing preſerv'd its
Religion and Property? And are they now leſs valuable
than they were ſix Years ago? No ſure, they are as much
to be prized as ever: But Men are too apt to prefer their
own Intereſt before the Publick; and Corruptions natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
grow, and no Place is ſo liable as the Courts of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
or of ſo dangerous conſequence. And as it's our Caſe
at this day; yet it can be no Reflection on his Majeſty's
Prudence, (who hath ſufficiently manifeſted to the World
the great Care he hath of our Welfare, by the many
Dangers he hath undergone for our Sakes;) for all he
can do is but to make choice of ſuch Perſons as are well
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46632:10"/>
qualified for Buſineſs: And if they ſhall afterwards (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
their Duty and Obligations they lie under) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
their own Intereſt before the Publick Good, it's not in
his Majeſty's Power to diſcover it.</p>
            <p>O the Miſchief and Evils that attend Covetouſneſs!
By it many Families, nay Kingdoms, have been ruin'd;
and therefore well might St. <hi>Paul</hi> call it the Root of all
Evil: And <hi>David</hi> renders ſuch Perſons no better than
Cannibals; <hi>They eat up my People as they eat Bread.</hi> And
he that's not wilfully blind, may ſee the Kingdom (and
indeed almoſt all <hi>Europe)</hi> in a Languiſhing Condition:
and have Men no bowels of Compaſſion or Regard to the
Honour and Safety of their Country? Certainly a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
Perſon (whom God abhors) can be a Friend to none:
for he will ſacrifice all to his own Luſt; and you may as
well think to waſh a Blackamore white, as ever to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
ſuch Men; for they are as inſatiable as Death or
the Grave.</p>
            <p>And I conceive no Man will ſo much as doubt, but that
thoſe very Perſons that have thus obſtructed their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
and the Publick Intereſt, have not been (nor never
will be) wanting to uſe all Artifices whereby to prolong
the War <hi>(Salamander</hi> like), that they may make a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
Harveſt, while the Nation is ſpending its Blood and
Treaſure. This can be no unjuſt Cenſure, but an Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
naturally following ſuch Actions. And without
all queſtion, ſuch Men are much more dangerous than
an open Foe: and if the War continue, and theſe
things are not inſpected into and redreſs'd, we are
like to be an unhappy People. Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was
happy, being all her Time ſerv'd with much Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs;
and carried on great Wars, and was generally
ſucceſsful in her Undertakings: And Secretary <hi>Walſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:46632:11"/>
has left ſuch an Example behind him, which I
judg there's few will take as a Precedent for them to
walk by. However, this Nation is not ſo far corrupted
and degenerated, but that there may be found Perſons of
Honour and Worth capable of ſerving their Majeſties in
the higheſt Station, and who will diſcharge their Duty
with Faithfulneſs and Loyalty.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed to give ſome account of thoſe
things I propos'd in the Book I publiſhed the laſt Seſſion
of Parliament; but ſhall only refer to ſuch of them as are
now put in practice: I had obſerv'd what little uſe we
had made of our Shipping, tho being ſo much ſuperiour
to the Enemy in our Strength at Sea, eſpecially the two
preceding Years; one of which we could not find them
out, the other they had gotten up into the <hi>Straits,</hi> when
and where they deſtroy'd ſo much of our Shipping: and
yet both we lay idle (as I may ſay) upon the Coaſt, and
made no Attempt upon their Maritime Towns; but
ſuffer'd them to draw their whole Strength into <hi>Flanders,</hi>
to the great Diſhonour of the Nation: Which I conceiv'd
to be no ways parallel to the Actions of our Fore-fathers;
the Apprehenſion of which, made me preſume to write
that bold Dedication I did to the Parliament; where you
may ſee theſe following Words:</p>
            <q>
               <p>It aſtoniſhes me, when I conſider that two Nations,
who are ſo potent at Sea as We and the <hi>Dutch</hi> are,
ſhould not make a more advantageous uſe of that
Strength which God hath given us: The being ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
at Sea, was ever an unſpeakable Advantage; which
is apparent to the whole World that we are, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
thoſe Loſſes we have had.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:46632:11"/>
And we may plainly ſee that the Providence of God
generally works and brings Things to paſs by Natural
Cauſes and Effects, as may evidently be ſeen by the
late Revolution in this Kingdom: for it was by the Evil
Adminiſtration of Government, under various Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of Affairs, that contributed to it, and which
gave juſt Ground and Occaſion for it; and was that
which turn'd the Hearts of the People, and thereby
begat a Union of Parties, and was the great outward
Cauſe of our preſent Settlement.</p>
               <p>Therefore in vain will it be for us to cry unto God
for Help, and to give a Bleſſing to our Endeavours,
when we take not apt and proper Meaſures.</p>
            </q>
            <p>And this Year we have ſeen quite different Meaſures
taken, from what hath been the whole Courſe of this
War, greatly to the Honour and Intereſt of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
And the going of Admiral <hi>Ruſſel</hi> into the <hi>Straits,</hi>
is certainly much to the Glory of this Nation, and ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choes
into all Parts of the World; and has not only ſav'd
an Ally from Ruin, but hath, as it were, clap'd a Hook
in the Noſe of our great Adverſary, which makes him
plunge like the Great Leviathan; and if the Blow be
follow'd, it will humble him, and make him know he's
but Man, and that all his Flatterers are but ſo many falſe
Prophets. And whoever will but conſider the ſtrange
Alteration there hath been in the Publick Affairs, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the Proſecution of the War againſt <hi>France,</hi> and
read but the laſt recited Dedication, will be apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
I was inſtrumental in it; not that I am ſo vain as
to think, it has been done upon the Account of my
writing, but am of the Opinion, that there are many
worthy Miniſters of State, who had long endeavoured
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46632:12"/>
to have had ſuch Meaſures taken, but were not able to
prevail. But Matters being laid open to the view of the
World, it may no doubt, in ſome degree, have furthered
their good Intentions.</p>
            <p>I preſented to the Right Honourable the Lords of the
Admiralty, Propoſals for laying aſide the Preſs-Ketches,
and for taking up the Sailers (in the ſeveral Ports) by
the Cuſtom-houſe Officers, it being ſeen by Experience,
that they generally fly up into the Country, or otherway
abſcond, ſo ſoon as the Preſs-Ketches arrive in Port;
which puts their Majeſties to a great and unneceſſary
Charge: And there are many judicious Perſons (who
well underſtand theſe Affairs) have thought this might
be put in practice in moſt of the out-Ports of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and thereby prevent that great Obſtruction to Trade,
which is occaſion'd by a continual Preſs. And upon the
Reſult of the Matter, their Lordſhips Anſwer to me was,
That the Fleet was out, and they could not then put my
Propoſition in execution; ſo I took it for granted, they
did approve of what I had done, (having anſwer'd all
Objections); but their Lordſhips have not ſince thought
fit to put it in practice: Therefore I could heartily wiſh
the Matter were inſpected into as to the Validity of it,
by thoſe who have a Power ſo to do. My Zeal for the
Publick, has made me tranſgreſs and break Promiſe, in
giving a Relation of this Matter that is not put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice;
but the Importance of it being conſider'd, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
I cannot be blam'd for ſo doing. And obſerving
what an Injury the Nation receiv'd from the great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bargoes
that were every Year laid upon Shipping, I did
(at the ſame time I made the Propoſals) what in me lay
to remove ſo great an Evil, and therein prov'd to be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:46632:12"/>
and ſo ſhall give ſome Account of the Matter, as
it was offer'd to their Lordſhips, in a Copy of a Letter to
the Lords of the Admiralty, which you may ſee juſt after
the Preface to the Reader.</p>
            <p>Upon the delivery of this Letter, I was call'd in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Lordſhips: where it was read; and they told
me it was an eaſy matter to ſay a Thing, and ask'd me
if I could give Reaſons to prove what I did aſſert? So
they put me upon anſwering this, If any Hardſhip muſt
lie upon Shipping, it ſhould rather be thrown upon the
Coaſting Trade. Which I did deliver, and endeavour'd
to prove by another Letter to the Lords of the Admiralty,
immediately following the foregoing Letter.</p>
            <p>And beſides theſe Letters, I further fully demonſtrated,
(as appears in the Book I publiſhed, to which I refer the
Reader) that there was no manner of Occaſion for laying
any Imbargo, there being a ſufficient Body of Sailers, to
anſwer the End of Government, and the Neceſſities of
Trade: And this Year we ſee there has been none laid,
notwithſtanding the King has taken ſeveral Thouſands of
Sailers more into his Service, than at any time during this
War. And their Lordſhips are now ſo far from laying an
Imbargo, that they have put forth ſtrict Orders, that no
Preſs-Maſters preſume to meddle with any Sailers on board
Outward-bound Shipping.</p>
            <p>By all which I have here related, I doubt not but it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to any impartial Man, that the Arguments I us'd
was the Cauſe of laying aſide the Imbargo; if not, why
was it not done before, when there was leſs occaſion for
an Imbargo than there is now? But <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>A poor
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46632:13"/>
Man ſav'd a City, and no body remembered that poor Man:</hi>
So it's no wonder at all that I go unrewarded, in an Age
and Nation where Corruption ſo much abounds.</p>
            <p>I likewiſe humbly propos'd an Act of Tunnage, for
laying ſix Pence <hi>per</hi> Tun upon all Coaſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which
may be ſeen <hi>p. 21, &amp;c.</hi> of my printed Book: And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Act now in force extends not to Barges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I
think it not amiſs to repeat what I then propos'd.</p>

is no Hardſhip upon them, it being brought in upon the
Merchants as Average.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="18" facs="tcp:46632:14"/>
Unleſs it fall upon Colliers; and it's well known
they get a great deal of Money, notwithſtanding all
the Charge they are at, and the great Wages they
give.</p>
                        <p>And it may further be objected by them, That they
are liable to great Dangers, and many of them taken
by the Enemy.</p>
                        <p>All which is no more than what the Merchants are
expos'd to; whoſe Effects are generally of much greater
Conſequence than their Shipping, yet are no ways ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
from paying greater Duties, both Inward and
Outward; notwithſtanding any great Loſſes they have
had, or may hereafter meet withal.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, it ſeems altogether unreaſonable, that theſe
Perſons ſhould be exempted from being Tax'd, when
there may thereby be ſo much Money rais'd, as will be
of great Importance to the Government.</p>

This foregoing Matter I did preſent to ſeveral Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of State, a Month before it was publiſhed; and
they were pleaſed to acknowledg it the firſt of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that had been offer'd to the Government. And Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
before was ever look'd upon to be as Sacred as
Church-Lands. It's not to be denied, but that 'tis greatly
improv'd, beyond what I propos'd; I always thought it
might be ſo, and am very glad to ſee it brought to that
Perfection it is. There is a worthy Gentleman, who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Exchange</hi> was pleaſed to ſay, he was the firſt Man
that propos'd the Tunnage Act to the King. And not
unlike, (but he cannot forget that I preſented him with a
Book, wherein it was propos'd four Months before ever
it was mov'd); and his Majeſty has no ways been wanting
to him, but has put him into an Honourable Station. And
indeed his Goodneſs is ſuch, that he never fails to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
thoſe that do him Service, if the Matter comes to
his Knowledg: And if others would but imitate his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and follow his Example, his Majeſty would be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſerv'd. And whoever thoſe Worthy Gentlemen are,
that firſt mov'd and occaſion'd the Royal Bank, ought to
have their Statues ſet in Braſs, to perpetuate their Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to future Ages: for it will appear every Day more and
more, to be of great Importance to the Kingdom, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the Advantage that accrues to them who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in it) it being that which this Nation hath long
wanted; and no Foreign Bank whatever can compare
with it, or appear to be built upon ſo ſolid a Foundation.
And the Tunnage is the moſt inſenſibly felt of any Tax
that hath yet been levied; for altho the Merchants and
Owners of Shipping disburſe the Money, yet it cannot
be ſaid to be any thing out of their Pockets; for it doth
conſequently advance the Goods, proportionable to what's
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:46632:16"/>
paid, it being general; ſo it doth, as it were, diffuſe it
ſelf into all parts of the Kingdom: And by what has been
before related, certainly there's no Man but will grant
that I laid the firſt Foundation of the Tunnage Act, (or
that I had the Gift of Prophecy, having propos'd it ſix
Months before it was paſt into an Act); but the Matter's
too plain to be queſtion'd, and there are ſome Perſons at
Court (by the Station they are in) who are oblig'd in
Honour and Juſtice to give Incouragement to Men that
do any thing that contributes to the Publick Service; who
notwithſtanding, make but Tools of them, to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of their Majeſties and the Kingdom, and Diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Nation.</p>
            <p>For Rewards and Puniſhment are the Support and
Axis upon which all Governments move.</p>
            <p>Therefore theſe things are not writ (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays in
another Caſe) for his ſake that did the Wrong, or his
that receiv'd the Wrong; but that the Nation may ſee.—</p>
            <p>What is it the French King at this day owes all his vaſt
Improvements by Sea, and Conqueſt by Land too, but
the Faithfulneſs of his Miniſters, and the great Rewards
he never fails to give them that do him Service? <hi>(Honos
alit Artes.)</hi> It's that which makes Men bold and daring,
and even out-brave Death it ſelf, and knits the Minds of
Men faſt to a Prince. For all Men naturally are well
pleas'd to ſee Perſons rewarded for Service done: it's that
which begets a ſteady Loyalty, and puts Hope in every
Man; and it's no other than what hath ever been the
Practice of all the civilized Nations and Ages in the
World.</p>
            <p>And our Fore-fathers were always careful to ſee it
executed: and 'tis the Method that even God himſelf
takes with ſinful Man, that ſo he may wean his Affections
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:46632:16"/>
from theſe tranſient Things below, and have an Eye
unto the Recompence of Reward.</p>
            <p>And ſo thus while we neglect our Duty, we tempt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
            <p>Therefore until better Meaſures are taken, I cannot
ſee with what Confidence we can think to proſper: for
Miracles are ceaſed, and God expects we uſe ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
as conduce and have a Tendency to Peace and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs;
otherwiſe, if we miſcarry, it may truly be ſaid,
we have been the Authors of our own Ruin. But it's the
Parliament, and only they, that are able to cope with, and
engage this Hydra (this many-headed Monſter); for
they are the great Council and Phyſicians of the Nation,
and have never been wanting to redreſs National Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances.
I ſhall conclude with that excellent Form of
Prayer, compos'd by our Church:</p>
            <p>Moſt gracious God, We humbly beſeech thee, as for this
Kingdom in general; ſo eſpecially for the High Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
under our moſt religious and gracious King and Queen
at this time aſſembled: That thou wouldeſt be pleaſed to direct
and proſper all their Conſultations to the advancement of thy
Glory, the good of thy Church, the ſafety, honour, and welfare
of their Majeſties and their Kingdoms; that all things may be
ſo ordered and ſettled by their Endeavours upon the beſt and
ſureſt Foundations, that Peace and Happineſs, Truth and
Juſtice, Religion and Piety, may be eſtabliſhed among us for all
Generations. Theſe and all other Neceſſaries for them, for us
and thy whole Church, we humbly beg in the Name and Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Jeſus Chriſt our moſt bleſſed Lord and Saviour. <hi>Amen.</hi>
