            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </hi> also to his Answer

                  </gap>o his book
called, <hi>Truth cleared of Calumnies, in Answer
to</hi> W. M. <hi>in</hi> Aberden. And the Answer given
by the said <hi>R. B.</hi> and me to the Students of
<hi>Aberden;</hi> as also to divers Treatises published
by me, such as my book of <hi>Immediate Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi>
my book of <hi>Vniversal Grace,</hi> my
book called, <hi>The Way cast up,</hi> my book called,
<hi>The Rector Corrected, in Answer to</hi> T. W. who
calls himself <hi>Rector of Arrow,</hi> and lastly to my
book called, <hi>Quakerism no Popery.</hi> And though
to this last book <hi>I. A.</hi> hath replyed in some
few particulars, which I purpose, so far as
may seem requisite, to Answer; yet he hath
quite passed by the most material passages, and
especially all the Authorities and Testimonies
of Ancient Writers; and also of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
brought by me, as concurring with
the Scriptures Testimony, to clear us of that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60394:3"/>
imputation of <hi>Popery</hi> falsly charged upon us
by <hi>I. M.</hi> To none of which weighty Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
hath the said <hi>I. A.</hi> replyed one word.
Now because there is little or nothing that
seems Material of <hi>I. A.</hi> his Objections that is
not already fully answered in these Books and
Treatises above mentioned, therefore I Judge
it not needful to Write a large or particular
Answer to every thing; yet lest he should
seem too wise in his own Eyes, or lest he
and others that favour him, should think he
is stronger, than really he is; and especially
to prevent the stumbling of the weak, into
whose hands his book may come. I purpose,
through the Lords Assistance, to reply some
things, which may suffice on every Head
or Section.</p>
               <p>What hath induced <hi>I. A.</hi> to Dedicate his
book against us, to the Mayor of <hi>London,</hi>
may seem no impertinent Query. Had he
none in all his Native Country whom he
had confidence in to Patronize his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings?
Or being Conscious of his small
esteem at home, did he despair to find any
Liberal <hi>Mecenas</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and therefore he
must go so far as <hi>London</hi> to find out one, and
that no less then the Mayor himself, to whom
it may be supposed <hi>I. A.</hi> his greatest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
was his being a stranger: And
that he saith in his Epistle to the said Eminent
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60394:4"/>
person; <hi>His Treatise presums not to add any
lustre to his Name, whereof it is uncapable:</hi>
That may well be believed, that his Book is
indeed uncapable of adding any lustre there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
But why was he not afraid that it
would detract from his lustre? It were
good, that those Eminent persons in the
World, who suffer men to Superscribe their
Names as Patrons to their Books, did first
examine them diligently, if they did deserve
any such Patronage, lest Error masking it self
under the name of Truth, seek the Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as is too common now in the World.
And for my part, I have no small conjecture,
that if the said Eminent person, to whom this
disingenuous and impertinent piece by <hi>I. A.</hi>
is Dedicated, had but taken the leisure or
pains, to review but one sixth part of it, he
had never suffered his Name to be super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
to it. And I am very hopeful that the
Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> who hath divers thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of that people, within his Precinct in
that Famous City; many of whom I judge
are better known to him, than <hi>I. A.</hi> ever
was, hath more charity towards the people
called in scorn <hi>Quakers,</hi> than to believe <hi>I. A.</hi>
his description of them in his said Epistle;
were he expresly alledgeth on them, <hi>That
they renounce all true Principles of Religion, and
stifle their very faculties of Reason;</hi> charging
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60394:4"/>
them also with Absurdity: And in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
to the Reader he calleth them, <hi>Vncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised
Philistins and reproachful Adversaries;
having in their Queries and other Papers, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorged
as many Lies against God and his Truth,
and as many Slanders against the Church of God
in</hi> Brittain, <hi>as if they had exchanged both Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and Offices with<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>the Father of Lies and
Accuser of the Brethren.</hi> But if that Eminent
person, whose Name and Favour this <hi>I. A.</hi>
hath abused, shall please to look into this
small Treatise, in Answer to that of <hi>I. A.</hi>
I hope he shall find, that they are falsly
charged with those Crimes. It seemeth no
new or strange thing to us to be so falsly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused,
knowing that not only our Fellow
Servants and Brethren in former Generations,
have been so used, but also the Head him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>elf,
and Captain of our Salvation, the Lord Jesus
Christ, was not only numbred among trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors,
but called a Blasphemer, and said to
have a Devil: And the Lord forewarned his
Disciples and Followers that they should be
so lied upon, and all manner of evil things
said against them falsly for his Name sake.
<hi>But rejoyce,</hi> said he, <hi>and be glad, for great is
your reward in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now whereas <hi>I. A.</hi> calleth his Book, <hi>A
Vindication of the Church of God in</hi> Brittain,
he ought to have told what Church he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60394:5"/>
meant, seeing there are divers sorts of people
in <hi>Brittain,</hi> who call themselves the Church
of God, and yet in divers things Dissent from
<hi>I. A.</hi> And upon review of his Book, I find
the said <hi>I. A.</hi> his Principles to be almost whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Calvinistical,</hi> and particularly, 1. <hi>That he
denyeth the Vniversal Grace of God, or that
Christ hath died for all men. 2. That he denyeth
that God hath any regard to the new Creature,
or work of Conversion, or Repentance to be so much
as a condition requisite in order to our Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
3. That he denyeth that any can be free
from actual sining in this Life by any Grace of
God given them, or to be given.</hi> These and other
principles alledged by him, which are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Calvinistical,</hi> are as much disliked by many
and some of those, the most considerable, of
the Episcopal Church in <hi>Brittain,</hi> as by us.
And I judge that <hi>I. A.</hi> should hold himself a
Member of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Episcopal Church, seeing he
himself Officiates as Reader and Presentor at
at <hi>Leith,</hi> under <hi>Iohn Hamilton</hi> an Episcopal
Preacher, who hath also recommended his
Book. And therefore seeing <hi>I. A.</hi> hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
the Vindication of the Church of
God in <hi>Brittain,</hi> as he alledgeth against the
<hi>Quakers;</hi> he must either acknowledge, that the
Episcopal Church in <hi>Brittain</hi> is not the Church
of God, whereof he is a professed Member,
or else have proved out of the the Episcopal
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60394:5"/>
Church now in <hi>Brittain,</hi> that she avoweth
and owneth such principles, all and every one,
as he asserteth; and that those Eminent and
Noted persons, both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi>
who dissent from him, and agree with us, in
those principles already mentioned, are He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,
and renouncers of true principles of
Religion, stifling the faculties of reason; such
as among others in <hi>England, R. Cudworth,</hi> and
<hi>H. More,</hi> accounted great Doctors, also <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Sharlock,</hi> and <hi>I. A.</hi> his Reverend and
much admired <hi>Rich<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Baxter,</hi> whom he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
opposeth in the matter of Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
And in <hi>Scotland,</hi> Bishop <hi>William Forbes</hi>
in his Treatise called, <hi>Considerationes modestae
&amp; pacificae Controvers.</hi> As also divers other
persons of Note yet living, whose Names I
need not to mention; all which I suppose,
and thousands more in the Episcopal Church
in <hi>Brittain,</hi> of all Qualities and Ranks, will
be loath to acknowledge <hi>I. A.</hi> for a Patron
or Defender of their Faith; but rather find
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ault with him in those things, as an Enemy
of their Faith, and in other things a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayer
and betrayer of it, rather then a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender.
In his Preface to the Reader, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuseth
himself that he hath not Cited any
humane Testimonies (meaning Authorities
of Ancient and Modern Writers) against us
<hi>Seeing these</hi> (saith he) <hi>they do not value, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60394:6"/>
when they think they make for them,</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<hi>ad hominem.</hi> And with this slender pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text,
I suppose he thinketh to evade the many
Testimonies I brought to confirm the Truth
of our principles, in my Book called <hi>Quake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rism
no Popery,</hi> even out of Writters both
Ancient and late, of great esteem among
them; none of which he hath once so much as
touched. But to Answer to his Charge, I say,
we value the Testimonies of all Writers, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Ancient or late, which are true, and
agree with the Scriptures, as much as any
Protestants do, or more than he doth. And
seeing he imputeth it as a fault to us, that we
will not own the Testimonies of others,
against us; I ask him, if he would own or
value any Testimonies of Authors that make
against him, or his Judgment? If he say nay,
then his excuse is removed, and he hath
nought to say for this omission. But the
matter seemeth to be in effect, that those
Testimonies adduced by me in the foresaid
Treatise he knew not how to Answer, unless
by saying that those persons erred in those
principles, as much as we, which he was
loath to acknowledge, lest he should seem to
weaken the Charge of his Title against us, and
acknowledge his own party, and those that
are more worth of Credit than himself,
equally guilty of <hi>Iesuitism</hi> with the people
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60394:6"/>
called <hi>Quakers,</hi> wherewith he doth falsly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
them.</p>
               <p>And here I shall give a List or Catalogue of
divers gross Perversions and Calumnies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he seeketh to abuse his Reader, in the very
Preface of his book against us: As 1. <hi>That
we reject all manner of External Ordinances;</hi>
Which is notoriously false, as all who have
the least knowledge of us can witness; that
we are for Meeting together, and that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently;
and when we meet, to Preach, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort,
Pray, and give Thanks to God in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
words, as the Spirit of the Lord doth
help us: And can <hi>I. A.</hi> say that none of these
are External Ordinances or Appointments;
and we challenge him to instance any one Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Ordinance or Appointment of God
that is truly so, which we are against: For it
is but only humane Institutions, (and Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
shadows) set up as Divine Ordinances
which we oppose, as in the Sequel of this
Treatise doth appear. 2. He saith, <hi>We do di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
strike at the Foundation of all with one
blow, overturning (so far as we can) the whole
rule of Faith and Duty, setting a new one of our
own Invention in the room thereof.</hi> But why
doth he charge us so highly in this matter?
because we cannot own the Letter or Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Testimony of the Scriptures, as the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
Rule or Foundation of Faith; but only
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60394:7"/>
Christ Jesus, the first and last; concerning
whom <hi>Paul</hi> hath writ, <hi>That another founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
no man can lay, then that which is laid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
which is Christ Iesus. And said the Lord,
behold I lay in</hi> Zion <hi>an Elect precious Corner
stone, a sure foundation:</hi> Which to be sure,
is not the Letter, but Christ and his Spirit,
Light and Life revealed in the heart. And I
Query this Accuser <hi>I. A.</hi> whether, if to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
Christ in his immediate Teachings
by his Spirit in mens hearts, is to set up a false
Foundation or overturn the true one; the
Apostles are guilty of this Charge, as to their
own particulars; seeing <hi>I. A.</hi> will not deny,
but that the Apostles had Christ immediatly
to Teach them, and speak in them: And was
it not the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> his labour to build the
Churches upon Christ, that their Faith might
not stand in men, (though sent and moved
of God) but in the power of God. And
though <hi>I. A.</hi> blame us for setting up the
Light within for the Rule, yet Christ taught
people to believe in the Light, and that this
Light was not the Scripture, which he bid them
believe in is clear; that he said, <hi>While ye have
the Light, believe in the Light, that ye may be
the Children of it:</hi> This clearly Imports, that
this Light should not long remain with them,
if they did not believe in it, as he said in the
foregoing Verse, <hi>Yet a little while is the Light
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60394:7"/>
with you; walk while ye have the Light, lest
darkness come upon you,</hi> see <hi>Iohn</hi> 12. 35, 36.
And indeed the gracious Visitation of Light
did not long after remain with them who did
reject it, although the Scriptures did remain
with them: And therefore the Light which
he bid them believe in, was not the Letter of
the Scripture, but Christ himself, who said,
<hi>I am the Light of the World.</hi> 3. He saith,
<hi>This Heresie</hi> (so he calleth our Faith) <hi>is a very
Sink or an Vniversal System of almost all the
gross Errors, which hitherto have annoyed the
Church of God:</hi> And herein he doth imitate
<hi>I. Brown,</hi> and the Author of the <hi>Postcript</hi> to
<hi>S. R.</hi> his <hi>Epistles,</hi> who have so charged us;
but how unjustly, we hope our Answers do
sufficiently evince: And surely this <hi>I. A.</hi> in
the Art of Slandering and false Accusing, may
pass muster for a Lieutenant to those afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Champions, who have led the way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him in this enterprise. It is not unknown,
how the <hi>Papists</hi> loaded the <hi>Protestants,</hi> at their
appearing, and do still at this day load them
with such kind of Charges; and to none is
it more familiar to blame others for Heresie,
than those who are greatest Hereticks them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
4. He saith, <hi>In Doctrine, we trample
generally upon the whole Moral Law, but more
especially upon the first Table:</hi> And here very
falsly he Charges our Doctrine to be contrary
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60394:8"/>
to the first, second, fourth, fifth, sixth and
ninth Commandments: but let us see how he
maketh good his Charge in each of them.
He alledgeth our Doctrine transgresseth the
first Commandment, because we say, <hi>All
Prayer and Worship that is performed without the
Spirit of God, is Will-worship and Superstition,
and consequently no wicked or unregenerate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are bound to Worship God, or indeed in any
respect to obey God:</hi> And from thence he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,
<hi>They are not under any Law of God; and
therefore lastly, let them do what they will, they
cannot sin against God, such men (in the</hi> Quakers
<hi>Principles,</hi> as he saith) <hi>may deny, disown, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
hate and contemn God, worship the Devil,
and debauch at their pleasure; they may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
dishonour and defame all men, Murder,
commit Adultery, Steal, bear false Witness,
and yet they cannot sin, because they are under
no Law.</hi> Hence also he infers, <hi>That Reprobates
are most unjustly condemned for their sinning
against God, seeing they (not having received the
Spirit) are not under Law to God, and so can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be guilty of sinning against him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now what Sober, Impartial and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
person that is not byassed with deep pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
against us, seeth not, that these absurd
consequences have not the least shadow of any
Rational inference. For although we say in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that there is no true Worship, but that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60394:8"/>
which is in Spirit, according to the express
words of Christ; and that none are true
Worshippers of God, but such as Worship him
n the Spirit; and that God requireth no
Lifeless or Spiritless Worship; yet we still af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
that all mankind ought to Worship
God, and Call upon him, even all the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and unrenewed persons, as well as the
renewed; so that in the thing of Worship it
self, we have no Controversy, whether it
be due unto God by all mankind; but the
state of the Question lyeth here betwixt us,
and those that dissent from us, what the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God is, and what kind or sort of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
it is that God requires of all men: And in
Answer thereunto, we say, the true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God is a Spiritual Worship, requiring
the sincerity of the heart not as a circumstance,
or accidental thing, but as the essential part
thereof, which cannot be done without the
Spirit of God: How much therefore more
True and Rational consequence is it to argue
thus. God commands all men to Worship
him, therefore he hath given some measure
more or less of the help of his Spirit, unto all
men, whereby they may so do, which doth
continue with them so long as it pleaseth God,
who taketh away this help from none, but
such as mightily provoke him, and sin out the
day of their Visitation. And even those whom
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60394:9"/>
the Lord in his Justice hath withdrawn that
help or grace of his Spirit, are still bound by
the Law of God, to Worship him, as much
as ever; even when they neither do, or can
Worship him truly, because they have
brought this unpotency or inability upon
themselves, by their own unfaithfulness:
Even as a Servant or Steward that hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a sum of Money to pay his Master, and
the said Servant spendeth the Money upon
his Lusts, and hath not one Penny, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to pay the debt; yet he is still lyable for
the whole sum. Hence what <hi>I. A.</hi> saith in
<hi>page</hi> 11. of his Preface, is true, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability
of unrenewed men, to perform accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Worship, neither does nor can take
away their Obligation to perform it. But
we differ from <hi>I. A.</hi> in the cause or reason,
why those who want that ability are still un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the said Obligation; which reason he
will have only and alone mens losing it in
<hi>Adam,</hi> in whom they all once had it; and
the losing of it is their fault, citing <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.
12, 19.</p>
               <p>But to this I Answer, <hi>First,</hi> Whatever loss
or inability is come upon <hi>Adam</hi>'s posterity by
the primitive disobedience; yet now by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of the second <hi>Adam</hi> his obedience, a new
ability is conferred upon all men; So that as
broad as the Sore did spread by the first sin,
<pb facs="tcp:60394:9"/>
even as broad is the Plaister that God hath
provided to the Lame and Diseased Souls of
all mankind. And this is most clear and
plain from <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18. as also from <hi>Ioh. 3. 19.
And this is the condemnation</hi> (said Christ) <hi>that
Light is come into the world, and men loved dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
rather than Light, because their deeds were
evil:</hi> So we see, that Christ layeth not the
ground of wicked mens condemnation upon
<hi>Adams</hi> sin, but upon their hating the Light
that did come unto them as a new and fresh
discovery and visitation of Gods love. But
secondly, Whether this Inability is come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the wicked by reason of <hi>Adam</hi>'s sin, or by
their own actual disobedience since that time;
yet we affirm no less than <hi>I. A.</hi> that the most
wicked and ungodly are still under the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
to the whole Law of God; and their
inability can be no ground of excuse unto
them. But the true state of the Queston is this,
Whether wicked men, not simply as men,
or creatures, but as wicked, and remaining still
in their wickedness, should, or are required to
offer up unto God hypocritical and lifeless
performances of that which men commonly
call Prayer and Worship; but is no more so
in the sight of God, than a dead Picture of
Stone or Clay is a true living man; and so
whether God did ever require any to draw
near to him with their Mouths, and remove
<pb facs="tcp:60394:10"/>
their Hearts far away, as the manner of all
wicked persons, while so remaining, always
is: Now we say, God never required such
sort of Prayers, but refused and forbad them,
to be offered unto him, even under the Law,
see <hi>Isaiah 1. 13. Bring no more vain Oblations;</hi>
and v. 12. <hi>When ye come to appear before me,
who hath required this at your hand to tread
my Courts?</hi> Again Psal. 50. 16, 17. <hi>But unto
the wicked, God saith, what hast thou to do to
declare my Statutes, or that thou shouldest take
my Covenant in thy mouth, seeing thou hatest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,</hi>
&amp;c. And whereas <hi>I. A.</hi> citeth some
words of our Friends, <hi>That wicked men should
not Pray;</hi> let the Impartial and Indifferent
Reader understand these words, in the Sense of
those Scriptures just now mentioned, which are
as positive and full, as any that can be cited
out of our Friends Books, and all occasion of
mistake shall be removed. For neither the
Sense of the Scripture, nor of our Friends is,
<hi>That wicked men are b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>und in no respect to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ip
God;</hi> for the contrary is manifest from
the words cited by <hi>I. A.</hi> out of the Book
called, <hi>The Principles of Truth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> where he
alledgeth their words, saying, <hi>All men ought
first to wait, until they receive the Spirit in
Truth, then in the same Truth to Worship God in
Spirit who is a Spirit.</hi> So we see by <hi>I. A.</hi> his
own Confession, the <hi>Quakers</hi> teach that all
<pb facs="tcp:60394:10"/>
men ought to Worship God in the Spirit, and
that they may indeed Worship him, they
would have all men follow the Lords order,
which is to wait, or watch unto Prayer; and
they would have men in the first place cease or
depart from their wickedness; and then by the
help of the Spirit (which is never wanting in the
proper season of it) to come and Pray unto
God. And that this is no new or invented way
of the <hi>Quakers</hi> so called; Read <hi>Isaiah</hi> 1. 16, 17,
18. where the Lord by the Prophet bids first,
<hi>That they wash and be clean, and put away the
evil of their doings,</hi> &amp;c. And then said he, <hi>Come
now let us reason together:</hi> Also <hi>Peter</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<hi>Simon Magus</hi> to joyn Repentance with
Prayer; <hi>Repent</hi> (said he) <hi>and Pray, that the
Thoughts of thy heart may be forgiven thee.</hi> And
for the more clear understanding of this whole
matter, we are to consider, that Prayer is
either simply Mental, and with the heart on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or both Mental and Vocal; to wit, both
with heart and Mouth. Now as for Mental
Prayer, at least in respect of the bent or
frame and inclination of the Heart, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
it always of all men; and it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for all men, if they but receive that
help of his Spirit, which he giveth or
offereth unto men always to perform it.
But as for Vocal Prayer, he neither doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
it at all times, nor doth he give the help at
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60394:11"/>
all times, nor the utterance whereby to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
it. And it is observable, that under the
Gospel, no particular set or limited time is
appointed for Vocal Prayer: But every one
is to wait to know the times of the Spirits call
and moving thereunto, which will be season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
and frequently afforded to such as wait
singly therefore, especially when the people
of God Assemble together; for then it is that
Vocal Prayer is of greatest use and service,
though it hath also its use and service in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
or when one is apart.</p>
               <p>But whereas <hi>I. A.</hi> alledgeth further, <hi>That
if wicked men are not to Pray, (viz.</hi> their Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical
Prayers) <hi>because they sin when they Pray;</hi>
No man on earth should offer to Pray or
Worship God, seeing as he saith, <hi>There is
somewhat of sin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>leaving to the best Actions of
the Saints here away.</hi> To this I answer; That
there is somewhat of sin cleaving to the best
Actions of the Saints here away is denyed,
seeing it is asserted by him without proof, for
the Scriptures cited by him, <hi>viz. Prov. 20. 9.
Gal.</hi> 5. 17. say no such thing, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
he hath not evinced it; and for a
proof to the contrary, see <hi>Iob 16. 17. Malach.</hi>
1. 11. But secondly, nor doth it follow, that
men, who are not yet come to a perfect state,
but labour sincerely under the burden of their
sins, to be delivered from them, may not
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60394:11"/>
Pray unto God, because their Prayer, as they
put it up unto God by the help of his Spirit is
pure and without all sin, proceeding from the
pure or renewed part of their hearts; for it is
only the pure or renewed part of the heart,
from which indeed the true Prayer doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed;
even as on the contrary, the evil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
and affections arise and spring only from
the impure and unrenewed part. Therefore
he that hath this unrenewed part in him,
ought to watch against it, while he prayeth,
that he give it no liberty to move or stir, as
indeed he ought to watch against it at all other
times. And though he that prayeth sincerely,
being not attained to a sinless state, pray not
with that degree or measure of fervency,
wherewith another more perfect doth or can
pray; yet God regarding that mans sincerity,
he accepteth his Prayer, in Christ, and for
Christs sake pardoneth him, when at any
time he committeth a weakness in his Prayer,
in not keeping purely to the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Lastly,</hi> Whereas <hi>I. A.</hi> objecteth,
<hi>That the Plowing, Eating, Sleeping,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of the
wicked is sin:</hi> Shall the wicked then do nothing
at all, because whatever they do, they go
about it in a sinful manner. I answer, This
consequence doth no wise follow, because
there is a great difference betwixt a wicked
mans Plowing, Eating, Drinking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60394:12"/>
his Praying, as remaining wicked and alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
from the Spirit of God; for his Plowing,
Eating, Drinking, or any other Corporal
or Natural actions, are really these actions,
and they are profitable and necessary in the
Creation; and when he performeth these
actions he faileth not in the substance or matter
of the action required, but only in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
for the substance or matter of a wicked
mans Plowing, Eating, Travelling, is not sin,
but the manner of it, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is not in
Faith, but a wicked mans Prayer, as he is a
wicked man, is no true Prayer at all, it hath
nothing of the true substance of true and real
Prayer, it is a meer picture, or dead resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of Prayer; and is rather a mocking
God, than praying unto him; for it wants
the life of true Prayer, which alone the Spirit
of God doth give; and thus a plain difference
is demonstrated betwixt the two cases: and the
Unvalidity of <hi>I. A.</hi> his consequences in this
whole matter is evinced. And if the Reader
desire further satisfaction, in this particular,
let him Read our Answer to the Students, and
<hi>R. B.</hi> his Apology, where these Objections of
<hi>I. A.</hi> are largely Answered, for he has brought
no new matter against us; and it had been
better he had both spared his own pains, and
not troubled the world with his repeating o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens Arguments, long since answered. As
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60394:12"/>
for his instance of our opposing the second
Commandment, by our rejecting, wresting
and abusing the Word of God, and avowing
of Error and Blasphemy; seeing it is but a bare
alledging, without any shadow of proof; it
is enough as simply to deny it, as he doth
simply affirm it. But another instance he
giveth of our opposing the second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>By swallowing down our Meat and Drink
(as so many Beasts) without any Prayer and
Thansgiving; without which (if they will believe
the Apostle,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 3, 4, 5.) <hi>they are not sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
But how unjustly he chargeth this upon
us, I can freely leave to the Judgment of all
sober and true Christians. For how doth he
prove that we Eat, or Drink, or receive any
Creatures of God without Prayer and
Thanksgivings? Because we do not always
use Vocal and External Prayer, when we Eat
and Drink although at other times we use it, as
God is pleased to give utterance, and are most
glad either to do it, or joyn with these, who
do it by the help of Gods Spirit: But is <hi>I. A.</hi>
so ignorant and unreasonable to think that
theirs is no Prayer, or Thanksgiving, nor any
use of the Word of God, but that which is
Vocal and External: Do we not Read of the
Prayer of the Heart in Scripture, and also of
Singing and making Melody in the heart unto
the Lord, as well as with the Mouth? Or
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60394:13"/>
doth <hi>I. A.</hi> think that brutes can do this, as well
as we, that he compares our Eating and Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
altogether to that of Brutes. However
for the satisfaction of those that are sober. I
futher declare, that we hold it our duty, and
I hope, we can say, it is our aim, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
in all our Eating and Drinking, and in
the receiving all the Mercies of God, both
Spiritual and Temporal, to reeeive them
with Prayer and Thanksgiving, either both
Mental and Vocal; or at least Mental, which
we know is aceepted of God, if in sincerity
when the Vocal is not used. And they who
Pray, or seem to Pray with their Lips and
Voices, when their Hearts are far away, as
it is too much the general manner and custom
of people; their Eating and Drinking is worse
than that of Brutes, which sin not when they
Eat, as all wicked persons do. But I ask <hi>I. A.</hi>
doth he use Vocal and External Prayer and
Thanksgiving, always when he receives any
of the Creatures of God; as in the use of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
or Tasting a little Wine, or Ale, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionally
in a Tavern; or when walking in
an Orchard, is his Conscience so scrupulous,
that he cannot Taste an Aple, but he must
use Vocal Prayer: I suppose he is not so scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous.
And doth not <hi>I. A.</hi> know, that there
is not one moment of our Life, but we are
still receiving the Creatures of God, seeing
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60394:13"/>
every breathing or receiving in of the Air, is
a renewed Mercy and Ble<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing of God, with
many others continually added unto us: And
yet the Lord doth not continually require
Vocal Prayer, in the continual use of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ose
Mercies. And here I shall propose a few plain
Questions for <hi>I. A.</hi> to Answer, upon this
whole matter. 1. Whether one that sincerely
useth Prayer and Thanksgiving in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>art
before he Eateth and Drinketh, and in his

to have his heart exercised in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ear
of God, although at times he use not Vocal
Prayer, before and after Meat, is not more
unlike to a Brute, and more indeed a true
Christian; than he, who knoweth not what it
is to fear God, or Pray to God sincerely in
his heart, at any time, yet always at Meal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
useth a form of dead and lifeless words
before and after Meat. 2. Whether to Pray
without the Spirit and without sincerity of
heart, be not a transgressing of the first, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
and third Commandments. 3. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that Doctrine which teacheth men to
Pray spiritless and hypocritical Prayers, doth
not oppose these three Commandments. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>I. A.</hi> doth alledge, that we do openly
impugne the fourth Commandment, in one
of the following Queries, unto which place,
he referreth the Controversy. To <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> I
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60394:14"/>
Answer, and so he might all the rest, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
prepossessing his Reader with prejudice
against us, until he had heard the whole
matter more amply discussed.</p>
               <p>Our opposing the fifth Commandment he
instanceth; in not taking off our Hats, and
bowing the body in Salutations: But seeing
the fifth Commandment mentioneth no such
form of Honour, nor doth he deduce it by
any just consequence therefrom, It is as easily
denyed by us, as affirmed by him. Nor doth
it follow, as he alledgeth, that because we
are to obey ehe fifth Commandment, with
our Bodies, as well as with our Souls; that
therefore we are to take off our Hats, in giving
that honour to Parents; for the <hi>Iews</hi> to
whom that command was particularly given,
used no such form of honor or respect. And
as for bowing the Body, although it was
practised under the Law, yet we find it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
under the Gospel, as in the case of
<hi>Cornelius</hi> bowing to <hi>Peter:</hi> And in the <hi>New
Testament</hi> we read of no bowing that is lawful,
but that which is at the Name of Jesus, and
of God Almighty. Again, whereas he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth,
that from the words of Christ,
<hi>Iohn 5. 44. We Impugne the very letter of the
fifth Commandment, and declare that no manner
of Civil Reverence or regard is to be given to any
man.</hi> I Answer, this is a false Charge like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60394:14"/>
the rest; for we deny not, that there is a
civil regard and honour that is due unto all

also to be signified and practised with a suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
outward behaviour of the body, and
may very well be, without either uncove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Head, or bowing the Knee, such as
to rise up before the Hoary-Head, or those
that are our Superiours; also to stand before
them, to speak humbly, or be silent, unless
when required, or liberty is given; also to
havean humble Aspect, or regard of the Eye
and Face towards them, to give the Hand, if
required; to be ready at a beck to Answer
their Call, and to walk and run to serve
them, in what is requisite; these and many
such instances of External Honour and respect,
may Children lawfully practice to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
and Inferiors to their Superiors, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
either bowing the Knee, or taking off the
Hat. But certainly these words of Christ,
<hi>Ioh. 5. 44. Condemn all false honour which the
spirit of the World hath invented:</hi> And such
we have good cause to hold the uncovering
of the Head to men, until <hi>I. A.</hi> can produce
a better Original for it.</p>
               <p>

               <head>CHAP. II.</head>
               <p>ANd here I give the Reader to know,
that this pretended Examination of
<hi>I. A.</hi> is in Answer to 17 Queries, which he
saith came to him subscribed by <hi>I. S.</hi> But I
believe <hi>I. S.</hi> never did Subscribe those Queries,
nor was he Author of them, but some of our
Friends in <hi>England;</hi> however it is possible that
through a mistake, some had put the said
Letters unto them. And though <hi>I. A.</hi> seemeth
not a little offended that these Queries should
be directed for one or all of the Ministers in
<hi>Scotland</hi> to Answer, as if such a direction
did argue both the Arrogance and weakness
of the Authors; yet I do not believe that they
all can Answer them sufficiently, holding to
Scripture, without renouncing their former
Principles in great part. Far less is this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Examination of <hi>I. A.</hi> any sufficient
Answer unto them, as the sequel I hope shall
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60394:15"/>
make appear. In his Survey or Examination
of the first Query, he alledgeth, <hi>That the
Questionist doth pervert the whole state of the
Question, For,</hi> saith he, <hi>who ever heard that
the Church of</hi> Scotland, <hi>or any other Church,
made humane Arts and Sciences an Infallible
Rule to make a Minister of Christ? then they
should never have required more of any man in
order to his admission to that Office, but his alone
sufficient skill in</hi> Grammar <hi>and</hi> Logick, <hi>which
the Adversaries themselves know to be most
false.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I Answer, That not the <hi>Questionist</hi>
but <hi>I. A.</hi> doth pervert the state of the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for the Question was not, Whether <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi>
and <hi>Logick,</hi> and the many Tongues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
was the only infallible Rule to make a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of Christ: but whether it was an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Rule, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now that may be conceived
to be an Infallible Ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, which is not the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Rule. Nor doth <hi>I. A.</hi> his consequence
follow, that then they should never have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
more of any man in order to his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to that Office, but his alone sufficient
skill in <hi>Grammar</hi> and <hi>Logick,</hi> an example in
other cases will show the weakness of this
Consequence. It is reported that <hi>Plato</hi> made it
an Infallible Rule to receive none into his
School, but he who had some skill in <hi>Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi>
doth it therefore follow, that he required
<pb facs="tcp:60394:16"/>
no more of any man, in order to his admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
to be his Scholar, but that he had some
skill in that Science. Another Instance may
be this, in divers Incorporations and Cities
it is an Infallible Rule, That none may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to be a Magistrate in the said City or
Incorporation, but he that is a Freeman there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
doth it therefore follow, that nothing is
more required of any man in order to his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Magistrate, but that he be a Freeman
in that City? Now suppose the Church of
<hi>Scotland</hi> make it not the one only Rule to
make a Minister of Christ, that he hath
<hi>Grammar, Logick,</hi> and the Languages, yet
it may be very fairly Queried I hope, whether
she makes it not an Infallible Rule? Seeing for
many years by-gone she hath made no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
but some as at least pretend to have
<hi>Grammar</hi> and <hi>Logick,</hi> and <hi>Languages,</hi> and
are called Masters of those Arts, (howbeit
many of them have but a very small scantling
of them for all the stress that seems to be laid
on them.) And I Query whether it be not one
of the Canons of the Church, that none be
admitted into the Office of the Ministry but
who have those aforesaid Arts? And if there
be no infallible or absolute Rule or Canon in
the case, then why do they not frequently al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
men, wanting those Arts, who possib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
may have all the other Qualifications
<pb facs="tcp:60394:16"/>
required, to enter into the Ministry. And
it is further Queried, Whether <hi>I. A.</hi> or the
Church that he doth own, doth establish and
avow that Doctrine of <hi>Iames Durhame,</hi> posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
asserted in his Commentary on the
<hi>Revelation,</hi> that <hi>Grammar Logick,</hi> or the like
acquired Arts, are necessary to the <hi>esse</hi> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Minister of Christ, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
much more necessary than true Piety and
Godliness, which he maketh only but neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to his <hi>bene esse</hi> or better being, and only
accidental to his being a Minister of Christ.
And this Question, which is indeed the main
design of the first Question, as is obvious to
any ordinary understanding, <hi>I. A.</hi> for all his
glorious pretence hath not in the least An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
which is therefore returned upon him
to be further considered.</p>
               <p>And whereas <hi>I. A.</hi> saith, <hi>That</hi> Grammar
<hi>and</hi> Logick <hi>are ordinary means of Knowledge,
exceedingly requisite in a Minister.</hi> If by <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi>
and <hi>Logick</hi> he mean not those innate gift<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
(which may be well called natural as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all men having the ordinary use of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
and which I acknowledge to be
in some degree necessary unto all) but the
Systems of those Arts, as they are artificially
composed of a great many Rules and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
and commonly taught in the Schools.
I ask <hi>I. A.</hi> Why are they more requisite in a
<pb facs="tcp:60394:17"/>
Minister, than in the rest of the Church?
Ought not all the Church to have the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God, and of the Principles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion as well as the Minister. And
may not some of the people come to have as
much true knowledge of God, as their
Teachers; yea, may they not become wiser
than their Teachers, as <hi>David</hi> said concerning
himself? and whereby did <hi>David</hi> become
wiser than his Teachers, was it by the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Arts of <hi>Grammar</hi> and <hi>Logick?</hi> I trow
not, but by the Law of God, wherein he did
meditate both day and night. May not
therefore people come to have as much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God at this day, without those
aforesaid Arts, only by meditating in the said
Law or Word, and praying to the Lord, as
also waiting upon the Lord to have their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings
more and more opened, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the Scriptures, as <hi>I. A.</hi> hath, with all
the help of his Arts? And if <hi>I. A.</hi> think that
those Arts are necessary to attain Divine
Knowledge, so as he who wants them,
may not know as much of Divine things, as
he who has them, I am not of his mind,
nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> hope are many others in his Church,
who believe they may both know the Lord,
and daily grow in the knowledge of Him till
they have as much, and perhaps more of true
Divine Knowledge than <hi>I. A.</hi> ever had, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb facs="tcp:60394:17"/>
all <hi>I. A.</hi> his Arts, which he doth so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
magnifie.</p>
               <p>But <hi>I. A.</hi> saith, <hi>The Infallible rule to make
a Minister of Christ, is set down in</hi> 1 Tim. 3. <hi>and</hi>
Tit. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It is very well. But I cannot find in
these places, or any where else in all the
Scripture; that Artificial <hi>Grammar</hi> and <hi>Logick,</hi>
are made any one part of that Infallible Rule,
or that God hath any where appointed them,
as ordinary means of attaining Divine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
And if they be the ordinary means of
Divine knowledge; then it must needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that all who have the least measure of
true Divine knowledge, have also humane
Arts, or else they are extraordinarily taught;
none of which I judge <hi>I. A.</hi> will readily grant.
Now the Infallible rule set down by the
Apostle, in these places already cited, requireth,
<hi>That Bishops and Deacons</hi> (and consequently Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters)
<hi>should be blameless, sober, just, holy,
temperate:</hi> And I Query <hi>I: A.</hi> if this one only
qualification, <hi>viz. To be Holy,</hi> be as much
made an Infallible rule, to make a Minister of
Christ in the Church he owneth, as to have
<hi>Grammar,</hi> and <hi>Logick,</hi> and <hi>Tongues:</hi> And
how is this consistent with the foresaid
Doctrine, that real Holiness is not necessary
to the <hi>esse</hi> or being of a Minister of Christ?
For is not that which is the infallible rule, to
<pb facs="tcp:60394:18"/>
make a Minister of Christ necessary to his
very <hi>esse</hi> or being.</p>
               <p>In the following part of his Examination of
this first Query, <hi>I. A.</hi> doth further wrong the
people called <hi>Quakers, As if they did hold that</hi>
Grammar, Logick, <hi>and</hi> Languages, <hi>were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
among Christians:</hi> And upon this idle
and false Supposition, he disputeth for the
lawfulness of those Arts, which none of these
people, so far as I know, deny: And for a
proof to the contrary, that people have
Schools wherein <hi>Grammar,</hi> and the <hi>Langu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,</hi>
viz. <hi>Hebrew, Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> are Taught,
and some other Arts. Nor is it the use of
these things, but the abuse of them, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too great a stress upon them, that we op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
Nor do we deny, but <hi>Grammar, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,</hi>
and especially the knowledge of the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Languages, may be of good
use and service to him that is a Minister of
Christ in a subordinate and subservient way,
when he hath to do with men, especially that

contend against the Truth; such adversaries

none of those Arts, has more prevailed
<pb facs="tcp:60394:18"/>
against a Letter-learned Adversary many
times, than many Learned men have done,
whereof a famous instance is recorded to have
befallen at the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> where a simple
Lay-man convinced again-saying Philosopher
so called, when the Learned Bishops and
Doctors could nothing prevail upon him; the
which passage is at length recorded in <hi>Lucas
Osiander,</hi> his <hi>Epitome of the Church History,</hi>
Centur. 4.</p>
               <p>But the said <hi>I. A.</hi> seemeth to dispute, not
only for the lawfulness of <hi>Grammar</hi> and <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,</hi>
as they are Taught in Schools, but for
the absolute necessity of them, to a Minister
of Christ. For he saith, <hi>Would they then have
a Minister, not knowing how to Speak and
Write Sense.</hi> To which I Answer, And think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
he that none in all the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi>
knoweth how to Speak and Write Sense, but
they who have Learned the Art of <hi>Grammar.</hi>
I suppose there are many thousands in that
Church, who never Learned any Art of
<hi>Grammar,</hi> that have as good Sense, and can
both Speak and Write to as good Sense; at
least in their Mother Tongue, as <hi>I. A.</hi> and
perhaps to better too, if that Proverb hold
good, <hi>That an Ounce of Mother-wit, is worth a
Pound of Clergy.</hi> And do we not commonly
Learn to Speak and Write our Mother
Tongue, without any Rules of <hi>Grammar;</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:60394:19"/>
and these who so Learn to Speak and Write,
only by Reading and Hearing, without
Rules of <hi>Grammar,</hi> speak well enough to be
understood. And what great or intollerable
defect is it, if a Minister of Christ, having suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
knowledge and Piety requisite to that
Office, should Speak or Write a little Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous
<hi>Grammar;</hi> doth or should that Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister
him? Is not a blemish or error in
Life and Conversation, much more intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
although such is the Vice of the Times,
whereof some good men have formerly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained,
that he who breaks a Rule of <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi>
is more noticed, than he who breaks
the Rule of Piety.</p>
               <p>Nor doth the Translation of the Scriptures
out of <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> argue the absolute
nec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ssity of those Languages, unto the Ministers
of Christ; seeing men who are not Ministers,
might have done that: And now since the
Scriptures are Translated, (which we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is a great Blessing of God) the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of these Languages seemeth less ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
on a general account; seeing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
errors or weaknesses may be found in the
present Iranss<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they contain the form
of found words, in respect of the more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
things: And therefore the Scriptures
thus Translated to him, who is indued with
that Spirit that gave them forth, may well
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60394:19"/>
enough suffice, though he hath neither <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi>
nor <hi>Greek:</hi> Which for all this pretended
necessity, the far greatest part of those called
Ministers in these three Nations have not so
much skill of, but that they are as much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to the Translation as many others that
make no such Vaunt. And it is a great que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion;
for all this pretended necessity of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi>
and <hi>Greek,</hi> whether many called Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
in these three Nations, ever once in
all their life Read an intire Chapter of the
Bible in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> or indeed can so do: And
I see no cause why there is any more abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
necessity for a Preacher to have <hi>Hebrew</hi>
and <hi>Greek</hi> than any ordinary true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian;
for if true Faith, Knowledge and Piety,
can be attained as well without <hi>Hebrew</hi> and
<hi>Greek,</hi> as with it, then why is it made abs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>lutely
necessary in the one, rather than in the
other. Nor do we plead against the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or good use that may be made of Tongues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
because they began at <hi>Babel,</hi> as <hi>I. A.</hi> doth
alledge; but seeing they began at <hi>Babel,</hi> or
<hi>Babylon,</hi> we may lawfully infer, they are
not absolutely necessary to give the true
knowledge of God, nor to make true
Preachers, seeing there were men that did
both truly know the Lord, and also Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him in Truth, before the many Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages
came in. Nor is <hi>I. A.</hi> his Argument
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60394:20"/>
for the necessity of <hi>School-Logick</hi> less imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.
<hi>He that knows nothing</hi> (saith he) <hi>how to
define, divide, judge and Argument aright (if
any such were) is in no better capacity, than the
Ass speaking to his Master: Take there</hi> (saith
he) <hi>the</hi> Quakers <hi>Minister, very fit for</hi> Balaam'<hi>s
Sadle, if he had but four Legs. Ignorance I see
is the Mother of the</hi> Quakers <hi>Devotion.</hi> By this
Argument <hi>I. A.</hi> (as it seemeth) concludes,
that all men who want <hi>School-Logick,</hi> are no
more men, and have no more the use of their
Rational Faculties, to define, divide, judge
and Argument aright, than <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Ass;
and thus he puts many thousands, and ten
thousands of his Fellow-Church-Members in
the same List with <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Ass, and maketh
them as unskilsul to define, divide, judge and
Argument aright, as <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Ass, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they want <hi>School-Logick.</hi> And is this a
Vindication of the Church of <hi>Brittain,</hi> so to
defame the greatest part of all her Members,
by comparing them to <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Ass, only
for want of <hi>School-Logick,</hi> which I suppose
scarce the hundreth person has any knowledge
of? Indeed I confess, it hath been but too fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
for such men, to repute the people as
Asses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for want of those <hi>School-Arts;</hi> and
they have but too much used them in
times past as Asses, and also Rid upon them.
But whether is not <hi>I. A.</hi> short of <hi>Balaam</hi>'s
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60394:20"/>
Ass, which saw the Angel of God, and had
its mouth immediatly opened by the Lord to
reprove the Prophet; to none of which <hi>I. A.</hi>
hath any pretence. and why doth <hi>I. A.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
<hi>That Ignorance is the Mother of the</hi>
Quakers <hi>Devotion?</hi> Because they have not
commonly <hi>School-Logick,</hi> and judge it not
absolutely necessary to any Christian, or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
of Christ. Then by <hi>I. A.</hi> his Irronical
and Sarcasme, none have true Devotion, but
these who have <hi>School-Logick;</hi> the which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
striketh as much against his own
Church Members as us. And I suppose there
are many thousands in the so called Church
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that may think <hi>I. A.</hi> deserves a
sharp reproof, for such an idle Satyr, as to
conclude, because we establish not <hi>School-Logick</hi>
as necessary<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to Devotion, <hi>That
therefore Ignorance</hi> (according to us) <hi>is
the Mother of Devotion.</hi> When the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi>
blame the <hi>Papists</hi> for holding Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to be the Mother of Devotion, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
they mean the ignorance of the
Scriptures, and principles of Religion, and
not of <hi>School-Logick,</hi> which men may either
have or want, and yet be truly Devout: And
for all this scorn of <hi>I. A.</hi> I shall mind him of
what <hi>Augustine</hi> observed above 12 hundred
years ago, <hi>Surgunt indocti, &amp; indoctae, &amp; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piunt

and women arise and take the Kingdom from us
who are the Learned:</hi> Which may well at least
be applyed against them, who glory in their
Artificial Learning, and set it up higher than
it doth deserve. And said <hi>Paul,</hi> to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
as well to the Preachers among them

how that not many wise men after the flesh,</hi> &amp;c.

according to <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine, God had not
chosen many such either to be Christians or
Ministers. Moreover, whereas <hi>I. A.</hi> pleadeth
for the great commendation of Humane

from <hi>Isaiah</hi> 50. 4. and 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
for him to prove, that these places
are to be understood of such kind of Learning,
which I deny; and on the contrary affirm,
it is Divine and Supernatural Learning, which
is there to be understood. As to <hi>Isaiah</hi> 29.
v. 12. 14. I grant that it is meant of human<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Learned; but it maketh clearly against
him, seeing the Vision was a Sealed Book,

Again, whereas he saith, <hi>The Quakers have
often Objected to him against the lawfulness of

among Heathens;</hi> and then he scoffingly doth
inquire, <hi>But what shall we do with the Isle of</hi>

Anwer, that I suppose it is <hi>I. A.</hi> his mistake,
or failure of memory, that the Quakers have
ever Objected against the lawfulness of true
Logick, which I know none to be against;
only I judge it may be well argued, that see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it was a thing used among the Heathens,
and yet did not bring them to the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God; nor can it bring any Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
thereunto now. And it seemeth unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
that any Art found or used among
the Heathens should be made an Infallible
Rule to make a Minister of Christ. Or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
if any of those called Quakers have
Disputed against Logick, it hath been only
against that falsly so called, <hi>viz.</hi> a Sophistical
way of contending about any thing, for or
against, which is too much used in Schools at
this day, and wherein too many glory, and
are puffed up. But <hi>I. A.</hi> his comparison be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Isle of <hi>Brittain</hi> and School Logick is
very unequal, else let him prove that his
School-Logick is as necessary, and profitable
to the life of man, as the Land of <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>

Again, whereas in Answer to the Instances
of <hi>Elisha, Amos, Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> who were
not bred up in <hi>Grammar</hi> and <hi>Logick,</hi> and yet
were true Min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sters, he alledgeth, <hi>It is no good
consequence to argue from an extraordinary fact
to an ordinary fixed Rule;</hi> I Answer, he hath not
as yet proved that it is any ordinary fixed
Rule by the Lord, that all must have those
Arts of School-Logick and Grammar who
are Ministers of Christ. He but here beggeth
the Question, as it's ordinary for him to do in
other cases. And as for us, we judge it no
tempting of God, nor looking for extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries
to believe that we may receive true
knowledge, and grow up in the same, so far
as is requisite for a true Preacher to have, by
our diligent reading and meditating on the
Scriptures, by the help of God's Spirit assisting
us to understand them, and withal using fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
Prayer unto God, to obtain the said help
of His Spirit, although we neither use the Art
of Grammar or Logick; and we find not that
<hi>Paul</hi> recommended <hi>Timothy</hi> to give atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
to those Arts, but only to Reading, <hi>viz.</hi>
the Scriptures, and not to neglect the gift that
was in him, which I suppose <hi>I. A.</hi> will not be
so ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h as to say, was either Grammar or Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick.
And now after diverse abuses and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions
of <hi>I. A.</hi> in his examination of this
first Question, he concludeth with another
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60394:22"/>
great calumny and false charge, in saying,
<hi>The Quakers alledge that</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> John <hi>had
no Grammar and Languages,</hi> whereas the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
doth only alledge, <hi>That</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> John
<hi>were not bred up in Grammar and Languages,</hi>
which doth not hinder it to be true, that God
afterwards did immediately inspire them with
the gift of Tongues. And yet even before
they were inspired with these Tongues, they
were Ministers.</p>
               <p>In his Survey or Examination of the second
Query, he continueth to play his old Game of
perverting the state of the Question, which is
not (as the Reader may see) whether Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,
Logick, and Philosophy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
in the World before Christ his coming in
the Flesh, for that we readily acknowledge;
but the Question is, <hi>How long it was, after
Christ, that those Arts were set up to make Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of Christ;</hi> To this he gives no Reply,
but only goeth on to prove the lawfulness of
Philosophy, and to tell what it teacheth.
Now, as for true and genuine Philosophy the
Quakers deny it not to be lawful, even that
commonly called Natural Philosophy, which
is a knowledge of natural things, and the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
thereof, with their effects; but that
which they oppose is to make such a natural
knowledge, so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ar as it is only an Art taught
in the Schools absolutely necessary to make a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60394:23"/>
Minister of Christ. Again, <hi>Secondly,</hi> We
Question much, Whether that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
taught in Schools, among those called
Christians, under the name of Philosophy,
be indeed the true and genuine Natural Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,
seeing the far greatest part of it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded
and rejected by not a few of the more
knowing among your selves, and if any of
us have called Philosophy, Foolosophy and
Witchcraft, as <hi>I. A.</hi> alledgeth they did not
mean it of any true Natural Knowledge, but in
the Apostlessence, when he saith, <hi>Beware lest any
spoil you through Philosophy, and vain deceit;</hi>
which <hi>I. A.</hi> confesseth is Sophisticate and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Philosophy. And dare he say there is
none of that sophisticate and corrupt Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
taught in the Schools and Universities in
<hi>Brittain.</hi> And may not sophisticate and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Philosophy be called Witchcraft in that
sence used by <hi>Paul, Gal. 3. O foolish Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
who hath bewitched you.</hi> And I Query
what Philosophy doth <hi>I. A.</hi> mean by the
true and genuine Philosophy, which he
maketh so necessary to every Minister of
Christ, whether <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Philosophy, or the
<hi>Cartesian,</hi> or any other, seeing there are many
kinds of that called Philosophy in the World,
whose principles and rules directly contradict
one another. And the Schools in <hi>Christend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m</hi>
to this day have not agreed in the common
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60394:23"/>
principles and Rules of that called Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
but remain at great uncertainty in the
very foundations of it, as is acknowledged,
by the most ingenuous Professors thereof.
Now to make a thing so uncertain (as their
Philosophy is in many or most things, to wit,
a fallible thing) an infallible Rule to make a
Minister of the Infallible Truth, is a very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
and unreasonable matter. But <hi>I. A.</hi>
giveth us a number of Thirteen or Fourteen
Positions, which his School-Philosophy doth
teach, the truth whereof is evident as that
there is a God, who is Infinite, Eternal, Omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nt,
Omnipotent, Unchangeable; that every
man is a Rational Creature; that the Soul of
man is Immortal; that no Brute is a Man; that
no Action can be without some Subject, nor
without some effect; nor any Union without
some extremes. But I suppose there are few
men, if any that have but the right use of their
understanding as men, that do not, or may
not know all this without School-Philosophy,
as well as <hi>I. A.</hi> doth with it. And then what
advantage giveth his Philosophy unto him?
But toere are other great matters which his
Philosophy teacheth; and as he particularly
describeth them? they are these following,
<hi>That every thing either is, or is not; that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oth be, and not be at once; that of
every contradiction the one part is true, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60394:24"/>
the other false; that every whole is more than
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> part, that every Cause is prior in nature to its
effect, that nothing can work before it exist.</hi>
But I must tell <hi>I. A.</hi> that these last mentioned
Positions, are not taught by Philosophy, and
are not any part of Philosophy, as is generally
acknowledged by the Professors of it; because
they are first Principles which Philosophy doth
not undertake to teach, but presupposeth
them as already known and understood, by
the common dictates of understanding, that is
in all men; and are called by them <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
common Sentiments or Principles; and
therefore we still desiderate, what peculiar
Misteries <hi>I. A.</hi> his Philosophy doth teach,
that men of ordinary understanding doth not
already know, or at least may know very
easily by a simple reflection, without his Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
or School-Craft. Not that I deny,
but that there are divers things which the
true genuine Philosophy may teach, that are
not obvious to common understanding; but
I find nothing asserted by <hi>I. A.</hi> in all these
positions, which he giveth as instances
of what Philosophy teacheth, but every
ordinary Tradesman knoweth as well to be
true, as <hi>I. A.</hi> And therefore he might have
spared his Pains in that idle and unnecessary
work.</p>

<hi>That the Words of the Scripture are, and ought

here, is, not whether the Scriptures figurative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as by a <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> or <hi>Metonymie,</hi> may not
be called the Word, for which I shall not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,

Translated into <hi>English [the Word</hi>] is used
sometimes in Scripture to signifie either Words
or Writings, as <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 1. the Treatise Writ
by <hi>Luke,</hi> he calleth it, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
which is to say in <hi>English,</hi> the first Word or
Speech: Also where <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Our Gospel
came unto you, not in Word only, but in
Power,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Thess:</hi> 1. 5. And some other
places may be found both in the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New
Testament</hi> to that effect, which yet doth in
nothing give to <hi>I. A.</hi> nor to any of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries,
the least advantage against us. For
the Question is, what is properly the Word
God, or the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. That which is
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60394:25"/>
most properly and eminently that Word of
God, so much mentioned in the Scripture,
with its wonderful effects; and that the
Letter is not properly the Word of God, is as
evidently apparent, as that the Writing or
Written Letter of a mans Speech, is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
the words of a mans Mouth; for we
commonly distinguish betwixt a mans Word
and his Write. How much more ought we
to distinguish betwixt the outward Letter and
Writing, and the Word of God in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
sense, seeing God is an invisible Spirit,
and so is his Word: And what he hath
spoke by his Prophets or Apostles, he spoke it
first in their Hearts and Mouths, before there
was any Declaration of it in Writ; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
it was the Word of God, before the
Writing: And therefore the Writing is not
the Word properly, but only figuratively,
as when a part is put for the whole, by a
<hi>Synecdoche,</hi> or when the sign is put for the
thing signified, as a Map of <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Scotland,</hi> is commonly called <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Scotland?</hi> and yet none will say, that that
Map is really <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Scotland;</hi> or when
we hear that <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> produceth
such and such Fruits, who is so ignorant as to
think, that the Map or Card, produceth
these Fruits, and not the Land it self. Let
<hi>I. A.</hi> know therefore, that in all the places
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60394:25"/>
where the Word is mentioned, he must
prove that the Letter of the Scripture is
meant, or he doth nothing against us; the
which I am sure he shall never be able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
seeing he grants himself, <hi>That some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
at least, by the Word is meant Christ, and
not the Letter.</hi> Moreover, I ask <hi>I. A.</hi> when
he saith, <hi>The Scripture is the Word of God,</hi>
what he meaneth by the term <hi>Scripture</hi>
Doth he mean the only bare Writing, or
Characters consisting of Ink and Paper; and
will he say that is properly the Word of God?
Or doth he mean the Doctrine expressed and
signified by the said Writing and Characters,
and the true sense and meaning of the Spirit
of God held forth in the same, which <hi>Meto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymically</hi>
may be called the Scripture, putting
the thing signified for the sign (and thus the
Doctrine may be called the Scripture, and the
Scripture the Doctrine, to wit, by a twofold
<hi>Metonymie,</hi> one where the thing signified is
put for the sign, the other where the sign is
put for the thing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ied.)</p>
               <p>Now we do most willingly grant that the
Doctrine and true sense or mind of the Spirit
declared of or expressed in the Scripture, is,
and may properly be called the Word of
God. But then we further affirm, that the
said Doctrine or true sense of the mind or
Spirit, cannot be reached or attained unto by
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60394:26"/>
the meer Reading or Hearing the Letter, o
the bare meditating in the Letter; and there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fore
not every one that hath the Letter,
Preacheth the Letter, and Heareth the Letter,
hath also the true Doctrine and mind of the
Spirit, and consequently nor hath he the
Word of God. But he only that receiveth
the Spirit of Christ, or Christ the Lord who is
that Spirit, receiveth the true Doctrine when
he Readeth or Heareth the Scriptures, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditateth
in them, and consequently he only
receiveth the Word of God: And thus also
none can Preach the true Doctrine and Word
of God, but he who speaketh it by the Spirit
of God; and none Heareth the Word of
God, but he who Heareth it, and into the
Heart and inward Ears of his inward man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
it by the Spirit of God. To these only,
I say, the Doctrine is known, and by these
it is only received, as it is indeed the Word
of God; and in this respect it was, that <hi>Paul</hi>
commended such as received the Truth, by the
same Spirit by which it was Preached unto
them through him; <hi>That they received it not
as the word of Man, but as the Word of God,</hi> &amp;c.
Now this comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ndation can be given to no
unbeliever, that what he receiveth in the
Ministry of the true Servants of God, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
it as the Word of God; for only the
true Believers do so receive it, according to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60394:26"/>
                  <hi>Paul</hi>'s Testimony, as it is indeed the Word of
God. Moreover, I would have the Reader
to know, that when we say, by the Word,
is understood Christ; we mean not Christ
abstractly, or seperately considered from the
Divine Doctrine and Testimony of Life,
whether in the heart or Mouth, that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
proceedeth from him, nor yet as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
or seperated from any Divine opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Spirit, Power and Life in any of
his Servants; but we take both these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
together, to be the Word of God,
even as the Soul and Body is one Man, and
sometimes the Soul is called the man, and
sometimes the Body, and both properly
enough, when the Soul is in the Body and
united therewith, but the Body alone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Soul, is not properly called the man;
and thus much I hope shall suffice, to satisfie
the sober Reader, as concerning the Word of
God, how we understand it. Now whereas
<hi>I. A.</hi> citeth divers places of Scripture to prove,
<hi>That by the Word of God is not understood Christ,
but the outward Testimony or Writing of the
Scriptures.</hi> It is very evident, and may plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appear so to be unto any having the least
measure of Spiritual understanding, that by
the Word of God in these Scriptures, is not
understood the Letter, but Christ, together
with the Divine operation and Testimony
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60394:27"/>
of his Life in the Hearts and Mouthes of his
Servants. And among these places by him
alledged, I shall cite these following (for it is
needless to cite them all) <hi>viz. Heb. 4. 12. Eph.
6. 17. Rev. 1. 16. Rev. 2. 12, 16. Rev.</hi> 19. 15.
And also he citeth divers Scriptures which
mention the Word of Christ, and the Word
which he hath spoken. And seeing that
cannot be Christ himself, it must needs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>according
to him be the Letter. Now as to
that Scripture <hi>Heb. 4. 12. For the Word of
God is quick and powerful,</hi> &amp;c. There are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<hi>Protestants</hi> that expound it of Christ, and
not of the Letter; and indeed the words
themselves do plainly enough evince it, seeing
it is said in the next verse, concerning the
same Word, <hi>That all things are bare and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
to his sight;</hi> and therefore that Word hath
an Omni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cience, which I suppose <hi>I. A.</hi> when
he considers, will not affirm of the Letter of
the Scripture. As for <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 17. his reason
is weak, that by it cannot be understood
Christ, seeing it is called, <hi>The Sword of the
Spirit;</hi> as to say, an Instrument in the hand
of the Spirit. But this is only <hi>I. A.</hi> his gloss,
and not <hi>Paul</hi>'s words; <hi>For the Sword of the
Spirit,</hi> may very well be understood to be
the Spirit it self, <hi>As the shield of Faith, is
Faith</hi> that shield, <hi>The Helmet of Hope,</hi> is Hope
that Helmet, so the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> is <hi>Rome</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:60394:27"/>
that City; and why not also the <hi>Sword of the
Spirit,</hi> that Spirit it self: And this is further
confirmed out of the <hi>Greek</hi> Article, <hi>Englished</hi>
by [which] that is in the <hi>Neuter Gender,</hi> and
therefore rendring this Sense, <hi>The Sword of
the Spirit, which Spirit is the Word of God,</hi> so
that the Article [which] being in the <hi>Neuter
Gender,</hi> is <hi>Relative</hi> to Spirit, which in the
<hi>Greek</hi> Language is in the same <hi>gender.</hi> Again,
as to those three places in the <hi>Revelation,</hi>
which mention the Word of God; its being
<hi>the Sword of his Mouth, and proceeding out of
the Mouth of Christ:</hi> Doth <hi>I. A.</hi> think,
that this only is the Letter of the Scripture?
Doth nothing but the Letter come out of his
Mouth? Doth not Spirit and Life, and living
vertue come out of his Mouth? And did not
Christ say, <hi>The Words that I speak unto you,
they are Spirit and Life,</hi> John 6. And is not
this somewhat more than the Letter? But
lastly, The Word of Christ, and the Word
that Christ speaks, hath of the Life and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Christ in it; and therefore it is still
somewhat beside the External Writing or
Letter, and is not divided or seperated from
Christ. And I have told <hi>I. A.</hi> already, that
not only Christ abstractly considered, but the
immediate Testimony and influence of his
Life (which can never be seperated from him,
no more than the <hi>Sun</hi> Beams can be seperated
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60394:28"/>
from the Son) is also acknowledged by us
to be the Word of God, and to be Light and
Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t,</hi> saith <hi>I. A. The whole Doctrine of the
Prophets, is the Word of the Lord;</hi> To which
I Answer, I have granted, and do still grant
it so to be, but as is already said, that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
is not the bare Letter; nor hath every
one that doctrine who hath the Letter; for
to have the true doctrine and sence of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t,
is not only to have the Letter, but to have
the Spirit, by which only the true doctrine
can be conveyed unto us, although the true
service and use of the Letter, in subordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the Spirit is not denied.</p>
               <p>And whereas <hi>I. A.</hi> accuseth the Quakers,
<hi>That they call the Scriptures a dead Letter,</hi> I
no where remember that ever I read or heard
any of them simply calling it so. But only
in so far as it is eventually such unto them,
who are spiritually dead themselves, and are
not turned to the quickning Spirit, but alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
therefrom, to such only the Scripture is
a dead and killing Letter, and this much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Protestants have acknowledged as well as
we, and particularly <hi>Iohn Owen,</hi> in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
on the Scriptures, <hi>That it is so to the Iews,
and other Vnbelievers.</hi> But unto all those who
are spiritually alive, the Scripture is no dead
nor killing Letter, but a living Testimony; as
<pb facs="tcp:60394:28"/>
also unto all such whom it pleased God to
quicken by his Spirit in the reading, or hearing
or meditating in the Scriptures. Again that he
saith, <hi>A part of the Scripture, to wit, the
Law considered, as strictly legal is in respect of
guilty sinners called a killing Letter, but never
the whole Scripture;</hi> I Answer, That not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Old Testament, but even the Writings
or Letter of the New Testament, may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a killing Letter to those that remain alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
from the Spirit that quickens. Lven as
<hi>Origen</hi> hath formerly taught in his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
on <hi>Leviticus, Not only</hi> (saith he) <hi>in the
Old Testament is found the killing Letter; there
is also in the New Testament the Letter which
killeth him, who doth not spiritually attend unto
the things which are spoken.</hi> And why was
the Law called a killing Letter? only because
it did curse and condemn guilty sinners. Nay,
that is not the only or main reason, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that its Ministration could not give life,
whereas the Ministration of the Gospel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
accompanied with the Spirit, doth quicken
and give life; and in that respect <hi>Paul</hi> said,
<hi>The Law was weak and could no make perfect,</hi>
and therefore calls it, <hi>The Law of a carnal
Commandment.</hi> Now if any go from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that only makes the true Gospel Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
and set up the Letter or Writings of
the Apostles, in the room of the same. These

Writings of the Apostles do eventually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a killing Letter, no less than that of the
Law, and can no more give life, or make
perfect, than the outward Law could.</p>
               <p>And here upon this Head, I do readily take
notice what <hi>I. A.</hi> acknowledgeth concerning
the Scriptures in <hi>page</hi> 16. of his Book, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the middle part, <hi>viz, That the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
as to the external Form and Mode, which
they have from the Writers Pen, they are not
the Word of God, but that as to their ennutiate
doctrine and sentence they are the Word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And why then doth <hi>I. A.</hi> make all this
loud clamour and noise against the Quakers,
seeing upon the matter he confesseth what they
say, <hi>viz. That the letter or external form of
the Writing is not properly the Word of God.</hi>
And I suppose I may add with <hi>I. A</hi> his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance,
that the external Form and Mode
of the Preachers mouth, when he formeth a
sound in speaking Scripture Words, is not
properly the Word of God any more than
the bare writing, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>seeing there is no more in
the one than in the other, simply as such.
Let not <hi>I. A.</hi> therefore blame us for that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
which he confesseth himself; and we
do as readily acknowledge, as he either doth
or can do, <hi>That the ennutiate and expressed
Doctrine and sense of the Spirit is indeed truly
and properly the Word of God.</hi> But then is
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60394:29"/>
there no difference betwixt him and us? I
Answer, as to the naming the Scriptures, the
Word, it seemeth there is none. But yet
another great Controversie ariseth, which I
doubt will not be so soon ended betwixt us,
<hi>viz. Whether any man can reach unto that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>te
Doctrine and sense of the Scriptures
without the Spiritual Illumination and Assistance
of that Spirit that gave them forth?</hi> we say
<hi>Not;</hi> and if he say <hi>Yea,</hi> we still differ;
but not as it seemeth to me by his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
in naming the Scriptures, <hi>The Word
of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there is yet another great Charge
wherewith he loadeth us in this his Survey
of the Third Query, <hi>Some Quakers,</hi> saith he,
<hi>are upon this Head so grosly Atheistical, as to
say, That the Scriptures are but the Saints
Words and Testimony from their own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
experiences.</hi> And again he alledgeth,
<hi>That according to the Quakers, they are but
the meer bare Word of a Creature.</hi> Hence
he inferreth, <hi>That the Pen-men of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turs,
of all men in the World, must have
been the greatest Cheats and archest Impostors,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>But seeing he produceth no express Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
out of the Writings of that People,
for such Assertions he is not to be believed.
Nor doth it follow, that because the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb facs="tcp:60394:30"/>
are the Saints Words, that therefore
they are not also the Words of God, even
unto all who hear or read them; at least
mediately and remotely; although none but
such as believe, do receive them as such,
which yet is only and alone the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ault of those
unbelieving persons, because they reject the
Spirit of God that doth certifie or assure unto
us, <hi>That the Scriptures are proceeded from
God by Divine Inspiration.</hi> And what if some
have said, <hi>That the Scriptures are Testimonies
of the Saints, from their experience.</hi> May not
this receive a fair and charitable construction,
and not presently be judged to be gross
Atheism; for although the Scriptures give a
narration of divers Histories, as also of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
Prohibitions, and mysteries of Faith,
<hi>As Christ His coming in the Flesh; His being
born of a Virgin; His being Crucified, and
Buried; His Resurrection, and Ascension;</hi> the
which Histories, and things aforementioned,
albeit they cannot properly be called the
<hi>Saints Experiences,</hi> yet the <hi>Divine Inspiration</hi>
and <hi>Revelation,</hi> which the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>
had immediately of those things, was
truly their <hi>Experience;</hi> and let us see if <hi>I. A.</hi>
will deny it; or if he do, may it not be more
justly retorted upon him, <hi>That he, and not
the Quakers, deny that the Scriptures are from
Divine Inspiration;</hi> or can he say, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60394:30"/>
the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles</hi> had <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Inspiration</hi> and <hi>Immediate Revelation,</hi>
yet they had no <hi>Experience</hi> of the same.
And that we call the Scriptures, sometimes,
the <hi>Saints Words</hi> (yet not denying them in
a true sense to be the <hi>Words of God) I. A.</hi>
can no more justly blame us than <hi>Paul</hi> and
<hi>Iohn</hi> who called their own Preaching and
Writing, and that of their Brethren, the
Witness and Teaching of men; so that <hi>Paul</hi>
and the Apostles Words were both the words
of men, and yet also the Words of God,
to wit, mediately declared unto them by
the Apostles. Now they whose Faith stood
in the Power of God, received them, as the
Words of God, but who came not to that
power to believe in it, they were but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
such as the words of men, which, as is
al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eady said, was only and alone the fault of
such unbelieving Persons.</p>
               <p>There yet remains two parts or branches
of the third Query, to which <hi>I. A.</hi> for all
his pretended Survey, hath given no more sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
than to any of the former. The
first is, <hi>Whether all that is written in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
from</hi> Genesis <hi>to</hi> Revelation, <hi>be a Rule
of Faith and Manners.</hi> To this he only answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in general, <hi>That we are bound to believe all
S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ripture Enunciation, from the beginning to the

e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d</hi> (which we do readily grant, and that
therefore it may well be called an Historical
Rule of Faith) <hi>and that the Moral Law, with
whatsoever is of common equity, or whatever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning
any peice of Religious Worship under the</hi>
New Testament <hi>doth belong to Christians of our
Calling and Condition; but that the obligation
of the Ceremonial and Iudicial Law is totally
abrogated: And</hi> (saith he) <hi>the</hi> Quakers <hi>must be
content with these generals.</hi> To which I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
When the Nature of the Question re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
a particular Answer, to Answer in
general, neither can nor ought to satisfie; for
notwithstanding of all he hath said, the great
Question yet remains unanswered. What
parts of the Scripture belong to the Moral
Law, and what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o the Ceremonial and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
so called. Also seeing there are divers
things that were commanded and practised by
the Apostles and Primitive Christians under
the <hi>New Testament;</hi> whether all these do oblige
us now, yea or nay; as for example, the
Washing one anothe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Feet, and Anointing
the Sick with Oyl; and whether these actions
were commanded by any part of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
or Judicial Law, or whether they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to any piece of Religious Worship un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>New Testament.</hi> The other branch of
the Question is, <hi>Whether every Title from</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>to the</hi> Revelation <hi>be the Word, or Words
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60394:31"/>
of God.</hi> To this he Answereth affirmatively,
and seemeth, to be so offended with the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
as if it did conclude, <hi>That the</hi> Quakers
<hi>judge, that the Scriptures are interpolated and
corrupted with the additions of men.</hi> But in
Answer, <hi>I. A.</hi> ought to know, that to Query
a thing, will not conclude that the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionist
doth positively affim or deny what is
Queried. Again, I hope it may without
offence, not only be Queried, but also conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the Translations of the Scripture
(the which Translations are commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed
Scripture) have divers additions, which
men have added, without any pretence to
Divine Inspiration: The which Additions are
commonly Printed in our <hi>English</hi> Bibles, in
another Character than the other words.
Now is it any Crime to ask if these Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions
be the words of God, or only the
words of man; and if such Additions be any
part of the Rule of Faith and Manners? And
yet those very Additions are of such conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
that they may occasion the Reader
to take up another sense of the Sentences,
then otherwise he would, or perhaps the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God did really intend. Nor are there
wanting divers, both Judicious and Learned
men so accounted, and of good repute, even
among <hi>Protestants,</hi> who do acknowledge,
that some particular words have dropt in,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60394:32"/>
into the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> Texts, since their
first Writing, and what are these various
Lections of many places of Scripture, especially
when they contradict in one and the same
place? Are not some of them at least only
the words of men? All which being gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
yet do not hinder, but that the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Scriptures is sufficiently pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
(<hi>viz.</hi> in respect of the main and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
things) for which we have cause to
bless God, and acknowledge his great care and
Providence, as in many other things. And
thus <hi>I. A.</hi> may see how much of the weighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
part of his task, in giving a sufficient An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to those Queries, he hath still left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
for all his windy Braggings against the
people called <hi>Quakers.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="chapter">
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:60394:32"/>
               <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
               <p>IN his pretended Survey of the fourth
Query, he divides it into three Sections:
In the first, he laboureth by many Arguments
to prove a thing, which we do not deny,
to wit, <hi>That the Scriptures are a Rule of Faith
and Manners:</hi> And so he might have spared
himself and others, all that pains, for the
state of the Question is not, whether the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are not, and may not be called a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary
Rule; nor whether they may not
in respect of all the Historical part, be called
an Historical Rule: But the true Question is,
whether the words of the Scripture, as they
are only written and spoken outwardly, be
the Principal, or only Rule of Faith and
Manners.</p>
               <p>Now seeing <hi>I. A.</hi> hath been at such need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
pains, to prove a thing against us, which
we do not deny, I need not give a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Answer to any of his Arguments. But
because there are divers of his Arguments,
which have some false premisses, although
the conclusion be granted; therefore I shall a
little take notice of one or two of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:60394:33"/>
In his seventh Argument, he maketh it one
of the Premisses, <hi>That the more sure word of
Prophecy, mentioned</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 19, 20. <hi>is the
Scripture.</hi> But this is denyed by us, for we
believe it to be that Word of God in the
heart, by which all the true Prophets did
Prophecy, and without which we cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
their Prophecies, nor any other
part of the Scripture. Now the reasons of
his Assertion are, 1. Because of the cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of 19 and 20 Verses. But this is no suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
reason, for the coherence is as good and
better, to understand it of the word in the
heart, as to understand <hi>Peter</hi> saying thus,
<hi>Take heed to the Word of God in your hearts, by
which the Prophets gave forth the Scriptures,
for it is that same word, which maketh us sure,
that the Scriptures are Divinely Inspired, and
also doth give unto us the true Interpretation of
them:</hi> This is a good coherence and much
better then that imagined by <hi>I. A.</hi> as if <hi>Peter</hi>
had said, <hi>Take heed unto the Scripture, as the
more sure Word, for no Scripture is of any
private interpretation:</hi> The which violent and
strained coherence, I for my part cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
seeing <hi>Peter</hi> aimeth at something
that is not the Scripture, as being necessary to
give us its Interpretation: And what can that
be, <hi>But that Word of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>od, which spake in the
Prophets.</hi> His second reason is, <hi>That he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb facs="tcp:60394:33"/>
understand how the Dictate or Light within
is more sure, than Gods immediate voice from
Heaven, as that was at the Transfiguration.</hi> To
which I Answer, that the inward Voice or
Word of God immediately in the heart, can
very well be understood to be more sure as to
us, than any outward Voice of God from
Heaven. 1. Because that which is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
in the Heart, is more near and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate,
than that which is outward in the
Air, which cometh to the Heart and Soul,
but mediately through the outward Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;
however immediate may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
otherwise. 2. It was by the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Word of God in the Heart, by which
the Prophets, when at any time they heard
an outward Voice or Word from God, did
assuredly know that it came from God, and
that it was no delusion of Satan. And they
believed the Word of God in their Hearts,
simply from its own self Evidence, and not
from any borrowed Evidence of an outward
Voice: For they oft believed, and received
the Word of God in their Hearts immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
when they heard no outward voice at all,
as is generally acknowledged. And this
inward or intellectual kind of speaking by the
Lord unto the Prophets, is acknowledged by
<hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> and <hi>Suarez,</hi> and other School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
to be the most noble kind of Divine
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60394:34"/>
Revelation, and consequently the most sure,
at least unto us. His 3. Reason, <hi>Is the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of other Scriptures produced, and to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</hi>
But he has neither produced, nor can
produce any Scripture that proveth, that
Word of Prophecy, or Prophetical Word,
to be only the Letter of the Scripture, and
not the Word or Light of God, and of
Christ in the Heart.</p>
               <p>Again in his eighth Argument, he alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<hi>That it cannot be the Dictate or Light
within, by which Spirits are to be tryed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Dictate or Light within is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>allible:</hi> And
this he undertakes to prove, from some words
of mine in <hi>Quakerism no Popery,</hi> where I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
<hi>That it is possible for us to mistake
and erre in Speaking and Writing (and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in Examining and Iudging) if we be not duely
watchful.</hi> But how unreasonable this conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
is, I leave unto sober men to judge;
as to conclude, because men are infallible, that
therefore the Dictate and Light of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in men is fallible also. Was not <hi>Peter</hi> fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
in some Cases; <hi>Yea,</hi> did he not fail sore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
when he denyed his Master: Doth it
therefore follow, that the Dictate or Light of
Gods Spirit in him was fallible? Indeed if
I had said, that when we follow the Dictate
and Light of God within, we are fallible,
he might have inferred such a consequence;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60394:34"/>
but I never said, nor thought any such thing,
but on the contrary, that the Dictates and
Leadings of Gods Spirit in us are infallible,
and have a direct tendency to lead, guide and
move us infallibly, as they are purely kept
unto, the which is possible for us to do. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Argument he bringeth against the Dictate
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>; <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s being the rule to try Spirits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
then it would be both Superior and Inferior,
which is Repugnant, Superior, when it tryes and
examines; and Inferior, when it is tryed and
examined.</hi> To which I Answer, 1. It is no
Repugnancy, that one and the same thing be
Superior and Inferior in different respects, and
as it respecteth different Subjects. But 2. There
is no necessity to understand the Dictate and
Light of Gods Spirit in divers men to be Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
and Inferior, when it examines, and
is examined, for one equal may be a measure
or rule to another; yea one thing may be
said to be a rule unto it self, according unto
that common Maxim or principle, <hi>Line<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
recta est norma sui &amp; obliqui,</hi> i. e. <hi>A right line is
the rule of it self, and also of that which is crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
Otherwise let <hi>I. A.</hi> Answer me, <hi>How
did</hi> Adam <hi>know the voice of God in his Heart
and the Prophets, before the Scriptures were
writ, how did they know it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the close of his first Section, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth
with a manifest Untruth, <hi>That the</hi>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:60394:35"/>
Quakers <hi>are for a new Dispensation, not only in
manner, but matter, contrary to the Doctrine
formerly Dictated by the Holy Ghost.</hi> This I say
is false, which he neither doth, nor can prove,
and the Dispensation we plead for is the same,
both for matter and manner, which belonged
to all true and good Christians in all Ages.
And as to what he saith, <hi>Of our extream In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuation
and Brain-sickness, and retaining the
proportion and features of humane bodies, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
quite enervated our Rational Essence.</hi> These
and the like scoffing and disdainful expressions
are no more to be regarded by us, nor have
any more weight, than when some <hi>Epicureans</hi>
at <hi>Athens,</hi> called <hi>Paul a Babler</hi> We know,
it hath been the Lot of Gods people in former
Generations, to be reputed by Adversaries,
both Fools and Mad-men. However, we
hope, the sober Readers of our Books and
Treatises, and these also who have any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with us, will find that we have neither
abandoned, nor lost the use of our Rational
Faculties, which we acknowledge to be good
Gifts of God, and for which he is to be praised;
nor doth our principle and belief of Divine
Inspiration, as being a more noble and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Gift of God, than the highest Natural
Faculty of Reason, either weaken or render
useless to us our Reason, but both indeed both
strengthen it and make it the more useful and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60394:35"/>
comfortable, whereof to Gods praise, we are
bold to say, we have true experience, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
of what <hi>I. A.</hi> or any of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting
humour do, or can say to the contrary.</p>
               <p>There yet remains two other things in this
first Section of <hi>I. A.</hi> which I think fit to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.
One is, <hi>That he alledgeth some of us
understand by the more sure word of Prophecy, the
Scripture, which is only to be taken heed unto,
until the day dawn, and the day Star arise in
the heart; that is, until the Holy Ghost be given,
and that consequently, the Scriptures serve for
nothing to belivers, who are born with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and sealed therewith.</hi> But seeing he has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
no Names of any among us understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that more sure word of Prophecy to be
the Scripture, we are not concerned to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
him. It is possible that some in Discourse,
has only so argued with him, <hi>ad hominem,</hi> as
they use to say, and not as being their own
judgment. And as for the Scriptures, we judge
that they are profitable, and ought to be
Read by true Believers and renewed persons,
as well as others. But when doth <hi>I. A.</hi> think
that the day dawneth, and the day Star ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
in the hearts of believers? Whether in
this mortal State, Yea or Nay, and then whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the shining of Gods day, and the day
Star thereof, be not a true immediate Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
in the hearts of those who have it, and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60394:36"/>
whether it doth not more assure them who
have it, than the Letter of Scripture can do?
And seeing the Light of God in them, when
it shines in the heart but as in a dark place, is
a more sure Word, than an audible voice
from Heaven, or than the Letter of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as to us; what shall be said of that Light,
when it becometh not only as the day Star,
but as the day itself, for clearness in the Soul?
Or can there be any greater, or more prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
rule than this? The other thing I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
is, <hi>That he inferreth the Scriptures to be a
rule,</hi> because Christ said to the <hi>Sadduces,
Ye erre not knowing the Scriptures.</hi> Now if
this Argument hold good, seeing Christ said
also, <hi>Ye erre not knowing the Scriptures, nor the
Power of God;</hi> It will as well follow, <hi>That the
Power of God,</hi> is the Rule, and that the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
because it was their being ignorant of
the Power of God, (which quickens both Soul
and Body) that made them ignorant of the
Scriptures; for none know truly the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
but they who know the Power of
God; and therefore that Power, which is
Life, Light and Spirit, is the more principal
and original rule. But <hi>I. A.</hi> in citing these
words of Christ, omitted the following
words, which are exceeding weighty, <hi>viz.
[no the Power of God,</hi>] whether this was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely

               <p>J. <hi>A.</hi> in the beginning of his second Section,
concerning the Rule, is pleased to call
me an <hi>Arch-Quaker,</hi> (the which Title I no
wise acknowledge) <hi>and a man too Learned,
as I employ it.</hi> To which I Answer, That as to
my Learning, that is but very ordinary, and
a thing I neither can nor ought to glory in.
However in this I rejoyce, that the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of my Conscience beareth me Witness in
the Holy Spirit, that any small measure I have
of that called Learning, it hath been my sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere aim
and endeavour to employ it to Gods
Honour, and serve the Truth therewith, and
not in the least to use it against the Truth,
so far as it was, or is made manifest unto
me. Next, he blames me that I affirm, <hi>The
Scriptures are only but a secondory Rule of Faith
and Manners; but that the Spirit, or his Dictate
within is the Principal Rule, and like</hi> Proteus,
<hi>turning my self into all shapes; sometimes I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
Christ himself, oftner the Spirit himself,
but oftnest the Dictate of the Spirit within to be
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60394:37"/>
that Rule.</hi> But he might at that ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e have no
less blamed the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> that he turned
himself into all shapes, while he affirmeth
sometimes, <hi>That Christ spoke in him; and
sometimes that the Spirit spoke in him;</hi> and
certainly what Christ or the Spirit spoke in
him, was by a certain Word or dictate. But
to Answer directly, when I say Christ is the
Rule: And again, when I say the Spirit is the
Rule, there is no absurdness therein; for if we
mean by the Spirit, the Holy Ghost, Christ
and the Holy Ghost are never separated or
divided in what they Speak or Witness in the
souls of men, but their speech and Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
is one and the same alwaies; and also
Christ himself in Scripture is called <hi>the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Adam; the quickening Spirit, and the
Lord that Spirit;</hi> and said Christ, <hi>I am the
way, the Truth, and the Life;</hi> and certainly
that Life is Spirit; and also the Words or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate
of it is Spirit and Life, as Christ said,
<hi>The words that I speak unto you are Spirit
and Life.</hi> So the Reader may see that my
words are sound and according to Scripture,
and therefore whether I say, Christ or the
Spirit, or the internal dictate and Word of
the Spirit is the Rule, it is to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
And to say the dictate of the Spirit is
the Rule, is no other than to say, the Spirit
dictating or speaking is that Rule; and do not
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60394:37"/>
some of your selves use a variety of Speech,
when ye speak of the Rule, one time saying,
<hi>The Scripture is the Rule;</hi> another time, <hi>The
Word of God contained in the Scriptures of the
Old and New Testament is the only Rule,</hi> &amp;c. as
the <hi>Westminster</hi> Confession of Faith expresly
hath it. Another time, <hi>The Spirit of God
speaking in the Scriptures,</hi> &amp;c. Now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>I. A.</hi> I may blame him and his
Brethren in this case, that <hi>Proteus</hi> like, he and
his Brethren turn themselves into all shapes
when they speak of the Rule. And whether
these phrases used by them be not more
unscriptural, I leave unto sober men for to
judge.</p>
               <p>In the next place he argueth, <hi>That Christ
cannot be the Rule, nor the Spirit, because the
Rule of Faith must be some complex Proposition,
Direction, or Precept, and the like.</hi> To this I
Answer, <hi>First,</hi> That the Rule of Faith must
be a complex Proposition, Direction, or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
formally understood in words formally
conceived, I altogether deny, and <hi>I. A.</hi> hath
not offered to prove it. And although the
Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rit of Christ may, and often doth speak ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
words in the souls of his people, yet he
doth not alwaies so do, when yet he clearly
enough signifieth his mind and will unto
them; for if among men, a King may signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
his mind to his Subjects, or a Master to his
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60394:38"/>
servants, without any formal Proposition, or
direction of words, but only by some motion
of his hand or face: How much more may
the Lord God, who is the King of Kings, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
his mind unto his servants by the motion
of his Spirit, without any formal or express
words? Again I ask <hi>I. A.</hi> if he hath not learned
in the Schools, that the reasonable nature of
God is the first rule of Manners? And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the reasonable Nature of God is not a
complex Proposition consisting of many
words. And hath he not read in <hi>Boetius</hi> that
excellent saying? <hi>Quis legem det amantibus?
major lex amor est ipse sibi,</hi> which the Author
of a late Book called, <hi>The Life of God in the
soul of man,</hi> doth use, to prove that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more than words is a Law or Rule to
Christians, and Englisheth thus:
<q>
                     <l>For who shall give a Law to them that Love?</l>
                     <l>Love's a more powerful Law that doth such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons move.</l>
                  </q>
And I further Query <hi>I. A.</hi> seeing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
saith, <hi>God is Love;</hi> he that knoweth God
to be Love, and hath the Love of God shed
abroad in his Heart by the holy Spirit, which
in Scripture is called, <hi>The Spirit of Love;</hi> shall
not this man be tyed to love God, and his
Brethren; yea, and all mankind, even his
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60394:38"/>
very enemies. Suppose it be not said to him
in formal express words, do so and so. Again,
whether he that only readeth or heareth these
outwardly, <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God
with all thy Heart,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and thy Neighbour as
thy self;</hi> but his Heart is utterly void of the
love of God; or he that hath the love of God
in his heart, and feelleth the powerful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
of it, is under the most powerful Law?
Whether the words without, or the Spirit and
Nature of Divine Love within, is the most
powerful Law and Rule? There may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be a Law or Rule, which is not a complex
Proposition of words, either inward or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
to wit, the Divine Love it self, which
hath a Voice and Language to the souls of
men, in the silence of all words, many times,
and can be understood as well without words as
with them. And therefore when I say the
dictate of the Spirit is the Rule, I mean not,
that there is alwaies a dictate of express words;
but that which is either such a formal express
dictate, or equivalent thereunto, which those
who are acquainted with the experiences of the
Saints do well understand, although it may
seem to <hi>I. A.</hi> a strange Riddle or Paradox.
And thus by what I have said in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
the intelligent Reader, I hope, shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that in saying, <hi>The Spirit is the Rule,</hi> I
am not beside my self, as <hi>I. A.</hi> doth alledge,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60394:39"/>
                  <hi>but speak the words of Truth, and soberness.</hi>
And I further ask, Whether <hi>I. A.</hi> thinks that
<hi>Ignatius</hi> the Martyr was beside himself, when
he writ in one of his Epistles to the People,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, i. e. <hi>Vsing the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost for a Rule?</hi> or, Whether <hi>Paul</hi> was
beside himself when he said, <hi>The Law of the
Spirit of Life in Christ Iesus had made him free
from the law of Sin and Death.</hi> And whether
that Law was not the Spirit of Life, even as the
Law of sin, was sin; and the Law of death,
was death. And whether the Law of the
Mind, mentioned by <hi>Paul,</hi> was not a Divine
Principle of Grace in his mind, even as the
Law of his Members was a principle of sin and
corruption, that sometime had place in him,
and not any complex Proposition of words?
And whether the Law that God writeth in the
hearts of his people in the new Covenant, be
simply a form of words, consisting of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
letters, syllables and sentences; or, rather
to speak properly is not that Law, a new and
Divine Nature or substantial Life of Holiness
and Righteousness and Wisdom, by which
the Children of God are led and taught under
the new Covenant (naturally as it were) to
love God, and all men; even as the Law that
God hath put in all living Creatures, or Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
to love and cherish their Off-spring
(which is a shadow or figure of that more Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60394:39"/>
Law in God's people) is not any complex
Proposition of words, but an innate principle
of love and affection, which he hath planted
in them?</p>
               <p>Moreover, the said <hi>I. A.</hi> digresseth here from
his matter to seek an occasion against us, and to
load us with down-right Blasphemy, because
we do not say, that there are three Persons in the
God-head. But to this Charge I have answered
already to one of <hi>I. A.</hi> his Champions, in my
book called, <hi>The Way Cast Vp;</hi> the which
hath given content to divers-sober people, and
I hope may give content to all who reads it in
that particular, where I show, that it is only
the unscriptural terms of a Trinity of Persons,
or of three Persons in the Godhead, that we
deny, and not the mysterie or thing it self, of
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, being three
that bear Record in Heaven, which according
to the Scripture, we both believe and confess.
And indeed <hi>Augustine</hi> in his Fifth and Seventh
Books of the Trinity, not only saith the words,
<hi>three Persons</hi> are improper, but disputeth against
them; and I suppose <hi>I. A.</hi> for all his School-Logick
and Philosophy, shall hardly be able
to Answer his Argument, the substance of
which, to my best remembrance, is this, <hi>The
word Person, either it signifieth somewhat abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
and simple, or somewhat relative; to say
the first is absurd, otherwise there should be three

                     </gap> Beings, or Essences in God, which is
absurd, if somewhat relative (which is the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond)
then seeing every relative is referred, or
is relative to another, as Father is relative to
Son (and therefore Father is the Father of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and no man is his own Father) in this sense,
to say the Father is a Person, is to say, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is the Person of some other, and so of the
rest, which is absurd.</hi> The which Argument,
not as mine, but really <hi>Augustines,</hi> I leave <hi>I. A.</hi>
to Answer; and <hi>Ierome,</hi> another ancient
Doctor and Father so called, doth find fault
with the words, <hi>Three Hypostasis,</hi> saying ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly

<hi>Three Persons,</hi> why then should we be so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitably
charged by <hi>I. A.</hi> or such hot-head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men, with Blasphemy, only for keeping
close to Scripture words in so great a Mysterie,
while the thing it self, so far as the Scripture
declareth it, is owned by us. And whereas
he urgeth us to tell what Three are they to be
called, if neither <hi>Three Gods,</hi> nor <hi>Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi>
I Answer, It sufficeth us to call them,
what the Spirit of God in Christ and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
hath called them; and to enquire no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
nor to be curiously wise, above what
they have d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

That there is a <hi>Docta Ignorantia,</hi> or <hi>Learned

falsly so called. And if <hi>I. A.</hi> his definition of
<hi>Person</hi> be received, <hi>viz. That it is an intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Being, subsisting incommunicably or distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one from another.</hi> I see not, for my part,
but that <hi>Three Persons,</hi> at this rate, shall infer

and consequently <hi>Three Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> That he saith, <hi>Some Quakers have
called them three Manifes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ations,</hi> viz. <hi>of</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<hi>of</hi> Christ, <hi>and of the</hi> Spirit; he ought to
have produced their names, or then we are not
bound to believe him, that any have said so;
for, at this rate, <hi>Moses</hi> should be the Father of
Christ, which I do not believe any, called a
Quaker, ever thought; perhaps some have
said, there have been three Dispensations or
Manifestations of God, one through <hi>Moses,</hi>
and one through Christ in the Flesh, and one
through the Spirit, or Christ in Spirit; and
that these may after some sort have such a refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
as that the first may be called relative to
the Father, yet not excluding the Son; and the
second may be relative to the Son, not exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which yet doth not argue,
that we understand the Dispensation, or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of the Father, to be the Father
himself; far less, <hi>Moses</hi> to be the Father, as <hi>I. A.</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:60394:41"/>
I believe very rashly and unwarrantably doth
alledge, Now that there are or have been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
of Administrations, the Scripture is
plain, and <hi>Protestants</hi> as well as <hi>Papists</hi> do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
it. Yea, what saith <hi>I. A.</hi> to the
common Catechism that saith, <hi>The Father
hath Created us, the Son hath Redeemed us,
and the Holy Ghost hath Sanctified us;</hi> which
is to be understood not exclusively, nor yet
without some order in the manner of working.
But who will be so foollish or ignorant, for all
this to say, <hi>That the Father is our Creation, the
Son our Redemption</hi> (strictly or literally, and
without a Figure so understood) <hi>and the Holy
Ghost our Sanctification.</hi> Nor doth it follow,
that because Christ bringeth in his Father and
himself as two Witnesses, to prove that he
was the true <hi>Messiah;</hi> that therefore there are
either two or three Persons in the Godhead;
for Christ speaketh these words, not simply as
God, but as man: Now as Man, we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that Christ is a distinct Nature or Being
from God, although not divided or separated
therefrom. And lastly, that he argueth,
<hi>That Christ is called the express Image of the
Fathers Hypostasis, and that Hypostasis should be
and is truly Translated</hi> Person, <hi>and not</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
<hi>and otherwise it would infer</hi> Arianism.
I Answer, That <hi>Hypostasis</hi> should be Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<hi>Person,</hi> he doth meerly affirm without
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60394:41"/>
any proof from approved Authors, and sure
I am the Etymologie of the word, hath no
affinity to person, but properly signifieth <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi>
being compounded of the <hi>Preposition,</hi>
and <hi>Substantive</hi> Verb, which as near as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
is in Latin <hi>substantia,</hi> and in English <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi>
and is so Translated, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. Now
that to Translate it <hi>substance,</hi> would infer
<hi>Arrianism, I. A.</hi> doth but meerly say it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any proof, and so is not to be believed,
And beside, Christ in Scripture is called, <hi>The
Image of the Invisible God;</hi> and certainly God
is a substance, and yet this, I hope, will not
infer <hi>Arrianism,</hi> and may we not well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
how Christ as man is the Character or
Image of God's substance, without <hi>Arrianism,</hi>
seeing Christ said, <hi>viz.</hi> in respect of his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
<hi>My Father is greater than I;</hi> and it is
clear that the aforesaid place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2, 3. is to
be understood of Christ, not simply as God,
but as man, who certainly as man is the most
bright and glorious Image of God, and above
all Angels or Men, or whatever can be named
besides the Godhead it self.</p>

               <p>HAving thus traced <hi>I. A.</hi> in his unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
and impertinent digression. I
shall now reply unto his Arguments, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he laboureth to prove, that the Scriptures
are the principal rule of Faith and manners.</p>
               <p>And to the first, that in <hi>Isaiah</hi> 8. 10. they
were sent unto the Law and Testimony, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
that were the Scripture; it followeth
not, that therefore it is the principal rule,
especially in Gospel times, when God writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his Law in the heart, and the Testimony
of Jesus is the Spirit of Prophecy; and he that
believeth hath the Testimony or Witness in
himself. But that people are not sent to any
dictate, Word or Light within, as <hi>I. A.</hi> doth
alledge is false, and contrary to 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 19.
Deut. 30. 14. Rom. 10. 8. Ioh. 3. 20, 21. Ioh.</hi>
12. 36. And doth not God and Christ, and
the Holy Ghost dwell in the Hearts of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers;
and must not they go to God and
Christ, where they are, and doth not God
and Christ speak in his people? Are they not
his Temple, and as God spoke immediately
in the outward Temple, under the Old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
<pb facs="tcp:60394:42"/>
the which Temple was a Figure of
Christ and the Church, shall he not speak
now immediately in his true Temple, as well
as he did in former times: Or are we wholly
to neglect God and Christ in us, and their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Teaching; and only to mind the Letter
of the Scripture without us, according to <hi>I. A.</hi>
And when <hi>Paul</hi> said to <hi>Timothy, Neglect not
the Gift that is in thee,</hi> Hath this command no
regard unto us. And when Christ saith, <hi>Behold
I stand at the door and knock, if any man will
hear my voice;</hi> Is this door only an outward
door, or is not rather the door of the Heart,
which is inward; and therefore is not that
voice inward? And whence is it, that seeing
Christ is so near to his people as to be in them,
that he doth not speak one word to them by
himself, as a man doth to his Friend, that he
is present with: Is it want of power or unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that he doth so refrain. Doth not <hi>I. A.</hi>
and those of his Principle, <hi>make God over all
Blessed for ever more;</hi> like unto the dumb Idols
mentioned in the Scripture, <hi>Who have a Mouth
but speak not,</hi> being always dumb or silent.
Oh! what an Indignity is this to the Lord
of Glory; and let <hi>I. A.</hi> take heed, lest he
who is so ready to charge us with Blasphemy,
be not found among the Blasphemers himself,
who would limit the Lord from speaking and
revealing himself, in his Living Temples.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:60394:43"/>
To his second Argument I Answer;
Though the Scriptures are Infallible, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deceive us; yet they cannot sufficiently
demonstrate unto us, their Infallibility, nor
yet their true Sense, without the evidence of
the Spirit, as is clear by <hi>Paul</hi>'s Testimony,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 4. where he telleth, <hi>That his Speech
and Preaching was in Demonstration of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and Power;</hi> And therefore without that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
of the Spirit, his words could
not prevail, nor perswade them, that they
were of God: And certainly if <hi>Paul</hi>'s Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
needed the demonstration of the Spirit,
his Writing doth as much need it at this
day.</p>
               <p>To the third, I say, It is no derogating
from the Scripture, that they derive their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
from the Spirit of God, which gave
them their being, even as it is no derogation
from the words of a King, long ago spoken
by him, <hi>That he confirmeth them a new, by a
new immediate Testimony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the fourth, Although we may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any Dictate within, that agrees not
with the Scripture; it doth not follow, that
therefore the Scripture is above the Spirit of
God, or his Dictate; for as the Spirit can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
contradict the Scripture, so nor can the
Scripture ever contradict the Spirit of God;
and neither can the Spirit or Scripture, ever
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60394:43"/>
contradict pure and sound Reason; yet it doth
not follow, that Reason is either greater, or
equal to the Spirit, or to Scripture. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that Dictate which is contrary to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is to be rejected, as being none of Gods
Spirit, it doth only well follow, that the
Scripture is a Rule, that is to be set over all
false Dictates, to judge and condemn them,
which we most willingly grant.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>I. A.</hi> perceiving that I could retort one
of his Arguments, labours to guard against it,
<hi>As seeing the Word of God is the principal Rule,
and the Dictate or Speech of Gods Spirit within
men, is the word of God; therefore that Dictate
is the principal Rule:</hi> And this Argument I
did use in my Book called, <hi>Quakerism no Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.</hi>
To which he Answers by denying,
<hi>That there is any such Dictate of God, or the
spirit in any men whomsoever, whether believers
or unbelievers.</hi> But to this I Answer, 1. He
will not deny, but that the Apostles had such
an inward or immediate Dictate, and also
the Prophets; and therefore he must allow,
that the Scripture, as to the Prophets and
Apostles, was but a secondary Rule, or at
least no greater Rule, than that Dictate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
which they had. And yet by <hi>I. A.</hi> his
<hi>Logick,</hi> the Apostles did vilifie and despise the
Scriptures, and it was a needless or unuseful
thing unto them, seeing they had an inward
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60394:44"/>
Dictate, which was greater, or at least equa
unto the Scripture: Or let <hi>I. A.</hi> shew, how
their having the Inward Dictate for their
Rule, did not make them undervalue the
Scriptures; whereas our having such a Dictate
as he alledgeth, or pretending to such a
Dictate makes us so to undervalue them. But
secondly, he only supposeth it, without any
proof, that such an Inward Dictate, which
was once in the Church of God, (as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed,)
is discontinued, or ceased. And this
indeed is the general manner of our oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers,
who lay it down as a Principle, as need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no proof, that Immediate Revelation, and
Teaching of Gods Spirit is ceased. But let
<hi>I. A.</hi> know, that we can receive no such
Doctrine as a Principle from hims but return
it as a meer idle and false supposition, which
yet is the foundation of a great many of his
consequences against us. Thirdly, that he
saith, <hi>I should first prove, that there is such
a D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ctate in every man.</hi> I Answer, that I have
done already, in my Book called, <hi>Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Revelation,</hi> published many years ago,
by many Arguments; and he should first
have Answered to these, before he had sought
any more. Also in my Book called, <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>erism
no Popery,</hi> to which he has given no
sufficient reply, and some of the most weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
he hath not so much as once Named. And
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60394:44"/>
whereas he objecteth the <hi>Americans,</hi> and
others that cannot tell how many Gods there
are: I ask him, by what shall the <hi>Americans</hi>
be judged at the last day; shall it not be by
the Law of God, writ in their Hearts. And
do not these <hi>Americans</hi> sin against God, and
those also who are most ignorant, and yet
want the Scripture; now where no Law is,
there is no transgression. This I hope is
enough to prove, that even the <hi>Americans,</hi>
and consequently all men, have a Divine
Law in their Hearts; for if it were not Divine,
and as really the Law of God, as any that we
have, to transgress it, were not a sin against
God. Hence I thus argue, a Divine Law in
all men, is an Inward immediate Dictate;
but there is a Divine Law in all men, and
therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in this respect it is, that
the substance of the Moral Law is generally
acknowledged to be Imprinted in the Hearts
of all men, even those who want the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
And I well remember, that Bishop
<hi>Sanderson</hi> saith in one of his Sermons, <hi>That
the said Law, in the Hearts of all men, is as
really the Word of God, as that Printed in our
Bibles:</hi> And thus I hope I have sufficiently
evinced, that there is a Dictate in all men,
that is a Divine Law and Rule, at least in
many or most things, belonging both to
Piety, Justice, and Sobriety. Although I
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60394:45"/>
do not plead, that there is a Law or Rule
in them, who have not had the History of
the Gospel revealed unto them to believe the
same. Nor do I say, that the History of the
Gospel is revealed to us immediately with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Scripture; but that, having Heard
or Read the said History, and all other Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
parts of the Scripture, the Spirit of God,
by some Inward Dictate formal or virtual,
or that which is equivalent, doth move and
incline us to believe the same. And that <hi>I. A.</hi>
doth plead, <hi>That Believers only have the Spirit.</hi>
I Answer, They have it only so as to
possess and enjoy the indwelling of it, and
union with it; but that Unbelievers have it
so far, at least as to reprove them, and call
them to repentance, is clear from many
Scriptures, especially <hi>Iohn 16. 8. Prov.</hi> 1.
23, 24.</p>
               <p>In Answer to one Argument of mine, he
saith, <hi>A Believer needs not any immediate
Dictate, to assure him that he is a Child of God,
seeing by the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>istance of the Spirit effectively, he
may draw a conclusion from Scripture Premisses,
in applying the Scripture marks.</hi> But to this I
Answer, that the Scripture only telleth him
one of the Premisses, of that they call the
practical Syllogism; but no Scripture in all
the Bible telleth <hi>I. A.</hi> or me, that he, or I
have these marks; and seeing a true Believer
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60394:45"/>
may attain to a Faith of assurance, as <hi>I. A.</hi>
doth not deny; and Faith must have the
Word of God for its object, seeing there is
not a word in all the Scripture that saith, he or I
have those marks, we must seek that word
somewhere else then in the Scripture; and
where shall we seek it else but in our Hearts,
where the Spirit himself witnesseth with our
Spirits, that we are the Children of God, (if so
be, that we have that witness) even as it did
witness in <hi>Paul.</hi> And if the illumination of the
Spirit discover the Graces of God in our Souls,
certainly that is an Immediate Revelation;
for Scripture doth not discover in us those
Graces, but the Spirit; and he that discovers
the Graces, discovereth also himself to be the
true Spirit of God, and doth not hide himself
from us; or else we might doubt whether the
discovery were true or not, not knowing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
the Author thereof.</p>
               <p>Lastly, That he saith, <hi>I spurn at the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
of objective and subjective Illumination,
as Anti-christian and deceitful.</hi> I Answer, I do
not blame the distinction simply as in it self,
but as it is illused and applyed: Whereas they
say, <hi>The influence and illumination of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in Believers, is meerly effective or subjective,
and not at all objective:</hi> But I say it is both
effective and objective; effective to help us to
See or Hear; and objective, or by way of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>b<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60394:46"/>
for the Sight and Hearing, or any other
perception of our Souls to stay and rest upon;
but this object, can no more be the Letter of
Scripture alone, than a report of Meat and
Drink, can be the object to satisfie a mans
Taste, or Appetite, when he is Hungry or
Thirsty: And thus I do not confound the
distinct considerations of objective and
effective; only I affirm, that the same thing
may be both, and so indeed is; as when the
<hi>Sun</hi> enlightens us, its Ray or Beam helps us
to see, and also it is the object of our sight:
And the Heat of the Fire is both the object of
our Feeling, and also when it is moderate
helpeth us to feel, and effectively doth
strengthen our Feeling: But when the Fire
heateth a stone, it worketh in it only effective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and not objectively, or as an object; but
Believers receive not the Heavenly Light
and warmth of the Spirit as dead and insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
stones, but as living Souls that have a
real sense and perception of that which doth
influence them; and therefore that influence
is the proper immediate object of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.
And if there be no inward Spiritual
object, that the Spirit presents to Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
then there is no inward Spiritual Eye
nor Ear, nor inward Spiritual Taste or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
nor inward Spiritual Feeling, all which
is most contrary, both to Scripture, (which
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60394:46"/>
mentions all these Spiritual Senses, as I have
proved at large in my Book of <hi>Immediate
Revelation</hi>) and also to the Saints experiences.
And doth not God promise, that his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
shall see him under the New Covenant;
and certainly all sight that is proper is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate.
And to say, that the Saints only see
God by the Scriptures, is but as much as to
say, that we only see our Father, by a report of
him, or that we only see the outward <hi>Sun</hi> by
ones telling us that it shines, who hath indeed
seen it; or that we only see our Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
in which we live and dwell, by looking
at the Map of it: But certainly such a remote
and improper seeing do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s no wise answer to
the Glory of the New Covenant, but rather
falleth short of the Old: And if that be all to
see God in the Scriptures, then all those that
lived under the Old Covenant saw God, as
clearly as Believers under the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
seeing they had the Scriptures in great
part. But I remember a good saying of <hi>S. R.</hi>
in one of his Epistles, that I hope may have
some weight with <hi>I. A. That is little</hi> (saith
he) <hi>to see Christ in a Book,</hi> (which yet the
Scripture is) and certainly if <hi>I. A.</hi> has seen no
more of God, or Christ, but what he has had
a report of, from the Letter of the Scripture;
I must needs say, he is a great stranger to the
New Covenant Dispensation, and is still like
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60394:47"/>
so to remain, while he disputes in unbelief
against so great a Blessing, that if he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
he might attain unto: But I wish the
Lord may open his Eyes, and then he will
no more contend against such a thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I. A.</hi> proceedeth further to dispute against
the Dictate, or Witness of the Spirit within,
although he saith, <hi>He hath sufficiently affronted
it, yet because it is worthy of a thousand deaths,
for its proud usurpation,</hi> as he saith, <hi>he will
reach it some few blowes more.</hi> To this I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that these exceeding bold and daring
words, against the Blessed Dictates or Words
of Gods Holy Spirit in the Hearts of his
people, hath not a little moved me with
Commiseration and pity, praying heartily
that the Lord may forgive him.</p>
               <p>But now let us see further, what he saith
against the inward Dictate. <hi>First,</hi> he saith,
<hi>It is not essentially right and infallible, because
all men have not the Spirit:</hi> But to this is An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
already. And whether all men have
the Spirit in some sense, Yea or Nay; it is
agreed upon by all sober Writers, that there
is an infallible and incorruptible Law planted
by God in all men, even those who have not
the Scriptures, which the Lawyers call <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deresis,</hi>
that is, the foundation of all just and
good Laws; and if that were destroyed or
corrupted, all Justice should utterly perish a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60394:47"/>
that part of mankind, in whom it
should be destroyed or corrupted. But this
<hi>I. A.</hi> like a blind man he striketh so rashly
with his supposed Blowes, that he not only
fighteth against our Religion, and Principle,
but even against all the Lawyers and Justicia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and all other sober Writers, on these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
who do all unanimously plead, that there
is such an incorruptible Law implanted or
imprinted by the Creator in all men: And
certainly if that Law could be corrupted and
changed from its essential rectitude and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to transgress it, were no sin; for a corrupt
and impure Law, can be no Law of God.
And doth not <hi>Paul</hi> speak of the Law that
was in the Hearts of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which he
did not say, they did or could corrupt, <hi>But
that they held the Truth in unrighteousness,</hi>
Rom. 2. 15 compared 1. 18. Again he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth,
<hi>That as for Believers, they need no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Dictate or Teaching of the Spirit, seeing
the whole Doctrine of Salvation is abundantly
made known in the Scriptures.</hi> But I Answer,
That the whole Doctrine of Salvation is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
made known in the Scriptures, that the
Inward Teaching and Revelation of God by
his Spirit is needless, is a thing he barely doth
alledge, without proof, as his ordinary cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
is: And indeed his manner of Argument
is, as if one should say, the Card or Map of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60394:48"/>
the Earth, doth abundantly make the Earth
known unto us, with the things therein; and
therefore we need no other knowledge of the
Earth, nor of any thing in it; we need not
see the Earth it self, nor Taste any of the
Fruits of it; and when we Hunger or Thirst,
we need neither Bread nor Drink, the report
of these things can satisfie our Appetite well
enough: Or if one should say to a Woman
that intirely loves her Husband, thou hast
many of thy Husbands Letters, and Books;
also thou hast his Picture very perfectly
drawn, to look upon, and it cannot be better
drawn than it is done already, and therefore
what needs thou to hear or see thy Husband
himself. The application is easie, for certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as the report of Meat and Drink, cannot
satisfie one that is Hungry and Thirsty,
though it be never so full, and as to hear or
read of our most dear and beloved Friends,
is not enough to satisfie our desire after them;
but over and above all that others can tell us
of them, we desire to hear and see them, and
converse with them immediately; so a report
of God and Christ, cannot satisfie the Souls
of Gods people, but they desire a nearer
knowledge of him, whom their Souls love,
and which he doth also give unto them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his promise, <hi>Ioh. 14. 21. He that
loveth me,</hi> (said Christ) <hi>shall be loved of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60394:48"/>
and I will manifest my self unto him.</hi> And
why did Christ promise, that he would send his
Spirit to Teach them all things, if the Teaching
of his Spirit was a needless thing? Might they
not have answered according to <hi>I. A.</hi> thou
needest not send thy Spirit to Teach us, we
have the Scriptures that abundantly Teach
us all things needful to be known; and what
is not expressly contained in the Scriptures, we
can gather it by consequence from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and therefore there is no need of
sending the Spirit to Teach us, it is but a
superfluous labour. But however this Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
savours to such whole persons as <hi>I. A.</hi>
that need not the Physician; yet those that
are truly Sick, Poor and Indigent, do need
the Lord and his Spirit to Teach them, and
also to speak unto them; without which they
cannot be healed, refreshed and comforted,
by all that they can read or hear from the
Letter of the Scriptures, or what man can
Preach unto them, until the Lord by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
syeak unto them himself.</p>
               <p>And in the close of his Argument against
the necessity of the Inward Teaching, or
Dictate of the Spirit of God, he pleadeth,
<hi>That it is inconsistent, to hold an infallible
Dictate of the Spirit to be in any man, and yet
that man in any respect, to Think, Speak,
Write, or act fallibly: And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> when</hi> Peter <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60394:49"/>
Christ, as also when Christ reproved him,
for saying, be it far from thee Master: Peter</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>I. A.</hi> had no infallible Dictate in
him: And seeing <hi>I. A.</hi> doth plead that the
Apostles did sin in Thought, Word and
Deed, so long as they lived upon Earth, and
to sin is to act fallibly, it must needs follow
by his doctrine, that none of the Apostles
had any infallible Dictate. But why may
they not err who have an infallible Dictate
within, as they may err who have the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
without, that is infallible? May not a
man have an infallible guide and way before
him, and yet through unwatchfulness, not
follow that infallible guide and way. Again,
whereas he pleads, <hi>That there is no middle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
fallible and infallible.</hi> I Answer, to be
universally fallible, and partly infallible, I
grant is a contradiction, and admitteth no
midst, but yet to be partly infallible, <hi>viz.</hi> so
far as a man doth follow the infallible Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and leading of Gods Spirit; and partly
fallible, <hi>viz.</hi> so far as at another instant or
moment, or hour, and in another thing he
waiteth not for his guide, but runneth before,
or turneth aside from him: I say, these two
are no contradiction. And I ask <hi>I. A.</hi> hath he
no infallibility nor infallible knowledge in
any thing? Doth he not believe and know
infallibly that there is a God, and divers
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60394:49"/>
other weighty Truths? This I judge he will
not deny? Well then. According to his <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,</hi>
if he be infallible, when he Thinks,
Says, or Writs that there is a God, he must
be infal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ible in all other things that he either
Thinks, Writes, or speaks, because according
to his Doctrine, there is no midle betwixt
fallible and infallible. <hi>I. A.</hi> should have better
remembred his <hi>School-Logick,</hi> which Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that contradictory propositions are not
betwixt two universals, nor two particulars;
but the one universal, and the other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
               <p>His 3d Argument against the Dictate of the
Spirit of God within, is the same with his 4th
Argument that is formerly Answered above<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
concerning the Scripture. And surely this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating
of Arguments, as if they were new
ones, when they are nothing but old ones
formerly used, argueth great barrenness of
matter in <hi>I. A.</hi> else he would not run into
such needless and idle Tautologies. But he
thinks I have yeilded the cause to him, because
I grant, all Doctrines, that agree not with the
Scriptures, are to be rejected; therefore the
Scripture is a superior rule to all such false
Doctrines I grant. Therefore the Scripture is
Superior to the Spirit of God and his Dictate
in our Hearts, I deny it. And though we are
to examine the inward Dictates of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60394:50"/>
by the Scriptures, yet that proves not that
the Scriptures are superior; no more, than
that it proves that the words of the Prophets
were superior to the words of Christ and the
Apostles, because the people examined the
latter by the former.</p>
               <p>His fourth Argument is built upon a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
that the Scriptures are the principal
rule, and consequently not the Spirit inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Dictating in our hearts. But he hath not
proved that the Scripture is a more principal
rule, then the Spirit. Although in respect of
all outward rules that can be named, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
the Scripture is the most principal rule.
Nor is it any repugnancy to say, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ure
is the principal external rule, by which all
Doctrines and Principles of Religion are to be
examined, and what is contrary to Scripture
is to be rejected; and yet to say also that the
Spirit himself, perswading or assuring us, of
the Truth of the Scripture, is the principal
inward rule, seeing these two principles are
in differing kinds, the one external, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
us, the other internal, and within us,
which are very well consistent, and mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
bear witness one of another, even as
<hi>Iohn</hi> bare witness to Christ, and Christ bare
witness to <hi>Iohn:</hi> Although Christ needed not
the Testimony of <hi>Iohn,</hi> as for himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:60394:50"/>
His fourth Argument concludeth only
against a thing, which we do no wise deny,
<hi>viz. That every Dictate within is not the Rule:</hi>
And <hi>I. A.</hi> might have spared his pains to
dispute against that, which no man holdeth.
For who is so absurd to think that every
Dictate, suppose it be of a mans own vain
and foolish mind, or of the Devil, is to be
received as his rule. The Question is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
every Dictate, nor indeed concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
any other, then that alone Dictate of
the Spirit of God and of Christ in men, which
hath a self evidence unto him, who hath it,
as <hi>I. A.</hi> must needs acknowledge it had to the
Prophets and Apostles. But he objects, <hi>That
the Devil may present an Imposture unto a man,
with so much seeming evidence, as with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
of a deceitful heart, will make it be
received for a Divine Truth, especially by that
man that for the present time has no Divine
Dictate.</hi> To this I Answer, That the person
supposed by <hi>I. A.</hi> is either one that the Lord
hath in his just judgment for some great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulness,
and abuse of Light formerly given,
delivered up to <hi>Satan</hi>'s delusions, such as these
mentioned 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 11. And as for him,
and the like sort, the Scripture cannot help
him: For certainly he that is given up by the
Lord, to the delusion of Satan, as a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his sinning against the Light he once
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60394:51"/>
had, will misunderstand the Scripture, and
cannot otherwise do, even as the <hi>Iews</hi> and
<hi>Sadducees</hi> did of old. But as for others that are
not so given up by the Lord, it ought not to
be supposed, that they can altogether want
some Divine Dictate, or witness of Gods
Spirit, to testifie against the strongest delusion
of Satan. And therefore he to whom Satan
presents such a delusion, if he hath a sincere
love to the Truth, by comparing the delusion
with the true Dictate or Light of Christ that
witnesseth against it, may readily discover it,
to be a delusion; and if the said delusion be
contrary to any Doctrine expresly declared in
the Scripture, the Scripture will also be a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary
confirmation to him, that what is so
presented to him, is but a delusion. But many
times Satan presents delusions to men to do,
or act things, that are not simply in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
unlawful, or contrary to Scripture.
And then I Query by what rule, shall these
delusions be discovered? But I confess <hi>I. A.</hi>
hath a very short way, but yet very false and
unsound to resolve this question, <hi>viz. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively
to conclude, that all inward Dictates
and suggestions whatsoever that any man finds in
himself, are utterl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to be rejected, as being any
Command of God, or any Divine Testimony,
seeing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there are none such in the hearts of men.</hi>
They are all according to him, either a mans
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60394:51"/>
own thoughts or suggestions of Satan: And
therefore nothing that a man hath in him
is to be relyed upon. But it is strange Doctrine,
that Satan shall be so near always to Dictate
evil, even unto the Children of God, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately;
but God and Christ shall be at
such a distance, as not once in a mans whole
life time, to Dictate in him immediately that
which is good. The which Doctrine of <hi>I. A.</hi>
is so favourable to the Devil, and so advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
to advance and uphold his Kingdom
among men, that this one consideration is
enough to render it suspected that it is not of
God, but of the adversary.</p>

himself that doth Dictate or Teach in us; and
who is the principal Rule of Faith and Life.</hi>
All which Objections he brings them not,
either in matter or form as used by us, but
miserably perverts the most of them to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
sense and intent, as if we did use those
Reasons to oppose an outward Ministry, or
the use of outward Preaching, Hearing,
Reading, Praying; none of which we op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
but on the contrary, we own all these
things, as both needful to be done, seeing they
are commanded of God, and as profitable to
men; yea, to the most advanced and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
Saints, when duly practised. And it
is an exceeding great mistake in our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
generally to suppose, That our Principle
of Immediate Revelation, or the Immediate
Teachings of the Spirit doth destroy, or make
null and void the use of the Scriptures, or any
other means: For by Immediate, we mean
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60394:52"/>
not Immediate in opposition to those things,
that are means truly appointed of God, as
Reading the Scriptures, Preaching, Praying,
Meditating, Singing, Waiting. But on the
contrary we say, It is only by the help of the
Spirits immediate Teachings and Leadings,
that those and the like means are made effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual,
and profitable to the People of God.
For if the Prophets and Apostles their having
Immediate Revelation, did not make void
the use of the Scriptures unto them, nor the
use of Preaching, Praying, Reading, Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating,
Waiting and Watching, no more
doth our having it. Again, our Adversaries
grant, that God doth operate or work imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
by an immediate effective illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Spirit, in the hearts of all his People,
and that this immediateness doth not hinder,
or make void the use of means, but make
them the more profitable and useful; even so
nor the i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mediate objective illumination,
doth in the least made void the means, as is
already said in the case of the Prophets and
Apostles; and <hi>Paul</hi> said, the Scriptutes were
writ for his and his Brethrens Learning, even
his fellow Apostles, as well as other Christians.
And to say or think the contrary, is as absurd
and unreasonable, as who would say, a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
that is taught of his Master immediately is
not to read upon any Book, nor to hearken
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60394:53"/>
to any of his fellow Scholars, that may be as
well or better learned than himself; and on
the other hand, to set up the means in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Lords immediate Teachings, is
equally unreasonable as to conclude, such a
man has Books whereon to learn, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it can profit him nothing to be taught
immediately, or <hi>viva voce,</hi> and by word of
mouth by a l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ving Teacher. Now both these
extreams, our Principle, and the Scripture,
and also our good experience have taught us
to shun. And the immediateness of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
illuminations, both effectively and obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively
to work and operate in us, in the use
of all the means appointed of God, (some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in the use of one means, and sometimes
in the use of another; as now in Reading,
then in Hearing; now in Preaching, then in
Praying; now in Meditating, then in Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or Praising God; now in giving Alms,
then in visiting the Sick, or thos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that are in
Prison; and sometimes, as the mind is retired
in pure silence to wait upon the Lord, which
may be as well and as truly called a mean, as
any of the former. I say the immediateness
of the Spirits Communications and Illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
in the use of those and the like means
aforesaid) do as well consist with the means,
and the means with them, as the immediate
Sun-shine and influence of the heat, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60394:53"/>
warmth of the Sun, which worketh
both effectively and objectively upon us, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
with the means; when we walk or tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
on the Road at noon day, or labour in
the Field, Plough, Digg, Sow, Reap, and
use any other manual operation, the which
means are so far from hindring, or making
void the necessity of the Suns immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
and concurrence, that none of these
things can be well or comfortably performed
without it. And in this large and general
sense of the word means, which also is true,
it may be warrantably enough said, without
any prejudice to our principle of Immediate
Revelation, that we have no ground to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
any Immediate Manifestation or Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God, but in the use of some one means
or another, that God requireth us to be found
in. For there is not one hour, or moment
of our Life, but there is something of Duty or
Obedience that we ought to be found in, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inwardly or outwardly (if we have the
use of our understandings as men) and every
act of Obedience may and ought truly to be
called a means of our receiving somewhat im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
of God, to wit, our Faith, our
Love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our Hope, our Holy Fear, our Care,
our Watchfulness, our Praying, Meditating,
and silent Waiting; and in one word, our
whole Obedience, all these are as truly and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60394:54"/>
properly means, as Prea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ing, or reading in
the Scriptures. And thus every one that is
most diligently exercised in the true means,
has greatest access unto God, and doth most
abundantly partake of the immediate Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Communications of God's Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
Light, Life, Love, Vertue, Power, and
Wisdom. And if it be said, Why are they
called then <hi>Immediate;</hi> I Answer, Because we
feel or perceive them most near unto us even
as near, or rather more near unto us, as the
things or actions wherein we are exercised,
giving Spiritual Vigour, Life, and lustre un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, without which they are but as dead
or lifeless. And thus even as when the soul
liveth in the Body, it is said to be immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
united with it, and act immediately there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
or therewith, although it useth the Body as
its Instrument: Even so the Spirit of God and
of Christ, livingly indwelling in the Saints,
and united with them, and they with him,
is said to act immediately in them, and with
them, although the Lord useth them as means
or instruments to work with him. And as for
the word <hi>Immediate Revelation,</hi> seeing it is not
any express Scripture phrase, no not in the
case of the Prophets and Apostles, so far as I
can remember, if the thing it self were grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to wit, <hi>That God doth inwardly reveal and
speak his mind, or shew his Glory, and glorious
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60394:54"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ower and Presence in his Children, as he did in
and to his Saints of Old; so that the Saints do
Hear, See and perceive, also Taste and Savour,
and feel after God Himself, as he reveals him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in his Son, by the Holy Spirit,</hi> the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy
about the Name or Phrase should soon
be at an end; for it did satisfie the Prophets
and Apostles, who had it in great measure to
call it simply <hi>Revelation,</hi> and <hi>Vision,</hi> or the
like, without adding the word <hi>Immediate:</hi>
for in those daies, it seemeth that deceitful di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
of <hi>Mediate</hi> and <hi>Immediate Revelation</hi>
was not found out in the World; I call it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful
and false, because, to speak properly,
all <hi>Revelation</hi> is <hi>Immediate,</hi> even as all <hi>Vision</hi>
is <hi>Immediate;</hi> and so is all Hearing, for I can
neither see nor hear a man, unless I see and
hear him immediately. And as for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
when it is called a <hi>Revelation,</hi> it should
be figuratively understood, as when it is called
a <hi>Vision;</hi> for none will say that <hi>Isaiah</hi> his Book
is really the <hi>Vision</hi> it self which he s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> could not
write the intellectual Vision that he saw, to
speak properly, so nor could he write the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
Voice, Word or Words, that he did
only intellectually hear, but only a Report or
Declaration of them, the which doth far come
short of what he saw, or heard; and in this
respect, <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that he heard <hi>verba inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fabilia,</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:60394:55"/>
unspeakable words, that could not be
uttered or expressed, and so did all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and Apostles; for indeed the words of
the mouth, as they can be spoken and writ,
fall short many times to express the depth of
what we inwardly think or receive in natural
things, and how much more to express what
God doth inwardly speak or reveal, which
yet is no derogation from the words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
for it is acknowledged by us to be a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
instrument, in the hand of the Spirit for
our Instruction. And though we cannot be so
bold as to say, That the true God is not Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped,
nor known savingly, where the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is wanting, as <hi>I. A.</hi> doth alledge more
daringly, I suppose, than many of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
that that are more sober will allow, yet
we do believe and freely acknowledge that the
Scriptures are ordinary means, (but yet not
without the inward Direction, Revelation and
Teaching of God's own Spirit) of Peoples In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
in all Nations, according to <hi>Rom.</hi>
16. 26. and those Nations that want the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
are, no doubt, for most part, in great
darkness; But why some Nations want the
blessing of the Scriptures belongeth to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Judgments of God; and as for us, who
have them, let us be thankful to God, and
earnestly seek the holy Spirit that gave them
forth, without which they will be a Sealed
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60394:55"/>
Book unto us, whether learned or unlearned,
as it is at this day unto the unbelieving Jews,
and also unto many thousands of unfaithful
Professors of Christ, who in works deny him.
And thus, by what is said, how and in what
manner we own the Word of God in our
Hearts, immediately Speaking and Teaching,
as our principal Rule, <hi>I. A.</hi> his Cavils, and
false Charges are sufficiently Answered, which
may serve to all his Third Section. Yet to
Answer to some things more particularly,
whereas <hi>I. A.</hi> alledgeth, <hi>That the Word men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,</hi>
Deut. 30. 14. <hi>is not Christ, but the Books
or Writings of</hi> Moses. To this I Answer, But
whether shall we rather believe <hi>I. A.</hi> or the
Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> who, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. doth plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
it of Christ; see Verse 4. compared
with Verse 5, 6, 7, 8. when he distinguisheth
betwixt the Law and Christ, as preferring
Christ to the Law; and he saith, <hi>Christ is the
end of the Law,</hi> which he proveth out of
<hi>Moses</hi>'s words, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 14. and therefore
these words of <hi>Moses</hi> are to be understood of
Christ, and so did <hi>Clements Alexandrinus,</hi> and
others of the Fathers understand them. But
saith <hi>I. A.</hi> Moses <hi>tyes them straitly to the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
written Word of the Scriptures.</hi> But what
then, doth he so tye them, as that they were
not to regard God, or Christ, or the Holy
Spirit in their Hearts? How wild and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60394:56"/>
is this consequence? Could the people
understand the true Spiritual intent and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
of the Law, without Christ and
his Spirit, and inward Teaching? Was it not
the fault of the people, that they stuck so close
to the bare outward performances of the Law,
and neglected Christ and his Spirit, which
could alone give the understanding of it:
And therefore when he came in the flesh, they
rejected him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> as to <hi>Ieremiah 31. v.</hi> 31, 32. we
do not bring this place to overthrow the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Rule of the Scripture, or true outward
Teaching, as <hi>I. A.</hi> falsly doth alleadge, but
only to prove, that God himself doth Teach
his people under the New Covenant; so that
they hear God himself, and learn of him;
which yet doth not hinder, yet they both
also may and ought to hear all those, whom
God sendeth. And certainly that Scripture
expression to be Taught of God; is more, or
a further thing then to be Taught by the
Letter of the Scripture, or by <hi>Moses</hi> and the
Prophets Writings; otherwise it might be said,
that the people simply by the Old Covenant,
was as much Taught of God, as under the
New.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Nor do we bring <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 20, 21.
where Christ saith, <hi>The Kingdom of God is
within you,</hi> to exclude all External helps and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60394:56"/>
means, as <hi>I. A.</hi> doth again no less falsely
alleadge. But only to prove that there is an
inward Principle of Christs Light, Life and
Grace in men, whereby he ruleth in those that
are obedient unto the same; and even in them,
who are disobedient, it hath its Rule and
Kingdom so far as to judge and condemn
them; which yet it could not do, without
some inward Dictate or witness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> As to <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 13. where Christ
<hi>Promises to send his Spirit to guide us into all
Truth:</hi> Nor do we bring this to oppose all
outward Teaching, Reading, Learning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
But still we say, seeing it was a promise made
to the Apostles, as well as unto us, it imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a real inward Teaching of God, and the
Spirit; that is somewhat further, then the
outward Teaching whatsomever, which if it
may and ought to be called immediate in the
Apostles, may and ought also to be called
immediate in Gods people now, and always
to the end of the World, seeing the promise
is the same to both; and therefore hath the
same performance at least in kind, if not in
degree.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The same false and absurd charge
he is guilty of, as to 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 20, 27. which
mentioneth, <hi>The Anointing which taught them
all things, so that they needed not any man
to Teach them.</hi> For we bring not this place to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60394:57"/>
oppose all outward Preaching or Teaching
of men, of God truly sent and called by him;
But only the bare dead and dry Teaching of
men, who run, and God hath not sent them.
And also the words may be understood in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of an absolute necessity; so as they who
are come to that inward Anointing, and that
it abide in them, they have not an absolute
necessity of outward true Teachers, so as they
must need perish, for want of them, if so be
at any time, they could not be had, as doth
at times come to pass. And thus also that of
<hi>Ieremiah</hi> 31. 31, 32, 33, 34. is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
importing likewise that all True Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
should have that experimental know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God and acquaintance with him,
by the inward Teachings of his Spirit, so as
none should be wholly ignorant of God, but
all should know him in measure; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it should not be needful to say unto any
of them, know the Lord; as if they were
utterly ignorant of him, in respect of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
and experimental knowledge, as indeed
many or most of the people under the Law
were: Which yet hinders not, but that still
there will be both need and great use of True
Teachers in the Church to the Worlds end,
though not to say, know the Lord, (as if
they did not in any measure know him) yet
to promote and advance them who know
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60394:57"/>
him already, in more knowledge of him;
and of the great and deep Mysteries of his
Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> He saith, <hi>That engrafted word men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned</hi>
Jam. 1. 21. which we are bid receive,
<hi>is the Scripture, and not Christ, or his Light.</hi>
For he saith, <hi>We cannot in proper Speech be
said to receive or hear a Dictate within, which
we have already, and is not audible properly.</hi> But
how weak is this Argument? Could not the
Prophets and Apostles both hear and receive
Christ, whom they had already? were they
not still more and more to receive him. And
have we not the Scripture already, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
according to <hi>I. A.</hi> we cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it. And that he saith, <hi>A Dictate within
is not audible properly.</hi> But why not as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
as a Dictate without? Seeing the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Hearing and Seeing are as proper in
their kind, as the Natural are in their kind.
And according to this reasoning of <hi>I. A.</hi> none
of the Prophets nor Apostles were to hear
God, or the Spirit in them, seeing nothing
within, is audible properly. And as for the
word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that is <hi>Englished, Engrafted,</hi> it
doth most properly signifie innate, and is
commonly understood of that which origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
is Grafted or Implanted in us; and in
this sense is used generally both by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
and Heathen Writers, as it is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinguished<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:60394:58"/>
from that which is outwardly
received. Hence the natural love or affection
that is in mankind, is said to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the
which is not a thing outwardly received, and
consequently the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, cannot be
the Letter of the Scripture, but a Divine prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
immediately grafted into our Souls, when
God Created them? and in respect of which,
men are said to be made in the Image of
God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> He alledgeth, that we bring
<hi>Heb. 6. 1, 2. To oppose and reject all External
Ordinances out of the Church citing Principles
of Truth,</hi> pag. 63, 68, 77, 80. And here he
insulteth not a little, as if by the same Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>were obliged to reject the
very Principles of the Doctrine of Christ, and the
foundation of Repentance and Faith, as well as
Water-Baptism.</hi> But to this I Answer, having
examined these pages cited by him, I do not
find, that they mention or intend any thing
of rejecting the Principles of the Doctrine of
Christ, or External Ordinances. And let but
the Reader examine the words, and he shall
find, that nothing further is intended, than
this, that people should not sit down, or
build their Faith upon a form of words,
though never so sound, but should come
further than all words; so that leaving them
behind, as in respect of a foundation, they
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60394:58"/>
were to come unto Christ the true foundation,
and grow up in him unto perfection. And as
for Water-baptism, that place of the <hi>Heb.</hi>
6. 1, 2. doth not mention it, among the
principles of the Doctrine of Christ, but only
the Doctrine of Baptisms, which is another
thing than Water-Baptism. For although we
have not Water-Baptism among us, yet we
have the Doctrine of Baptisms, that is set
down, with other principles of our Faith, as
in divers other of our Book, so in that men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
by him, called, <hi>The Principles of Truth.</hi>
Now to leave a form of Words, or Articles
and Propositions concerning Faith, which
commonly are called Principles, so as not to
set them up for the principal and only founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Faith, which people are but too
ready to do. This is not to reject them, no
more than when a man leaves his Affairs he
hath been conversant in, and goeth to his
Bed to rest him with moderate sleep, is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
his Affairs, for he returneth unto them
again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> He saith, <hi>We object that</hi> Enoch,
Noah, Abraham, <hi>&amp;c. Had not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to be their Rule, and therefore nor are we
to have it to be our Rule:</hi> And this he makes
as ridiculous a consequence, as to say, the
Scriptures were not written in the primitive
World, therefore neither afterwards. But I
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60394:59"/>
Answer, that to argue from thence, that the
Scripture is not to be our only and principal
Rule, is both safe and pertinent. For it
<hi>Enoch, Noah, Abraham</hi> had the Spirit to be
a Rule unto them, it is no less a rule unto all
now, who have the same Faith which they
had; seeing the same Spirit is given to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
now, which they had, which Spirit
is one, as <hi>Paul</hi> hath declared; and it is most
Rational, that as the Faith is one, in all
Ages of the World, and the Spirit one, so the
Principal rule of Faith should be one also.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ninthly,</hi> He saith, <hi>I object, (Quaker<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>sm no

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mony of the
Spirit within, is greater than the External Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Scripture; and therefore the said
Testimony of the Spirit is the Principal Rule.</hi>
To which he roundly Answereth, by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that there is any such Testimony of the
Spirit within Believers; and because I say
there is, he alledgeth I drive the Plough be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Oxen. But I Answer, that I have
proved it sufficiently already; and now also I
have Answered I hope sufficiently, all his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
against it. And here I desire the
Reader to take notice, how that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<hi>I. A.</hi> saith elsewhere, as Pag. 44.
<hi>That he and his Brethren never denyed the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
Teaching,</hi> Yet how inconsistent that is,
with denying any Testimony of the Spirit, or
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60394:59"/>
Dictate thereof, in mens hearts. Is the Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Spirit, only an outward thing?
Is it nothing else, but to Hear or Read the
Letter of the Scripture? And are they all
Taught of the Spirit, who are but only and
meerly Taught by the Letter? But if it be
granted, that there is an inward Teaching
of the Spirit, distinct from the outward
Teaching of the Scripture, although not se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
therefrom, or without the outward,
as I know some of the more sober doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge;
then I say, is not that inward
Teaching a Testimony of the Spirit? For to
affirm it to be a Teaching, and no Testimony,
seemeth to me to be a great contradiction.
And as for us, althogh we cannot say that
the inward Teaching or Testimony of the
Spirit is never in any case, without the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
yet we grant it is oft accompanied with
the outward, and in that case, it is no less
truly immediate, than if it were without it, as I
have already shewed. And supposing, but
not at all granting, that the inward Teaching
of the Spirit were never without the outward
of the Letter; yet seeing the outward Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Letter, is oft without the inward,
(for many are Taught by the Letter, who
are not Spiritually Taught, all that the Letter
hath outwardly Taught them) it followeth
evidently that the inward Teaching of the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60394:60"/>
Spirit, and outward Teaching of the Letter
are distinct things, as is manifest from that
sure maxime, that when two things can be
seperate, so as the one to be without the other,
they are really distinct. This Argument I used
in my Book called <hi>Quakerism no Popery;</hi> but
<hi>I. A.</hi> hath made no reply to it. And still I
say, if the inward Teaching of the Spirit be
denyed, it doth follow, that in respect of any
inward Speaking, or Teaching, God doth
no more intelligibly or perceptibly speak to
the Saints, than he speaketh to the Earth to
bring forth Grass; the which consequence <hi>I.
A.</hi> seemeth to allow, but how absurdly, I
leave to sober men to judge.</p>
               <p>And whereas <hi>I. A.</hi> saith, <hi>That God doth not
always make use of the greater Witnesses for
testifying his will to us.</hi> I Answer, In respect of
men and Angels, it is true: But notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
God hath given himself, and his own
Holy Spirit, which is one with him, to be
unto us a witness of his will; and this is the
greatest witness that can be given: See <hi>Rom.

               <head>CHAP. VIII.</head>
               <p>IN his pretended Survey of the Fifth Query,
he begins with two false Charges against
us, the First, <hi>That we deny all Scripture Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation;</hi>
the Second, <hi>That we deny all Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Consequences;</hi> And to refute these idle
Suppositions, which are none of our Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
he spendeth many Pages of his Book
to no purpose, and wherein we are nothing
concerned to Answer: For we own both Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
interpretation, and just and necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
of Scripture; but then we say, that
these interpretations and consequences ought
to be by the help and direction of the same
Spirit that gave forth the Scriptures, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
teaching them to interpret, and to draw
such consequences therefrom; to which <hi>I. A.</hi>
doth not pretend, nor any of his Brethren.
For all the Interpretations and consequences
which Christ or the Apostles used, were
by the same Spirit that was in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets;
and <hi>Peter</hi> saith expresly that no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
of Scripture is of private Interpretation;
and it is said of Christ, that he opened the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings
of the Disciples that they might
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:60394:61"/>
understand the Scriptures, which opening was
by his Spirit that he gave unto them, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Scripture cannot be understood without
the opening of the Spirit that gave it forth, it
cannot be interpreted without the same; nor
can consequences be lawfully deduced from
Scriptures without it; for how can a man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
what he doth not understand? or how
can he deduce a consequence from that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he is ignorant?</p>
               <p>And there is yet another fault that we find
in <hi>I. A.</hi> and his Brethrens interpretations of
Scripture and consequences therefrom, that they
keep not closely to Scripture it self, when they
interpret, or draw consequences, but for most
part, mingle with the Scripture words many of
their false principles and Axioms of that they
call their Philosophy. For as I have already
said; the most part of that they call their Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
is utterly false or uncertain; nor are
the Teachers of it agreed among themselves,
in their Principles and Axioms. And yet
their Consequences are commonly from one or
other of these false or uncertain Maxims or
Principles which they joyn with the Scripture,
in which case the consequences are not purely
Scriptural. For seeing in Argumentation, the
Conclusion or Consequence is drawn from two
Propositions or Premisses, one of which may
be true, the other false. Again, the one may
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60394:61"/>
be true and certain, the other although true,
yet may be to us uncertain and doubtful; in
which cases, the consequence or conclusion is
always of the nature of the weaker premise,
hence if but one of the premisses be false, the
conclusion is false, although the other Premise
be true: And if one of the Premisses be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clear
or uncertain, the conclusion is also un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain.
And again, if one of the Premisses
be Scripture, and the other be but some prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
or maxime of Natural Philosophy so
called, the conclusion in that case is not
Scriptural, but Natural: And thus much is
generally acknowledged by all the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
so called. And hence it is that the
School-Divinity, as it is so termed is rejected
by many, as a dubious and uncertain thing,
because the conclusions thereof, for most part,
depend not on Scripture Propositions, but
uncertain and doubtful principles and
maxims of that called Natural Philosophy.
But again, suppose one should draw a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
from Premisses that are both Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural;
yet seeing the terms in those Premisses
may have different significations, as the
words, Flesh, Spirit, Life, Light, Man, and
many others, that have one signification in one
place of Scripture, and quite another in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part of Scripture; the conclusion in that
case doth not follow, for not only the Art of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60394:62"/>
Logick, but Common Reason it self Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, that in all Arguments, the word or
term that is used in both Premisses, must have
the same sense and signification in both. Now
he who has not the direction of the same Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
that did Dictate the Scripture, hath not
this discerning so as to know the true sense or
signification of Scripture words, as they sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
Spiritual Misteries and things; <hi>For the
Natural man understands not the Things of
God,</hi> as saith the Scripture, and therefore he is
utterly unfit to reason about them. By which
natural man I understand, any man considered
as never so well furnished with all Natural
helps of his Parts and Arts, but wanting the
Spirit of God, or at least not making use of
the help of it, but puting another thing in its
room. And thus much shall suffice at present
to the Intelligent Reader, how and after
what manner we own both Scripture Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations
and Consequences; and yet may
very well deny <hi>I. A.</hi> his Interpretations and
Consequences, and all such as he is, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
themselves Enemies to that Spirit that
gave forth the Scriptures, as necessary to help
them in interpreting and drawing Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
from Scripture. And albeit <hi>I. A.</hi> use
many Arguments to prove, that Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Scripture are lawful, and Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
therefrom; as that Christ and the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60394:62"/>
Apostles did interpr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> the Scriptures, and draw
Consequences therefrom; yet all this proves
not, that <hi>I. A.</hi> his Interpretations and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences,
without the same Spirit, which
they had, are as good, which is all one as to
say, Christ and the Apostles did Interpret the
Scriptures, and argue from them by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:
And therefore <hi>I. A.</hi> and his Brethren
may as well do it, without the Spirit; but
who having common Sense, doth not see the
unreasonableness of this Consequence. Again,
as for the <hi>Levites</hi> their Expounding the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which is another Argument of <hi>I. A.</hi>
it remaineth for him to prove, that these <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi>
who did rightly Interpret the Scripture,
did it without the Spirit of God, and meerly
by their own Natural Understanding. And
what if these <hi>Levites</hi> were not in all respects
Infallible? it doth not therefore follow, that
they had no Infallible direction of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
when they did rightly Interpret the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
And indeed this is a third false Charge
of <hi>I. A.</hi> against us, as if we did hold, that
none is to Intepret the Scripture, but he who
is simply and absolutely, or in all respects In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,
which we affirm not. Nor is that
the true state of the Question, but this, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any should give an Interpretation of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
without he be Infallibly perswaded by the
Spirit of God, that he hath received it from the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60394:63"/>
Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d.</hi> We say, Nay, otherwise he Preacheth
not the Word of God to the people, but his
own Fallible conjecture. Now it is one thing
to be simply or universally Infallible, and
another thing to be Infallibly directed in some
particular cases of Interpreting some particular
places of Scripture, as God giveth to a man
the help of his Spirit so to do. And thus <hi>I. A.</hi>
his two first Sections, wherein he spendeth
18 Pages are sufficiently Answered. In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of his third Section, concerning Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
with Water, he alledgeth falsly upon
us, <hi>That wherever Bapt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sm is mentioned in the
New Testament, and the word Water is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
added; that we always deny Baptism with
Water, there to be meant.</hi> This is false, for
we grant, that though Water be not expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
yet in some places, Baptism with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is understood; as where <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>Christ
sent me not to Baptize;</hi> here we affirm, that to
Baptize signifieth to Baptize with Water.
But we say further, That the words Baptism
and Baptize, when Water is not mentioned,
do sometimes signifie Water-baptism, and at
other times not, but some other thing, as the
Baptism of the Spirit, or the Baptism of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings;
as where Christ said to two of his
Disciples, <hi>Can ye be Baptized with my Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism;</hi>
this was not Water-baptism, but the
Baptism of his Sufferings whereof they were to
be partakers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:60394:63"/>
And here in my Answer to <hi>I. A.</hi> his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
for Water-baptism, its being a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
Ordinance, it shall suffice to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
what is the principal defect of every
one of them, and wherein he comes short in
his proof as being meerly asserted, which
therefore are to be returned unto him to be
proved. In his first Argument he alledgeth,
<hi>That</hi> John <hi>the Baptist was the first Minister of
the New Testament way of Dispensation,</hi> for
which he citeth, <hi>Mat. 11, 12, 13. Luk.</hi> 16.
But these places prove no such thing, for they
do not call him the first; and the words, <hi>viz.
The Law and the Prophets was unto</hi> John; here
<hi>Iohn</hi> is the term inclusive in respect of the
Law and Prophets, as if I should say <hi>England</hi>
reaches from I ands end in <hi>Cornwall</hi> to <hi>Berwick</hi>
upon <hi>I weed;</hi> here <hi>Berwick</hi> is the term inclusive,
and therefore it doth not follow, that it is any
part of <hi>Scotland;</hi> again to say <hi>Scotland</hi> reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
from <hi>Berwick</hi> to <hi>Orknay;</hi> here again <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi>
is exclusive, in respect of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and
therefore when it is said, <hi>From</hi> John, <hi>the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
of the Kingdom is P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eached.</hi> It doth not
inferr, that the Gospel began at <hi>Iohn</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusively,
but exclusively, even as <hi>Scotland</hi>
begins at <hi>Berwick</hi> exclusively; for <hi>Iohn</hi> was
but a fore-runner of Christ, who himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
the Gospel Dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ensation, in a peculiar
way, and yet Christ also was subject to the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60394:64"/>
Law, for he was Circumcised, and did Eat
the Passover, both which were but Legal Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations.</p>
               <p>And here again, in the Prosecution of the
first Argument <hi>I. A.</hi> abuseth us, saying, <hi>That
we agree with</hi> Papists <hi>in affirming that Christs
Baptism was substantially differing from the
Baptism of</hi> John. But his fallacy lyeth in this,
that he doth not express what the <hi>Papists</hi> mean
by Christs Baptism; for they mean Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Baptism,
even as <hi>I. A.</hi> doth; but we say,
the Baptism of Christ is not with Water,
but with the Holy Ghost: Now we do not
say as the <hi>Papi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ts, That there were two Baptisms
with Water, one of</hi> John <hi>another of Christ;</hi> but
only that <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Baptism with Water, and
Christs Baptism with the Holy Ghost were
distinct, even as <hi>Iohn</hi> and Christ have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
distinguished them. And therefore the
seeond Objection he instanceth <hi>pag.</hi> 69. doth
not concern us.</p>
               <p>As to his second Argument, he taketh
great pains to prove a thing which we no wise
deny, <hi>viz. That the Disciples did Baptize di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
with Water, after Christ his Ascention,
and his giving the Holy Ghost;</hi> But it is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
that is den<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed by us, <hi>viz.</hi> That
therefore Water-Baptism, is a Gospel pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
for the Disciples practised divers things
after Christ his Ascension, which were not
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60394:64"/>
Gospel Precepts, for <hi>Paul</hi> Circumcised <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi>
long after Christ his Ascention, also he
purified himself after the manner of the Law,
none of which were Gospel Precepts. And the
Disciples did not only abstain from Blood and
things Strangled, but enjoyned it unto others,
the which Abstinance continued in the Church,
even in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s days, as is clear from his
words; and <hi>I. A.</hi> doth not hold that to be
a Gospel Precept, nor yet the Anointing
with Oyl the Sick, nor the Washing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Feet, both which were commanded and
practised in the Primitive times. And this doth
also sufficiently Answer his third Argument,
from <hi>Peter</hi> his saying, <hi>Repent and be Baptised,</hi> if
it were granted him, that Baptism with Water
is there to be understood, for <hi>Peter</hi> might see
it convenient at that time, for a help to their
weakness, who were much used with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Signs, to require it of them; which yet
proveth not, that it is a Gospel Precept: For
all Gospel Precepts reach further than unto
Figures and Signs, which are but the shadows
of Gospel Mysteries. And his fourth Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hath the same defect with the former,
that because <hi>Peter</hi> commanded <hi>Cornelius</hi> and
others with him to be Baptized, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was a Gospel Precept; which doth no
more follow, than that abstaining from Blood
was commanded by the Apostles, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60394:65"/>
it is a Gospel Precept; or because Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Sick with Oyl was commanded by
<hi>Iames,</hi> that therefore it is a Gospel Precept.</p>
               <p>And to his Fifth Argument, from <hi>Eph.</hi>
4. 5. that the one Baptism must be Water-Baptism,
because that is the only proper Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
according to the signification of the
word, whereas there is not one but mány im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
or Metaphorical Baptisms. But ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this reason of <hi>I. A.</hi> when in the
same place <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>There is one Body;</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
doth not signifie the Church: for, to call
the Church Body, is but improper and meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical;
and there are many such metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
Bodies. Also when <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>There is
one Spirit, I. A.</hi> I suppose, doth know that
Spirit, or as it is in the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, doth
not improperly and metaphorically signifie
God, as much as Baptize signifieth inward
Baptism, for the Grammatical signification of
the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, is Wind, and therefore if
<hi>I. A.</hi> his consequence hold good, when the
Apostle saith, <hi>There is one Spirit,</hi> that Spirit
must be, in the Grammatical sense, <hi>Wind,</hi>
that is a material thing, and not the Spirit of
God, even as the Baptism must be a material
or outward Baptism. And thus we may see,
whether <hi>I. A.</hi> his blind way of drawing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
doth lead him, even to the greatest
impertinencies imaginable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:60394:65"/>
His sixth Argument from <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16.
hath this defect, that seeing the word <hi>Baptised</hi>
cannot be meant of Conversion, or any other
metaphorical Baptism, it must therefore be
meant of Water-baptism. And it cannot be
meant of Conversion, because of the order of
the words, which requireth Faith to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Baptism, whereas Faith cannot go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Conversion, because Faith is Conversion
it self. I say his Argument hath this defect,
that it confounds the part with the whole, for
granting that Faith is Conversion in part, or
in some degree; it doth not follow, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is the whole, or furthest degree of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version;
for the work of Conversion, or
Sanctification hath its several degrees, and
that high or eminent degree of the Souls puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
which may be called its Bap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ism, or
through plunging, is really posterior to the
Souls first believing, and is the effect or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
of it. Hence we read of purifying
the heart by Faith, so as the purification is the
effect and consequent of Faith. Again,
whereas he laboureth to prove that the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
that saveth, which is mentioned, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi>
3. 21. must be Water-baptism, because it is
called the <hi>Anti-type,</hi> or thing signified, in
respect of <hi>Noah</hi>'s temporal saving by Water,
and there must be some near resemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
a <hi>Type</hi> and its <hi>Anti-type,</hi> but he alledgeth
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60394:66"/>
there is little or no resemblance betwixt <hi>Noah</hi>'s
temporal saving by Water, and the saving by
the inward or Spiritual Baptism. But who is so
blind or weak, that doth not see the falsehood
of this his Assertion? Is there not the greatest and
most near and infallible resemblance betwixt
that temporal Salvation of <hi>Noah</hi> by Water,
and the spiritual and eternal Salvation by the
spiritual Baptism, which doth universally and
infallibly save all Souls that are partakers of
the said spiritual Baptism, whereas many
thousands get the Water-baptism, who are
not saved thereby? and therefore it doth much
more naturally follow that not Water-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
but the Baptism of the Spirit that doth
infallibly purifie the Soul is here meant, even
as the inward Circumcision of the Spirit, is
the <hi>Anti-type,</hi> or thing signified by outward
Circumcision.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> As to his seventh Argument; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
he laboureth to prove, <hi>That Water-baptism
is meant,</hi> Matth. 28. 19, 20. whereof he is so
confident, that he entreats his Reader, <hi>Not
to believe him henceforth, if he do not prove it
so to be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> I shall briefly take his proof into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> He says, <hi>The</hi> Greek <hi>Word which is
Translated</hi> Teach, <hi>signifies to make Disciples,
and therefore they were to be made Disciples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were to be Baptized; but they could
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60394:66"/>
not be made Disciples before Conversion, nor does
Conversion pre-require Discipleship, or else no
man might endeavour the Conversion of an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
or of any man who is not before Hand a
Disciple.</hi> To which I Answer, That granting
the <hi>Greek</hi> word may signifie to make Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
yet all this reasoning of <hi>I. A.</hi> doth not
inferr, that by Baptizing here, cannot be
meant the Spiritual Baptizing, by the effusion
of the Spiritual Water upon them, which, as
is already said, signifies not barely the first
or lowest degree of Conversion, but an high
or eminent degree thereof, even as the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Plunging or Dipping into Water, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
more than a small Sprinkling. Now as true
Faith is before this eminent degree of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
or Purification, so is also true Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipleship:
Nor doth it follow, that else no
man might endeavour the Conversion of an
Heathen; for they were to endeavour
the full and perfect Conversion of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
in the highest degree that was
possible; but so as to do it in Gods way and
order, to wit, first by Teaching and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling
them into the true Faith, and then their
full and perfect Conversion, or Purification
and Spiritual Cleansing, was to follow one
degree after another.</p>
               <p>His other reason is, <hi>That the Baptism of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
or the Spiritual cleansing of the Soul is but
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60394:67"/>
only improper and Metaphorical; and we must <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
throw about the words of any Text of Scripture,
from a proper to an improper meaning, without
some necessity constrain us so to do.</hi> To this
I Answer, <hi>First,</hi> That we ought not to go
from the proper signification of any word,
to an improper, without some urgent neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
I already acknowledge. But then why
doth <hi>I. A.</hi> and his Brethren frequently trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
this Rule in expounding other places of
Scripture; as to instance when the Scripture
saith, <hi>Christ died for all men, I. A.</hi> expoundeth
this <hi>all,</hi> not of all individuals of mankind
but only some, and these the far less number;
and yet he must needs acknowledge, that the
proper signification of the word <hi>all,</hi> is all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual.
Again, when the Scripture saith,
<hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Kingdom of God is within you, I. A.</hi> turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it, <hi>to among you,</hi> contrary to the proper
sig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ification, and also to the common Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tion.
Also when the Scripture speaketh
frequently of Christ and the Holy Spirit being
in the Saints, they commonly say, <hi>This is not
to be meant properly, but figuratively understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by Christ and the Spirit, the effects and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
or Graces of the Spirit, and not Christ or
the Spirit himself;</hi> And many instances of
that nature can be given, to shew how <hi>I. A.</hi>
and his Brethren go from the proper significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Scripture words, to an improper,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60394:67"/>
without any necessity, unless that of their own
devising.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Secondly, I. A.</hi> doth but barely take it
for granted, without any shadow of proof,
that it is an improper meaning, to mean by
the Baptism of Christ, the spiritual Baptism.
For the proper meaning of any place or sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Scripture, is certainly that meaning
which the Spirit of God doth intend, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be a Metaphor used in that place or
not. Nor doth the Metaphorical use of the
word, hinder the meaning of it to be proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>when
it is so intended. And seeing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
doth almost every whereabound with Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors
and metaphorical expressions, we are
not so much to consider, what is the bare
Grammatical sense of any word in common
Speech, as what is the most common and usual
sense of it in Scripture; for what is the most,
common sense of it in Scripture I judge is
the most proper meaning of it, whether the
word be otherwise metaphorical or not; for
who will deny, but according to Scripture
sense, by the word <hi>Christ</hi> is properly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
the true Christ of God, to wit, <hi>His on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
begotten Son;</hi> and yet Grammatically, it is
but metaphorical; at least, as much as the
word <hi>Baptize,</hi> for <hi>Christ</hi> signifieth <hi>Anointed,</hi>
even as <hi>Baptized</hi> signifieth <hi>Was<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed</hi> or <hi>Dipped;</hi>
and if <hi>I. A.</hi> or any will contend, <hi>That Christ
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60394:68"/>
is properly called Christ or Anointed, because the
spiritual Anointing is as real and proper in its
kind, as the outward and natural is in its kind;</hi>
I shall not contend against them, but rather go
along with them therein; but then I say also,
that the <hi>spiritual Baptism</hi> is as real and proper
in its kind, as the <hi>spiritual Anointing</hi> is in its
kind; and thus also when Christ is called
<hi>Bread</hi> in Scripture, in the Scripture sense, he
is truly and properly called so; yea, why
doth he call himself, <hi>The true Bread;</hi> and why
said he that the <hi>Manna</hi> which <hi>Moses</hi> gave to
the People in the <hi>Wilderness,</hi> was not the true
<hi>Bread</hi> from <hi>Heaven.</hi> Doth not this signifie,
that whatever vertue or excellency outward,
Bread hath to feed the Body Christ, who is
the inward and spiritual Bread hath it much
more to feed the Soul, yea, and the Body al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
when he pleaseth so to do; and in this
respect it is that some do affirm, <hi>That those
names of Bread, Water, Light, Oyl, and the
lik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, are more properly applyed to the spiritual
than to the natural: so that the Water, Oyl,
Light and Bread, that is but outward and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
is rather metaphorically so called, and the
inward and spiritual, more truly and properly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ving
those names.</hi> And thus the spiritual
Baptism shall be the most proper in that sense
also. But now let the Scripture be searched,
and we shall find, that the word to <hi>Baptize,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:60394:68"/>
doth no less commonly signifie the spiritual
Baptism, than the outward and Elementary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and therefore whoever would perswade us to
believe that the spiritual Baptism is not meant
here in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19, 20. must shew some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinsible
necessity, why it ought not, the which
<hi>I. A.</hi> hath not as yet done; and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
we have good ground to believe, that
the spiritual only is meant, because it is the
spiritual Baptism only, which is called the
Baptism of Christ in Scripture, and is expresly
distinguished from the Baptism of <hi>Iohn</hi> with
Water; and certainly the Baptism which
Christ commanded, was his own Baptism,
whereof he gave the Apostles charge to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
it as servants and instruments under him,
who made them Ministers of the Spirit and
Power that was in him, by whose Ministry,
others were partakers of the same. But if
<hi>I. A.</hi> his Argument hold good, the spiritual
Baptism is altogether excluded, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
received no Authority to Administer the
Baptism of the Spirit, but only of Water,
and consequently they were no Minister of the
Spirit, for how could they Minister of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
or the spiritual <hi>Baptism,</hi> unless they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Authority so to do; and where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
they this Authority or Command; if
not, when Christ said these words unto them.
Again, if Christ had sent the Apostles to <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:60394:69"/>
with Water, then certainly he had sent
<hi>Paul</hi> a Chief Apostle, but <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>Christ
sent him not to Baptize,</hi> to wit, <hi>with Water.</hi>
But whereas <hi>I. A.</hi> doth alledge, that <hi>Paul</hi>
meaneth, <hi>That Christ sent him not principally to
Baptize;</hi> I ask him, Why doth he transgress
his own Rule, to go from the proper to the
improper, and unusual signification of the
word, not which is absolutely Negative, and
not Comparative, and that without any ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t
necessity, but that of his own meer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising;
and that he saith, <hi>Doubtless the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
did not Baptize without a Commission;</hi> I
Answer, this is barely asserted without proof,
why might not <hi>Paul</hi> and others <hi>Baptize</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Commission, <hi>to wit,</hi> by a permission,
as well as he did Circumcise, and did other
things of the Law, and that without any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>tion
of Will-worship.</p>
               <p>Having thus Answered <hi>I. A.</hi> his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
I shall not need to answer his Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or pretended refutation of our Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and that especially because some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of
them which he bringeth as our Arguments,
are not really ours; and none of them he
bringeth doth he fairly propose; and therefore
I shall refer the Reader to our other Treatises,
wherein our Arguments are more duly and
fairly proposed, without rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ating them here,
because of Brevity. Only whereas he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:60394:69"/>
we argue that Water-baptism is not
meant, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19, 20. because not expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
I say, that <hi>Baptism</hi> with <hi>Water</hi> is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
nor by any true and just consequence
is proved to be meant in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. and
therefore we are not bound to believe that
Water-baptism is there understood. And I
hope the intelligent and impartial Reader
may see, that <hi>I. A.</hi> hath not proved it to be
so meant, by all his endeavours, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not of his own mouth, henceforth he is
not to be believed.</p>
               <p>As concerning <hi>I. A.</hi> his Fourth Section,
which is altogether concerning <hi>Infant-Baptism,</hi>
I might wave it, because it proceeds upon a
bare Supposition that is not proved, <hi>viz. That
Water-Baptism is a Gospel Precept.</hi> And see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Controversie is most proper betwixt
him, and these called <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> wherein we
are little concerned, I shall not insist to Answer
every thing, only I cannot but take notice of
some of his most gross and impertinent As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions
and Proofs.</p>
               <p>He alledgeth Baptism under the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament

to this I may reply in his own language
elsewhere, <hi>He putteth the Plough <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>before the
Oxen,</hi> because he supposeth still a thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
proof, that Water-baptism is any New
Testament Precept. Again he alledgeth,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:60394:70"/>
                  <hi>That Boptism with Water is come <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n the room of
Circumcision, because</hi> Paul <hi>saith,</hi> Col. 2. 11, 12.
<hi>Our burial with Christ in Baptism is our Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision.</hi>
But he hath not proved that the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
there mentioned, is Water-baptism;
where is his consequence for this? And why
doth he expound the Circumcision to be spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
in that place; and the Baptism out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and visible? Is it not more proper to
take them both spiritually, and then his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
doth wholly vanish? And I find,
ask him, <hi>Are all buried with Christ, who are
B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ptized with Water;</hi> if he say <hi>Not,</hi> as he
ought, then surely the Water-baptism, is not
the Baptism there understood. Another Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of his, is, <hi>That because the Infants of
Believers are probably partakers of Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which is the thing sealed or signified; that
therefore they ought to be baptized with Water.</hi>
But this Argument proves as much, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
should also have that called the Supper,
because Christ who was signified thereby, doth
as probably belong to Infants as Regeneration,
seeing none can have Regeneration without
Christ, and I would know what <hi>I. A.</hi> doth
say to this; or let him shew a reason why his
Argument prove the one rather than the
other. And it seems, that for that, or the
like reason, <hi>Augustine</hi> and others of those cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Fathers, were for giving that called
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60394:70"/>
the Supper to Infants, as well as Water-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism;
and in that respect was long ago really
administred to them.</p>
               <p>But seeing <hi>I. A.</hi> hath spent so much Paper
on Water-baptism, why saith he nothing to
sprinkling of Infants? why doth he not so
much as attempt to prove that sprinkling with
Water, is, or ever was the true form of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
with Water, although the Question doth
expresly mention it. Thus we see how all
along hitherto, <hi>I. A.</hi> hath left the substance of
the Queries unanswered.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="9" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. IX.</head>
               <p>BEfore my Answer to <hi>I. A.</hi> his pretended
Survey of the Sixth Query, which is
concerning that called the Sacrament of the
Supper, I shall premise these few particulars:
1. That we do not deny but own and believe
that all true Christians and Believers do eat of
Christ's body, and drink of his blood, and
that beyond, or what is more than a figure or
figurative Commemoration thereof, to wit,
really and substantially, yet so as spiritually,
and by Faith, and not outwardly and with
the outward or bodily mouth. 2. Nor do
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60394:71"/>
we deny, but that in all our Eatings and
Drinkings, we are to remember the Lords
Death, and so Eat with Holy Fear and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,
and Thankfulness. 3. And we
deny not, but that the night wherein he was
betrayed, he took Bread and brake it, after
Supper, and having given Thanks, he gave
it unto his Apostles, saying, <hi>Take Eat this is
my Body,</hi> and likewise the Cup, saying, <hi>Drink
ye all of it, for as oft as ye Eate this Bread, and
Drink this Cup, ye shew forth the Lords Death
until he come:</hi> So we grant, he gave them a
Commandment to do the like for sometime
to come: But that which is Queried is this,
Where is it called a Gospel Ordinance, or
standing Command of Christ unto the
Worlds end, to Eat Bread and Drink Wine
after Supper in a peculiar and solemn way of
Commemoration, over and besides that
which may and ought to be done every day?
And whereas Christ said, <hi>Do this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of his Death, till he come again.</hi> It is
Queried, Was this coming to the end of the
World, or was it his coming to dwell in them?
Now saith <hi>I. A.</hi> to all this, first he alledgeth,
<hi>It was a meer Circumstance, the doing of it at
night, and after Supper, and so is no Essential
part of the Action.</hi> But he giveth no proof
of this: And if men take a liberty to change
one Circumstance, why may they not change
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60394:71"/>
all the rest as well as that one. As for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
why may they not say, that Bread of
Wheat, and the Wine, are but Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
also, seeing Eating and Drinking may
be without either Wheat or Wine, as well
as it may be any other time, then at Night.
Again, why may it not be said, that the
whole Action is but a Circumstance in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the thing principally intended, which
was to signifie our Spiritual Eating and Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Christ his Body and Blood; which may
be very well without the outward Eating and
Drinking, as all Protestants do generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge;
and thus the outward Eating and
Drinking is but a Circumstance, as well as the
time: And surely the time doth seem no less
to have signification, than the Eating and
Drinking it self had, to wit, that it was at
Night; for that time when Christ suffered was
the Evening, or last part of the Covenant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensation,
wherein he gave them a Sign or
Figure suitable to that present Dispensation,
and was not to continue as a binding thing,
after the Gospel day or Dispensation should
clearly break up, or be dispersed. And it doth
plainly enough appear, that in the primitive
times, they who used that Solemnity, they
laid weight upon the circumstance of the time,
doing it at Night, and after Supper; which
came in process of time to be changed, to the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60394:72"/>
doing of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, because it was done in the
Night or Evening of the Old Covenant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensation,
and consequently was to come to
an end with it. Although for the weakness
of some, it was continued for a time in the
Primitive Church after the Night of the Old
Covenant was expired, and the day of the
Gospel Dispensation was clearly broke up:
And another Argument we have, that the
outward Bread and Wine is but a Figure of
Christs Flesh and Blood, and not his real Body,
as all Protestants acknowledge, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
is no Gospel Ordinance, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists

Figures, Types and Shaddows thereof by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
as they were able to bear. But it doth
not follow, that because Christ commanded
it unto them, for that time, or sometime
following, that therefore it is a Gospel Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
seeing he commanded them as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
divers other things, which <hi>I. A.</hi> and
his Brethren acknowledge are no Gospel Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
<hi>As the washing one anothers Feet;</hi> also,
<hi>That they should go and tarry at</hi> Jerusalem <hi>for
certain days, and wait for the Promise of the
Father.</hi> And he bid them, <hi>Provide neither
Bag, nor Shoes, nor Money, when they went
forth to Preach:</hi> But I suppose none of all
these will <hi>I. A.</hi> or his Brethren plead to be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
Ordinances. And even as his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them to tarry at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> until they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Promise of the Father; which was
the Spirit, (to wit, in greater measure than
formerly it was given unto them) did not
oblige them to stay longer: So his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them to use that solemn and peculiar
<pb facs="tcp:60394:73"/>
commemoration of his Death until he sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

come, did not oblige them longer, than un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
that his coming. But now the Question is,
What coming did Christ mean, whether his
last coming at the end of the World, or his
Spiritual coming to dwell in them, and feed
with his real Flesh and Blood Spiritually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
which is more than the Figure? We
say it is his Spiritual coming in his Saints; but
<hi>I. A.</hi> and his Brethren say, <hi>It is his outward
coming,</hi> which yet he hath not proved, for
all his wrangling. And instead of proving
what he saith, he not only abuseth us with
bad words, as calling us, <hi>Possest with a blind
and deaf Spirit;</hi> but most falsly alleadgeth on
us, that we hold, <hi>Christ did not dwell in his
Apostles, before that time, when Christ took the
Bread:</hi> For we say no such thing, nor is any
thing of that sort insinuated in the Queries:
Only, <hi>That Christ did promise unto them, that
he would come and dwell in them,</hi> to wit, in a
more abun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ant measure, and clearer way of
manifestation, suitable to the Gospel Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
than formerly they witnessed under
the Law. Nor will this argue that either the
Apostles were wholly unconverted, or unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated
at that time; all this is but the bare
imagination of <hi>I. A.</hi> his Brain, and no just
or true consequence from our words. And
whereas <hi>I. A.</hi> Querieth, <hi>Did not Christ dwell
<pb facs="tcp:60394:73"/>
in these</hi> Corinthians <hi>whom</hi> Paul <hi>writes to.</hi> I
Answer, he did in some measure; but
yet in diverse of them, he did not
dwell in that measure or manner of clear
manifestation, as was promised; for <hi>Paul</hi>
said unto them, <hi>He could not write unto them
as spiritual, but as carnal, and he fed them with
milk, and not with meat;</hi> which plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
that many of them was short of that
measure and degree of Spirituality, which
the pure Gospel state required. And as for
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23, 24. Which <hi>I. A.</hi> bringeth to
prove, <hi>That the outward Eating is a Gospel In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution;</hi>
I Answer, that place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.
23, 24. contains no Institution of it at all, but
only an Historical relation of what Christ did
and said that night to his Disciples. Nor did
<hi>Paul</hi> say, that he received a Command from
the Lord, or delivered a command unto them,
concerning <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine;</hi> but that which
he received and delivered unto them from the
Lord was, the knowledge of what the Lord
did and said at that time. And though this
practise was continued in the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi>
for that time, and perhaps in other
Chruches, this proves it not be a Gospel
Ordinance more than Water-baptism, or Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,
both which were practised by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that did believe in those times.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:60394:74"/>
And here again <hi>I. A.</hi> falls into his old trade
of fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly accusing us, as being against all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Ordinances, because the Query in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuates,
<hi>That such who are come into Death
with Christ, need not Bread and Wine to put them
into remembrance of his Death;</hi> from whence
he most unjustly inferreth his consequence,
that we reject all outward helps and means
whatsoever. But doth not <hi>I. A.</hi> know that
his own brethren acknowledge there is no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
necessity of using that called the Supper,
so as none can be saved but such as pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>take of
it; and the like may be said of any outward
helps, when people cannot have them. But
yet we say still, whatever outward thing
God hath Commanded us to use, be it never
so small or mean, is in that respect both neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
and profitable unto us, for there is none
of God's Commands, but they bring along
with them a real advantage to mens Souls;
but <hi>I. A.</hi> hath not as yet proved it, that using
<hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> as aforesaid, is any Gospel
Command. Another abuse of his is, that he
alledgeth, <hi>We reject the said practise of taking
the Bread and Wine, from a conceited perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
which is false, for as we do not boast of
our perfections, so we do not reject that cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
because of any perfection, that some of
us may become unto beyond others, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we cannot find it to be any Gospel Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept;
<pb facs="tcp:60394:74"/>
and therefore we cannot acknowledge
it either to be necessary or profitable to the
weakest.</p>
               <p>Another thing he quarrelleth in the Query
is, <hi>That it makes to dye with Christ, and to come
to the Death with him all one.</hi> And here he
insults not a little in his knowledge of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
above the <hi>Quakers,</hi> for a meer <hi>Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticism</hi>
of saying <hi>to</hi> for <hi>into,</hi> which perhaps was
only a fault in the Transcriber; and yet we
find commonly that <hi>to</hi> and <hi>into</hi> are indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
used to signifie one thing: as <hi>to</hi> come to
Town, is all one as to come <hi>into</hi> it; and <hi>to</hi>
come to Christ, is all one as to come <hi>into</hi> him;
and when Christ said, <hi>Come unto me,</hi> he did
certainly mean that they were to come <hi>into</hi>
him. Hence we read of the Saints being in
Christ. And if this be <hi>I. A.</hi> his Philosophy
so to quarrel at words proper enough, and
according to Scripture, let the judicious and
sober Reader judge, whether some of our
Friends that called his Philosophy, Fooloso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
had not ground so to do. And whether
he has not discovered more folly than true
Philosophy, from first to last, in his Book
against us.</p>
               <p>In his Answer to the reason hinted in the
Query from <hi>Paul</hi>'s words, to seek the things
that are above, and the things that are seen
are temporal, he still beggeth the Question,
<pb facs="tcp:60394:75"/>
                  <hi>That the outward observation of Bread and
Wine, is a mean which God hath appointed, for
the attaining the things above.</hi> And in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to his <hi>Assertion,</hi> let him read what
<hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 17. where he putteth mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
and drink in together with the new Moons,
and other legal Observations, which he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,
<hi>A shadow of things to come;</hi> but the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is of Christ. And seeing <hi>I. A.</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
that the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> are but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
signs, and not the real body of Christ;
I ask him, wherein then differ they from
<hi>Shadows.</hi> And if they be <hi>Shadows,</hi> they are
no part of the Gospel Dispensation, according
to <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine.</p>
               <p>In the close of his pretended Survey to this
Sixth Query, he chargeth us most rashly and
uncharitably, as being related to the accuser
of the Brethren, as if the writer of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
had positively charged all the Ministers of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> that they never intended their
Hearers should come any nearer to Christs
Death, than a bare Historical remembrance
thereof. But doth not <hi>I. A.</hi> know, that to
Query a thing is one, and positively to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
it, far another. And the Enquirer had
ground so to Query, because he understands,
that if it were the care of Preachers to bring
people into the Death with Christ, so as to be
Crucified with him, they would not plead so
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60394:75"/>
much for upholding a Figure or Shadow of
Christ's Death, to put them in remembrance
of it; when to suffer and die with Christ is
much more effectual to remember them. Nor
<hi>Secondly,</hi> would they plead so much for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
a body of sin about with them, while
they live, and that all must be under a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of sinning daily in Thought, Word, and
Deed; yea, in whatever thay think, speak,
or do, for such a state is not consistent with a
being Dead and Crucified with Christ. And
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> If it were their work to bring
people to dye with Christ, they would turn
them to the Light of Christ in their Hearts,
and Preach it to be unto them of a saving Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and an effectual mean to obtain the said
Death with Christ, which yet they do not,
but on the contrary deny it as meerly natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
insufficient. And is it not too apparent
that the far greatest number of your Church
Members, know nothing more of Christ's
Death than the History of it? And whether
the fault of this lye not in a very great part up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Preachers, is no small nor impertinent
Question.</p>
               <p>And seeing <hi>I. A.</hi> pretends so much to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
Rule, I shall ask him a few Queries
more upon the former Head.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:60394:76"/>
                  <hi>First,</hi> What Scripture hath he and his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
to call that eating of Bread and drinking
of Wine, once or twice in a year, in the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Assembly, the Sacrament?</p>
               <p>2. What Scripture have they to instruct them
how oft they should use it, as once, twice, or four
times in every year? And if they have none, was
it not then left to people according to the Query,
at least as to the time?</p>
               <p>3. What Scripture have they for consecrating
it, or when did Christ say, Before ye eat it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate
it?</p>
               <p>4. When did Christ give only the power to a
Priest or Presbyter, or Ordamed Minister to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate
it, so as without the said Consecration by
some Priest, or Ordained Minister, it is no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament?
And seeing every Christian may eat it
as well as the Minister, why may he not also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate
it, as well as he, seeing every true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is a Priest?</p>
               <p>5. Where did Christ appoint, that these words,
<hi>Take Eat, this is my body,</hi> should be the words
of consecration, and have ye not received all this
from the Papists, and not from Christ?</p>
               <p>6. Seeing ye commonly say, that this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:60394:76"/>
Minister to celebrate that called the Supper?</p>
               <p>7. Seeing every true Christian feeds daily by
Faith upon the body of Christ, according to
the Protestant Doctrine, and ought daily to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the Death of Christ, in all their eating
and drinking, which is also sanctified unto them
by the Word of God and Prayer, what peculiar
vertue or efficacy hath your sacramental eating,
more than ordinary eating; when done, with
godly Fear, Prayer and Thansgiving, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
the Lords Death?</p>
               <p>8. Seeing it is clear from <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 17, 18,
19, 20. that Christ did take the cup twice; once
before he gave them the bread, and once after,
bidding them do the same; why take ye the cup
but once? was this only a bare circumstance?</p>
               <p>9. Is not the Apostle <hi>Paul, 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 15,
16, 17. to be understood of quite another Bread
and Cup, than that which is visible and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
when he saith, <hi>I speak as to wise men,
judge ye what I say</hi> (did he not say this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was to speak of the Bread and Cup, in
the mysterie, as it was altogether a spiritual and
invisible thing, to wit, the real body and blood of
Christ spiritually received, which none but the

of the blood of Christ? The bread which we

                  </gap> of that one Bread. Is it
not clear from all this, that <hi>Paul</hi> speaks not of
any visible and corruptible Bread but of Christ
himself, as he is spiritually and invisibly received
by Faith whom he calls the same spiritual meat
and drink, which the Fathers received of old?
see the same Chapter, <hi>Verse</hi> 3, 4.</p>
               <p>10. Do any receive the Supper of the Lord,

And is not this Supper, or Supping with the Lord,
altogether inward, spiritual and invisible.</p>
               <p>Now whereas <hi>I. A.</hi> doth alledge that the

               <p>J. <hi>A.</hi> in his pretended Survey of the seventh
Query, (which is concerning the Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day)
alledgeth, <hi>That the fourth Commandment
requireth, to keep Holy unto God one day of seven;
and seeing that fourth Commandment is Moral,
it extends to all Ages of the World.</hi> But in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to this, as that the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
required one day in seven, so it expresly
mentions that day to be the seventh, and not
any one other of the seven; for the said fourth
Commandment did plainly bind the <hi>Iews</hi> to
the seventh day, which was not lawful for
them to change to the first. And whereas <hi>I.
A.</hi> alledgeth, <hi>That the Accomodation to the
particular time, or Diet to the last day of the
Week is indeed Abrogated, but not the substance
of the Command:</hi> By this he quite overturneth
his former Assertion, <hi>That the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
was simply Moral;</hi> for if it was sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
Moral, nothing of the least Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of it could be Abrogated. But some of
<hi>I. A.</hi> his Brethrem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>are more wary and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate,
who say, <hi>The fourth Commandment
was partly Moral, and partly Ceremonial:</hi> The
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60394:78"/>
Ceremonial part of it was, that it tyed to the
seventh day; the Moral part of it was, and
is partly that it requires some competent time
to be appointed for the Worship of God, both
private and publick, laying aside all World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
occasions for that time, as well out of our
Minds as hands, without tying to any limited
day of seventh or sixth: And partly again in
respect of its Spiritual signification; for the
outward Sabbath of the <hi>Iews,</hi> was a Type or
Shadow of Christ, in whom all True Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
find rest to their Souls, from all their
heavy Labours and Toils; and that Christ
is the thing signified by the Sabbath, is clear
from <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2. 16, 17. Again that neither <hi>I. A.</hi>
nor his Brethren hold the first day of the
Week, in that strickness of a Sabbath, as the
fourth Commandment required is clear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the said fourth Commandment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
<hi>That in it they should not do any work,</hi>
which elsewhere in Scripture is more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
set down, <hi>That they were not to kindle a
Fire on the Sabbath; and he that gathered sticks
on the Sabbath-day was to be stoned to Death:</hi>
All which proveth that the Sabbath of the
<hi>Iews</hi> was Typical, and consequently that the
Morallity of it, was principally its Spiritual
signification, as it did hold forth Christ,
no less than the other Types and Figures. But
<hi>I. A.</hi> alloweth people to kindle a Fire on
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:60394:78"/>
that day, and to Boil and Roast Meat as plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
as on other days, if he be of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns
mind, who commonly Feast on that
day, and have a larger Table than at other
times. And although <hi>I. A.</hi> undertake the
Vindication of the Church in <hi>Brittain,</hi> yet he
cannot be ignorant, that the greatest part of
his Episcopal Brethren were and are of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mind, <hi>viz. That the keeping of the First day
of the Week is no Moral Command;</hi> else they
would never have allowed Playes and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets
to be kept on that day. And <hi>Calvin,</hi> whose
Opinions <hi>I. A.</hi> followeth but too much in
other things did not hold, <hi>That the keeping
of the first day, was any Command of God, but
simply that the Church had agreed to it to meet
on that day:</hi> And he saith plainly, <hi>They might
have chused another day as well as that.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Query saith, <hi>That the Saints did
meet together,</hi> this is Scripture; so we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that the Saints did meet together
on the first day of the Week, and so we do
according to their example; and also we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that some considerable part of our
life time is to be set apart for the solemn Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and Service of God; and this not only the
Scripture Testimony, but the Law of God in
our hearts doth require. And we further
judge, that rather more of our time is to be
given to the Service of God, solemnly se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:60394:79"/>
apart from all worldly occasions now under
the <hi>New Testament,</hi> (and that Servants and
Beasts may have rest, for God requireth that
mercy be shewn to them also) than was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
under the Law, by vertue of the fourth
Commandment. And therefore we have
Meetings, and other times of Retirement, at
other times of the Week, than on the first
day. As also we do generally abstain from
Bodyly Labour on the first day of the Week,
although we cannot call it the Christian Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
for that were to put it in the room of
Christ: But what abuse and profanity is it to
pretend to set apart a day only for the Service
of God, and yet to spend it worse, than any
other day of the Week, for most part, to
wit, in Idle Communications, Playes, and
Drinking, as too many of <hi>I. A.</hi> his Brethren
openly do.</p>
               <p>And now let us see further, what <hi>I. A.</hi> doth
alledge for the first day of the Week, its
being appointed to be kept for a Sabbath.</p>
               <p>One Argument is, <hi>That because Christ rose
on that day, and honoured it with his most fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
appearings, after his Resurrection on that
day, that therefore he appointed it to be kept
for a Sabbath:</hi> But this inference is without
any proof, and is therefore returned to him:
And it is manifest, that at a certain time,
when Christ did appear, some of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb facs="tcp:60394:79"/>
were Fishing with their Nets, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 21.
And if that was the first day of the Week,
and appointed by Christ for a Sabbath, how
was it that the Disciples did so openly trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
it, and yet were not reproved by Christ,
but were bidden cast out the Net by himself.
Nor is his other Argument of any greater
weight, <hi>That because the Primitive Christians,
in the Apostles times and downwards, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
meet on that day, and had their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections
for the poor, that therefore it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to be strickly observed as a Sabbath:</hi> This
consequence is also returned upon him, as
barely alledged without proof. And both we
and many other Protestants in <hi>France</hi> and
<hi>Holland,</hi> constantly meet on that day; and
yet it doth not follow, that we or they hold
it for a Sabbath, for many of them do not,
any more than we.</p>
               <p>Another Argument of his is, <hi>Because it is
called the Lords day,</hi> Rev. 1. 10. To which
I Answer <hi>I. A.</hi> hath not as yet proved it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
that by the Lords day there is meant
the first day of the Week, but giving it, that
<hi>Iohn</hi> meant the first day, as I find generally
that <hi>Iustine Martyn</hi> and others about his time
did call the first day of the Week, the Lords
day; yet it doth not follow, that therefore
the Lord appointed it to be kept as a Sabbath,
for it might well enough he called the Lords
<pb facs="tcp:60394:80"/>
day because he arose upon it, for many day<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
have received Names for much less reason,
according to the Ancient Tradition in Old
times, which not being in Scripture is not so
certain to us, as that other, <hi>viz. Of Christ his
Resurrection day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another Argument of his is, <hi>Because that
Christ Taught the Disciples to Pray that their
flight might not be on the Winter, nor on the
Sabbath day, when he Prophecied of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>Math.</hi> 24. 20. But to
this I Answer, That the Name of Sabbath
doth not infer, that any outward day is to be
kept for a Sabbath, under the <hi>New Testament,</hi>
more than the Name of Circumcision doth
infer that there is now to be any outward Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision;
and what Christ spoke to the
Disciples, it was not to them alone, but to all
the <hi>Iews,</hi> who as he did well know, would
still be Zealous for the <hi>Iewish</hi> Sabbath, after
his Resurrection? As indeed they were, and
also for Circumcision; and therefore he knew
what great an Affliction it would be to them
to be put to flee on that day; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we find, that not only them, but long
after the <hi>Iews,</hi> even many of them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
and also our Christians, did observe
the <hi>Iewish</hi> Sabbath, and some observed both,
that and also the first day, until <hi>Constantine</hi>'s
time. What Christ therefore spoke of the
<pb facs="tcp:60394:80"/>
Sabbath, was not to confirm them, to keep
either that or the first day of the Week for a
Sabbath, but to express the great Affliction, they
would be in, if they should flee on that day,
which they so much did regard. And beside,
some understand the Sabbath here also by way
of Allegory, which <hi>I. A.</hi> hath not re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And whereas the said <hi>I. A.</hi> alledgeth, that
<hi>Rom. 14. 5, 6. Is not to be understood of the first
day of the Week, but only of other</hi> Jewish <hi>days:</hi>
This is meerly alledged, without any shadow
of proof; for no where doth <hi>Paul,</hi> or any
other Pen-man of the Scripture make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of the first day: And therefore seeing
<hi>Rom.</hi> 14. speaks of days indefinitely, the
first day is understood as well as the rest.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XI.</head>
               <p>IN the pretended Survey of the eighth Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which is concerning Singing of
Psalms, <hi>I. A.</hi> is at much pains to prove a
thing, which we do not deny, <hi>viz. That
Singing of Psalms, is allowed and commanded
under the</hi> New Testament: For this we wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
acknowledge, and those who can Sing
with the Spirit and undestanding, they may
use either <hi>David</hi>'s words, or words of any
other Holy-men, recorded in Scripture, or
any other sound words, as the Lord shall
move them: But all this is no Answer to the
Question, which is not concerning Singing
only or simply, but that way of Singing used
by <hi>I. A.</hi> and his Brethren, without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to an immediate direction, or motion
of the Spirit Infallibly Teaching or assisting
them what and how to Sing. Now the Query
is, where doth he find such Singing War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
in Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> without the Spirit
infallibly directing them. 2. Their Singing
with Meeter or Tooting Rhymes, Artificially
composed by meer Natural Art and Industry;
where is such Singing commanded or practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb facs="tcp:60394:81"/>
in Scripture. And 3. it is Queried since the
Apostles did not turn them into Meeter,
why have others since them, done so, as if
they were more wise than the Apostles, or
saw further what God required of them. And
whereas <hi>I. A.</hi> alledgeth, <hi>That Psalms cannot
be Sung, except they be Meetered;</hi> If he mean
by Meetering, putting them in Tooting
Rhymes, or Rhymes ending with the like
Cadencies and Sounds, he sheweth his great
ignorance in Poetry, and Musick; for the best
Poesies are without any such Cadencies: Nor
have <hi>David</hi>'s Psalms any such Cadencies of
like sounds at the end of the Lines, as they are
written in <hi>Hebrew.</hi> And although <hi>Davids</hi> Psalms
are Penned with certain measures of Words
and Sentences, yet that was by some Divine
Skill, which the Spirit of the Lord Taught
him, and not by bare humane Art, as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<hi>I. A.</hi> will not deny.</p>
               <p>But another great abuse in <hi>I. A.</hi> is, that he
excuseth wicked and proud mens Singing such
words of <hi>David</hi> as these: <hi>I am not puft up in
mind, I water my Couch with my Tears,</hi> &amp;c.
alledging they may be Sung as well as Read
by such men. But who cannot see the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity
of this inference, for to Read, and to
Pray, and also to Sing, are very differing;
and one may Read the Devils words, and the
words of the wickedest men Recorded in
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:60394:82"/>
Scripture, but when one Prayeth, or Praiseth,
he expresseth somewhat of his own condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And men may read the Creed or Ten
Commands, but yet they are not proper for
a Prayer, and the most of the Psalms are
Prayers.</p>
               <p>But lastly, whereas <hi>I. A.</hi> saith, He <hi>and
his Brethren have the same Spirit the Apostles
had, though not the same measure:</hi> We may
not unfitly Query them, how he can prove
or demonstrate this to us, seeing some of his
Brethren have asked a proof from us, that we
had the same Spirit: And if <hi>I. A.</hi> be in good
earnest, and doth indeed believe that he has
the same Spirit, which the Apos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>les had, how
is it that he doth so very frequently mock and
scoff at the Infallible Inspiration of the Spirit,
which we plead for, as the common priviledge
of all true Christians. And was not the Spirit
which the Apostles had, the Infallible Spirit?
And if <hi>I. A.</hi> thinks he has the same Spirit, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he must needs acknowledge, that he has
the Infallible Spirit, and is so far infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,
or then he must say, that the Spirit
of God is changed, so that whereas it was
Infallible in the Apostles and Primitive
Christians, it is become Fall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ble in <hi>I. A.</hi> and
his Brethren. And if he have the same Spirit,
which the Apostles had, but in the least mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
how is it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat he hath said above that
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:60394:82"/>
the Dictate of the Spirit within is worthy of
a thousand Deaths? Let <hi>I. A.</hi> extricate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of these contradictions if he can. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I ask <hi>I. A.</hi> whether the Psalms, he and
his Brethren Sing in their Meetings, be these
Spiritual Songs, which the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
did Sing; and such as we Read of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> where
Psalms are reckoned among the other pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Gifts of the Spirit, such as Revelations and
Interpretations; where it is manifest, that the
whole Assembly did not all Sing the same
words with their voice; but every one did
Sing as they received it from the Lord, and
as he did put it into their Hearts; and such
were the Songs of <hi>Zachariah, Mary</hi> and <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi>
who Sung and Blessed the Lord by the
Holy Ghost. And seeing <hi>I. A.</hi> saith, <hi>That they
cannot Sing, unless what they Sing, be turned
into Meeter,</hi> I ask him, whether the Songs of
<hi>Zachariah, Mary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> were Sung by
them in Meeter, or Rhyme, and with Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical
Dittyes and Tunes Artificially Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
or whether they had a Precentor, or any
that went before them. And whether such
kind of Officers were in the Church in the
time of the Apostles, as Precentors that went
before the people: And whom they were
all to follow, accordingly as he Sang after
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>his or that Tune of Musick Artificially Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:60394:83"/>
Or rather have ye not Learned all
this from the Papists? And was it not <hi>Guido
Aretinus,</hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Scale of Musick commonly called the Gamut
according to which the Precentors are Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to Raise the Psalms. All which is but the
bare Act of Man; and such who plead for
Vocal Musick in the Church, from the
example of <hi>David,</hi> and the Law; they may also
on the same account plead for the use of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical
Instruments in the Church; not only as
lawful, but as necessary, (which yet the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
Church here wanteth) and not only so,
but Dancing also, as a part of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
which was used in time of the Law, and
especially by <hi>David.</hi> And thus by <hi>I. A.</hi> his
Argument, both Instrumental Musick, and
Dancing shall be necessary parts of Gospel
Worship.</p>
               <p>And as concerning wicked mens Singing, it
is most clear, that as they are not to Pray,
while remaining wicked, so nor are they to
Sing, because all true Singing is a real part of
Divine Worship, which is to be done in
Spirit and Truth; but no wicked nor unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
person can so do. And seeing all
wicked persons professing Christianity, are
Captives in Spiritual <hi>Babylon,</hi> how can they
Sing any of the Songs of <hi>Zion</hi> in a strange
Land? Can they Sing that new Song, which
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:60394:83"/>
the Redeemed from the Earth Sing? <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.
was not the Lord displeased with their Singing
even under the Law, when the people did
degenerate and become perverse? And did he
not threaten that he would turn the Songs of
their Temple into Howlings? And yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>I. A.</hi> the most perverse and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
corrupted persons, may and ought
to Sing Psalms: But what Harmony can such
Singing make in the Ears of the Lord, while
the Heart is so discordant to the Law of God?
And although <hi>I. A.</hi> hath his best and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Patrons, for his Musical Singing, with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial
Dittyes, and Tunes, and Rhymes
out of the Popish Church; as also for his
pleading that wicked persons may Sing <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s
words, without making a Lye; I shall
here Cite a very fair acknowledgement out of
a late Popish Writer, to the Truth of what
we alledge against <hi>I. A.</hi> The which Writer
is <hi>Iohannes Bona</hi> in his Book called, <hi>The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples

<hi>I. A.</hi> is a Member of the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Church,
and Officiates therein under <hi>Iohn Hamilton,</hi> an

of the bare natural understanding of man, as

after such consequences, without any such
special direction and conduct of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
in the least measure, which Christ and
the Prophets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Apostles had. Nay I do
not find that <hi>I. A.</hi> doth acknowledge so much
as the least absolute necessity of any sort of
operation or illumination of the Spirit, so

without the help of the Holy Spirit
were so safe and sure, how is it then that so
many of all sorts draw contrary consequences
from the same Scriptures? Is not the great reason
of all this, because men are departed from that
holy Spirit, which gave forth the Scriptures,
and can only give the true understanding of
them? And therefore is it not plain and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
as the Light at Noon-day, that man's
natural Spirit, and Reason, and Wisdom, in
its highest perfection, is altogether unable to
meddle with Divine Truths, or to search after
them, as it remains alone, hunting in the
dark. And certainly this is no small part of
that cursed self-conceit and exaltation of
mind, that Rules in the degenerated nature of
man, that they think they can be wise enough
without God's Spirit, they need no direction,
or assistance, or illumination to help them to
search into the Scriptures, they can do that
well enough with their natural reason, and a
little School-craft of Artificial Logick, and
Grammar, and Natural Philosophy; but that
blessed man <hi>David</hi> was of another mind, when
he prayed unto the Lord, saying, <hi>Open my
Eyes, that I may see the wonderful things of thy
Law.</hi> And as for consequences which men
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:60394:86"/>
draw, as they are directed and taught by the
Spirit of God, as Christ and the Apostles were,
when they drew any consequence from what
was formerly writ, we do own them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them, and none else. But yet as to the
most weighty and necessary things, to wit,
such as are the general principles of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith and Doctrine, and which as such
are generally to be received by all Christians,
as well these of the meanest capacity, as
others of the greatest, we see the Lord hath
not left it to mans industry, to search after
them by consequences long or short, but hath
delivered them to us in plain express words
and terms, and that many times over and
over again (as in respect of many of them)
in the Holy Scriptures. And why is it, that
the Scriptures are so full and large in their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
to the Doctrines and Principles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
but to let us understand, that all the
Principles and Doctrines of the Christian Faith,
which God requireth in common of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
are expresly their delivered and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded,
and put as it were in a puplick Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.
And therefore, for my part, what I
cannot find expresly delivered in Scripture, I
see no reason why I should receive or believe
it as any common Article or principle of the
Christian Faith or Life; and for such, to
whom God hath given that Divine skill to

                  </gap>e true Christians, so as to collect or gather by
just and true consequences, other things that
lie out of the view of their weaker Brethren,
they ought not to obtrude them upon any to
be received as principles of Faith, but in that
case to have Faith to themselves, and receive
them as peculiar discoveries or Revelations of
the Spirit to them, and such others as God hath
so enlightened; the which by the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>
is called, <hi>The Word of Wisdom,</hi> to wit, such
a peculiar degree of Wisdom or Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the depth of the Scriptures, as others
who yet were true Christians did not reach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;
and concerning such a peculiar gift of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Wisdom, he said, <hi>We speak Wisdom
among the perfect?</hi> this certainly could be no
common Article of Faith, else he should have
Preached it to all. And this by the same Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
is elsewhere called, <hi>The knowledge of My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,</hi>
as distinguished from the common
Faith and knowledge of the whole Church.
Now if this were but received among those
called Christians, that nothing should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
by one sort from another, as an Article
of Faith, or Doctrine or principle of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion in common to be believed, but
what is expresly delivered in the Scriptures, in
plain express Scripture terms, of how great
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:60394:87"/>
an advantage might it be to bring a true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilement
among them, and beget true
Christian Unity, Peace, Love and Concord.
And as for the consequential part of peculiar
Doctrines, whether true or false, to leave
every one a freedom or latitude, without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
upon them the affirmative or negative,
as any bond or tye of Christian fellowship;
for if such consequential Doctrine be false, it
is most unreasonable to impose it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in that Case, a Dissenter should have his
liberty to differ in judgment, without any
breach of Brotherly Unity and Society; and
if it be true, yet not being opened or revealed
to another, it cannot be in justice pressed or
urged upon him, where God has not given
him the true freedom and clearness of mind
to receive it; and to do otherwise, is to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
that Golden Rule delivered by <hi>Paul, viz.
To walk by the same Rule, according to what
we have attained; and if any be otherwise
minded,</hi> said he, <hi>God will reveal it unto him.</hi>
And if this Advice could find place, it would
bring the differences among those called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
in point of judgment, into a very
small and narrow compass, and they would
understand one another far better than now
they do.</p>
               <p>But again, seeing <hi>I. A.</hi> is so absolute and

and the consequential part of it, the alone
Fruit and product of their humane Spirit,
since they deny all pretence to an inward

Case; why should the said <hi>I. A.</hi> so oft Taunt
and upbraid us with an Infallible Spirit, and
Infallible Speaking and Writing, and Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
for now it seems a meer humane
Spirit hath inspired those that gave forth the

to write every Article and Sentence of it In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly,
according to <hi>I. A.</hi> his high estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>But whereas <hi>I. A.</hi> dareth us, <hi>To give any

particularly by <hi>R. B.</hi> in his <hi>Catechism and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi>
and by me in my Book of <hi>Immediate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation:</hi>
And there was in the year 1651. an
intire examination of that <hi>Confession of Faith</hi>
published in Print by one <hi>W. Parker,</hi> (who
was not called a <hi>Quaker,</hi> and whose words in
all things we do not own) and to the said

he hath said more against it, and many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles

which whole Book lyeth at their door to

Another gross mistake, or rather

this is a gross abuse, for we do own, that
there may and ought to be Confessions of

we own, that there may be Catechisms,
and that they are useful in the Church, and
accordingly we have such. And though the

be not absolutely or universally Infallible, yet
we hold that none should publish any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession

                  <hi>I. A.</hi> thinks he may Speak and Confess his
Faith, without the same Spirit of Faith which
<hi>David</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> had: And as for our Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisms
and Confessions of Faith, if we cannot
prove them, and all the Articles and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
in them, to be according to express
Scripture words, then let them not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.
For we profess to urge nothing, nor
to press any thing to be received, as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Article of Faith, but what is expresly
delivered and Recorded in the Scriptures.
And if any should be so unbelieving and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate,
as not to believe the express Scripture
words, we may not urge them, or press them
thereunto by any Humane or Carnal Force
and Compulsion, but only to labour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
them, according to that evidence and
demonstration of the Spirit and Power, as
God shall be pleased to furnish us withal.</p>
               <p>Another great mistake or abuse of <hi>I. A.</hi> is,
that he alledgeth the Tenth Query is void of
Sense, as if it did import, <hi>That their Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and Sanctification, Faith and Grace,
were the Gifts of their Directory, Catechism,
and Confession of Faith;</hi> and thus because the
Query saith, <hi>The Gifts of these,</hi> whereas it is
plain to any Sober and Rational Person, that
by <hi>the Gifts of these,</hi> the Inquirer meaneth,
the Gifts of Justification, Sanctification, Faith
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:60394:89"/>
and Grace; and this is a form of Speech al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by the <hi>Grammar</hi> it self, and practised
by Learned Authors, I suppose far beyond
<hi>I. A.</hi> who say not only the Town <hi>London,</hi>
or <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> but also the Town or
City of <hi>London,</hi> the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> the City
of <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> and therefore why may it not
be as well said, the Gift of Faith, of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
of Sanctification; and speaking of
these in general, why may it not be said, the
Gifts of these, which is equivalent to these
Gifts: And beside, perhaps all this Quible is
only raised upon a mistake of the Transcriber,
wri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing the Gifts of these, for these Gifts; but
it seems <hi>I. A.</hi> is barren of matter, when he
maketh a mountain of so small a matter, if so
be it were an impropriety of Speech. But to
deal in earnest with <hi>I. A.</hi> seeing he is so decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
an Enemy to Divine Inspiration in our
days, we cannot think that he indeed oweth
his pretended Justification, Sanctification and
Faith unto God, but rather unto those Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions
and Catechisms; for what Evidence
or probable ground can he give us, that he
hath any Divine Faith, or that which is more
than barely Historical and Traditional?</p>
               <p>Another gross abuse of his is, <hi>That because
we call the Gospel the Power of God,</hi> as we are
warranted by the express words of <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi>
1. 16. therefore he alledgeth, <hi>That we fain to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:60394:90"/>
our selves a sort of dumb Gospel, without any
Words, or Doctrine.</hi> But to remove this abuse,
let the Reader know, that by the Gospel, we
mean not the Power of God abstractly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
without the Doctrine, and suitable
words, inwardly or outwardly Preached, nor
yet the Doctrine and Wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> God, but both
conjunctly. And although we do readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that the Doctrine, when it is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
Preached by the Spirit of God, and so
hath the Power of God accompanying it, is and
may be called Gospel; yet we cannot simply
or absolutely limit or confine the Gospel to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Preaching of men; otherwise what God
or Christ Preaches of his Love and Mercy to
men in their Hearts, should not be the Gospel,
nor should that be Gospel which God Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ry of men. To conclude therefore, what
God reveals of his Love and Mercy for mens
Salvation, whether without, or by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
of men Spiritually fitted and called
thereunto is the Gospel, and that Gospel may
be called the Power of God unto Salvation,
because it is mighty and powerful in operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but yet it doth not follow, that the

                  </gap>reaching of the Letter without the Spirit and

                  </gap> it, as being both a
great Jester, and a great Fool also, because the
Inquirer asketh, <hi>Whether Original Sin be the
Devil, seeing the Word Original signifieth the
Beginning.</hi> But I ask <hi>I. A.</hi> why may not the
Devil be called sin, or unrighteousness in a
certain sense, as Christ is called righteousness
frequently in Scripture? And what is it that
made him that was an Angel of Light, to
become a Devil, but sin; for when God first
created him, he was not a Devil; but he
became so, or made himself so, by his sin:
And seeing sin made him become a Devil,
why may it not receive his Name? And also
seeing the Devil stirreth up men to sin, and is
the Author of it commonly in mens Hearts,
it may very well receive his Name, at least
by a <hi>Metonymie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, is not sin called in Scripture, <hi>The
Old Man,</hi> or <hi>Old Adam,</hi> whom we are bidden
to <hi>put off?</hi> According to <hi>I. A.</hi> his reasoning,
<hi>Sin cannot be an Old Man, because a man is a
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:60394:91"/>
person, and then Sin should be a person also.</hi>
Again, by his Argument, <hi>God made man, but
he made not sin, therefore sin cannot be a man:</hi>
And thus according to <hi>I. A.</hi> the Inspirer of
the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> must also be a Fool and a
Jester (which were very Blasphemous to
think) because <hi>Paul</hi> calleth sin in men, <hi>The
Old Man,</hi> and compareth it unto man, <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
its various Members.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if indwelling sin may be called man,
in any tollerable sense of a <hi>Metonymie,</hi> or
<hi>Allegory;</hi> according to Scripture, why not
also Devil, Serpent, <hi>Leviathan,</hi> as also it is
called flesh. And whereas the Inquirer doth
ask, what did Christ come to destroy? was
it not the Devil and his works? To this <hi>I. A.</hi>
giveth no direct Answer; for certainly that
Divel whom Christ destroyeth in mens hearts;
and that Serpent whose head Christ the Seed
of the Woman doth bruise, is sin, which is
the Serpents birth in mens hearts, and which
receiveth his Name, as the Child doth the
Name of its Parent.</p>
               <p>Now as to the words Original sin, as they
are no express Scripture words, so they have
an Ambiguous or doubtful signification,
and therefore it were better to leave those
words, and to keep to express Scripture. For
in one Sense, there can be no Original sin,
because originally all things were good, and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:60394:91"/>
sin came in not with the Creation, but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
after it.</p>
               <p>But how sin hath come generally upon all
men, as whether by the bare imputation of
<hi>Adam</hi>'s sin, without the consent of his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,
or by and through their consenting
thereunto, is the true state of the question,
which <hi>I. A.</hi> hath not as yet resolved. And it
seemeth most absurd that God should reckon
any sinners for <hi>Adam</hi>'s sin, without the least
consent or concurrence on their part, which
is not just among men; and certainly what is
unjust with just men, is not just before the
Lord, who is infinitely just and good. And
seeing none are Righteous or Just by the
Righteousness of Christ, the second <hi>Adam,</hi>
without their Faith in him, and consenting
to his Righteousness; so none are unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
by the first <hi>Adam,</hi> but such as consent to
his sin. But again, when this consenting to
<hi>Adam</hi>'s sin took place in his posterity, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
whether before they came into the womb,
(as those who hold the pre-existence of all
Souls from the beginning, do affirm, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
there have been and are divers among
those called Christians) or whether after they
are born, when they grow up to the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of discerning good from evil, is yet ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Question, which <hi>I. A.</hi> hath not touched,
far less resolved. And it were well that men
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:60394:92"/>
were more inquisitive to find the way, how
to get sin put out, than how it came in; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they are generally sensible that that it hath
entred, and got too great place in them. But
as to the determinate and precise time, when
sin hath entred into mens Souls; as it is no
part of the Query, so it is none of my present
work to determine. It shall suffice enough to
reply unto <hi>I. A.</hi> that all his Arguments for
the in being of sin in mens hearts, fall short
to prove that it came into them without their
own consent; or that God doth impute sin
unto any Soul, simply and barely for the Fact
of another; for that is to contradict the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
instinct of Justice that is placed by the
Lord, the judge of the whole Earth in all
men.</p>
               <p>Another Question which <hi>I. A.</hi> raiseth on
this Head, although it be no part of the
Query, is, <hi>Whether that Seed of Concupiscence
which is felt to move in those who are Travelling
uprightly towards perfection, be really and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
their sin, or imputed unto them; for sin by
the Lord, when not consented unto, in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
or degree.</hi> And he resolveth it in the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative,
but with very weak and insufficient
Arguments. 1. He saith, <hi>By the sin of</hi> Adam, <hi>all
were made sinners,</hi> Rom. 5. 16, 17, 18. But what
then, doth it therefore follow, that they were
made sinners without their own consent;
<pb facs="tcp:60394:92"/>
let him show us this any where in Scripture?
2. He saith, Adam <hi>was the representative Head
of mankind.</hi> But I say again, it doth not
thence follow, that his sin is the sin of his
Posterity without their consent; no more
than it doth follow, that because Christ is
also the Head of every man, that his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
becometh theirs, without their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
and their actual receiving of him, and
believing in him. 3. He saith, <hi>There are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which are sinful, though not consented to,
when they are tampered with, or listned unto.</hi>
I Answer, to tamper with any evil motion,
or listen thereunto, is some measure of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting;
but when the evil motion is not
tampered with, nor listned unto, in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
this reason hath no place. And here he
alledgeth on me, that as he was informed I did
once dispute for a Professors place, which to
what purpose he mentioneth this, I donot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand;
however I tell him, his Information
is false, for I never disputed any where in all
my life, for a Professors place. 4. He argueth,
<hi>That as Gracious Principles are Grace, so an evil
principle is sin.</hi> I Answer, there is a Principle
of Grace, in the Souls of Bad men, which is
Grace in it self, and Truth and Righteousness,
yet it is not their Righteousness, nor Grace,
because they joyn not with it, and even so
an evil Principle in a good man, though evil,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:60394:93"/>
and sin is not his sin, when he doth not joyn
with it. 5. He Argueth, <hi>That which inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
men to sin, must be sin.</hi> But if this Argument
hold, then the Devil must be sin still, because
he inclines men to sin. Again, as to what
he alledges that <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>Sin did dwell in
him, from</hi> Rom. 7. I Answer, <hi>I. A.</hi> hath not
proved that <hi>Paul</hi> was at that time in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
whereof he makes mention, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he speaks of the dwelling of sin, in
him, <hi>viz.</hi> in respect of his former condition;
yet he telleth, that not his mind, but his
flesh, was the Subject, where it did indwell.
And therefore when <hi>I. A.</hi> so insultingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
at me, <hi>What is the Subject of that evil
thing or motion; for seeing it is an accident, it

exist.</hi> I Answer him from the Apostle; the
Subject of it, in good men, is not the mind, or
more noble part, which is immortal, but the
flesh. And seeing it is not lodged in the mind
of any righteous man, it cannot defile it,
when it is not in any wise consented unto. Nor
doth it follow, that because an evil motion
may be in the flesh or mortal part, the Devil
is also lodged there too; this is nothing but
a foolish inference of <hi>I. A.</hi> his making; and
therefore let him take home his silly Jest
to himself, where he saith, <hi>It is better to lodge

lest sin and the Devil too, have not too great

<hi>I. A.</hi> so offended with the Inquirer, for ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15. Yet
we find not that Christ hath died for all sins
of men that were to come, after they were
Enlightned. And although no doubt all sins,
as well to come as past, are pardoned upon
Repentance; and that Christ hath died for
such sins, as are repented of by any men, at
any time, when they truly repent; yet seeing
many sins are committed, by many, that are
never repented of, and wherein they die fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
Impenitent and hardned against Gods
tender Call and Visitation of Grace in their
Souls: Also seeing some sin wilfully and fall
away, after they have received the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

Scripture is plain, <hi>That there remaineth no more

even until the day of Visitation be
over, and God be provoked to give them
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:60394:96"/>
up, even as many at this day, because they

up to the strong delusions of Antichrist, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
Lies, and die in that state.</p>

                  <p>MEn are not according to Scripture called
Reprobates within that time, that
God dwelleth with them by his Grace, in
order to convert them, and renew them by
Repentance; far less doth the Scripture speak
of mens being Reprobated from all Eternity,
or before the foundation of the World, as
some alledge; although we read of an Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in Christ before the foundation of the
World. And to say that God doth simply
Reprobate men, while he is calling them to
Repentance, and graciously inviting them in
true Love to be reconciled with him, is an
absolute inconsistency. The time therefore of
any mans final Reprobation is after this day
of Grace is over, and God hath wholly left
striving with him in order to his Conversion.
We must therefore distinguish betwixt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and their sins and sinful state; for also

                     </gap>in, and state of sin is always rejected and
reprobated, yet not the persons, until their
day be over. For the Scripture speaketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundantly
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:60394:97"/>
of a day of Grace that all men
have, or are to have, wherein the Lord not
only visits them, but even endures with much
long suffering the Vessels of wrath fitted for
destruction. These only therefore are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
Reprobates, who are finally given over
to a Reprobate mind, after their day of Grace
is over; and Gods fore-knowledge and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination
respecteth them only as such.</p>

                  <p>ACcording to what is formerly said, it
may be further concluded, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
Christ hath died for all men in a day,
so that within that day of Grace, all their sins
past and to come as well as present, are pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for Christs sake, no man being absolutely
reprobated, and finally given over, within
this day of Grace; yet that day being at an
end, Christs death is no more a Sacrifice for,
them, nor for their sins; and because of their
rejecting so great Salvation offered them by
Christ, all their former sins which formerly
were not imputed unto them, so as to hinder
Pardon, are newly charged upon them, and
that in the just Judgement of God, seeing
they deny the Lord that bought them, and
account his Blood, as an unholy or common
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:60394:97"/>
thing. And in this respect Christ hath Died
for no Reprobates, to wit, as such: And he
hath neither died nor Prayed for the World;
in that sense, to wit, as it signifieth them,
who die in the final unbelief and impenitency,
and so perish, for so I find the term World
sometimes to signify in Scripture. And
if <hi>I. A.</hi> think that this is a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11 32.</note>
as implying that Christ
hath died for all men, and yet hath not died
for Reprobates, who are a great part, or the
greatest part of mankind; I shall mind him
of a Rule in his School-Logick, that he doth
so highly magnifie, to wit, that Propositions
are not contradictory, although the one be
Affirmative, and the other Negative, unless
they be <hi>in ordtne ad idem,</hi> in order to the same,

                  <p>THe Sacrifice of Christs death did truely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
for the remission of sins past, from the
beginning of the world; hence all the Believers
that lived under the Law, and Prophets, and
before the Law were saved by Faith in Christ,
and had their sins pardoned; not by the
Offering of the Blood of Bulls and Rams;
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:60394:98"/>
but by the Blood of Christ, who was to die for
them, and in whom they believed; and died
in Faith; as is clear out of many places of
Scripture, and especially the Epistle to the
<hi>Hebrews.</hi> And by vertue of Christ's death, and
offering once for all men, have had or have,
or shall have a day of Visitation, and offer
of Grace through Christ, even these who
lived before Christ came in the flesh, in that

all who finally perish, and are lost in
whatever Age or time of the World they
lived, they must be accountable to Christ
who is judge, both of quick and dead, and
Lord of both; and they shall be punished with
Fire of Hell, for neglecting and despising the
Salvation offered by him. And although this
is a great Mistery and hard to be uttered, how
this Gospel Invitation,<note place="margin">Act. 10. 42.</note> and Visitation
cometh unto all, and how all shall
be accountable unto the man Christ
Jesus, on the score or account of his dying for
them; yet seeing the Scripture is so
plain and clear for it,<note place="margin">Act. 17. 31.</note> it is better to
believe it, than curiously to dispute
how, or after what manner it comes so to be:
And the opening of this and other great
Misteries of the Christian Religion, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
to many, who as yet do not see
them; and when men are prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

                  <p>ANd whereas <hi>I. A.</hi> and others do urge,
<hi>That either Christ has died for those that
perish, absolutely or conditionally:</hi> I Answer,
partly both, first he hath so far died absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
even for those, as by his death and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
Grace is come upon them, suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
both to Faith and Salvation, within their
day of Grace; which Grace is given them
absolutely for that time, and doth continue
with them, until the day of their Visitation
be at an end, and then it is taken away from
them, the Lord ceasing to strive with them
any more for their Recovery. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I say,
Christ hath died conditionally, even for those
that perish, that they might have been saved,
within their day, upon the condition of their
believing: And whereas <hi>I. A.</hi> doth object,
<hi>That seeing the condition it self,</hi> to wit, <hi>Faith
is the Gift of God, then he either bestowes it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them absolutely or conditionally; if absolutely,
then Reprobates shall thereby be made Believers,
and so be saved; if conditionally, then the
sense will be, that God bestowes Faith in Christ
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:60394:99"/>
upon Reprobates, upon condition that they fir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>
have Faith in him.</hi> To which I Answer, that
Faith is indeed the Gift of God, and God is
willing to bestow it upon them, and work it
in them; not upon the condition of their first
believing, before he give them to believe,
which I confess would imply a contradiction;
but the condition on which God is willing
to work Faith in them is, if they do not final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
resist his Spirit of Grace, having offered
Faith unto all men, which moveth and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
or inclineth them to believe; for to every
one that doth not resist the motion of Gods
Spirit of Grace, he giveth Faith, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it in them: And though men cannot
actually do any thing that is good, or accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
unto God, before they believe; yet
when the Visitation of God's Grace is upon
them, by the help thereof they may cease
from resisting the Spirit of God: and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
I have heard it again urged by others, <hi>Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
God willeth that men should not resist the
Spirit of Grace absolutely or conditionally; if
absolutely, then say they, men shall not resist it;
for what God willeth absolutely, must certainly
come to pass, if conditionally, then the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may be renewed concerning that condition,
and so without end.</hi> To this also I Answer,
that God willeth absolutely, that men should
n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t, or d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> not resist his Spirit of Grace; for
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:60394:99"/>
seeing God commandeth that men do not
resist, it is evident that it is the absolute or
positive will of God, that they do not; for
whatever God commandeth is according to
his wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l. But it doth not follow, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
God willeth men to do, that must cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be done; for how often do men act
contrary to the Will of God, in some sense,
although when they do so act, it is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his permissive will, whereby he suffers
them so to do. Indeed I g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ant, that whatever
God willeth that he do himself, that must cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be done, and it cannot be resisted; and
therefore when God punisheth the disobedient,
it being his own act of Justice, and proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from his own holy and just will, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be resisted in that respect. I have the more
largely Answered this Objection, because it
is judged by many of the Adversary side, to
be unanswerable: But I hope by what is said,
the Impartial Reader, who loveth Truth,
may perceive, that there is indeed no
strength in it; and it is so far from being a
clear demonstration, that it is nothing else,
but a Captious Sophism, and Fallacy.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, whereas <hi>I. A.</hi> classeth us with
the <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Iesuits,</hi> for holding this
Doctrine, <hi>That Christ Died for all men.</hi> I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
seeing both <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Iesuits</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:60394:100"/>
to hold many other Doctrines, which <hi>I. A.</hi>
doth also profess, as that there is one God, and
one Lord Jesus Christ; it is no just ground of
reproach to us, to own that Doctrine, which
the Scripture doth own, although <hi>Arminians</hi>
and <hi>Iesuits</hi> profess to own that also: But it
is the greater shame to <hi>I. A.</hi> and his party, who
profess to be more Orthodox, to be guilty in
denying that, which Adversaries confess;
we find that not only wicked men, but the
Devils also confessed unto Christ, which yet is
no reproach unto Christ, nor to the true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors

               <p>PROP. 1. In the Question concerning the
Universality of Gods Grace sufficient to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
it were altogether wisdom in our
Adversaries to forbear pressing so hard in that
point, and so positively conclude against us,
and not us only, but the Scripture it self, <hi>That
many Nations or Kingdoms of the World are
utterly excluded from all sufficiency of Saving
Grace, and possibility of Salvation; and that
upon the account of wanting the Gospel outwardly
preached unto them, and benefit of the Scriptures.</hi>
Do we not read in Scripture, <hi>That God hath
given the Heathens to his Son for his Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:60394:101"/>
and the uttermost ends of the Earth for
his possession?</hi> And doth not Christ invite the
most remote and desolate places of the Earth
to come unto him, saying, <hi>Look unto me all ye
ends of the Earth, and be ye saved:</hi> Mark it is
not said, some ends of the Earth, but [<hi>all ye
ends of the Earth;</hi>] even as well those to
whom the outward Testimony of Christ by
the Scriptures is not come, as those to whom
it is come. And did not Christ command,
<hi>That the Gospel should be preached to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
even those that wanted the Scriptures
Testimony, and therefore the Gospel
did belong unto them; even so to speak
before it was outwardly Preached u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>to them,
for because it did belong unto them, therefore
was it to be Preached unto them; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
for the same reason the Gospel doth
belong to many at this day, to whom it is
not as yet outwardly Preached; and did not
<hi>Paul</hi> say, <hi>Rom. 1. 14. That he was a Debter both
to the</hi> Greeks, <hi>and to the</hi> Barbarians, <hi>as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Gospel?</hi> And how can <hi>I. A.</hi> or any
of his party who dispute so fiercely against all
possibility of Salvation, not only to many
thousands among those called the Heathens,
but to many intire Nations of them, make it
appear that they are utterly and finally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from all sufficient means of Salvation.
Have they been in Gods secret Counsel to
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:60394:101"/>
know this? or who hath revealed it to
them? And if the outward Testimony of the
Scriptures be not as yet come to divers Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Earth, this doth not hinder, but
that the Gospel doth belong unto them, as
well as unto others, to whom they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
come, <hi>Seeing God hath commanded,
that the mistery which was kept secret since the
World began, should now be declared or made
known unto all Nations for the obedience of
Faith, and that by the Scriptures of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
according to</hi> Rom. 16. 25, 26. And
seeing Christ hath commanded, <hi>That the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
should be Preached to all Nations,</hi> Dare <hi>I. A.</hi>
or any of his party give us the Instance of any
one Nation now under Heaven, to whom
the Gospel ought not, or may not be Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
suppose they altogether at present want
the outward Testimony of Scripure, and
knowledge of the History of the coming of
Christ in the flesh. But if the Gospel may
be Preached to any Nation now under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
then certainly it belongeth unto them,
I mean the Gospel Dispensation; for because
it belongeth unto them, and is the free Gift
of God unto them: And because Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
hath procured or obtained that priviledge
unto the Gentiles, by vertue of his death and
blood-shed for them, <hi>Having broken down the
middle wall of partition betwixt the</hi> Jews <hi>and</hi>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:60394:102"/>
Gentiles; therefore i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> is to be Preached unto
them: Even as because the King hath given
some great favour unto his Subjects, it is to
be published or declared unto them, and it is
therefore published unto them, because it is
given them; and is not given them, because
it is published; and therefore the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
have some title or claim to the Gospel, even
before it be published, and consequently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the outward publication of it unto them,
they are not utterly excluded from the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
of Gods Grace towards men. And
if any shall say; The Gospel is to be Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to all Nations indeed, (seeing Christ hath
commanded it, and not one Nation is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted)
because that God hath some scattered
up and down all the Nations, who are to be
saved, as belonging to Gods Election. To this
I Answer, that according to <hi>I. A.</hi> his way of
reasoning, <hi>God hath none belonging to his
Election in many Nations of the World, because
they are excluded from all possibility of Salvation
for want of the Scriptures.</hi>

the universal sufficient Light and Grace of
God, because it is said, 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 14. The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural

know the things of the Spirit of God.</hi> I Answer,
By the Natural man is to be understood, the

But when it pleaseth God to shine upon man
in his Natural state, by his Divine illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
then he may know something belonging
to his Souls Salvation, so far as his weakness
can permit, by vertue of the said illumination.
For how are men converted from Natural to
Spiritual? God dealeth not with men in
Conversion, as with Stocks and Stones, but
as with Reasonable Creatures, having some
capacity of understanding.</p>

                  <hi>PROP.</hi> 3. That some in Scripture are said
to have neither Ears to hear, nor Eyes to see,
nor Hearts to understand, <hi>And that because
God hath not given it unto them, which is another
objection of</hi> J. A. This doth not prove, that
at no time God hath given to those people
any measure of sufficient Grace for this great

may be upon them, either because the day of
their Visitation is expired altogether, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of some intermission, that is only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue

it doth not follow, as <hi>I. A.</hi> would have
it, <hi>That these who are so fearfully blinded by

As this is no where said in Scripture, so it is

<hi>After I am lifted up, I will draw all men unto me:</hi>
And certainly all whom Christ draweth, the

Christ doth not simply say, every one that hath

we do not say that every one hath Learned
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:60394:103"/>
of the Father, although they have heard in
some sort; also there is a right and wrong
hearing, some hear willingly; and this is
only the right hearing; but although all
hear one time or another, while their day of

obey, and therefore they come not unto
Christ.</p>

<hi>That wicked men have not the powers, principles

sufficient Grace;</hi> and he laboureth to prove,
<hi>They have not the powers and habits or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Grace, because otherwise they would be
Converts and Gracious men.</hi> To this I Answer,
Although wicked men have not these powers
and habits, as some call them, actually, yet
they have them hiddenly, to wit, in a Seed
or principle of Grace, which virtually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
all these powers and faculties, even as
the Seed of a Tree doth virtually contain the
Fruit and tree it self. But it doth not follow,
that because a wicked man hath a good Seed
in him, that therefore he is a good man, no
more, than because good Seed is sown in
barren ground, that therefore it is fruitful.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dge,
<hi>That the</hi> Gentiles <hi>did the things of the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:60394:104"/>
Law mentioned,</hi> Rom. 2. 14. <hi>By the meer nature
of man, without the Grace of God;</hi> and this
because it is not said, <hi>They did the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Law by Grace, but by Nature.</hi>
To this I Answer, nor is it said they did the
things contained in the Law by the corrupt
Nature of man, as it is corrupted in the Fall,
and no wise healed or restored. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
corrupted Nature could not do the
things contained in the Law; for the Law of
God in the Hearts of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> did require
not only the outward action, but the inward
purity of the heart; and if this was wanting,
they did not the things contained in the Law.
But that there was an uprightness of heart in
some of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> is clear from divers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of Scripture, as from <hi>Rom. 2. 14. They
show the work of the Law Writ in their Hearts;</hi>
and in the Case of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and also of <hi>Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech,
Gen.</hi> 20. 6. so that God said unto him, <hi>I know
that thou didst this in the Integrity of thy heart.</hi>
And therefore that Nature mentioned by <hi>Paul
Rom.</hi> 2. 14. is either Nature healed and restored
in some measure by the Grace of God, as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>
did partly expound it, or the innate
word mentioned by <hi>Iames,</hi> to wit, <hi>The Word
of Life immediatly grafted, or planted in the Souls
of men,</hi> which is a Divine Nature; for the
<hi>Greek</hi> word used by <hi>Iames</hi> in that place, doth
most properly signifie, that which is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:60394:104"/>
planted in mens Nature, as distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
from that which they receive by Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
or Industry; as when we say, innate
wisdom or understanding, and innate good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
we mean that which a man hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
received from God, from his Birth,
or Creation, to distinguish it from what he
hath acquired by his own pains or labour,
in which sense I find both the word
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap> to be used by <hi>Greek</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.
Now that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had a measure
of Gods Grace bestowed upon them, which
for most part they did not improve, is clear
as from many other passages of Scripture, so
in particular from the Parable of the Prodigal,
who received of his Fathers Goods and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
as well as the Elder Brother, but he
spent it in Riotous living, so that he was left
destitute. Now I ask what was that which the
Prodigal spent which his Fathers gave him,
and was a Portion of his Fathers Goods and
Substance; surely this was not mans own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
Nature, nor any faculty or power
thereof, for that remained still with him: And
therefore it behoved to be the Grace of God.</p>
               <p>

<hi>All men to whom the Grace of God hath appeared,</hi>
Tit. 2. 11. <hi>To be all Ranks, Stations and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of men,</hi> &amp;c. This his Exposition contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicteth
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:60394:105"/>
his own Doctrine, who so fiercely
doth oppose the appearing of Gods Grace, not
only unto all particulars, but also to many or
most of the Nations of the Earth, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to some of the Ranks, Stations and
Qualities of men, such as these numerous and
great Nations in the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West-Indies,</hi> and
other remote places, to whom the Doctrine
of the Gospel was not in <hi>Paul</hi>'s time, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
since outwardly Preached, at least to
most of them. Nor can <hi>I. A.</hi> shew where
all men signifie any definit number, and that
the smallest part also of mankind. And when
<hi>Paul</hi> spoke of his warning and teaching every
man, his sense is clear, that he excepted none,
but still as he had occasion, he Preached the
Gospel freely unto all, telling them, <hi>That they
should repent and believe, that they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the remission of their sins through Iesus
Christ; who had died for them, and was risen
again.</hi> But <hi>I. A.</hi> saith, <hi>There are many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as well as persons for whom Christ died not;
and these for whom Christ died not, are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
to believe that Christ died for them; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they shall first make choice of and embrace
him, for their Lord and Saviour, as the Gospel
offers him.</hi> But this is a strange inconsistency
and contradiction? How can they or ought
they to embrace him as their Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
if they are not to believe that he has
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:60394:105"/>
died for them, even when the account of
Christ his dying for mankind is Preached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them. It God require men to believe in
Christ, it is certainly upon reasonable and
equal terms; some foundation or ground for
such a belief is to be made known unto them,
<hi>As that God is Merciful and ready to pardon their
by past sins;</hi> which yet cannot be if Christ hath
not died for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>PROP.</hi> 9. Lastly, whereas <hi>I. A.</hi> doth
argue, <hi>That the Doctrine of Vniversal Grace,
destroyes the Efficacy of Grace, and makes the
Effectualness thereof depend upon mans will, to
chuse or refuse as he pleaseth, and so the Grace
of God shall be subordinate to mans will, which is
absurd:</hi> To this it is easily Answered, that
the Grace of God is still effectual in its Nature,
even when it doth not actually work the
Salvation of all; for as much as it is sufficiently
able to work it, where it is not resisted, even
as the Fire is effectual to Melt the hardest
Mettal, if the Mettal be duely applyed to it,
but if the Mettal be removed from the Fire,
that the said Mettal is not Melted, is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the Fire, its not having efficacy enough,
but because the Mettal is removed from it,
so the Fire still retaineth its efficacy as it had
before. Again, the efficacy of Gods Grace
dependeth not on mans will, seeing the will
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:60394:106"/>
of man doth not influence or excite the Grace
of God to make it operate; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
it is the Grace of God that doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
or excite the heart and will of man,
without which it cannot do any thing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
mans Salvation; and therefore the
Grace of God is never subordinate to the will
of man, as <hi>I. A.</hi> doth falsly inferr. And
whereas <hi>I. A.</hi> upon this head, <hi>Calls the Grace
of God, that can be resisted, (so as the Souls
Conversion may be hindred by mans resisting it)
ill natured, and false Grace; and moreover
addeth, that he will have nothing to do with such
Grace that can be resisted, he speaketh here too
rashly and presumptuously<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for do we not read of
some in Scripture that resisted the Truth, and
also the Holy Ghost?</hi> As <hi>Stephen</hi> charged
the <hi>Iews,</hi> that they did always resist the Holy
Ghost, as did their Fathers; and yet accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to <hi>I. A.</hi> his Principle, he might as well
say, <hi>He would have nothing to do with the Holy
Chest that can be resisted,</hi> and charge it as ill
natured and false, which were Blasphemous
to affirm. Notwithstanding the same, <hi>I. A.</hi>
forgetting himself a few Lines after, saith,
<hi>We may indeed resist both the means and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Grace, and not improve Grace, as we
should and might too:</hi> But (saith he) <hi>God makes
it still eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ctual to the growth by him designed.</hi>
This is a contradiction not only to his former
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:60394:106"/>
Assertion, but to it self, as implying that men
may improve Grace further than God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
they should. Another very absurd
Assertion I find alledged by him, as if Grace
did not incline men to perfection, and so there
cannot be any resistance of it in that respect.
But he may as well say, God doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
perfection, and so not to be perfect is
no sin; for certainly whatever God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
his Grace inclines men to; yea, it is
his Grace in their Hearts, that is a Law, and
command unto them. In the close of this
Section, <hi>I. A.</hi> falleth on to dispute against
the posibility of the falling away of any from
real beginnings of Sanctification, the which
because he doth it so overly and barely, not
bringing Arguments for what he saith, but
meerly giving us his own private conjectures
on some places of Scripture which are alledged
on both sides, as also because it is altogether
a digression from the Queries, I shall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
upon particularly to refute. Only for a
service unto those, who may desire Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
as touching the thing it self; because
of the seeming contrariety of some places of
Scripture, which hold forth the state of some
in the Grace and favour of God, as unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and not lyable to any alteration of falling
away from the same, are to be understood of
the State of such persons, after they have
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:60394:107"/>
come to such a growth in Grace, so that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance
in the same is a reward given them
of God, with a respect to their Faithfulness and
diligence, wherein they have been formerly
exercised. And such especially is that place,

if the same did consist in God his remitting or

is a gross perversion, for I did not mean any
such thing thereby, as <hi>I. A.</hi> doth alledge, but
only that God out of his infinite goodness and

Gospel Dispensation, a Law that is so Gentle
and so full of Clemency, as that by the same
he requires no more of any of us, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the measure of Grace and Strength
he doth afford unto us; and still as our
Strength and Ability is Increased, the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of the Law becomes the greater upon
us. Hence it is, that he who is Faithful in
every respect to the measure of Grace which
he hath received, is indeed a perfect man,
and doth please God, although he be not
equal in his attainment unto others, who
have more given them: For to whom much
is given, much is required; and to whom
less is given, less is required; which is most
clear from the Doctrine of Christ, in his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
of the Talents.</p>
               <p>And whereas <hi>I. A.</hi> doth plead against the
possibility of perfection in this Life, by divers
Arguments deduced from a misapplication of
some places of Scripture; I shall only point
at the defects of his Arguments in general,
which shall suffice to every one of them, if
<pb facs="tcp:60394:108"/>
duely applyed in particular. 1. One great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of his Arguments is, that the most they
prove is, <hi>That man of himself, without the Grace
and help of Gods Spirit, cannot attain to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;</hi>
which we do not deny, but this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
not, that by Grace he may. 2. A se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
defect is, that his Arguments prove,
<hi>That the Saints had their Imperfections and sins,
before they were fully washed and cleansed from
them,</hi> which we also acknowledge, but this
doth not hinder, that some time or other,
they witnessed a perfect cleansing before
death. A third defect is, his confounding <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he
States and Conditions of the Saints, to wit,
<hi>Their weak Estate, when they are but in the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
and strugling against sin, with their Last
and final Estate, wherein they have overcome,
and got the Victory.</hi> And lastly, to mention
no more, his misapplying the word or term
perfect, when it is taken in an higher sense,
to the lowest condition of a sinless state, as in
the Case of <hi>Paul,</hi> when he said, <hi>Philip. 3. 12.
He was not as yet perfected,</hi> where he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eaneth,
certainly, that he had not attained to the
highest pitch or condition of Holiness, that
was attainable in this Life; which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
doth not hinder a sinless perfection;
for although <hi>Adam</hi> was Created in a sinless
perfection, yet certainly he was to have gone
on to a higher state of Perfection: And we
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:60394:109"/>
Read of Christ who had no sin at all, that he
was made perfect through Sufferings. Again,
when Christ said, <hi>I work to day, and to morrow,
and the third day I am perfected:</hi> This cannot
signifie that he had any sinful Imperfection
before that time; but his being perfected the
third day, signifieth that his work was then to
be done, and so that he was prepared for the
Glory that he was to receive thereafter.</p>
               <p>Again, whereas he maketh some show of
bringing our Arguments or Reasons for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
I find not my self concerned to Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
those Arguments, as managed by him;
because he doth not propose them, either in
matter or form as they do require; as also
that he alledgeth divers Arguments as used by
us in the Case, which I know not, if indeed
used by any of us. Nor is it my work at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
to bring Arguments for our Doctrine,
that being already done by others, and partly
also by me; but to Answer <hi>I. A.</hi> in what he
hath against the same.</p>
               <p>He alledgeth, that <hi>Paul</hi> must needs have
been in that very condition, which he there
describes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 14, 15, 18, 23. and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
there can be no place for the figure called
<hi>Metaschematismus,</hi> as I did alledge, except I
will say, that <hi>Paul</hi> then did not with his
mind serve the Law of God. But how weak
and frivolous is his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cason here? Could not
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:60394:109"/>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> in the same discourse, speak of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that was truly his present conditions,
and of some other thing that was not? Is it
not clear that <hi>Iames</hi> doth so in his Epistle,
when he saith of the Tongue, <hi>Herewith Bless
we God, and herewith Curse we men. My Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
these things ought not to be so.</hi> Now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>I. A.</hi> his highly admired <hi>Logick,
Iames</hi> behoved to be both a Blesser of God, and
Curser of men at the same time, seeing he
useth the first person to express both, and the
like Impertinency <hi>I. A.</hi> is guilty of, in saying
the word cleanseth, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 7. Being in the
present Tense, imports the Sanctification of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
to be imperfect in this Life; for the
word is also used in the present time. And
second by <hi>I. A.</hi> his reason, the word justifieth,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33. importeth an imperfect Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
contrary to <hi>I. A.</hi> his express assertion.</p>
               <p>Again he alledgeth, that the words in
<hi>Ecclesiast. 7. 20. There is not a just man upon
the Earth that doth good and sinneth not;</hi> Have
the Verb in the indicative Mood, and not in
the Potential signified frequently by the second
future, as I did affirm. But this is a bareeva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and no direct Answer to my Assertion?
And I say again, the second future, even
that of the indicative, may be turned into
the Potential Mood, as it is often at other
times, because the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language hath no
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:60394:110"/>
Potential Mood distinct by it self. Again,
whereas he urgeth, <hi>That</hi> Solomon <hi>must needs
understand Actual Sinning, and not a bare pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
of mens sinning, for who would be ignorant
of that?</hi> To this I Answer, that <hi>Solomon</hi> did
not mean a bare possibility, but such a possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
as did infer the great danger and hazard
that men were under to sin, if they were not
duely watchful: And although all men did
know this, yet they did need to be admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
of it; for some parts of the Scripture
are for admonition, and putting us in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,
and not barely for Information.
How oft doth the Scripture tell us, that all
men are Mortal, and must die, which yet
none are ignorant of, although they oft for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
that it is so, and therefore need often to be
remembred. But by <hi>I. A.</hi> his <hi>Logick,</hi> either
men are ignorant, that they shall die, or the
Scripture saith so in vain. Who seeth not
here, the weakness of <hi>I. A.</hi> his Reasons,
which I am already weary to repeat, or spend
my time and pains on such stuff; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
shall hast to an end of the whole. Only
I cannot but take notice, with what confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<hi>I. A.</hi> doth conclude, <hi>That the Apostles
and Prophets their Writing the Scriptures, was
an Action surely defective and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>perfect, as to
the exact and compleat degree of Love to God
and men,</hi> &amp;c. But where doth he read any
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:60394:110"/>
such assertion in Scripture? Or by what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
doth he prove it? Suppose they
did not what they did in the highest degree,
that men could attain to; this doth not prove
any sinful defect in what they did. For it
did sufficiently Answer to the exactness of the
Law, if what they did was, with all that
degree of Love to God and men, that was
possible for them, at that time to perform.</p>

               <p>J. <hi>A.</hi> in his pretended Answer to the 16<hi>th</hi>
Query; first of all beginneth to accuse
the Inquirer, <hi>As guilty of a leud Calumny, in
charging his Brethren, for holding Salvation by
Self-works, and Self-Righteousness; whereas they
disclaim Salvation by the best works of the Saints.</hi>
But <hi>I. A.</hi> in this, as in other things, doth
grosly abuse his Reader, and falsly accuse the
Inquirer. For doth not <hi>I. A.</hi> know, that to
Query a thing is no positive conclusion, either
for or against it. And albeit the Inquirer did
know, that in words ye cry down all self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works,
and self-righteousness; yet he had
but too much ground to question you,
about them, seeing ye are generally found
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:60394:111"/>
so much practising them; and if they be
not so much as useful means or helps of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
why do ye both so much practice them
and plead for them, as <hi>I. A.</hi> hath done at
great length, for Preaching, and Praying,
and Singing without the Spirit, all which are
nothing but Self-righteousness. Another
fault that <hi>I. A.</hi> committeth here is, that he
confoundeth the meritorious cause of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
with the subordinate and instrumental
means thereof. For although those called
Protestants deny the Saints good Works, that
are wrought by the Spirit, to be strickly the
meritorious cause of Salvation; yet generally,
or for the most part, they deny not, that
they are means of Salvation, and necessary
in order thereunto, which yet <hi>I. A.</hi> seemeth
here altogether to deny. And as to that
place of Scripture cited by <hi>I. A.</hi> to prove,
that the Saints are not saved by any work of
righteousness, even wrought by the Holy
Spirit in their hearts, <hi>viz. Tit.</hi> 3. 5. He could
not have brought a more convincing Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
against his false Doctrine, than that
very place: For after that <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>Not by
works of Righteousness, which we had done, (viz.</hi>
by any power of our own) he immediately
addeth, <hi>That God saveth us according to his
Mercy, by the washing of Regeneration, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing
of the Holy Ghost:</hi> Which Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th on at his old rate of
multiplying false accusations and perversions
and perversions against us: Some of the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
whereof I shall briefly mention. 1. <hi>That
we hold a</hi> Popish <hi>Iustification. 2. That in one
of our Books called,</hi> A Confession of Faith, p. 21.
<hi>We deny to be justified by Righteousness received
of us by Faith, and also by a Righteousness im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
unto us.</hi> All which are most gross For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries
and Slanders, for the words in that
page 21. say expresly. <hi>That acceptance with the
Father is only in Christ, and by his Righteousness
made ours, or imputed unto us.</hi> And the said
Book denyeth not that the Righteousness of
Christ is received by Faith, that is the Gift of
God, but both that Faith and imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is only and alone the Creatures
act, or work without the Spirit of Christ,
we do justly deny to have any place in our
Justification. 3. Whereas in the said Book,
our Friends alledge, it is not Acts of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
as done by us, nor as inherent in us
as Acts, by which we are accepted of God,
and justified before him, but by Christ the
Author and worker of those Acts in us, and
for us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He most grosly perverteth the
sober and honest intent of those words, as if
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:60394:112"/>
by them, they understood, only that they hold
not themselves justified by all Acts, as Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy
or any other gross sin. But who seeth
not that this is a most gross perversion, for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
all Righteous Arts of all sorts they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
when they say, not by Acts of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness;
and therefore when they say, it is not
Righteous Acts as Acts, whereby we are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
their meaning is most plain and obvious,
as Acts being understood, to be only, even
as Acts of Righteousness, and not simply and
barely as Acts; though upon this meer <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical</hi>
Quibble <hi>I. A.</hi> buildeth all his loud cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
against them. But <hi>I. A.</hi> should know
better, that when the Sense is obvious, a word
may be understood, that is not expressed in
the Sentence, as so it is in this present Case.
A fourth gross Perversion of his, that he saith
of me, in my Book called <hi>Quakerism no Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi>
I affirm, <hi>That we are justified by our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Graces immediately, I. A.</hi> doth under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that I mean without all respect to
Christ, which is a most gross perversion; for
the express words of my Book are these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
<hi>The Righteousness of God and Christ
by which we are most immediately and nearly
justified, is Christ himself,</hi> (and then I add) <hi>and
his work of Righteousness in us by his Spirit,</hi> So
that I am so far from excluding Christ, that
I say in the first place, Christ himself is our
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:60394:112"/>
Righteousness. A fifth gross Perversion of
<hi>I. A.</hi> is, that in my defunction of Justification,
I give no other material cause of our Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
before God, but only our Inward
Graces; whereas in the said definition, I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
expresly Jesus Christ, as being the ground
and foundation of our Justification, both in
what he hath done and suffered for us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
us, and as really and truly indwelling in
us. A sixth perversion of his is, that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
Justification and Sanctification together,
making no imaginable distinction betwixt
them; and that because I say, we are justified
by inward Righteousnes, and sanctified by
the very same. But this proveth not, that I do
not distinguish them, for one and the same thing
may have a respect to different operations, as
well as to different Causes. But this reasoning
of <hi>I. A.</hi> is as one would argue, that when a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor
is both Condemned and punished for
his Crime, that his Sentence of Condemnation,
and his punishment are one and the same, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any imaginable distinction betwixt them.
As also that his Condemnation and guiltiness
are the same, seeing by his Crime he is both
guilty and condemned. But as to Justification
and Sanctification, that they are distinguished
(although sometimes in Scripture, one
and the same word doth signifie both) I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
grant, and do expresly mention them
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:60394:113"/>
as distinct in my Book, which I need not
here repeat.</p>
               <p>And whereas <hi>I. A.</hi> doth not only accuse
me in particular, as holding a <hi>Popish</hi> Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but saith further, <hi>That</hi> Bellarmine <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
was never more</hi> Popish <hi>on that Head.</hi> Surely
this his assertion proceeds either from great
ignorance or something worse. For <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
de justif.</hi> lib. 5. cap. 17. holdeth, <hi>That
good works do merit Eternal Life condignly, not
only by reason of Gods Covenant and acceptation,
but also by reason of the work it self; so that in a
good works proceeding from Grace, there may be
a certain proportion and equality unto the reward
of Eternal Salvation;</hi> and to the same purpose
writeth <hi>Gabriel Vas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>uez,</hi> a Papist: But no
such thing is affirmed by any of us, nor by
me; but on the contrary, in my Book called
<hi>Quakerism no Popery</hi> I altogether deny the
merit of the best works; as it signifieth an
equality of worth to the reward of Eternal
Life. Nor do I in any other case, or sense
allow the word merit, with a respect to the
best works of the Saints, but in that sober and
qualified sense used by divers of greatest note
among those called Reformers among the
Protestants, as <hi>Melanction</hi> and <hi>Bucer,</hi> and also
by the Fathers so called, and which is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

acknowledge. And not only the said <hi>Richard
Baxter</hi> a great <hi>English Presbyterian,</hi> but divers
of the best account in the <hi>Episcopal</hi> way, as
particularly <hi>H. Hammond</hi> do hold, that the
Saints are justified not by Faith only, but by
Repentance, Love and New Obedience, as
well as by Faith, as Instruments of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and necessary conditions requisite there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
and that Sanctification in the order of
Causes is prior to Justification. And <hi>Iames
Durham</hi> a great <hi>Scots Presbyterian,</hi> in his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
on the Revelation, Digress.</hi> 11. saith,
<hi>That such who rest upon Christ for Iustification,
and acknowledge his satisfaction, ought not to be
blamed as guilty of</hi> Popery; <hi>although they hold
that Repentance, Love and other Spiritual Vertues
and Graces are necessary to Iustification as Faith
is.</hi> Seeing then we have some of the greatest
note, both among those called <hi>Presbyterians</hi>
and <hi>Episcopalians</hi> who agree with us, in the
Doctrine of Justification; it must needs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from great prejudice, and untowardli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in <hi>I. A.</hi> to charge us, as being guilty of
<hi>Papery,</hi> in that, for which we have not only
the Scriptures abundantly to warrant us, but
divers also both <hi>Episcopal</hi> and <hi>Presbyterian,</hi>
of the best account, to vindicate us. And as

agree with us on this Head of Justification,
but also on many other very great and

by <hi>I. A.</hi> as particularly in those follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
1. <hi>That Christ hath died for men. 2. That
there is no absolute decree of Reprobation.
3. That Gods Grace is Vniversal. 4. That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
of Regeneration may be fallen from. 5. That these words of</hi> Paul, Rom. 7. 14, 15.
<hi>concerning his being Sold under sin, are a</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>chematismus,
<hi>and not the present State that</hi>
Paul <hi>was in.</hi> And <hi>I. A.</hi> is extreamly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
if he know not, that an exceeding
great number, if not the greatest, of the most
judicious persons of the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Church both
in <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> are of the same mind
with the said <hi>H. Hammond</hi> in these things, who
therefore are so far from esteeming <hi>I. A.</hi> a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron,
or Advocate of their Church, that they
cannot but judge him in so far at best, their
Adversary.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the great prejudice of <hi>I. A.</hi>
against us appears in this, that because I deny
all merit strictly considered, he inferreth most
absurdly, that if Justice will not exact the very
rigid rigour of the Law from us, and take
the very <hi>summum jus,</hi> we think to merit our
Justification by our Inherent Righteousness at
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:60394:114"/>
Gods Tribunal. This I say is an absurd infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and smelleth ranckly of deep prejudice,
and perverseness of Spirit, in <hi>I. A.</hi> in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to which, I say, that unless God did
not only not exact in his Justice, the rigid
rigour of the Law, as he terms it, but did not
also pardon and forgive us freely for Christs
sake, multitude of sins, so as not only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
us a Penny, but many thousands of
Pounds; neither we, nor any man living
could be justified at Gods Tribunal, by the
greatest Holiness attainable; for all that the
best of the Saints can attain unto; of Holiness
or Righteousness, is but their duty, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
can be no ransom nor redemption, unto
God, for the lest by past sin; far less, for
many that they have formerly committed.</p>
               <p>And whereas in my Book aforesaid, I
charged. <hi>I. A.</hi> and his Brethren, to be too
much one with the <hi>Papists,</hi> in the Doctrine of
Justification; both of them denying that the
Saints Justified by Christ indwelling in them,
as <hi>Luther</hi> expresly Taught in his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
on the <hi>Galatians:</hi> And also denying that
Gods Justifying his Children is an inward Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
or Dictate of his Spirit immediately
pronounced in their hearts; to which the said
<hi>I. A.</hi> can give no reply, but a meer evasion,
and falleth on a fresh to accuse us of <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasme,</hi>
which being already Answered in the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:60394:115"/>
former part, I need not here to repeat. Only
I cannot but take notice, how ignorantly
<hi>I. A.</hi> opposeth the word or term immediate,
to the use of means, which I have already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed,
and shewed how immediate Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
such as the Prophets and Apostles had,
doth very well consist with the use of means:
And so I willingly acknowledge, that true
and right means, are as Vessels, whereby or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
our Spiritual Meat and Drink are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
to us, sometimes in the use of one
mean, sometimes in the use of another; but
I hope, when we Eat and Drink, that which
is conveyed to us, we Eat and Drink it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
See, Taste, Savour, and Handle,
and Feel it immediately, and can well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
when the Meat is indeed in the
Vessel, and when it is empty; and therefore
<hi>I. A.</hi> his comparison in this respect, doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together

               <p>Another great impertinency and abuse I

he means, they are not justified by all

according to the maxime cited by him, <hi>A
quatenus ad omne sequitur Vniversaliter.</hi> Nor
is he less Impertinent to accuse me of a self
contradiction, because I distinguish Faith, as
it is both receptive and operative; for even
the receptive Faith, I hold it to be a work,
and also wrought, not only in the Soul, but
in some degree by it, as a co-worker through
the operation of the Holy Spirit. And I say
again, to affirm that the Saints are not justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by Faith, as it is a work, is too nice, and
subtle a distinction, unless they mean thereby,
as work wrought by them, and as having an
equal proportion to the reward of Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
And in this sense, that may be as well
said, we are justified by Love, Repentance,
and all the Acts of men and Spiritual obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
but not as works done by us, and
having that quality of proportion to Eternal
Life.</p>
               <p>I shall not insist to Answer particularly <hi>I. A.</hi>
his pretended Arguments against Justification
by Repentance, and Conversion, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Acts of Righteousness, as proceeding
from the Spirit of Christ in Believers. The
whole force of his reasons being founded on a

refuted both by us, and divers noted men

in the <hi>Epis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Faith and all works, or the inward work
of Regeneration, and Renewing by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost, when he saith, <hi>We are not saved
by Works;</hi> and the contrary is manifest from
<hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. already cited. As for his saying,
<hi>That our Souls are of great price in the sight of
God, and yet do not merit Heaven, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
nor the best Works, although they are
said to be of great price with God.</hi> I grant, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our Souls, nor our Vertues merit Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
nor Redemption, as merit signifieth
equality: But seeing God hath counted our
Souls so dear, as to give so great a price for
them, as the Blood of his Dear Son, they
may at least be said to have some dignity or
worth (which is to say merit) in them; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
God would never have given so great
a Ransome for them, if the Souls of men,
in respect of their Nature and Being, had not
been of great value, which is all I understand
by the word merit, as used by any of us. And
truly for our part, we very rarely, or never
use the word merit, as with a respect to the
Saints best works, unless, when we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained,
to bear our Testimony against the
ignorance and rashness of those, who so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue,
and reproach the Blessed Spirit his
works in the Saints, as to call them not only
unclean and underfiled with sin, but sin it self,
<pb facs="tcp:60394:116"/>
for which God might justly condemn them to
Hell, as some have not been afraid to affirm.</p>
               <p>I take notice also on this Head, how <hi>I. A.</hi>
doth acknowledge, that Repentance, Love
and Hope, are necessary to Justification, by
way of presence, and existence, but not as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
or qualifications required in order to
Justification, which is another frivolous and
groundless distinction; for seeing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
doth equally press our Repentance and
Conversion, that we may obtain Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Justification, as it doth Faith. The
one is certainly as much the condition as the
other. And it is not Faith barely considered,
which hath the fitness to receive us into the
Favour of God, and his acceptance, but as it
is accompanied with sincere Repentance and
Obedience; for as it is a most unfit and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous
thing, that any man, while remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in his unbelief, should be admitted into
Friendship and Favour with God, so it is no
less unfit, and unagreeable to the Wisdom
and Holiness of God, to receive them into
his Friendship and Favour, as his Children,
who remain still Rebellious and disobedient
against him.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>I. A.</hi> his last Assertion on this Head,
consisting of above three pages; wherein he
only beats the Air, and fights with his own
shadow, upon a gross and perverse, but alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:60394:117"/>
groundless surmise; as if the <hi>Quake<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s</hi> did
deny any imputed Righteousness of Christ,
in what he did and suffered for us, but as it
is inwardly wrought and inherent in us; for
we most willingly and sincerely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that the Righteousness of Christ, in
what he did and suffered for us outwardly in
his own person, is imputed unto us for Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;
and so much I did acknowledge in
my Book already mentioned: But we further
say, that all to whom that is imputed, which
Christ did and suffered for us outwardly, must
witness a real and true Conformity both to
the Death of Christ, and also to his Holy
Life and walk, without which, all mens im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
it unto themselves, is but an airy
Dream and Imagination.</p>
               <p>There is yet another gross perversion used
by <hi>I. A.</hi> in his pretended Survey or Answer
of the sixteenth Question; as if the <hi>Quakers</hi>
so called, <hi>Seem to deny that there was any Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Worship, in the time of the Old Testament;</hi>
And thus because it is said in the Query, that
Christ set up the True Worship in Spirit and
in Truth above 1600 years ago; but nothing
but great Ignorance or prejudice, can from
this inferr, that there was not any degree of
it in the World in former times. And <hi>I. A.</hi>
might as well argue against the Scriptures,
that because God saith in the last days, <hi>He
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:60394:117"/>
would make a New Covenant with the House of</hi>
Israel, <hi>and Write his Law in their Hearts;</hi>
That therefore nothing of this sort was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
in the World. And thus I have done
with <hi>I. A.</hi> his long and tedious pretended
Survey of this Question, having omitted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that seemed unto me Material; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
found in his whole Discourse consisting
of about 19 pages, scarce any thing, but gross
mistakes and perversions.</p>

but on the contrary it plainly affirmeth, that
all who are in outward Worships (without
the leading and enabling of the Spirit of God)
painted over with glorious Words, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
full of Abominations, belong to the
Kingdom of <hi>Babylon.</hi> And well may that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
and deceitful Spirit, that acteth all such
persons who are levened and governed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

Figurative Speech, even as the Soul of a man
is commonly called the man, which hinders
not, that the people in whatsoever Profession
they may be, who are acted by that evil and
Antichristian Spirit, are <hi>Babylon.</hi> And as for
the <hi>Pope,</hi> and <hi>Popish Church;</hi> as we do cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
joyn with the best and most sincere <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antests</hi>
against them, as being the great and
principal Members of that Scarlet Whore
<hi>Mystery Babylon,</hi> in whom Antichrist or that
Antichristian Spirit hath its chiefest or most
principal residence, (and therefore in no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
can be said to favour the <hi>Pope,</hi> or <hi>Popish</hi>
Church, on that or any consideration, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
we with the Salvation of the worst,)
so we most freely declare, that wherever

of it is to be found in <hi>I. A.</hi> and too many of

Wages or reward, for being so kind to him,

               <p>As for his Postscript against, or for Doctor
<hi>Everards,</hi> Ghost, as he calleth it: I find not
my self concerned to Answer him therein, nor
defend every word or Opinion of his, seeing
he never went under that Name or Designati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with us: Albeit I must needs acknowledge,
both my Friends and I,(such of them I mean
as have read his Book) have a great love and
respect to his memory, which all <hi>I. A.</hi> his
bitter Revilings against him, shall never be
able to defame: And we believe the said
<hi>Everard</hi> hath indeed had rare and singular
gifts of Understanding and Openings of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from God, and withal a good measure
of Integrity and zeal for the Truth, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the time, and Dispensation he was in
and in that respect doth truly deserve to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
among the Witnesses of Truth in
his day, whatever imperfections attended
him otherwise; or suppose some mistakes of
Judgment in some things, or not so warily
cautioning some of his words, as could have
been wished. Although I judge that <hi>I. A.</hi> doth
seek to fix or fasten upon him divers errors of
Judgment, of which he is not guilty, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of deep prejudice against him: Partly,
whiles he takes the said <hi>Iohn Evrard</hi>'s words
too Literally and Superficially, which are to
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:60394:119"/>
be understood more Mystically and Figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
and partly while he takes that as
spoken absolutely, which is but spoken com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative,
and by way of some Similitude,
and but in some respect.</p>
               <p>But before I make a full close, I shall only
take notice of two gross and absurd Assertions,
(waving others to another opportunity) in
his Postscript to me. The one is, that the
<hi>Pope</hi> and his Clergy had the true Power and
Authority of Ordination, and calling Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
before the Reformation, neither as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
nor as Antichristian. Not as Christian,
or else all Christians would have it, nor as
Antichristian, seeing these two terms are not
contradictory but contrary; for many things
and persons too, are neither Christian nor
Antichristian. To which I Answer, Every
true Minister or Pastor hath his Anthority to
Execute his Function; as Christian, as nor
being a strict and formal reduplication, but
taken specifically; seeing to be a Christian
is as necessary to every true Minister of Christ,
as to be a living Creature is necessary to be a
man, or to be a man is necessary to be a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
or Magistrate, or Lawyer. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<hi>I. A.</hi> saith, <hi>That Christian and Antichristian
are not contradictory terms, seeing many persons
are neither Christian nor Antichristian</hi> I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
again, as they are taken indefinitely,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:60394:120"/>
they are not contradictory, but as restricted
to such as bear the Name and Profession of
Christianity they are perfectly contradictory,
so that every one that professeth himself to be
a Christian, (such as the <hi>Pope</hi> doth) is most
certainly either Christian or Antichristian.</p>
               <p>The other gross Assertion of his is, <hi>That
the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>was still a True Church,
and not</hi> Babylon, <hi>until the time of Reformation,</hi>
viz. <hi>about the time of the Council of</hi> Trent, <hi>or</hi>
Luther's <hi>arising, with some others to witness
against her; notwithstanding she did hold many
fundamental errors, and thus because her errors
were not so discovered and demonstrated unto her,
before as since that time.</hi> But what a miserable
shift and evasion this is, and how contrary
to Scripture, and the Judgment of the most
sound of all <hi>Protestant</hi> Writers, I leave the
Sober Reader to judge. For doth not the
Scripture plainly declare, <hi>That Mystery</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon
<hi>was to rule over the Nations, and deceive
them, and Drink the Blood of the Martyrs and
Witnesses of Iesus for many Hundreds of years?</hi>
And when was it, that she deceived all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?

hath the least knowledge of Church History,
but will say the contrary, and acknowledge
that she has been a Bloody Murtheress for
divers hundreds of years long before the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
and consequently was no true
Church of Christ. For not only her unsound
and corrupt Doctrines, but her wicked Life,
and especially her slaying the Witnesses of
Christ, <hi>And exalting her self over the Kings
and Emperors of the Earth,</hi> above six hundred
years ago (at least) with many other things
to be charged against her, utterly inconsistent
with a true Church, doth altogether make
her to be no true Church for many hundred
of years before <hi>Luther.</hi> And the Lord wanted
not Witnesses sufficient to demonstrate her
Errors unto her, many hundreds of years
before <hi>Luther;</hi> for in every Century God
raised up his Witnesses against her, as the
Church History doth plainly and fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.
