            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The CASE of the BOOKS ELLERS and PRINTERS Stated; with <hi>Anſwers</hi> to the <hi>Objections</hi> of the PATENTEE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is humbly conceived, Firſt, That the Author of every <hi>Manuſcript</hi> or <hi>Copy</hi> hath (in all reaſon) as good right thereunto, as any Man hath to the Eſtate wherein he has the moſt abſolute property; and conſequently the taking from him the one (without his own conſent) will be equivalent to the bereaving him of the other, contrary to his Will.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Thoſe who purchaſed ſuch Copies for valuable conſiderations, having the Authors right thereby transferred to them (and a due Licence and Entrance according to Law) 'twill be as prejudicial to deprive them of the benefit of their Purchaſe, as to Diſſeiſe them of their Freehold.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Art, Craft,</hi> and <hi>Myſtery</hi> of <hi>Printing,</hi> if it be made to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be a Common Trade and Occupation, whereby many hundred Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies are maintained; then the conſequence muſt be, That the Pattent now in queſtion, granted to <hi>John Moore,</hi> for the ſole Printing of all Books, touching or concerning the Common Law of <hi>England, Must be a Monopoly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, that it is a <hi>Common Trade,</hi> will be made evident, by conſidering, how, and when the Art of <hi>Printing</hi> came into this Kingdom, which was in the Reign of <hi>H.</hi> 6. and yet no <hi>Patent</hi> for <hi>Printing Law-books</hi> was granted until the Reign of <hi>Edw.</hi> the <hi>ſixth,</hi> which was about 100 years after. And not long after <hi>H.</hi> 6. the Art and Myſtery of Printing (being found a thing very uſeful for the Common-weal) <hi>The number of Printers much encreaſed, and Printing improved at the Subjects charge;</hi> after which, they took Apprentices, and had Servants, and many Families were ſupported by it; and ſo by the uſe and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity thereof, it then became a <hi>Common Trade,</hi> whereon the Subſiſtance of many Families have ever ſince depended: Inſomuch, That by the <hi>Stat.</hi> 35 <hi>H. 8. c.</hi> 15. it is in the preamble declared, <hi>That great numbers of Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are well skil'd in the Craft and Myſtery of Printing, in all points therefore the Statute prohibites any Forreigners to bring in any Books bound up, and lays likewiſe a penalty upon any perſons that ſhall buy any manner of Printed Books of any Forreigners by Retail.</hi> Which <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> did not onely declare Printing here to be a <hi>Common Craft</hi> and <hi>Trade,</hi> but likewiſe made Proviſions for the encouraging of the <hi>Trade</hi> for the future, the ſucceſs whereof is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to all Men; and this preſent Parliament calls Printing, <hi>An Art and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture which for many years hath been in this Kingdom;</hi> and ſays further for the encouragement thereof, <hi>Be it enacted, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being taken for a Ground, which cannot with any Reaſon or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority be denied; It is to be conſidered, Whether the Pattent, 19 <hi>Jan. 15 Jac.</hi> which grants to <hi>Moore</hi> the ſole Printing of all, and all manner of Books, which touch or concern the Common Laws of the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> with a Prohibition to others not to Print, Be a <hi>Monopoly,</hi> or not? And it is conceived, it is a <hi>Monopoly</hi> for theſe Reaſons.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. <hi>It is a Reſtraint of Trade;</hi> for by the ſame reaſon as the King may grant the ſole Printing of Law-Books, by the ſame reaſon he may grant the ſole Printing of all manner of Books to any perſon, which never any King of <hi>England</hi> did. In the Fiftieth year of King <hi>Edw.</hi> the Third, lone had procured a Pattent under the Great Seal for the ſole Selling of <hi>Sweet Wines</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and it was adjudged a <hi>Void Patent,</hi> as much as if it had a grant for the ſole Selling of all manner of <hi>Wines, Cooke 3 Inſt.</hi> 181. Note <hi>That Caſe exactly agrees with the Caſe now in Queſtion, and the Patent condemned in Parliament:</hi>
               </item>
               <item>II. <hi>It will much inhance the Prizes of Law-books;</hi> for if the Pattentee ſhall have a power to reſtrain others from Printing, he may advance the Rates of Books as he pleaſeth; and the rather now at this time, becauſe <hi>vaſt quantities of Law-books were burnt in the late Fire.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>III. <hi>If the Patentee ſhould Engroſs the whole Trade of Printing Law-books, he may Print the Books with bad Impreſſions, and yet make the Subject pay as dear for them, as for the beſt.</hi> All which particulars before mentioned, are declared by the Laws of <hi>England</hi> to be incidents inſeparable to all <hi>Monopolies,</hi> and the Caſe now in Queſtion, hath all thoſe inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies attending it.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Now it is to be conſidered where lies the ſtrength of the Arguments on the other ſide.</p>

It is anſwered, That there were divers <hi>Law-books</hi> Printed before 1641, and ſince the <hi>Kings moſt happy Reſtauration,</hi> by particular perſons, without any reſpect to the <hi>Patent,</hi> ſome of which were produced before the <hi>Honourable Committee for Printing.</hi> And whereas great quantities of <hi>Law-books</hi> have been burnt in the late <hi>Fire,</hi> which now need Reprinting; as Three Parts of the <hi>Lord Coke's Inſtitutes,</hi> and Three Volumes of <hi>Judge Croke's Reports,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others; the Copies of which Books coſt thoſe who firſt Printed them many 100 pounds, and onely whoſe right it is to Reprint them, as firſt Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers: yet the ſaid <hi>Farmers</hi> of the <hi>Patent</hi> did the ſaid 26th of <hi>October,</hi> declare to the Committee, <hi>That by vertue of their Patent, they claimed the ſole Printing of all Law-books, old and new, though other mens Copies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And to make it more plainly appear, that this</hi> Patent <hi>is a very great Grievance, ſeveral of the</hi> Complainants <hi>having purchaſed the</hi> Manuſcript <hi>or Copy of a Law-book writ by</hi> Serjeant Rolls, <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenced and Prepard for the Preſs by the Lord chief Baron</hi> Hales, (<hi>and Regiſtred according to the Act of this</hi> Parliament.) <hi>Bought a great quantity of</hi> Paper <hi>to Print the ſaid</hi> Book, <hi>and have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready Printed 100 Sheets; but by Vertue of the</hi> Patent, <hi>a Stop hath been put to the</hi> Preſs <hi>ever ſince</hi> Auguſt <hi>laſt, and is yet continued, to the great Damage of the</hi> Owners, <hi>who have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready expended above 1000 pounds upon the ſaid</hi> Book.</p>
               <p>Whereas it is alledged, <hi>That</hi> Wingate's <hi>Abridgment is now ſold for 6 s.</hi> It is anſwered, That before the late dreadful Fire, it was not ſold for above 5 s. and until the Farmers of the Patent wreſted it out of the hands of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors, not for above <hi>Four ſhillings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the treaſonable Book ſuggeſted in the cloſe of their Caſe, ſaid to be Publiſhed by one of the Complainants as a new Book this year 1666, is a notorious untruth, for it was Printed in the times of the late <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and not ſince, and lookt upon to be <hi>Printed</hi> by one of the <hi>Farmers</hi> of this <hi>Patent</hi> who uſed then to Write and Print Books of that nature.</p>
               <p>And the Honourable Committee of Parliament having upon this occaſion voted the Patent (according to the pretended Extent) <hi>to be a Monopoly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is humbly ſubmitted to the conſideration of the Honourable Aſſembly of Parliament, whether the ſaid Patent (as to the pretence of</hi> Sole Printing all Books <hi>touching or concerning the Common Law of</hi> England) <hi>ought not to be made void?</hi>
