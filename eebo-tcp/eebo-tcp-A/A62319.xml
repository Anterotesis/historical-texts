            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Argument OF THE WHOLE.</head>
            <l>THe Gyant <hi>Typhon</hi>'s mighty strength;</l>
            <l>His courage, inches, and his length:</l>
            <l>The threats, the menaces and odds</l>
            <l>'Twixt him, the Gyants and the Gods.</l>
            <l>Those wonders which as yet but few know,</l>
            <l>Besides those Gods and Madam <hi>Juno;</hi>

            <l>And they are wiser then to tell</l>
            <l>Disasters to themselves befell.</l>
            <l>The nimble God from heaven sent</l>
            <l>Returnes with Gyants Complement:</l>
            <l>At which the Gods begin to tremble,</l>
            <l>And straight a Parliament assemble;</l>
            <l>Who for preventing future harms,</l>
            <l>Consult on manner of their Arms:</l>
            <l>Debating long, it is decreed</l>
            <l>That <hi>Vulcan</hi> fall to work with speed.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:62881:4"/>With ill success: again they arm,</l>
            <l>Renew a second time the fight</l>
            <l>With like success, are put to slight.</l>
            <l>Back they return, and gain the odds;</l>
            <l>They rout, and they pursue the Gods,</l>
            <l>Who cunningly do vary shape</l>
            <l>In Wood, the better to escape.</l>
            <l>The Gods bethink it base to range</l>
            <l>In Woods like beasts, and therefore change</l>
            <l>Their borrow'd shapes: at <hi>Nylus</hi>-banks</l>
            <l>God <hi>Mercury</hi> performs his pranks</l>
            <l>They cloath themselves, to <hi>Memphis</hi> go;</l>
            <l>The Priest and People kindness show:</l>
            <l>Great <hi>Hercules</hi> they send for, who</l>
            <l>Attends them with no more ado.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Jove</hi> and his son <hi>Alcides</hi> go</l>
            <l>By joynt consent in quest of foe.</l>
            <l>Gyants scale heaven to a wonder;</l>
            <l>From thence are headlong thrown by Thunder.</l>
            <l>A fight determines; where's the odds,</l>
            <l>On Gyants side, or on the Gods.</l>
            <l>Gyants are slaine, and <hi>Typhon</hi> flies:</l>
            <l>Great <hi>Jove</hi> pursues, and <hi>Typhon</hi> dies.</l>

               <l>Quoth he, Give <hi>Bacchus</hi> t'other cup:</l>
               <l>He that speaks sense deserves to drink;</l>
               <l>Fill him some Nectar to the brink:</l>
               <l>He spake sense now, but drank before;</l>
               <l>Give him some drink, he'll utter more:</l>
               <l>It should be <hi>(Ganimede)</hi> your part</l>
               <l>To be provided with a Quart</l>
               <l>For whoso wants. Thus went he on,</l>
               <l>Till <hi>Iove</hi> cry'd out, No more, ha' done,</l>
               <l>You carping Knave; or if you'll not,</l>
               <l>I'll mince you small as herbs in pot:</l>
               <l>Or if you drop a word i' th' way,</l>
               <l>When any here hath ought to say:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:62881:32"/>This is no more a place for laughing,</l>

               <l>For all these checks, you may believe</l>
               <l>The Knave laught at him in his sleeve.</l>
               <l>Then quoth <hi>Salasia, Neptune</hi>'s wife,</l>
               <l>This <hi>Momus</hi> does delight in strife.</l>
               <l>More she'd have said, when <hi>Vulcan</hi> came</l>
               <l>Limping to <hi>Iove,</hi> (for he was lame)</l>
               <l>And Blacksmith-like, without a Band,</l>
               <l>By'r leave, quoth he, with Cap in hand:</l>
               <l>Great Sir, I judge we ought to shew</l>
               <l>What dutie you may claim as due:</l>
               <l>Yet if you have your eye or ear</l>
               <l>From <hi>Momus,</hi> he doth laugh and jear.</l>
               <l>

               <l>He's such another fiend of hell:</l>
               <l>Nor he, nor any of his Race,</l>
               <l>Were ever worth a Fiddle-case.</l>
               <l>But 'tis no matter: pray retire,</l>
               <l>And tell us, thou great God of Fire,</l>
               <l>The means to quell these Gyant-dogs.</l>
               <l>Let me alone to forge out Clogs,</l>
               <l>Quoth <hi>Vulcan:</hi> but I'll tell you, Sirs,</l>
               <l>The best defence against the Curs</l>
               <l>Is to bar up your windows all</l>
               <l>With iron Grates, and raise your wall:</l>
               <l>I'll forge them out so strong, you'll say,</l>
               <l>The workman merits double pay:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:62881:33"/>They shall defend with so much ease,</l>
               <l>Heav'n needs no other bars then these.</l>
               <l>The thing requires some haste, I trow;</l>
               <l>Straight to my Cyclops will I go,</l>
               <l>And cause them beat with strength of arm</l>
               <l>Bars to protect the Gods from harm.</l>
               <l>So fare you well. 'Twas <hi>Momus</hi> now,</l>
               <l>That next with tongue began to plow:</l>
               <l>For 'tis to him as Cash and Diet</l>
               <l>To talk, and poison to be quiet.</l>
               <l>Quoth he, 'Tis foolish; Gyants are</l>
               <l>So tall, they'll reach to iron bar,</l>
               <l>There fix a hold, by that means get</l>
               <l>Perhaps to place where now we sit:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:62881:34"/>For if they once get hold of Grate,</l>
               <l>They'll quickly burst a room for pate;</l>
               <l>And if the head does enter hollow,</l>
               <l>The body certainly will follow:</l>

               <l>They can't get in, so hugely ill</l>
               <l>Their holding is; for Gyant proud</l>
               <l>Has nothing to embrace but cloud.</l>
               <l>Quoth <hi>Iupiter,</hi> I pray give o'er,</l>
               <l>We have consider'd this before:</l>
               <l>What you say we'll prevent with Guard</l>
               <l>Shall watch from time the Gods are barr'd;</l>

               <l>By this time night came on, and they</l>

               <l>The Gyant, when he saw the same,</l>

               <l>O'er legs and shoulders, arms and backs,</l>
               <l>Among the Gods: he held in hand</l>
               <l>A tall Pine, which he did command</l>
               <l>With ease: it was the same with which</l>

               <l>Kicks on the Belly and the Cods,</l>

               <l>With <hi>AEtna</hi> hid him. Stories tell,</l>

               <l>His brother did. And thus the State</l>

               <l>Who spurns against a Deity,</l>
