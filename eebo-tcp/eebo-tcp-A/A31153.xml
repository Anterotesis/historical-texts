            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Caſe of the <hi>ENGLISH WEAVERS</hi> and <hi>FRENCH MERCHANTS</hi> truly Stated.</head>
            <p>THe Deſign of the WEAVERS in their Bill, contained in the Preamble, is the encouragement of them in their Trade, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by all to be neceſſary, and very beneficial to the whole Nation, which they ſay is much diſcouraged by the frequent Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Forreign-wrought Silks, eſpecially from FRANCE, moſt of which are privately conveyed hither without paying of Cuſtome, by which means the FRENCH MERCHANTS are ſufficiently enabled to underſell the WEAVERS in their Home-made Commodities, and conſequently carry away the Trade of theſe Nations.</p>
            <p>The FRENCH MERCHANTS, in anſwer to this, ſay, The WEAVERS of ENGLAND are under a great Miſtake, and that their diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not becauſe the FRENCH MERCHANTS do not pay their Cuſtomes, but becauſe the WEAVERS live too high, and are not ſo good Workmen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as the WEAVERS in their Preamble refer to the Cuſtome-Houſe Books for proof, ſo have they ingeniouſly done likewiſe.</p>
            <p>Therefore here follows a true Accompt of the particular Entries of all wrought, as well as unwrought Silks in the Port of <hi>London,</hi> from <hi>Michaelmas</hi> 1668, to <hi>ditto</hi> 1669. together with the Places from whence they came; by which it will truly appear, whether the ENGLISH WEAVERS or the FRENCH MERCHANTS are under a Miſtake: And it is humbly ſubmitted to ſerious Conſideration, it being conceived by ſome eminent Merchants and Tradeſmen in and about this City, to be a Matter of very high Concernment to Trade, and the general Intereſt of the Nation.</p>

               <head>OBSERVATIONS.</head>
               <p>BEſides, to the Entries of Silks wrought up here, may be added the great Revenue that comes to the KING, by Dying Stuff imported, which amounts the ſame year to 9193<hi>l.</hi> 6<hi>s.</hi> 8<hi>d.</hi> a great Quantity whereof is uſed in the Dying of the Silks here Manufactured.</p>
               <p>It is worthy Obſervation, that the wrought Silks imported are doubly rated to the Silks that are manufactured here; ſo that there hath been entred at the Port of <hi>London,</hi> of wrought Silks 20101<hi>l.</hi> weight leſs than one fourth part of the Silks wrought here.</p>
               <p>Now the FRENCH MERCHANTS ſay, that we make not ſo many as they import, and it is too true; becauſe we are prevented by their unfair Dealing: nay 'tis verily believed, and by ſome of themſelves confeſſed, that we make not one ſixth part of the Silks that are worn in theſe Nations; but ſuppoſe there were one third part made here, how greatly then is the KING wronged, and his Subjects, the Handi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts men, diſcouraged, when inſtead of accompting at the Cuſtom-houſe for 60000<hi>l. per ann.</hi> and upwards, they pay but little more than 5000<hi>l.</hi> Subſidy? for the Additional Duty is not to be accompted in this Calculation.</p>
               <p>From hence it appears, that the FRENCH MERCHANTS are greatly miſtaken in their Grounds of the ENGLISH WEAVERS Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement in their Trade; for certainly 55000<hi>l. per ann.</hi> and upwards, with the Additional Duty added to it, eſcaping Cuſtoms, will enable them to carry on their Trade, and conſequently incourage a Forreign Intereſt when the ENGLISH ARTISTS muſt ſit ſtill, although as good, if not better Workmen than the FRENCH, as may be proved if occaſion offers.</p>
               <p>But to take particular Notice of the FRENCH Manufactures of Silks imported, if the Merchants and Traders therein be obſerved, they will be found to be moſt guilty of the occaſion of the WEAVERS Complaint by their Bill; Therefore here follows a true Accompt of what they have entred at <hi>London</hi> and other Ports, from <hi>Michaelmas</hi> 1668, to <hi>Ditto</hi> 1669.</p>

               <p>It is modeſtly conjectured, that the FRENCH MERCHANTS Trade for at leaſt double the Quantity in Silks more than the Natives, and yet they enter not one ninth part in weight of Silk to what the ENGLISH do, nor pay little more than one third in Subſidy to the King, ſo that did they make a true Entry, whereas they pay 3463<hi>l.</hi> they ought to pay 62334<hi>l. per annum;</hi> ſo that they pay ſhort of their Duties in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidy 58871<hi>l.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if they object, that a great part of this Silk is wrought up in Ribbons, Laces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> againſt that may be ſet the vaſt Quantities of their Ribbons, Laces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are imported without paying any Duty, becauſe prohibited: And beſides allow them to take off one half, for the Manufactures of Ribbons, and Laces made here, which is the moſt they can reaſonably do; yet notwithſtanding they anſwer not their Duty by 29435<hi>l</hi> 10 <hi>s. per ann.</hi> in Subſidy, beſides a Moiety thereof for Additional Duty.</p>
               <p>It is obſervable, that far greater Quantities, of <hi>French</hi> Silks are vended in theſe Nations than of <hi>Italian</hi> Silks, and yet enter not ſo much in Weight: neither do the <hi>Italian</hi> wrought Silks ſo much prejudice the Native Artiſts, becauſe few or none of thoſe kinds, or ſorts, of Silks are here manufactured: But by the frequent Importation of <hi>French</hi> Silks and Stuffs (which are chiefly paid for with Monies, not with other Commodities) the <hi>English</hi> Artiſts are greatly diſcouraged, as from others, ſo eſpecially from the making of Faſhionable figured Silks and Stuffs, in which they are ſufficiently skilful, and moſt inclinable to: therefore the Discountenance of the <hi>French</hi> Silks and Stuffs is chiefly aimed at by the WEAVERS Bill.</p>
               <p>Theſe things conſidered, it makes the WEAVERS wonder that the FRENCH MERCHANTS ſhould, in their Paper, ſay, the King would loſe 120000<hi>l. per ann.</hi> if a Seal for their Goods be appointed (which they know is the only way to prevent their Goods from eſcaping the Cuſtoms, and many other inconveniences by the <hi>French</hi> Trade) whereas by the Accompt aforeſaid it appears, there was paid in Subſidy, for all Silks from Forreign parts, but little more than 8000 <hi>l.</hi> in one year.</p>
               <p>Nor do the WEAVERS deſign a Monopoly (as is reflected) by this Seal, they being no way fond of that trouble, but willing to wave the ſame, if any other way may be found as effectual to the End deſigned by their Bill, that is, Security of His Majeſties Cuſtoms and Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>Engliſh</hi> Artiſts in their Trade. After a ſerious peruſal hereof, it is hoped the FRENCH MERCHANTS Reaſons againſt the WEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERS Bill, will be weighed in the Ballance with the grand End intended; and then no queſtion but they will be found too light: All which is humbly ſubmitted.</p>
