            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THere is a <hi>Warning</hi> for us, to take consideration of the loss of <hi>good</hi> or <hi>useful</hi> men; and to <hi>fear,</hi> when they are <hi>going</hi> from us, that some evil is <hi>coming</hi> to us. The Prophet complaineth of the too great and general neglect hereof in his time: <hi>The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart; and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken from the evil to come,</hi> Esay 57.1. When God sendeth his <hi>Angel</hi> to pluck out his righteous <hi>Lots,</hi> what may <hi>Sodom</hi> expect but <hi>fire</hi> and <hi>brimstone</hi> to be rained down upon them? When he plucketh up the fairest and choicest <hi>flowers</hi> in his Garden, &amp; crop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth off the tops of the goodliest <hi>Poppies,</hi> who can think other then that he mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50684:5"/>
to lay his <hi>Garden</hi> waste, and to turn it into a wilde <hi>Wilderness?</hi> When he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermineth the main <hi>Pillars</hi> of the house, taketh away the very <hi>props</hi> and <hi>buttresses</hi> of Church and Commonwealth; sweep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away religious <hi>Princes,</hi> wise <hi>Senators,</hi> zealous <hi>Magistrates,</hi> painful <hi>Ministers,</hi> men of eminent <hi>ranks, gifts</hi> or <hi>example</hi>; who shall be secure tha either <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweal</hi> shall stand up long, and not <hi>totter</hi> at least, if not <hi>fall?</hi> God in <hi>mercy</hi> taketh such away from the <hi>evil</hi> to come; we in <hi>wisdom</hi> should look for <hi>evil</hi> to come, when God taketh such away.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Am equally sorry that I cannot satisfie your just desire in the Remarques of our Renowned <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan</hi>'s <hi>Life,</hi> as that I must comply with your sad fear in the too true report of his <hi>Death</hi>; that I must assure you we have lost the man, and what was mortal in him, and yet cannot help you to his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and what was immortal in him: that when I must write you the news that he is dead to the world, I cannot draw a character wherein he may <hi>live</hi> with the good and vertuous for ever.
<q>The
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50684:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wise, the holy and the good, live more nobly in their vertues and graces in the hearts of others, then they did in their own bodies.</q>
            </p>
            <p>His modesty wrapped him in that privacy, and his place kept him at that distance, that I cannot take his portraicture, nor recount his memorials so exactly as I could wish, and you may expect: yet though for no other cause then for this,
<q>That Posterity may know we have not loosely through silence permitted things and persons to pass away as in a dream;</q> there shall be thus much extant concerning this excellent person, for his own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and the honour of the Church he was bred in, That he was a Bishop, and a man of most sound Judgement, of most deep Learning, of a vast Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, of an holy and unspotted Life, of an unsuspected Integrity; a great Friend, a faithful Servant, a valiant Champion of the Church.
More particularly there shall be extant, 1. His Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: 2. His temper of body and minde: 3. The great instances of his Life: 4. His Person and Aspect: 5. His Works or Writings: 6. His Sufferings: 7. His Rewards and Preferments: And lastly and chiefly, his Judgement and Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those Cases of Conscience that concern the Discipline or Worship of our Church:—where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you will observe something <hi>admirable,</hi> many things <hi>imitable,</hi> all things <hi>commendable.</hi>

               </note>VVhen his Parents observed that he was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of advancing the VVorshipfulness of his Birth by the excellency of his Parts, his pregnant Wit, his large and capacious Understanding,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50684:6"/>
his fixed Judgement, his faithful Memory, and his hopeful Seriousness, they took care that his youth and first years of reason should not be lost, but (being hardly recovered if neglected) be carefully improved in all good Learning: of which he was not onely capable, but comprehensive, in a severe and exact Grammar-School; where, by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied diligence, a silent, sedentary, and astoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed way of following his Book, a seriousness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his years, (Oh how would he steal away from his Companions follies, to his severer tasks and privacies!) he made his way thorow all things on which he could fix, to an exactness in Greek and Latine, which he retained to his dying day. And he would observe,
<q>That an exactness in School-learning was a great advantage to our higher stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; as the miscarriages of School are not easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recovered in the University:— the errours of the first Concoction being hardly rectified in the second.</q>
            </p>
            <p>At School he observed, he learned an art of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. When he was enjoyned to learn what he understood not, (which was then an ordinary mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage in Grammar-Schools) he was compelled to make use of similitudes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to remember those things he knew not, to think upon something like them he knew. As he had many excellent Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations touching Schools, which he would say were the most considerable places in a Kingdome: so he would usually say,
<q>That the <hi>Practical Way</hi> is the best;</q> when as <hi>Aristotle</hi> speaks, <hi>We learn that by doing, which we learn to do.</hi>

               </gap>, excel his equals and himself; in a staid worth above his years and time, always eminent, always excellent. And therefore I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him furnished with excellent Rules of Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar and Rhetorick, with choice pieces of History, Poetry and Oratory, with an elegancie in Latine, a good judgement in Greek; serious in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe, prudent in his study, industrious in his way, clear in his apprehension, searching in his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; serene, orderly and methodical in his thoughts; sober and civil in his carriage: (the School having added to his great Parts that humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, meekness, modesty, obedience and civility, as, advantaged by his good disposition, rendred him to his dying day submissive to Superiours, obliging to his Equals, tender to his Inferiours, amiable and charitable to all.) I follow him (with as much duty, observance and affection, though not with so much ability as other men) to the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of <hi>Oxford</hi>; where, in <hi>Lincoln</hi>-Colledge, with a slow, but sure pace, he proceeded in all rational and solid Learning: his unwearied minde strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the intricacies, perplexities, darkness and confusion of Nature, and aiming at that clear and genuine apprehension of things we were created in, <hi>after the image of God, in knowledge:</hi> not so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent upon the notions, as the nature of things. As
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50684:7"/>
he had attained to so much Grammar as enabled him to speak his minde properly, and so much Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick as to express it perswasively: so he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to gain so much Logick as might order, guide and direct his thoughts <hi>methodically</hi>; in <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending</hi> things <hi>distinctly</hi>; in <hi>judging</hi> of them <hi>exactly</hi>; in finding out the truth that lies in them <hi>successfully</hi>; in <hi>discovering</hi> the errours, deceits and fallacies imposed upon us in them <hi>evidently</hi>; and <hi>urging</hi> the truths found out <hi>convincingly.</hi> His way was, 1. to <hi>write</hi> the Rules his Tutor suggested, or his Books afforded: (for he writ most he read or heard, as he said, <hi>to stay his active and young soul upon things, until he had distinctly conceived them.</hi>) 2. To debate those Rules with himself and others, which he had so written. 3. To practise them upon some Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion or other, till they became as his native Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as his own soul. Whereby he afterwards at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in all cases a great happiness to comprehend things fully, to state Controversies exactly, to lay them before others both clearly and compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously; to finde out the merit of a Cause, the right joynt of a Question exactly; to confirm a Truth pertinently, properly and acutely: insomuch that as he composed a new Logick, an excellent way of Reasoning; so he was himself for many years the <hi>publike Reason</hi> of the Church: looking into Debates deeply, opening them solidly and conspicuously, determining them impartially, conscientiously and clearly; pressing Truth and Duty convincingly: his Reasons were strong and demonstrative, his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations close and pertinent, his Observations
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50684:8"/>
choice and prudent; his Deductions clear, his Censure impartial, his Expressions apt, suitable, weighty and accurate; his Discourse steady, judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, undistracted, made up of abstract notions of Reason, Experience and Religion; his Thoughts calm, smoothe, and methodical. He was a great engrosser of private Systemes and Papers; and he would say, <hi>The united Reason of many industrious and serious searchers after the Truth, make one compleat man.</hi> He would gather the acutest Arguments he found among Philosophers, to <hi>quicken,</hi> though not to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct</hi> himself: these smart trifles (he would say) would help us to that acuteness and distinctness of apprehension that might be useful in greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: and it was equally useful and pleasant to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the various workings of several Reasons with mens several defects and excellencies; by the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the one whereof, and imitating the other, a man might raise a frame of soul most knowing, most clear, and almost innocent.
He advised yong men to <q>advance towards a clear understanding of any thing by these steps: 1. To understand the word by which it is expressed, in all its acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations. 2. To understand all the words in the learned Languages, by which that thing is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed; with the Original of those words, and the reason why they were made use of to express that thing; with all the words that are neer to it, and their signification. 3. Then to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the nature of the thing, with what it hath common with other things, and what it hath spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial in it self; what relation it hath to other
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50684:8"/>
things in the world; whence it proceeded; for what end it was made: with other things that are like it. Thus to know a few things exactly, is to be very learned. As to any Question that was to be debated, the words (he said) must be clearly understood, and the notion of the things in debate stated; and then, what is granted on all sides concerning the things rightly understood must be shewed;</q> 
               <hi>and what is controverted (as there will be very little, when words and things are well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood) must be clearly laid down as it is understood on all hands, and convincingly proved by a proper reason from the nature of the thing, or from authority, pressed and cleared from all evasions, cavils and subterfuges; which cavils must be proposed faithfully and honestly, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered briefly and fully, ingeniously, candidly and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His advice about reading of Authors was this: 1. To observe the nature of the thing handled, and so know what to look for from him, what part of Learning he may satisfie you in. 2. To observe the Author, and the occasion, time and way of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. 3. To observe what is said of the thing handled in direct Propositions. 4. To note what is said indirectly of it out of other Learning, as Rhetorick, Philology, History, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 5. To take notice what new Explications the Author useth beyond what we have in the old Learning: his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Conclusions and Arguments, with the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks from whence they are taken; with his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to Arguments and Objections. He would say,
<q>It was no less then a miracle of knowledge
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50684:9"/>
that men might attain to, if they proceeded thus distinctly in reading Authors, and in pursuing after knowledge.</q>
He advised young men to use Common-place-books; in the beginning whereof, there might be a common table, containing the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral heads of the book: under which generally, the special heads may be written, with references to the pages where those heads are handled, with a little blank space after each sort of heads, wherein more heads if we meet with them may be inserted: for every head let there be reserved a page, where what notable sentence, notion, rule or particular soever is suggested to us in reading, meditating, discoursing, may be written and reserved for future use. His minde thus guided by sure and constant Rules of Reason, made the more methodical, and so more happier progress in learning Languages and Intellectual Sciences, Philosophy, History, Poetry, Philology, and the whole circle of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which he throughly studied, and methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally digested, making each part illustrate and help another, until he became a great Master of the whole,—and his Parts voted him Fellow of the House, (an excellent advantage for young men to improve their first years of prudence and discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) and made him an eminent Tutor in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, where he at once learned and taught, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his own Parts and Reason, while he improved his Pupils: <hi>I learn,</hi> said he, <hi>much from my Master, more from my Equals, and most of all from my Disciples.</hi> And indeed he allowed himself no other diversion then what the giving encouragement and instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50684:9"/>
to ingenious young Students yeilded him: (a thing he peculiarly delighted in, as wherein he could observe the several weaknesses of Reason, and their respective remedies.)</p>
            <p>Here he was as retired as he could; being able, but not forward to appear, and very willing to improve himself. His modest thoughts and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust of himself made him a while satisfie himself with the conscience of well-doing, having the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est pleasure of enjoying Worth without noise, and Vertue without applause; being a great <hi>Stream</hi> of Learning, without noise, <hi>deep</hi> and <hi>clear.</hi>

            <p>While he was in the University,<note place="margin">Sect 2. <hi>His In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry.</hi>
               </note> he generally spent eleven hours a day in study: which industry of his, dispatched the whole course of Philosophy, and picked out in a manner all that was useful in all Classick Authors that are extant; drawing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dexes for his private use, either in his own Paper-book, or at the beginning and end of each book: which will testifie his indefatigable pains to as many as shall peruse his excellent and well-chosen Study. This assiduity continued to his dying day, as if he had resolved to depart studying, and go im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from his pursuit of <hi>revealed truth,</hi> to the view of the <hi>eternal.</hi> He disposed himself and time to perpetual industry and diligence; not only avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but perfectly hating idleness, and hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending any thing more then this; <hi>Be always furnished with somewhat to do, as the best way to inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and pleasure.</hi> There was not a minute of the day he left vacant from business of necessity, civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or study: you should hardly see him without
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50684:10"/>
his book, or hardly meet him without his plodding thoughts and meditations. A clear and calm way he had of weighing duely what he should do, in designing what he had considered, and soberly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming what he had designed. His minde was wholly inward, where lay his Scoenes of discreet, prudent and pious undertakings. In sicknesses, if they were not so violent as to make the recollecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his thoughts impossible, he never intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted study, but rather re-inforced, as the best ease of his distemper, and diversion of his pain. His way was to cast into paper his Observations, and direct them to his great designe. I may say of him, as the reverend Dr. <hi>Fell</hi> saith of his good friend the excellent Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> That considering his time of prayer and instructing his family, his perusal of the writings of friends and strangers when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rended to be publick, his review of his own works, his reception of visits, whether for civility or for resolution of conscience, or information in point of difficulty, which were numerous, and great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers of his time, (he being reckoned the ablest and faithfullest Casuist in the world) his general Correspondencies by Letters, which took up the proportion of a day in each Week, and more: I say, he that shall consider these instances of dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, besides his own vast reading, must be to seek what point of time remained undisposed of, and <hi>learn to redeem the time.</hi>

Wine</hi> and <hi>musick,</hi> and gorge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>apparel,</hi> and delicate <hi>fare,</hi> are such things as God in his goodness hath created and given to the children of men for their comfort; and they may

use them lawfully, and take comfort in them as their portion: but he that shall use any of them <hi>intemperately,</hi> or <hi>unseasonably,</hi> or <hi>vainly,</hi> or <hi>wastfully,</hi> abuseth both them and himself. And therefore we shall often finde both the things themselves condemned, and those that used them blamed in the Scriptures.

And yet none of all these things are or were <hi>in themselves</hi> unlawful: it was the <hi>excess</hi> onely, or other <hi>disorder</hi> in the use of them, that made them obnoxious to reproof. Though some in their heat have said so, yet who can reasonably say, that <hi>horse-matches,</hi> or playing at <hi>cards</hi> or <hi>dice,</hi> are in themselves and wholly <hi>unlawful?</hi> And yet on the other side, what sober wise man, because the Things are <hi>lawful,</hi> would therefore approve of that vain and sinful expence which is oftentimes bestowed by men of mean estates in <hi>the dieting</hi> of Horses, and <hi>wagering</hi> upon them? or of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive abuse of <hi>gaming,</hi> wherein thousands of our Gentry spend in a manner their whole <hi>time,</hi> and consume away their whole <hi>substance,</hi> both which ought to be far more precious unto them? I might instance in many other things in like manner. In
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50684:13"/>
all which, we may easily erre either in point of <hi>judgement,</hi> or <hi>practice,</hi> or both; if we do not wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sever <hi>the use</hi> from the <hi>abuse.</hi> Many times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>the abuses</hi> are common and great, we peevish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>condemn</hi> in others <hi>the very use</hi> of some <hi>lawful things.</hi> And many times again, because there is evidently a <hi>lawful use</hi> of the things, we impudently <hi>justifie</hi> our selves in the very <hi>abuses</hi> also.

His method was to chuse his Text <hi>pertinently</hi>; to weigh its occasion, coherence, and other circumstances, <hi>duely</hi>; to look out the truest reading of it, <hi>industriously</hi>; to open that Original by reading out of the choicest Authors, and most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per learning in that kinde, <hi>clearly</hi>; to drop such pithy and pertinent Observations, learned, moral, divine, as he went on in Explication, <hi>judiciously</hi>; to pitch upon great Observations that were couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the several parts, <hi>usefully:</hi> which he deduced
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50684:14"/>
from the Text evidently, (for he could not endure those that wrested the Scripture for a truth, as men that were under a temptation of wresting them for an errour) bottomed upon their proper Grounds and Reasons orderly, (pressing each truth with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence raised from their several places in the body of Divinity) illustrated and enlarged with general Learning, and <hi>improved</hi> to the respective Duties of Christianity that he saw might rationally be infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from them: and indeed his general Learning afforded him plenty of Observations, proper, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and useful, upon each head. His way, like Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> was after every Sermon to resolve upon the ensuing subject, and to draw a Scheme of it, and to take in the course of his study what fell in conducible unto the present purpose; and he spoke from the heart to the heart.</p>
            <p>As he provided strong meat for strong men, so he provided sincere milk for babes, spending an hour at evening in the Church-Catechism, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at the Parents and elder sort were wont to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and from whence they reaped more benefit then from his Sermons; the great Principles of Religion working more powerfully upon them then his Discourses and Enlargements. <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity was most successful,</hi> he would say, <hi>when proposed naked and in its own evidence, as the truth was in Jesus.</hi> By Catechising, the Gospel prevailed over Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daism and Heathenism; by Catechising, Popery incroached and broke in upon the Gospel; by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techising, the Gospel again recovered itself, and got ground of Popery. He opened the Church-Catechism
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50684:15"/>
distinctly, grounded them in each point stedfastly, and taught them their duties arising out of each part of Religion profitably; making it appear as he went along, <hi>how the grace of God bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing salvation by Jesus Christ hath appeared, teaching men to deny all ungodliness and wordly lust, and to live soberly, justly and godly in the present world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As he taught them, so he and they lived up to a Religion pure and undefiled: he and they joyning together in the holy Offices, 1. Of Common-prayer in all the days appointed, devoutly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently, (where he and his family was the great Rule and Pattern.) 2. Of the holy Sacrament carefully and preparedly, not without previous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions and directions publick and private. 3. In an holy love and charity, which taught them suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessfully, being exemplary therein, and being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by his great skill in all Laws to compose all Differences in his private address and conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: his Judgement being so esteemed, that there were few that knew him, but would stand to his prudent and honest Arbitration: wherein the God of love and peace so blessed him, that as he maintained love among others, so he had the love of all; there being not any of his function either more esteemed while alive, or more lamented when dead. Neither did he think it enough to perswade his people to an obligingness in Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, unless he could work them to a charity and hospitality, whereby they might endear themselves to each other, and relieve the poor. Among them he would be the most welcome: for he understood
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50684:15"/>
very well how much the Applications of the Table enforced the Doctrines of the Pulpit; and how subservient the endearing of his person was to the recommending of his instructions, where his ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, apt and facetious way, sweetned his more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious discourse, and weighty conceptions: so that he was heard at once with the highest <hi>pleasure</hi> and <hi>profit</hi> in the world. As he urged their charity to the Poor earnestly, so he directed it discreetly, that the Idle partaked not of it: and truely the Needy had a stock raised for them, to employ and relieve them; I say, to employ and relieve them: for he had no charity for the Idle and the Vagrant,— the very scabs, filth and vermine of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. I mean such as have <hi>health,</hi> and <hi>strength,</hi> and <hi>limbs,</hi> and are in some measure able to <hi>work,</hi> and take pains for their living, yet rather chuse to <hi>wander</hi> abroad the Country, and to spend their days in a most base and ungodly course of life; and, which is yet more lamentable, by I know not what connivence, contrary to all <hi>Conscience, Equity,</hi> and <hi>Law,</hi> are suffered. All Christian <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths</hi> should be the <hi>Israels</hi> of God; and in his <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> God, as he <hi>promised</hi> there should be some al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>poor,</hi> on whom to exercise charity; so he <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained</hi> there should be <hi>no beggar,</hi> to make a trade and profession of begging. <hi>Plato,</hi> than whom ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any laid down a more exact <hi>Idea</hi> of an happy Commonwealth, alloweth not any <hi>beggar</hi> therein; alledging, that where such were tolerated, it was impossible but the State must abound with <hi>pilfering</hi> and <hi>whoring,</hi> and all kinde of base villany. The
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50684:16"/>
               <hi>Civil Laws</hi> have flat Constitutions against them, in the Titles <hi>de mendicantibus non invalidis.</hi> But I think never kingdom had more wholesome laws in both kinds, I mean both for the competent <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief</hi> of <hi>the orderly poor,</hi> and for sharp <hi>restraint</hi> of <hi>disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly vagabonds,</hi> then those provisions which in many of our own memories have been made in this land. But <hi>Quid leges sine moribus—?</hi> Those <hi>Laws</hi> are now <hi>no Laws,</hi> for want of due <hi>execution:</hi> but <hi>Beggars</hi> are <hi>Beggars</hi> still, for want of due <hi>correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Et vetabitur semper, &amp; retinebitur</hi>; the saying is truer of <hi>Rogues</hi> and <hi>Gypsies</hi> in England, than ever it was of <hi>Mathematicians</hi> in Rome. You to whose care the preservation of <hi>the Justice,</hi> and thereby al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of <hi>the Peace</hi> of the Land is committed, as you tender <hi>the Peace</hi> and <hi>Justice</hi> of the Land, as you tender your own <hi>quiet,</hi> and <hi>the safety</hi> of your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; as you tender <hi>the weal</hi> of your Country, and the honour of <hi>God:</hi> breath fresh life into the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing <hi>Laws</hi> by severe <hi>execution</hi>; be rather <hi>cruel</hi> to these <hi>Vipers,</hi> than to <hi>the State.</hi> So shall you free <hi>us</hi> from <hi>the Plague,</hi> and <hi>your selves</hi> from <hi>the guilt,</hi> and <hi>them</hi> from <hi>the opportunities,</hi> of infinite sinful abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations.</p>
            <p>But we are unreasonable to press you thus far, or to seek to you or any others for <hi>Justice</hi> in this matter; having power enough in our own hands to do our selves <hi>Justice</hi> upon these men, if we would but use it: Even by making a strait Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with our <hi>Ears,</hi> not to <hi>heed</hi> them; and with our <hi>Eyes,</hi> not to <hi>pitty</hi> them; and with our <hi>Hands,</hi> not to <hi>relieve</hi> them. Say I this altogether of my
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50684:16"/>
self? or saith not the Apostle even the same? <hi>He that will not labour, let him not eat:</hi> relieve him not. But hath not Christ required us to <hi>feed the hungry,</hi> and to <hi>cloath the naked,</hi> and to be free and <hi>charitable to the poor?</hi> Nothing surer: God forbid any man should preach against <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Almsdeeds.</hi> But remember, that as <hi>God</hi> approveth not <hi>Alms</hi> or any other work, if without <hi>Charity</hi>; so nor <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> it self, if without <hi>Discretion. Honour Widdows,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Paul, But those that are Widdows indeed.</hi> So relieve the <hi>poor,</hi> but relieve those that are <hi>poor indeed.</hi> Not every one that <hi>asketh</hi>; not every one that <hi>wanteth</hi>; nay more, not every one that is <hi>poor,</hi> is <hi>poor indeed:</hi> and he that in his indiscreet and mis-guided charity should give to every one that <hi>asketh,</hi> or <hi>wanteth,</hi> or is <hi>poor,</hi> meat, or clothing, or Alms; would soon make himself more <hi>hungry,</hi> and <hi>naked,</hi> and <hi>poor,</hi> than he that is most hungry, or naked, or poor. The <hi>poor,</hi> whom Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth to thee as a fit object for thy charity, <hi>the poor indeed,</hi> are those that want, not onely <hi>the things</hi> they ask, but want also <hi>means</hi> to get with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out asking. A man that is <hi>blind,</hi> or <hi>aged,</hi> and past his <hi>work</hi>; a man that is <hi>sick,</hi> or <hi>weak,</hi> or <hi>lame,</hi> and <hi>cannot</hi> work; a man that desires it, and seeks it, and <hi>cannot get</hi> work; a man that hath <hi>a greater charge</hi> upon him than his honest pains can maintain; such a man as one of these, he is <hi>poor indeed.</hi> Let thine <hi>Ears</hi> be open, and thine <hi>Eyes</hi> open, and thy <hi>Bowels</hi> open, and thy <hi>Hands</hi> open to such a one: it is a charitable deed, and a <hi>Sacrifice of sweet smelling; with such sacrifices God is well pleased:</hi> Forget not
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50684:17"/>
thou to offer such <hi>sacrifices</hi> upon every good op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, and be well assured God will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get in due time to reward thee. But for a lusty able <hi>upright man</hi> (as they stile him in their own dialect) that had rather <hi>begg,</hi> or <hi>steal,</hi> or both, than <hi>dig</hi>; he is no more to be <hi>relieved</hi> as a <hi>poor</hi> man, than a woman that hath poysoned her husband is to be <hi>honoured</hi> as a <hi>Widow.</hi> Such a woman is a <hi>Widow,</hi> for she hath no more an husband than any other <hi>Widow</hi> hath: but such a Woman is not <hi>a Widow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> would be understood; not such <hi>a Widow</hi> as he would have honoured: it is alms to <hi>hang</hi> up such a <hi>Widow,</hi> rather than to <hi>honour</hi> her. And I dare say, he that helpeth one of these <hi>sturdy Beggars</hi> to the stocks, and the whip, and the house of correction, not only deserveth better of <hi>the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth</hi>; but doth a work of greater <hi>Charity</hi> in the sight of God, than he that helpeth him with <hi>meat,</hi> and <hi>money,</hi> and <hi>lodging.</hi> For he that doth this, corrupteth his <hi>Charity</hi> by a <hi>double</hi> errour. <hi>First,</hi> he maintaineth, and so <hi>encourageth</hi> the other in <hi>idleness</hi>; who, if none would relieve him, would be glad to do any <hi>work</hi> rather then starve. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> he disableth his <hi>Charity,</hi> by <hi>mis-placing it</hi>; and unawares robbeth <hi>the poor,</hi> whilst he thinketh he relieveth them. As he that giveth any <hi>honour</hi> to an <hi>Idol,</hi> robbeth <hi>the true God,</hi> to whom alone all <hi>religious honour</hi> is due: so he that giveth any <hi>Alms</hi> to an <hi>idle beggar,</hi> robbeth the truly <hi>poor,</hi> to whom properly all the fruits of our <hi>Alms</hi> are due. And so it cometh to pass oftentimes (as Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> sometimes complained) that the maintainance of <hi>the poor</hi> is made the spoil of the <hi>loyterer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:50684:17"/>To maintain that peace and quiet, he endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to keep every one within his own bounds, that none defraud and go beyond another: wishing them to have that one great Rule in their eye, <hi>What ye would have others do unto you, that do ye unto them</hi>: this is the Law and the Prophets. He would tell them, that the reason why he lived so peaceably with all his Neighbours, was, because he never received from any of them any more then he would willingly pay: the reason why he was so civil, he always looked upon his Parishioner as if he were the Minister, and upon himself the Minister as if he were the Parishioner.</p>
            <p>Neither was he less obliging in his Carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Neighbouring Gentry, who were much taken with his great Reason, useful Observation, excellent Discourses, Civil, Moral, Philosophical, Historical, Technical: and indeed his skill in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture, Geography, Opticks, Geometry, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomy, Heraldry, in which he took great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, much endeared him to his ingenious Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, who in his company might communicate and improve their own. And indeed he observed it very requisite that Ministers should have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent skill in History, Mathematicks, Law and Physick, to entertain the Ingenious, and to advise the Ignorant, <hi>who expect that the Priests lips should preserve all knowledge, and that the people should receive it from their mouths.</hi> Excellent was that advice of his:
<q>As the times now are, wherein <hi>Learning</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth even unto <hi>wantonness,</hi> and wherein the World is full of Questions, and Controversies,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50684:18"/>
and Novelties, and Niceties in <hi>Religion</hi>; and wherein most of our <hi>Gentry,</hi> very <hi>Women</hi> and all, (by the advantage of long <hi>Peace,</hi> and the customs of modern <hi>Education,</hi> together with the help of a multitude of <hi>English books</hi> and Translations) are able to look through the ignorance of a <hi>Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and censure it, if he be tripping in any point of <hi>History, Cosmography,</hi> Moral or Natural <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy, Divinity,</hi> or the <hi>Arts</hi>; yea, and to chastise his very <hi>method</hi> and <hi>phrase,</hi> if he speak loosely, or impertinently, or but improperly, and if every thing be not <hi>point-vise.</hi> I say, as these times are, I would not have a <hi>Clergy-man</hi> content himself with every <hi>Mediocrity</hi> of gifts; but by his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, care and industry improve those he hath, so as he may be able upon good occasion to <hi>impart spiritual gifts</hi> to the people of God, <hi>whereby they may be established,</hi> and to <hi>speak</hi> with such under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and sufficiency, and pertinency, (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when he hath just <hi>warning,</hi> and a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent time to prepare himself) in some good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of proportion to the quickness and ripeness of these present times, as they that love not his <hi>Coat,</hi> may yet approve his <hi>Labours,</hi> and not finde any thing therein whereat justly to quarrel: <hi>Shewing in his Doctrine</hi> (as our Apostle writeth to <hi>Titus) uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity, sound speech that cannot be condemned, that he that is of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary part may be ashamed, having no evil to say of him.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>He was always so excellent a Neighbour, that he seldome failed in the civility of Visits and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50684:18"/>
Correspondence; the greatest advantages for good understanding and love: but especially in time of sickness, when affliction was an excellent prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive for instruction. Wherefore not onely when intreated, (as most of his dying Neighbours were unwilling to leave the world until he, good man, had setled their consciences upon Gospel-princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in peace with God) did he make his visits to all such as wanted his assistance; but before he was thought of, would he prevent their requests, by early and frequent addresses to them: attending dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently those <hi>mallia tempora,</hi> those gentle and most tractable opportunities of doing good which might be offered him.</p>
            <p>As he was publick-spirited himself, so he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured that all he had interest in, might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative; there being few Gentlemen of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance whom he had not directed to some no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or charitable work for mens improvement or relief: He, their great Casuist, having their hearts and purses at his devoir, and using his happy pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er always to their honour, comfort, and infinite satisfaction: so, he would say, he rescued the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the <hi>bondage of corruption, to the glorious ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, and to Primitive innocence,</hi> and their <hi>first use.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although he was thus employed and taken up at his private charge,<note place="margin">Sect. 8. <hi>His Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
               </note> and pleased with his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved privacy and retirement; yet when summoned to the Publick, as to <hi>Paul</hi>'s Cross, to Visitations, to Lectures, to the Court, to the University, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared with much zeal, prudence, and holy abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50684:19"/>
with elegant and useful performances, full of Dogmatick, Polemick, Practick, Casuistick and Critick Learning; where he offered the marrow and pith of the Fathers, the subtilty of the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the solidity of the Neotericks, so ready, so clear, so percolated from the Authors obscurity or tediousness, that his Quintessence, or Distillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of them in his Discourse, were more useful, perspicuous and vigorous, then the Originals or first Mass wherein they were diffused. At Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations he offered deep, solid, clear and abstract Notions of Reason, Experience and Religion, for Order, Peace, Unity and Obedience, and pointed out those paths equally distant from superstition and licentiousness, wherein all wise and good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians should walk in peace, according to the will of God declared in Laws Natural, Civil, Moral and Ecclesiastical; where the attentive Hearers admired equally the acute manner, and the weighty matter of his Discourses; his strong Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, his clear Deductions, his impartial Judgement, his steady, even, and undistracted Thoughts, whereby he rescued poor souls, whose easiness cast them on obvious errours, rather then they would search after difficult and retired truths. He perswaded private Reasons, Pretences, Interests and Designes, to yeild to publick Law and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good. He convinced the world that the things enjoyned in our Church, are in their nature safe and lawful, in their use free; and to be used in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to Authority, for order, decency and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, as they might be forborn when not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50684:19"/>
or not conducing to order, decency, or a sacred solemnity. He taught men to bring their consciences to a Rule, and forbear nothing as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst conscience which was not against a Rule, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Gods Word, against Faith, or Manners, or the nature of the things enjoyned. How clearly hath he proved, that as all necessaries were enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by express Scriptures; so all the Circumstances of Worship and Discipline were enjoyned in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-<hi>intimations,</hi> which required all things <hi>orderly</hi> and <hi>decent?</hi> How pathetically would he urge, that Publick Authority knew better what Time, Place, Gesture, Garment, Phrase, Rite or Ceremony was most expedient and orderly, then any private Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and that if any man would be contentious, <hi>we had no such custome, nor the Churches of God?</hi> How powerfully would he urge a Compliance with Publick Authority, to avoid scandal, to testifie our Charity, Humility and Obedience; to shew our Reverence and fear of it; to use our Christian Liberty soberly, charitably and obediently; that Laws might be observed, the Church might be composed, Charity might be revived, Dangers might be avoided, the Kingdome might be setled, good Christians might be edified, God might be obeyed, and our Superiours for Gods sake? Thus he studied, debated, cleared and composed Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences; thus he satisfied Scruples; thus he justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Churches Liberty and Authority: the care of which so entirely possessed him, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced most of his study to that designe; which he managed with plenty of Matter, with variety of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50684:20"/>
Reading, with full and pertinent Citations, with clear and copious Expressions, methodical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, powerful Demonstrations, Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Reason, Original Law, Essential Religion, with a prudent discovery of the proportions of order and policy, of the boundaries of Government, and the great principles of peace. And all this was the better taken, because taught by a man not onely of vast and great Abilities, of full maturity of Judgement; but of great Integrity in his Designe, of great innocency and unblameableness in his Conversation; of a good Conscience; of a great calmness and composure in Spirit; of a vast Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, who strained the Quintessence of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Religion, Laws Grecian, Roman, Imperial, and Civil, Canon and Ecclesiastical, to his great Platform for Peace, Unity and Setlement.</p>

For which Meetings he prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himself by a view of all Judgements in the Controversies there likely to be debated, which he drew up into Tables still to be seen, that he might try all things, and hold fast that which is good. Where-ever he appeared, whether in the School, or in Convocation, or in a Committee, (as at the Dean of <hi>Westminster, March</hi> 21. 1640.) his mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was known unto all men:</p>
            <p n="1">1. In those five Points controverted so much in <hi>England</hi> as well as <hi>Holland,</hi> of, 1. Predestination; 2. Reprobation; 3. Universal Redemption; 4. Effectual Grace; and, 5. Perseverance: he pitched upon such a mean as Bishop <hi>Usher,</hi> Bishop <hi>Davenant,</hi> Bishop <hi>Overal</hi> aimed at, and the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> approved of, as appears in his Letters of Accord with that incomparable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:50684:21"/>2. As to the Popish Controversies and Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, he had so far pity and charity for those plain and honest-hearted people of that way, as either their errours or ignorance in some things not fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental, did not betray them either to unbelief or presumption, or to final impenitency, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality, or uncharitableness. He was herein of Bishop <hi>Usher</hi>'s minde, in his Sermon before King <hi>James</hi> an <hi>Wansted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. As to our Reformation: he had a great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem for the Moderation of it, a great Veneration for the Instruments employed of God in it, and a great love of that wholsome way of Doctrine, Life, Devotion and Government then composed: not that he was such a Formalist, but that he wished an alteration of some Words, Phrases, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and Order, to which change of times, or Language, or the like, might <hi>invite</hi>; though he judged all alterations in such grand and establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed Concerns of Religion, should be done by the publick Spirit, Counsel and Consent of the Prophets, Prince and People.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As to Conformity to the Church, although no man more eminent then he for Orthodox Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and orderly Conformity, yet if any out of scruple or tenderness of conscience was less satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with some things, no man had a more tender heart to pity and pray for them; none had a gentler and more powerful way to win and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade those that were capable, ingenious and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest. Indeed he would say as Bishop <hi>Brownrig,</hi> That <hi>nothing was less to be stickled for or against,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50684:22"/>
then Ceremonies</hi>; and yet that nothing was to be stickled for more then Obedience to Governours enjoyning even the smallest Ceremonies: not for rhe worth of the Ceremony, but for the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence due to Authority for conscience sake.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In the business of Church-government, as he was too knowing to question, so he was too honest to deny the universal Customs and Practice of the Church of Christ, in all ages and places for 1500 years for Episcopacie; yet was he passionately inclined to any fair and fraternal accommodation, that humble, orderly and worthy Ministers might have all their, and Bishops no more than was their due by Scripture, primitive Customs, by the Laws of the Land, and by principles of order and true government among all societies of men. As his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations for Episcopacie were potent, his perswasions pathetick: so his designs were upright and just, his deportment so fatherly and friendly, that he was able to reclaim all rational, sober and honest men.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 11. <hi>His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>
               </note>In all revolutions, as he had espoused principles constant to truth and duty, so he stood firm to his principles, as a judicious and conscientious man, as a wise and honest man, where he saw Scripture and Law tyed him up: bearing up with his great abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities against the stream, while Reason could be heard; and afterward retyring within himself, and wrapping himself in innocence and patience: more affected with the publick sins and miseries, than his own suffering: Alwayes as cheerful as one that had the continual feast of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50684:22"/>
               <hi>and the happiness to learn in what state soever he was, therewithall to be contented,</hi> and to know how patiently to <hi>want,</hi> and how wisely and soberly to <hi>abound.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing troubled him more, than that he was layd aside and made useless, when a whole Nation desired to imploy him, and many eminent Persons (as the Honorable Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> 1659) endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by all means to contrive a way, wherein he might communicate his excellent notions to the world. He was a man of whom the world was not worthy: How willing were men to have more of that man, who had composed so many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Sermons as they read? who had written those judicious pieces <hi>De juramento &amp; de obligatione Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiae</hi> which they enjoyed? who had penned the Satisfactory Reason and Judgement of the University of <hi>Oxford</hi> against the Covenant, which they perused? who attained that exactness in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies, which in the Letters of accord to Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> they observed? What reason would have <hi>suppressed</hi> this <hi>worth?</hi> What people would have <hi>deprived</hi> this man? What Government would have laid aside so much reason, judgement and most useful Learning?</p>
            <p>As he went through all conditions prudently, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, faithfully and honourably: so he fulfilled all relations conscientiously. 1, He was a good, faithful, tender and loving, discreet husband, as I take it, of one VVife, with whom he lived some years comfortably, to whom he intrusted his Houshold-affairs intirely; whom he troubled
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50684:23"/>
not with unnecessary business above her capacity.
<q>He was more for an honourable Marriage, then such an affected Coelibacy, as was less consistent with sanctity,</q> and less able to bear off those houshold-cares and other intercurrent troubles, which a Ministers condition and charge brings with it. 2, He was a good father, prudent and indulgent to his children, exemplary before them: constantly recommending love and amity to them; and wisely disposing them according to their capacities and tempers, and devoting them to God: and giving them his blessing, and scattering among them excellent rules of living and dying. 3, He was a provident, careful, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and discreet Master, directing each Servant to his peculiar advantage in his service; reckoning nothing so much his honour, as Gods blessing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his thriving Servants. 4, He was a most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent friend, punctual, honest, useful, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative. 5, He was a Loyal Subject, by no considerations to be moved from his dutiful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects of fidelity, gratitude, love and obedience due to his Soveraign from him, as a Christian, and a Church-man; he denyed any capacity in Christian Subjects to resist those in authority, under any pretence whatsoever, there being a necessity for obeying, in doing, or suffering for conscience sake, as he expresseth himself honestly and rationally in his preface to Bishop <hi>Ushers</hi> Book of <hi>Power and Obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was made Bishop by his Majesties gracious favour, with the universal vote of all good men,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50684:23"/>
               <hi>anno</hi> 1660. as who expected, his Prudence, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, Equanimity and Moderation equal with his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Abilities, might allay Animosities, close Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, heal mens Distempers, and work a right Understanding; all men imagining his Gravity might awe, his Goodness oblige, his Moderation temper, his Reason perswade, and his approved Sincerity prevail upon all men <hi>otherwise minded:</hi> for he was not onely (as I told you) a man of much <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Reading,</hi> but of a <hi>mature Understanding</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a <hi>mellow Judgement</hi> in all matters Politick and Prudential, both Ecclesiastical and Civil. Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that it was thought, if his excellent temper had sooner been added as an allay to some other mens hottest spirits, possibly we had not seen things run to that disorder and ruine; his Gravity and Discretion being likely to allay and fix the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy to a due temperament, (guiding some mens well-meaning Zeal by such Rules of Moderation as might best preserve the Government and Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Church and Kingdome.)</p>
            <p>In this place he setled himself more to comply with the publick good, then his own inclinations: looking up to him who called him to the Office of a Bishop, that great and good work, for direction and assistance in all the intricate Affairs that were before him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He had this advantage of other men, that when he entred upon that employment which lay open to the envy and malice of so many, that his <hi>Life</hi> was so spotless, his <hi>Integrity</hi> so eminent, that Partiality it self could not accuse him; he being a
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50684:24"/>
man of solid worth, in whom was nothing dubious or dark, nothing various or inconstant, nothing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal or affected; nothing as to his publick carriage that was suspected, nothing that needed <hi>palliation</hi> or apologie. I never heard of any thing said or done by him, which a wise and good man would have wished not said, or undone. As <hi>Diogenes</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed him who allowed not motion, by saying no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but walking before his eyes: so this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent person neglected the suggestions of people dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected against his Order, but walked warily and circumspectly in his Calling, really shaming those Cavils by his Conversation.</p>
            <p>His greatness prejudiced not his humility and diligence: the meanest Minister had free access to him: the meanest service had some time allotted to it: <hi>Evangelizavit manu &amp; Scriptione</hi>; by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, teaching the Clergy to preach; by his instruction, teaching the Laity to live. Hereby he governed hearts, ruling the Church as Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by the Word, and making men yeild him a true and willing Obedience, reverencing God in him.</p>
            <p>Painful, pious and peaceable Ministers, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Visitation, were his chief Favourites: he looked them out of their retirements, to bring them to employment and preferment. He very dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly bestowed the Incouragements he had in his Diocess, on persons of most reputed piety, suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency and usefulness.</p>
            <p>As he was very careful to prefer good men that he found in Orders, so he was as careful to admit
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50684:24"/>
none but good men to Orders; lest, as he would say, he should have reason (with him who made a dangerous man Priest) to wish he had laid his hands rather <hi>on the Briers then on such a mans head.</hi> For their Parts, he trusted onely his own Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for their Conversation, he trusted such men of known integrity, as gave their Testimonials not out of courtesie but conscience: and he would say,
<q>That whosoever gives a Certificate, enters into bonds with God and the Church, under a heavy forfeiture to avouch the honesty of the party re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended; and, as <hi>Judah</hi> for <hi>Benjamin,</hi> they become <hi>sureties for the young man to his father.</hi> Nor let them (as one saith) think to avoid the bond, and make it but a blank, with that clause, <hi>So far forth as we know</hi>; for what saith the Apostle? <hi>God is not mocked.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>He was careful and happy in suppressing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations he met with in Doctrine and Discipline; mildly winning men, rather then severely punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them: such Offenders as were unhappy in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving, were yet happy in doing penance in his presence; who aimed not at their suffering, but instruction; who would not have them undone, but reclaimed and reformed: and when he was severest to the <hi>fault,</hi> he made it appear he was kind to the <hi>man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Church-censures of, 1. Admonition, 2. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, 3. Aggravation, 4. Penance, 5. Absolution, were by him seriously and solemnly used, with great reverence, and on great occasions, that they might be restored to the Primitive esteem and veneration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:50684:25"/>He employed his power wholly in Church-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, medling as little as he could with Affairs of State: not that he was unable to manage them, but that he thought them unworthy to be managed by him: onely he would endeavour a good understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding between Prince and People: yet he rather ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired then condemned such reverend and able per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who are strengthned with that which would distract him; making the concurrence of Civil and Temporal power in themselves, support one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Thus this good man was, in my judgement, the <hi>Idaea</hi> of an excellent Prelate; coming up exactly to that excellent character of a Bishop, as one among men the most sober, among Christians the most religious, among Preachers the most exact, among Scholars the most useful, among Ministers the most faithful, among Governours the most mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, among Martyrs the most patient and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant; who when he had discharged his conscience honestly, served his Prince successfully, assisted the Church industriously, gone through all charges renownedly, leaving nothing behind him justly to be blamed, or sinisterly to be suspected, but all things deservedly commended by wise and sober Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, bequeathing to Posterity Principles of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment clearly stated and rationally expressed, with the general sorrow of the Church, but his own great satisfaction, was taken away with an happy <hi>Euthanasia,</hi> composedly, peaceably and comfortably departing, giving himself to Prayers,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50684:25"/>
Meditations, and Discourses, which his own strength could bear, or others kindness could rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably afford him, full of the grace and peace of God, and confirmed (as Dr. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> &amp;c.) by the Absolution of the Church, (which belongs to all that die in the true Faith, and blessed hope of peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent sinners) he calmly rendred his holy, devout and precious soul to God that gave it, in a time when, with Bishop <hi>Bancroft,</hi> he could say, <hi>Eo tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris occubui quò mallem rationem Episcopatus coràm Deo dare, quam Episcopatum coram hominibus exercere.</hi>

            <p>QUest. <hi>How far we may Indulge good and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men of tender consciences dissenting from us in liberty of Conscience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ. First,</hi> besides that <hi>all parties</hi> pretend to <hi>Godliness; Papists, Anabaptists,</hi> and what not? (even the late-sprung-up generation of <hi>Levellers,</hi> whose <hi>Principles</hi> are so destructive of all that <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Justice</hi> by which <hi>publick societies</hi> are suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, do yet style themselves, as by a kinde of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarity, <hi>The Godly</hi>;) And that <hi>secondly,</hi> it is the easyest thing in the world, and nothing more
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50684:27"/>
common then for men to pretend <hi>Conscience,</hi> when they are not minded to <hi>obey</hi>: I do not believe <hi>thirdly,</hi> (though I am well perswaded of <hi>the godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of many of them otherwise,) that <hi>the refusal</hi> of indifferent <hi>Ceremonies</hi> enjoyned by <hi>Lawful Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> is any part of their <hi>Godliness</hi>; or any good fruit, evidence, or sign thereof. But certain it is <hi>fourthly,</hi> that <hi>the godliest</hi> men are <hi>men,</hi> and <hi>know but in part</hi>; and by the power of <hi>godliness</hi> in their <hi>hearts,</hi> are no more secured from the possibility of falling into <hi>Errour</hi> through <hi>Ignorance,</hi> then from the possibility of falling into Sin through <hi>Infirmity.</hi> And as for <hi>Tenderness</hi> of Conscience <hi>fifthly,</hi> a most gracious blessed fruit of <hi>the holy Spirit</hi> of God, where it is <hi>really,</hi> and not <hi>in pretence</hi> only, nor <hi>mistaken,</hi> (for sure it is no very <hi>tender Conscience,</hi> though sometimes called so, that <hi>straineth at a Gnat, and swalloweth a Camel</hi>:) it is with it, as with other <hi>tender</hi> things; very subject to receive <hi>harme,</hi> and soon put out of <hi>order.</hi> Through the cunning of <hi>Satan,</hi> it dangerously <hi>exposeth</hi> men to <hi>tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the right hand:</hi> and through its own apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to entertain and to cherish <hi>unnecessary scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> it strongly <hi>disposeth</hi> them to <hi>listen</hi> thereunto so long, till at the last they are <hi>overcome</hi> thereof. Needful it is therefore, that in the publick teaching <hi>the Errours</hi> should be sometimes refuted, and <hi>the Temptations</hi> discovered: And this ever to be done <hi>seasonably, soberly, discreetly,</hi> and <hi>convincingly</hi>; and when we are to deal with men whose <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi> are (so far as we can discern) truly <hi>tender,</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:50684:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with the spirit of <hi>meekness</hi> and <hi>Compassion.</hi> For <hi>tender</hi> things must be <hi>tenderly</hi> dealt withall, or they are lost. I know it is not allwayes <hi>so done</hi>: nor can we expect it should.

            </p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>Whether good men should be suspended from the exercise of their ministry, and deprived of their livelyhood, which are on all hands acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged indifferent: and inded in comparison to the work of the ministry are but trifles, however some men dote on them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Let <hi>Ceremonies (secondly)</hi> be as very <hi>Trifles,</hi> as any man can imagine them to be; yet <hi>Obedience</hi> sure is no <hi>Trifle.</hi> They mis-state <hi>the Question,</hi> when they talke of pressing <hi>Ceremonies.</hi> It is <hi>Obedience</hi> (formally) that is required: <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi> not otherwise pressed, then as <hi>the matter</hi> wherein that <hi>Obedience</hi> is to be exercised. If a <hi>master</hi> appoint his <hi>servant</hi> to do some small matter that he thinketh fit to have done, though in it selfe of no great moment; yet he will expect to be <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed</hi>: and it is great reason he should. If in such case <hi>the servant</hi> should <hi>resufe</hi> to do the thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, because he hath <hi>no minde</hi> thereunto; and should receive a check or correction for such refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal: could he either sufficiently <hi>excuse</hi> his own <hi>fault,</hi> or reasonably <hi>complain</hi> of his <hi>master</hi> for dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50684:28"/>
hardly with him, by saying the thing was but <hi>a Trifle?</hi> Is it not evident, that the thing which made <hi>the master</hi> angry, and <hi>the Servant</hi> an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in <hi>that case,</hi> was not (<hi>precisely</hi> and <hi>formally</hi>) the leaving of the thing <hi>undone,</hi> (which had it not been <hi>commanded,</hi> might have been left <hi>undone</hi> without any <hi>fault</hi> or <hi>blame</hi> at all;) but <hi>the refusing</hi> to do it, when he that had <hi>a right</hi> to his service <hi>commanded</hi> him? Wherefore <hi>Thirdly,</hi> rhat which is said of some mens <hi>doting</hi> so extreamely on <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> might have been well enough spared. I know no true son of <hi>the Church of England,</hi> that doteth upon any <hi>Ceremony,</hi> whatsoever opinion he may have of <hi>the decency</hi> or <hi>expediency</hi> of some of them. If any do; let him <hi>answer</hi> for himself. Among wise men, he will hardly pass for a <hi>wise man,</hi> that <hi>doteth</hi> upon any. Nor will he, I doubt, prove a much <hi>wiser man,</hi> that runs into <hi>the contrary</hi> extream, and <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth</hi> all. It is true <hi>Fourthly,</hi> that there have been long and <hi>unkinde quarrels</hi> abour these things; More is <hi>the pitty</hi>! but where is <hi>the fault?</hi> To whom is <hi>the beginning,</hi> and to whom <hi>the continuance</hi> of a quarrel rather imputable? to him, that <hi>demandeth</hi> his right? or to him that <hi>with-holdeth</hi> it from him? For this is the plain <hi>Case</hi> in short: <hi>The Bishops (under the King)</hi> require <hi>obedience</hi> to the <hi>Lawes Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical</hi>; these men <hi>refuse</hi> to give it. So <hi>began the quarrel</hi> at first; and upon the same terms it <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued.</hi> If the <hi>Obedience</hi> challenged were indeed due to these Laws; then did our <hi>Brethren</hi> both <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin</hi> the quarrel, and <hi>hold it on</hi>: if it were not, then
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50684:28"/>
must the whole <hi>blame</hi> lie upon them that <hi>claimed it unjustly,</hi> and not upon them. So that in the winding up of the business, the whole <hi>Controversie</hi> will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve upon this point; Whether to the <hi>Laws Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical</hi> obedience be due or not? For the right de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining whereof, (for so much as it is confest on all hands, that <hi>Obedience</hi> is due to <hi>Lawful authority</hi> commanding <hi>lawful things) two</hi> other <hi>points</hi> are to be resolved; the one concerning <hi>the authority</hi> by which the Constitutions were made; the other concerning <hi>the lawfulness</hi> of the things therein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; <hi>The Presbyterians of the Kirk</hi> flatly and directly deny both: <hi>Ours,</hi> less forward to declare their opinion in <hi>the former</hi> point, have chosen ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to stand upon <hi>the latter</hi> only. And so <hi>the point in issue</hi> is briefly this; Whether <hi>the things</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded (and particularly the <hi>Ceremonies</hi>) be <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> yea, or no.</p>
            <p>When for <hi>decency, order,</hi> or <hi>uniformity's</hi> sake any <hi>constitutions</hi> are made concerning <hi>ceremonies,</hi> there is the same <hi>necessity</hi> of obeying such <hi>Constitutions,</hi> as there is of obeying other <hi>lawes</hi> made for the good of <hi>the Common-wealth</hi> concerning any other <hi>indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent</hi> things. That such <hi>necessity,</hi> either in the one or the other, ariseth not properly from <hi>the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of the immediate <hi>Lawgiver</hi>; but from <hi>the Ordinance of God,</hi> who hath commanded us to obey <hi>the ordinance of men</hi> for his sake. That such <hi>necessity of obedience</hi> notwithstanding, <hi>the things</hi> remain in the same <hi>indifferency</hi> as before; Every way in respect of their Nature, and <hi>quoad Rem,</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:50684:29"/>
(it being not in the power of <hi>aecidental relations</hi> to change <hi>the natures</hi> of things:) and even in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of their <hi>Vse,</hi> and <hi>quoad nos,</hi> thus far, that there is <hi>a liberty</hi> left for men, upon extraordinary and other just occasions, somtimes to do otherwise then the Constitution requireth, <hi>extra casum Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dali &amp; Contemptus:. A liberty,</hi> which we dare not either take our selves, or allow to others, in things properly and absolutely necessary: Upon which very account (I mean the consideration of the indifferency of the things in themselves) and upon which account alone it is, that many of the Episcopal (that is to say, the true English Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant) Divines, who sadly resent the voting down of the Liturgy, Festivals, and Ceremonies of the Church by so many former Laws established, heartily desired heretofore the continuance, and as heartily still wish the restitution, and are (by Gods help) ready with their Tongues, Pens and Sufferings to maintain and justifie the Lawful use of the same: do yet so far yield to the sway of the times, and are perswaded they may with a good Conscience so do, as to forbear the use thereof in the publick worship; till it shall seem good to those that are in place of authority either to restore them to their former state (as it is well hoped, when they shall have duly considered the evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents of that Vote, they will,) or at leastwise and in the mean time to leave them arbitrary, for men, according to their several different judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to use or not to use, which seemeth but
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50684:29"/>
reasonable, the like favour and liberty in other kinds having been long allowed to almost all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sorts of men, though of never so distant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions one from another. Lastly, That all <hi>Laws</hi> made concerning <hi>Ceremonies</hi> or other <hi>indifferent</hi> things, whether <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> are <hi>mutable</hi>: and as they were at first made <hi>by humane authority,</hi> so may they from time to time be <hi>by humane au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> abrogated and repealed. And then and thenceforth they lose their <hi>obligation</hi>: whereby <hi>the necessity</hi> of yielding <hi>obedience</hi> thereunto wholy ceaseth and determineth; and <hi>the things</hi> thereby <hi>commanded</hi> or <hi>prohibited,</hi> return to their primitive and natural <hi>indifferency,</hi> even in their <hi>Vse</hi> also, and <hi>in respect of us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in the Case of our Church now it is far orher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. <hi>Cap, Surplice, Cross, Ring</hi> and other <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which are the Matter of our differences, though they be things <hi>indifferent</hi> for their <hi>nature,</hi> and <hi>in themselves</hi>: yet are not so for their <hi>use,</hi> and <hi>unto us.</hi> If <hi>the Church</hi> had been silent, if <hi>Authority</hi> had prescribed nothing herein, these <hi>Ceremonies</hi> had then remained for their <hi>use,</hi> as they are for their <hi>nature,</hi> indifferent: <hi>Lawful,</hi> and such as might be <hi>used</hi> without sin; and yet <hi>Arbitrary,</hi> and such as might be also <hi>forborn</hi> without sin. But men mus<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Neither is this accession of <hi>Necessity</hi> any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment to <hi>Christian Liberty</hi>; or <hi>insnaring</hi> of mens <hi>consciences</hi> as some have objected. For then do we ensnare mens consciences by <hi>humane consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,</hi> where we thrust them upon men as if they were <hi>divine</hi>; and bind mens consciences to them <hi>immediately,</hi> as if they were immediate parts of <hi>Gods worship,</hi> or of absolute necessity unto salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Vsurpation</hi> over mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, <hi>the Pharisees</hi> of old did, and <hi>the Church of Rome</hi> at this day doth exercise, and we justly hate in her, equalling, if not preferring her <hi>Constitutions</hi> to the <hi>Laws</hi> of GOD. But our <hi>Church</hi> (GOD be thanked) is far from any such impious presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and hath sufficiently <hi>declared</hi> her self by solemn <hi>protestation,</hi> enough to satisfie any ingenuous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial judgement, that by requiring obedience to these <hi>ceremonial constitutions,</hi> she hath no other purpose, then to reduce all <hi>her children</hi> to an <hi>order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirmity</hi> in the <hi>outward worship</hi> of God; so far is she from seeking to draw any opinion, either of <hi>divine necessity</hi> upon the <hi>constitution,</hi> or of <hi>effectual holiness</hi> upon the <hi>ceremony.</hi> And as for the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice which seemeth to be hereby given to <hi>Christian liberty,</hi> it is so slender a conceit, that it seemeth to bewray in the objectors a desire, not so much of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50684:30"/>
               <hi>satisfaction,</hi> as <hi>cavil.</hi> For <hi>first,</hi> the liberty of a Christian to all indifferent things, is in <hi>the Mind</hi> and <hi>Conscience</hi>: and is then infringed, when <hi>the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> is bound and strained, by imposing upon it an opinion of <hi>doctrinal Necessity.</hi> But it is no wrong to <hi>the Liberty</hi> of a Christian mans conscience, to bind him to <hi>outward observation</hi> for <hi>Orders</hi> sake; and to impose upon him <hi>a necessity of Obedience.</hi> Which one distinction of <hi>Doctrinal</hi> and <hi>Obediential Necessity</hi> well weighed, and rightly applyed, is of it self sufficient to clear all doubts in this point. For, to make all <hi>restraint</hi> of the outward man in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>indifferent</hi> an impeachment of <hi>Christian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>; what were it else, but even to bring flat <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptisme</hi> and <hi>Anarchy</hi> into the Church? and to overthrow all bond to <hi>subjection</hi> and <hi>obedince</hi> to lawful authority? I beseech you consider, wherein can <hi>the immediate power</hi> and authority of <hi>Fathers, Masters,</hi> and other <hi>Rulers</hi> over their inferiours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist; or the due <hi>obedience</hi> of inferiours be shewn towards them: if not in these <hi>indifferent</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary</hi> things? For, things <hi>absolutely necessary,</hi> as commanded by God, we are bound <hi>to do</hi>; whether humane Authority <hi>require</hi> them, or no: and things <hi>absolutely Vnlawful,</hi> as prohibited by God, we are bound <hi>not to do</hi>; whether humane Authority <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid</hi> them, or no. There are none other things left then, wherein to express properly <hi>the Obedience</hi> due to superiour Authority, then these <hi>Indifferent things.</hi> And if a <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>Master</hi> have power to prescribe to his <hi>Child</hi> or <hi>Servant</hi> in indifferent
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50684:31"/>
things; and such restraint be no way prejudicial to <hi>Christian liberty</hi> in them: Why should any man, either deny the like power to <hi>Church-Governours,</hi> to make <hi>Ecclesiastical-constitutionr</hi> concerning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things? or interpret that pow<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r to the prejudice of <hi>Christian Liberty</hi>? And again <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Men must understand, that it is an errour to think <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>constitutions</hi> to be things <hi>meerly in different</hi>: I mean in the general. For howsoever every <hi>particular Ceremony</hi> be indifferent; and every <hi>particular constitution</hi> arbitrary and alterable; yet that there should be some <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> it is necessary <hi>Necessitate absoluta,</hi> in as much as no outward work can be performed without <hi>Ceremonial</hi> circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, some or other: and that there should be some <hi>Cinstitutions</hi> concerning them, it is also necessary (though not simply and absolutely, as the former; yet <hi>ex hypothesi,</hi> and) <hi>necessitate covenientiae.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, since some <hi>Ceremonies</hi> must needs be used; every <hi>Parish,</hi> nay every <hi>man</hi> would have his own fashion by himself, as his humour led him: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of what other could be the issue, but infinite <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction,</hi> and unorderly <hi>confusion</hi> in the Church? And again <hi>thirdly,</hi> to return their weapon upon themselves; If every restraint in <hi>indifferent things</hi> be injurious to <hi>Christian liberty</hi>: then themselves are injurious no less by their <hi>negative</hi> restraint from some Ceremonies, <hi>Wear not, Cross not, Kneel not,</hi> &amp;c. then they would have the world believe our Church is by her positive <hi>restraint</hi> unto these Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of <hi>wearing,</hi> and <hi>crossing,</hi> and <hi>kneeling,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50684:31"/>
Let indifferent men judge, nay let themselves that are parties judge, whether is more injurious to Christian Liberty; <hi>publick Authority</hi> by mature ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice commanding, what might be forborn: or <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate spirits</hi> through humorous dislikes, forbidding what may be used: the <hi>whole Church</hi> imposing the <hi>use,</hi> or a <hi>few Brethren</hi> requiring the <hi>forbearance</hi> of such things, as are otherwise and in themselves e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually <hi>indifferent</hi> for use, or for forbearance.</p>
            <p>But they say, <hi>our Church</hi> makes greater matters of <hi>Ceremonies</hi> than thus; and preferreth them even before the most <hi>necessary duties</hi> of preaching &amp; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministring <hi>the Sacraments</hi>: in as much as they are imposed upon <hi>ministers</hi> under pain of <hi>Suspension</hi> and <hi>Deprevation</hi> from their Ministerial <hi>Functions</hi> and <hi>Charges.</hi> First, for actual Deprivation; I take it, unconforming Ministers have no great cause to complain.
<q>Our Church, it is well known, hath not alwayes used that rigour she might have done. Where she hath been forced to proceed as far as <hi>deprivation</hi>! she hath <hi>ordinarily</hi> by her fair, and slow, and compassionate proceeding therein, sufficiently manifested her unwillingness thereto:</q> and declared her self a Mother every way indulgent enough to such ill-nurtured Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as will not be ruled by her.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> those that are <hi>suspended</hi> or <hi>deprived</hi>; suffer it but justly for their <hi>obstinacy</hi> and <hi>contempt</hi> For howsoever they would bear the world in hand, that they are <hi>the only persecuted ones,</hi> and that they suffer for their <hi>consciences</hi>: yet in truth, they do but abuse
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50684:32"/>
the credulity of the simple therein; and herein (as in many other things) jump with the <hi>Papists,</hi> whom they would seem above all others most abhorrent from. For as <hi>Seminary Priests</hi> and <hi>Jesuits</hi> give it out that they suffer for <hi>Religion</hi>; when the very truth is, they are justly executed for their prodigious <hi>Treasons,</hi> and felonious or teacherous <hi>practises</hi> against lawful Princes &amp; Estates: So <hi>the brethren</hi> pretend they are <hi>persecuted</hi> for their <hi>consciences</hi>; when they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed but justly <hi>censured</hi> for their obstinate and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacious <hi>contempt</hi> of lawful authority. For it is not <hi>the refusal</hi> of these <hi>Ceremonies</hi> they are deprived for, otherwise then as <hi>the matter</hi> wherein they shew their <hi>contempt</hi>: it is <hi>the contempt</hi> it self, which <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly</hi> and properly subjecteth them to just <hi>Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical censure</hi> of Suspension or Deprivation. And <hi>contempt of authority,</hi> though in the smallest matter deserveth no smal punishment: all <hi>authority</hi> having been ever sollicious (as it hath good reason) above all things to vindicate and preserve it self from <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi>; by inflicting sharp punishments upon <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous</hi> persons in <hi>the smallest</hi> matters, above all other sorts of offenders in any degree whatsoever. Thus have we shewed and cleared the <hi>first</hi> and main difference betwixt <hi>the case</hi> of my Text, and the case of our Church, in regard of <hi>the matter</hi>: the things whereabout they differed, being every way <hi>indifferent</hi>; ours not so.</p>
            <p>The determination of <hi>Superiours</hi> may and ought to restrain us in the outward exercise of our <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian liberty.</hi> We must <hi>submit our selves to every
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50684:32"/>
Ordinance of man,</hi> saith St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. and it is necessary we should do so: for <hi>so is the will of God,</hi> Ver. 15. Neither is it against <hi>Christian liberty</hi> if we do so; for we are still as free as before: rather if we do not so, we <hi>abuse our liberty for a cloak of maliciousness,</hi> as it followeth there, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> telleth us we <hi>must needs be subject, not only for fear,</hi> because the Magistrate <hi>carryeth not the Sword in vain, but also for Conscience sake,</hi> because <hi>the powers that are, are ordained of God.</hi> This duty, so fully pressed and so uniformly by these two grand Apostles, is most apparent in <hi>private so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties.</hi> In a family, <hi>the Master,</hi> or <hi>Pater familias,</hi> who is a kind of <hi>petty Monarch</hi> there, hath autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to prescribe to his <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>servants</hi> in the use of those <hi>indifferent things</hi> whereto yet they, as <hi>Christians,</hi> have as much <hi>liberty</hi> as he. <hi>The servant,</hi> though he be <hi>the Lords free-man,</hi> yet is limited in his <hi>dyet, lodging, livery,</hi> and many other things by his <hi>master</hi>: and he is to submit himself to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters appointment in these things, though perhaps in his <hi>private affection</hi> he had rather his Master had appointed otherwise: and perhaps withall in his <hi>private judgement,</hi> doth verily think it fitter his Master should appoint otherwise. <hi>If any man</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of <hi>Christian liberty,</hi> shall <hi>teach otherwise,</hi> and exempt <hi>servants</hi> from the obedience of their <hi>masters</hi> in such things: St. <hi>Paul</hi> in a holy indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on inveigheth against such a man, not without some bitterness, in the last Chapter of this Epistle, as one that <hi>is proud, and knoweth nothing,</hi> as he should do,

               <hi>but doateth about questions and strife of words, &amp;c. ver.</hi> 3.5.</p>
            <p>Now look what power <hi>the master</hi> hath over his <hi>servants</hi> for the ordering of his <hi>family</hi>; no doubt the same at the least, if not much more, hath <hi>the supreme magistrate</hi> over his <hi>subjects,</hi> for the peace of <hi>the Common-wealth</hi>: the Magistrate being <hi>Pater Patriae,</hi> as the Master is <hi>Pater familias.</hi> Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever then shall interpret <hi>the determinations of magistrates</hi> in the use of <hi>the Creatures</hi> to be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to <hi>the liberty</hi> of a Christian: or under that colour shall exempt <hi>inferiours</hi> from their <hi>obedience</hi> to such determinations, he must blame Saint <hi>Paul</hi>; nay he must blame <hi>the holy Ghost,</hi> and not us; if he hear from us that he is <hi>proud, and knoweth nothing, and doateth about</hi> unprofitable <hi>Questions.</hi> Surely, but that <hi>experience</hi> sheweth us it hath been so, and <hi>the Scriptures</hi> have foretold us that it should be so: that there should be <hi>differences,</hi> and sidings, and part-takings in the Church: a man would wonder how it should ever sink into the hearts and heads of sober understanding men, to deny either <hi>the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer</hi> in Superiours to <hi>ordain,</hi> or <hi>the necessity</hi> in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours to <hi>obey</hi> Laws and constitutions, so restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning us in the use of <hi>the Creatures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither let any man cherish his ignorance herein: by conceiting, as if there were some difference to be made between <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Things, and Laws, and Persons in this behalf. The truth is, our <hi>liberty</hi> is equal in both: <hi>the power</hi> of Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours fo restraint equal in both, and <hi>the necessity</hi> of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50684:33"/>
               <hi>obedience</hi> in Inferiours equal to both. No man hath yet been able to shew, nor I think ever shall be, a real and substantial difference indeed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them to make an inequality. But that stil, as <hi>civil magistrates</hi> have sometimes, for just poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick respects, <hi>prohibited</hi> some trades, and manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, and commodities, and enjoyned other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, and done well in both: so <hi>Churnh-Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi> may upon good considerations, (say it be but for order and uniformities sake,) prescribe the <hi>times, places, vestments, gestures,</hi> and other <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial circumstances</hi> to be used in <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Offices and assemblies. As the Apostles in the fi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Thus we see our <hi>Christian liberty</hi> unto the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, may without prejudice admit of some <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straints</hi> in <hi>the outward exercise</hi> of it: and namely from the three respects, of Christian <hi>Sobriety,</hi> of Christian <hi>charity,</hi> and of Christian <hi>Duty</hi> and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. But now in the comparing of these toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; when there seemeth to be a repugnancy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween one and another of them, there may be some difficulty: and the greatest difficulty, and which hath bred most trouble, is in comparing the cases of <hi>scandal</hi> and <hi>disobedience</hi> together, when there seemeth to be a repugnancy between <hi>charity</hi> and <hi>Duty.</hi> As for example. Suppose in a thing which simply and in it self we may <hi>lawfully</hi> according to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50684:34"/>
               <hi>the Liberty</hi> we have in Christ, either use or forbear; <hi>charity</hi> seemeth to lay restraint upon us one way, our <hi>weak</hi> brother expecting we should <hi>forbear,</hi> and <hi>Duty</hi> a quite contrary way, <hi>Authority</hi> requiring <hi>the use</hi>: in such a case what are we to do? It is against <hi>charity</hi> to offend <hi>a brother</hi>; and it is against <hi>Duty,</hi> to disobey <hi>a superiour.</hi> And yet something must be done: either we must <hi>use,</hi> or <hi>not use; forbear,</hi> or <hi>not forbear.</hi> For the untying of this knot, (which, if we will but lay things right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together; hath not in it so much hardness as it seemeth to have;) let this be our <hi>seventh Position.</hi> In the use of <hi>the creatures,</hi> and all <hi>indifferent things</hi> we ought to bear a greater regard to our <hi>publike Governours,</hi> than to our <hi>private Brethren</hi>; and be more careful to <hi>obey</hi> them, than to <hi>satisfie</hi> these, if the same course will not in some mediocrity satisfie both. Alas, that our brethren who are contrary minded, would but with the spirit of sobriety ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <hi>common Reason</hi> to be umpire in this case: Alas, that they would but consider, what a world of <hi>contradictions</hi> would follow upon the contrary <hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> and what a world of <hi>confusions</hi> upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <hi>practice.</hi> Say what can be said, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of a <hi>Brother</hi>; all the same, and more may be said for a <hi>Governour,</hi> For a <hi>Governour</hi> is a <hi>Brother</hi> too, and something more: and <hi>Duty</hi> is <hi>charity</hi> too, and somthing more.

bindeth me to satisfie <hi>another Brother,</hi> equally bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me to satisfie <hi>this.</hi> So that, if we go no farther, but even to the common bond of <hi>charity,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>Brother-hood</hi>; that maketh them <hi>equal</hi> at the least: and therefore no reason, why I should satisfie one that is but a <hi>Private Brother</hi>; rather then <hi>the publike magistrate,</hi> who (that publike re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect set aside) is my <hi>Brother</hi> also. When the Scales hang thus even, shall not the accession of <hi>magistracy</hi> to common <hi>Brother-hood</hi> in him, and of <hi>Duty</hi> to common <hi>charity</hi> in me, be enough to cast it clear for <hi>the magistrate</hi>? Shall a <hi>servant</hi> in a Family, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than <hi>offend</hi> his fellow-servant, <hi>disobey</hi> his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster?

If private men will be offended at our <hi>obedience</hi> to publike <hi>Govornours</hi>; we can but be sorry for it: We may not redeem their <hi>offence</hi> by our <hi>disobedience.</hi> He that <hi>taketh</hi> offence where none is <hi>given,</hi> sustaineth a double person; and must answer for it, both as <hi>the giver</hi> and <hi>the taker.</hi> If offence be taken at us, there is no woe to us for it, if it do not come by us; <hi>Woe to the man by whom the offence commeth</hi>: and it doth not come by us, if we do but what is our duty to do. <hi>The Rule</hi> is certain and equitable; The respect of <hi>private scandal</hi> ceaseth, where <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful authority</hi> determineth our <hi>liberty</hi>: and that <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint</hi> which proceedeth from <hi>special Duty,</hi> is of superiour reason to that which proceedeth but from <hi>common charity.</hi>

               <hi>Answ.</hi> The <hi>Opinion</hi> is, that to do any thing at all without direction from <hi>the Scripture</hi> is unlawful and sinful.

I marvel what warrant they that so teach have from <hi>the Scripture</hi> for that very doctrine: or where they are commanded so to <hi>believe</hi> or <hi>teach.</hi> One of their chiefest refuges is <hi>the Text</hi> we now have in hand: but I shall anon drive them from this shelter. The other places usually alleaged speak only, either of divine and <hi>supernatural truths</hi> to be believed, or else of <hi>workes of grace or worship</hi> to be performed, as of necessity unto salvation: which is not to the point in issue. For it is freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, that in things of such nature <hi>the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is, and so we are to account it, a most <hi>absolute sufficient</hi> direction. Upon which ground we hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily reject all <hi>humane traditions,</hi> devised and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as <hi>supplements</hi> to <hi>the doctrine of faith</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in <hi>the Bible,</hi> and annexed as <hi>codicils</hi> to the holy <hi>Testament</hi> of Christ, for to supply the defects

thereof. The question is wholly about things in their nature <hi>indifferent,</hi> such as are the use of our <hi>food, raiment,</hi> and the like; about which <hi>the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon actions</hi> of life are chiefly conversant: Whether in the choice and use of such things, we may not be sometimes sufficiently guided by the light of <hi>reason</hi> and the common rules of <hi>discretion</hi>: but that we must be able, (and are so bound to do, or else we <hi>sinne</hi>) for every thing <hi>we do</hi> in such matters, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce our <hi>warrant</hi> from some place or other of <hi>Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before <hi>the Scripture</hi> were written it pleased GOD by <hi>visions,</hi> and <hi>dreams,</hi> and other like <hi>reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi> immediately to make known his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to the <hi>Patriarches</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> and by them unto the people: which kind of <hi>Revelations</hi> served them to all the same intents and purposes, whereto the sacred <hi>Scriptures</hi> now do us, <hi>viz.</hi> to instruct them what they should <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>do</hi> for his better <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> and the furtherance of their own <hi>salvations.</hi> Now as it were unreasonable for any man to think, that they either had or did expect an <hi>immediate revelation</hi> from God every time they <hi>eat,</hi> or <hi>drank,</hi> or <hi>bought,</hi> or <hi>sold,</hi> or did any other of <hi>the common actions</hi> of life, for the warranting of each of those particular actions to their consciences: no less un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable it is to think, that we should now expect the like <hi>warrant</hi> from <hi>the Scriptures</hi> for the doing of the like actions. Without all doubt <hi>the Law of nature,</hi> and <hi>the light of reason,</hi> was <hi>the rule</hi> whereby they were guided for the most part in such matters:
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50684:36"/>
which the wisdome of God would never have left in them or us, as a <hi>principal relique</hi> of his decayed <hi>image</hi> in us, if he had not meant, that we should make use of it, for <hi>the direction</hi> of our lives and actions thereby. Certainly God never infused any <hi>power</hi> into any creature, whereof he intended not some <hi>use.</hi> Else, what shall we say of <hi>the Indies</hi> and other barbarous nations, to whom God never vouchsafed <hi>the lively Oracles</hi> of his written word? Must we think that they were left <hi>a lawless people,</hi> without any <hi>Rule</hi> at all whereby to order their <hi>actions?</hi> How then come they to be guilty of <hi>transgression?</hi> for where there is <hi>no Law,</hi> there can be <hi>no transgession.</hi> Or how cometh it about that their <hi>consciences</hi> should at any time or in any case either <hi>accuse</hi> them, or <hi>excuse</hi> them, if they had no <hi>guide</hi> nor <hi>rule</hi> to walk by? But if we must grant they had <hi>a Rule,</hi> (and there is no way, you see, but grant it we must;) then we must also of necessity grant that there is some <hi>other Rule</hi> for humane actions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides <hi>the written word</hi>: for that we presupposed these nations to have wanted. Which <hi>Rule</hi> what other could it be, then <hi>the Law of the Nation</hi> and of <hi>right reason,</hi> imprinted <hi>in their hearts</hi>! Which is as truly <hi>the Law</hi> and <hi>Word of God,</hi> as is that which is printed <hi>in our Bibles.</hi> So long as our <hi>actions</hi> are <hi>warranted</hi> either by the one or the other, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be said to want <hi>the warrant of Gods Word: Nec differet Scriptura an ratione consistat,</hi> saith <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>; it mattereth not much from whether of both we have our <hi>direction,</hi> so long as we have it from either<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:50684:36"/>You see then those men are in a great errour, who make the holy Scriptures <hi>the sole rule</hi> of all humane actions whatsoever. For the maintenance whereof, there was never yet produced any piece of an argument, either from <hi>reason,</hi> or from <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of holy writ, or from the <hi>testimony</hi> either of the ancient <hi>Fathers,</hi> or of other classical <hi>Divines</hi> of later times; which may not be clearly and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly answered, to the satisfaction of any rational man not extreamly fore-possessed with prejudice.
<q>They who think to salve the matter by this <hi>miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi>; that at least wise our actions ought to be framed according to those <hi>general rules</hi> of <hi>the Law of Nature,</hi> which are here and there in the Scriptures dispersedly contained; (as <hi>viz. That we should do, as we would be done to; That all things be done decently and orderly, and unto edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; That nothing be done against conscience,</hi> and the like:) speak somewhat indeed to <hi>the truth</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but little to <hi>the purpose.</hi> For they consider not, <hi>First</hi> that these <hi>general Rules</hi> are but <hi>occasionally</hi> and <hi>incidentally</hi> mentioned in Scripture; rather to manifest unto us <hi>a former,</hi> than to lay upon us <hi>a new obligation. Secondly,</hi> that those <hi>rules</hi> had been of force for the ordering of mens actions, though <hi>the Scripture</hi> had never <hi>expressed</hi> them: and were of such force, before <hi>those Scriptures</hi> were written, wherein they are now <hi>expressed.</hi> For they bind not originally <hi>qua scripta,</hi> but <hi>qua justa</hi>; because they are <hi>righteous,</hi> not because they are <hi>written. Thirdly,</hi> that an action con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50684:37"/>
to these <hi>general Rules</hi> might not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as <hi>sinful,</hi> although the doer thereof should look at those rules meerly as they are the dictates of <hi>the law of nature</hi>; and should not be able to vouch his <hi>warrant</hi> for it from any place of <hi>Scripture,</hi> neither should have at the time of the doing thereof any present thought or considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any such place. The contrary whereunto, I permit to any mans reasonable judgement, if it be not desperately <hi>rash</hi> and <hi>uncharitable</hi> to affirm. <hi>Lastly,</hi> that if mens actions done agreeably to those <hi>rules</hi> are said to be <hi>of faith,</hi> precisely for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, because those rules are contained in <hi>the word</hi>: then it will follow, that before those <hi>particular Scriptures</hi> were written wherein any of those <hi>rules</hi> are first delivered, every action done accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to those rules had been done <hi>without faith,</hi> (there being as yet <hi>no Scripture</hi> for it;) and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently had been a sin. So that by this doctrine it had been a sin (before the writing of S. <hi>Matthews Gospel</hi>) for any man to have done to others as he would they should do to him; and it had been a sin (before the writing of <hi>the former Epistle to the Corinthians</hi>) for any man to have done any thing <hi>decently</hi> and <hi>orderly</hi>; supposing these <hi>two Rules</hi> to be in those <hi>two places</hi> first men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: because (this supposed) there could then have been no warrant brought from <hi>the Scriptures</hi> for so doing.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Well then, we see the former Opinion will by no means hold, neither in <hi>the rigour</hi> of it, nor yet
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50684:37"/>
in <hi>the mitigation.</hi>
               </q>
We are therefore to beware of it; and that so much the more heedfully, because of the <hi>evil consequents</hi> and effects that issue from it: to wit, a world of <hi>superstitions,</hi> uncharitable <hi>cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,</hi> bitter <hi>contentions, contempt</hi> of superiours, <hi>perplexities</hi> of conscience. <hi>First,</hi> it filleth mens heads with many <hi>superstitious</hi> conceits, making them to cast <hi>impurity</hi> upon sundry things, which yet are <hi>lawful</hi> to as many as use them lawfully. For the taking away of <hi>the indifferency</hi> of any thing that is indifferent, is in truth <hi>Superstition</hi>: whether either of the two wayes it be done, either by <hi>requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> it as <hi>necessary,</hi> or by <hi>forbidding</hi> it as <hi>unlawful.</hi> He that condemneth a thing as <hi>utterly unlawful,</hi> which yet indeed is <hi>indifferent,</hi> and so lawful, is <hi>guilty</hi> of <hi>superstion,</hi> as well as he that enjoyneth a thing as <hi>absolutely necessary,</hi> which yet indeed is but <hi>indifferent,</hi> and so arbitrary. They of <hi>the Church of Rome,</hi> and some in <hi>our Church,</hi> as they go upon quite contrary <hi>grounds,</hi> yet both <hi>false</hi>; so they run into quite contrary <hi>errours,</hi> and both <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious.</hi> They decline too much on <hi>the left hand,</hi> denying to <hi>holy Scripture</hi> that <hi>perfection</hi> which of right it ought to have; of containing all appertaining to that <hi>supernatural doctrine</hi> of faith and holiness which God hath revealed to his Church for the attainment of everlasting salvation: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they would impose upon Christian people, and that with an opinion of <hi>necessity,</hi> many things with <hi>the Scriptures</hi> require not: and that is <hi>a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition.</hi> These wry too much on <hi>the right hand,</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:50684:38"/>
ascribing to the <hi>holy Scripture</hi> such a kind of <hi>perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> as it cannot have; of being the sole directour of all <hi>humane actions</hi> whatsoever: whereupon they <hi>forbid</hi> unto Christian people, and that under the name of <hi>sinne,</hi> sundry things which the holy <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> condemneth not: and that is <hi>a superstition</hi> too.</p>
            <p>From which <hi>Superstition</hi> proceedeth in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place <hi>uncharitable censuring</hi>: as evermore they that are the most <hi>superstitious,</hi> are the most <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percilious.</hi> No such severe <hi>censurers</hi> of our blessed Saviours person and actions, as the <hi>superstitious</hi> Scribes and Pharisees were. In this Chapter the special fault, which the Apostle blameth in the <hi>weak ones,</hi> (who were somewhat <hi>superstitiously</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,) was their <hi>rash</hi> and <hi>uncharitable judging</hi> of their brethren. And common and daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence among our selves sheweth how freely some men spend their <hi>censures</hi> upon so many of their brethren, as <hi>without scruple</hi> do any of those things, which they upon false grounds have <hi>superstitiously</hi> condemned as <hi>utterly unlawful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then <hi>thirdly,</hi> as unjust <hi>censures</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly entertained with <hi>scorn</hi> and contumely; they that so liberally condemn their brethren of <hi>prophan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> are by them again as freely flouted for their <hi>preciseness</hi>: and so whiles both parties <hi>please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi> in their own wayes, they cease not mutually to <hi>provoke</hi> and scandalize and exasperate the one the other, pursuing their private spleens so far, till they break out into <hi>open contentions</hi> and oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50684:38"/>
Thus it stood in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> when this Epistle was written. They <hi>judged</hi> one another, and <hi>dispised</hi> one another, to the great disturbance of <hi>the Churches peace</hi>: which gave occasion to our Apostles whole discourse in this Chapter. And how far the like <hi>censurings</hi> and <hi>despisings</hi> have embit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered <hi>the spirits,</hi> and whetted both <hi>the tongues</hi> and <hi>pens</hi> of learned men one against another in our own Church; the stirs that have been long since <hi>raised,</hi> and are still <hi>upheld</hi> by the factions opposers against our <hi>Ecclesiastical constitutions, government,</hi> ond <hi>ceremonies,</hi> will not suffer us to be ignorant. Most of which stirs, I verily perswade my self, had been long ere this either wholly buried in silence, or at leastwise prettily well quieted, if <hi>the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>danger</hi> of the errour whereof we now speak, had been more timely discovered, and more <hi>fully</hi> and <hi>freqvently</hi> made known to the world than it hath been.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> let that doctrine be once admitted, and all <hi>humane authority</hi> will soon be <hi>despised.</hi> The commands of <hi>Parents, Masters, and Princes,</hi> which many times require both <hi>secrecy</hi> and <hi>expedition,</hi> shall be taken into slow deliberation; and <hi>the equity</hi> of them sifted by those that are bound to <hi>obey,</hi> though they know no cause why, so long as they know no cause to the contrary. <hi>Delicata est obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientia, quae transit in causam deliberat vam.</hi> It is <hi>a nice</hi> obedience in St. <hi>Bernards</hi> judgement, yea rather <hi>troublesome</hi> and odious, that is over curious
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50684:39"/>
in <hi>discussing</hi> the commands of <hi>superiours</hi>; boggling at every thing that is enjoyned, requiring <hi>a why for every wherefore,</hi> and unwilling ro stir until the <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> and <hi>expediency</hi> of the thing commanded shall be demonstrated by some manifest <hi>reason,</hi> or undoubted <hi>authority</hi> from the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> the admitting of this doctrine would cast such a snare upon men of weak <hi>judgements,</hi> but tender <hi>censciences,</hi> as they should never be able to unwind themselues again. Mens <hi>daily occasions</hi> for themselves or friends, and <hi>the necessities of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon life,</hi> require the doing of <hi>a thousand things</hi> within the compass of a few dayes; for which it would puzzle the best <hi>Textman</hi> that liveth, readily to bethink himself of <hi>a sentence in the Bible,</hi> clear enough to satisfie a scrupulous conscience of <hi>the lawfulness</hi> and <hi>expediency</hi> of what he is about to do: for which, by hearkening to the rules of <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>discretion,</hi> he might receive easie and speedy resolution. In which cases if he should be bound to <hi>suspend</hi> his resolution, and delay to do that which his own <hi>reason</hi> would tell him were present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly needful to be done, until he could haply call to mind some <hi>precept</hi> or <hi>example</hi> of Scripture for his warrant: what <hi>stops</hi> would it make in the course of his whole life? what <hi>languishings</hi> in the duties of his calling? how would it fill him with <hi>doubts</hi> and irresolutions, lead him into a maze of <hi>uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties,</hi> entangle him in a world of woful <hi>perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities,</hi> and (without the great mercy of God, and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50684:39"/>
better instruction) plunge him irrecoverably into the gulph of <hi>despair?</hi> Since the chief end of the publication of <hi>the Gospel,</hi> is to <hi>comfort</hi> the hearts, and to revive and refresh the spirits of <hi>Gods</hi> people with the glad tidings of <hi>liberty</hi> from the spirt of <hi>bondage</hi> and <hi>fear,</hi> and of gracious <hi>acceptance</hi> with their GOD; to anoint them with <hi>the oyl of gladness</hi> giving them <hi>beauty for Ashes,</hi> and instead of <hi>sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath</hi> girding them with <hi>joy</hi>: we may well suspect that <hi>doctrine</hi> not to be <hi>Evangelical,</hi> which thus setteth the consciences of men upon <hi>the rack,</hi> tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureth them with continual <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>perplexities,</hi> and prepareth them thereby unto <hi>hellish dispaire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>What are the dreadful consequences of</hi> scrupling <hi>some indifferent things?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Althouugh difference of <hi>judgement</hi> should not alienate our <hi>affections</hi> one from another: yet daily experience sheweth it doth. By reason of that <hi>self-love,</hi> and <hi>envey,</hi> and other corruptions that abound in us; it is rarely seen that those men are of <hi>one heart,</hi> that are of <hi>two mindes.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> found it so with the <hi>Romans</hi> in his time: whilest some condemned that as <hi>unlawful,</hi> which others practised as <hi>lawful</hi>; they <hi>judged</hi> one another, and <hi>disposed</hi> one another, perpetually. And I doubt not, but any of us, that is any-whit-like acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the wretched <hi>deceitfulness of mans heart,</hi> may easily conclude how hard a thing it is, (if at all
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50684:40"/>
possible,) not to think somewhat hardly of those men, that take <hi>the liberty</hi> to do such <q>things as we judge <hi>unlawful.</hi> As for example. If we shall judge all <hi>walking</hi> into the fields, <hi>discoursing oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionally</hi> on the occursences of the times, <hi>dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of meat</hi> for dinner or supper, or even <hi>moder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate recreations on the Lords day,</hi> to be grievous <hi>prophanations of the Sabbath</hi>; how can we chuse but <hi>judge</hi> those men that use them to be grievous <hi>prophaners of Gods Sabbath?</hi> And if such our <hi>judgment</hi> concering <hi>the things</hi> should after prove to be <hi>erroneous</hi>: then can it not be avoided, but that such our <hi>judment</hi> also concerning <hi>the persons</hi> must needs be <hi>uncharitable.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This mis-judging of things filleth the would with endless niceties and <hi>disputes</hi>; to the great disturbance of <hi>the Churches peace,</hi> which to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good man ought to be precious. The mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying of <hi>Books</hi> and <hi>writings pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing of <hi>arguments</hi> with heat and opposition, doth rather <hi>lengthen,</hi> then <hi>decide</hi> controversides; and instead of destroying <hi>the old,</hi> begetteth <hi>new ones:</hi> whiles they that are <hi>in the wrong</hi> out of obstinacy <hi>will not,</hi> and they that stand <hi>for the truth</hi> out of conscience <hi>dare not,</hi> may not <hi>yeild</hi>; and so still the war goeth on.</p>
            <p>And as to <hi>the publick peace</hi> of the Church, so is there also <hi>thirdly</hi> by this means great prejudice done to <hi>the peace</hi> and tranquillity of private <hi>mens
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50684:40"/>
consciences?</hi> when by <hi>the peremptory doctrines</hi> of some strict and <hi>rigid masters,</hi> the souls of many a well-meaning man are miserably disquieted with a thousand <hi>unnecessary scruples.</hi> And driven some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times into very woful <hi>perplexities.</hi> Surely it can-be no light matter, thus to lay <hi>heavey burdens</hi> upon other mens shoulders, and to cast <hi>asnare</hi> upon their consciences, by making <hi>the narrow way to Heaven</hi> narrower then ever God meant it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> hereby Christian <hi>Governours</hi> come to be robbed of a great part of that <hi>honour</hi> that is due unto them from their people; both in their <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>Subjection.</hi> For when they shall see cause to exercise over us that <hi>power</hi> that God hath left them in <hi>indifferent things,</hi> by commanding such or such things to be done; as namely, <hi>wearing</hi> of a Surplice, <hi>kneeling</hi> at the communion, and the like: if now we in our own thoughts have already <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged</hi> any of the things so commanded to be <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful</hi>; i<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Answ.</hi> But you will say, if these things were so, how should it then come to pass that so many men pretending, to <hi>Goliness,</hi> (and <hi>thousands</hi> of them doubtless such as they <hi>pretend</hi>; for it were an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable thing to charge them all with <hi>hypocrisie</hi>)
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:50684:41"/>
should so often and so grievously offend this way? To omit those two more <hi>universal causes</hi>; Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Gods permission</hi> first, whose good pleasure it is, for sundry wise and gratious ends, to exercise <hi>his Church</hi> during her warfare here with <hi>heresies</hi> and <hi>scandals</hi>: And then the <hi>williness</hi> of <hi>Satan,</hi> who cunningly observeth whither way our hearts incline most, to <hi>loosness,</hi> or to <hi>strictness</hi>; and then frameth his <hi>temptations</hi> thereafter: So he can but put <hi>us out of the way</hi>; it is no great matter to him, <hi>on whether hand</hi> it be: he hath <hi>his end</hi> howsoever. Nor to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist upon sundry more <hi>particular causes</hi>: as namely, a natural proneness in all men to <hi>superstition</hi>: in many an <hi>affectation</hi> of <hi>singularity,</hi> to go beyond the ordinary sort of people in something or other; the difficulty of shunning one without running into <hi>the contrary extream</hi>; the great force of <hi>education</hi> and <hi>custome</hi>; besides manifold <hi>abuses, offences and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations,</hi> arising from <hi>the carriage</hi> of others; and the rest: I shall note but these two only, as the <hi>two</hi> great <hi>fountains</hi> of Errour, (to which also most of the other may be reduced,) <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>: from neither of which Gods dearest servants and children are in this life wholly exempted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ignorance</hi> first is a fruitful mother of <hi>Errours. (Ye erre not knowing the Scriptures, Matth.</hi> 22. Yet not so much, <hi>Gross Ignorance</hi> neither: I mean not that. For your meer <hi>Ignaro</hi>'s, what they erre, they erre <hi>for company</hi>: they <hi>judge</hi> not at all; neither ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>the appearance,</hi> nor yet <hi>righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:50684:41"/>
They only <hi>run on</hi> with the <hi>herd,</hi> and <hi>follow</hi> as they are <hi>led,</hi> be it right or wrong; and never trouble themselves farther. But by <hi>Ignorance</hi> I mean <hi>weakness of judgement,</hi> which consisteth in a <hi>disproportion</hi> between <hi>the affections,</hi> and <hi>the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing:</hi> when a man is very <hi>earnest,</hi> but withall very <hi>shallow</hi>: readeth much, and heareth much, and thinketh that he knoweth much, but hath not <hi>the judgement</hi> to sever truth from falshood, nor to <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern</hi> between a sound <hi>argument</hi> and a captious <hi>fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy.</hi> And so for want of ability to examine the soundness and strength of those <hi>principles,</hi> from whence he fetcheth his <hi>conclusions</hi>; he is easily car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away, as our Apostle elewhere speaketh, with <hi>vain words,</hi> and <hi>empty arguments.</hi> As St. <hi>Augustine</hi> said of <hi>Donatus, Ratioues arripuit</hi> he catcheth hold of some reasons, (as <hi>wranglers</hi> will <hi>catch</hi> at a smal thing, rather then <hi>yeild</hi> from their opinions,) <hi>quae considerantes, verisimiles esse potius quam veras invenimus</hi>: which saith he, we found to have more <hi>shew of probability</hi> at the first appearance, then <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of truth</hi> after they were well considered of.</p>
            <p>And I dare say, whosoever shall peruse with a judictious and unpartial eye most of those <hi>Pamplets,</hi> that in this daring age have been thrust into the World against <hi>the Ceremonies</hi> of the Church, against <hi>Episcopal Government</hi>; (to pass by things of lesser regard and usefulness, and more open to <hi>acception</hi> and <hi>abuse,</hi> yet so far as I can understand, unjustly
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50684:42"/>
condemned as things <hi>utterly unlawful</hi>; such as are <hi>lusorious lots, dancing, Stage-plays,</hi> and some other things of like nature;) When he shall have drained out the bitter <hi>invectives,</hi> unmannerly <hi>jeers,</hi> petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant <hi>guirding</hi> at those that are in authority, imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent <hi>disgressions,</hi> but above all those most bold and <hi>perverse wrestings</hi> of holy <hi>Scripture,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with such books are infinitely stuffels, he shall find that little poor remainder that is left behind, to contain nothing but <hi>vain words and empty argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> For when these great undertakers have snatcht up the bucklers, as if they would make it good against all comers, that such and such things are <hi>utterly unlawful</hi>; and therefore ought in all reason and conscience, to bring such <hi>proofs</hi> as will come up to that <hi>conclusion: Quid dignum tanto?</hi> very seldome shall you hear from them any other arguments, then such as will conclude but an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expediency</hi> at the most. As, that they are apt to <hi>give scandal</hi>; that they carry with them an <hi>appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of evil</hi>; that they are often <hi>occasions of sin</hi>; that they are <hi>not command</hi> in the Word; and such like. Which <hi>Objections,</hi> even where they are <hi>just,</hi> are not of force, (no not taken <hi>altogether,</hi> much less any of them <hi>singly,</hi>) to prove a thing to be <hi>ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unlawful.</hi> And yet are they glad many times, rather then sit out, to play very <hi>smal Game,</hi> and to make use of <hi>Arguments</hi> yet <hi>weaker</hi> then these, and such as will not reach so far as to prove a bare <hi>inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediency.</hi> As, that they were invented by <hi>Heathens</hi>; that they have been abused in <hi>Popery</hi>; and other
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50684:42"/>
such like. Which to my understanding is a very <hi>strong presumption,</hi> that they have taken a very <hi>weak cause</hi> in hand, and such as is wholly destitute of sound proof.</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>Whether what the</hi> King <hi>and</hi> Parliament <hi>have</hi> determined <hi>may be</hi> altered <hi>to</hi> satisfie <hi>private men,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> While things are in agitation; <hi>private men</hi> may, if any thing seem to them <hi>inexpedient,</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly tender their <hi>thoughts</hi> together with the <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> thereof, to the consideration of those that are in <hi>authority</hi>: to whose care and wisdom it belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, in prescribing any thing concerning <hi>indifferent things,</hi> to proceed with all just advisedness and moderation: that so the <hi>Subject</hi> may be encouraged to perform that <hi>obedience</hi> with <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>rfulness, which of necessity he must perform howsoever. It concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Superiours</hi> therefore to look well to the <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency,</hi> and <hi>inexpediency</hi> of what they enjoyn in indifferent things. Wherein if there be a fault, it must lie upon their account: <hi>the necessity of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> is to us a sufficient discharge in that behalf. Only it were good we did remember, that they are to give up that account <hi>to God onely,</hi> and <hi>not to us.</hi> But after that things are once concluded and <hi>established</hi> by publick authority, <hi>Acts</hi> passed and <hi>Constitutions</hi> made concerning the same, and the will and pleasure of <hi>the higher powers</hi> sufficiently made known therein: then for <hi>private men</hi> to put
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:50684:43"/>
in their vye, and with <hi>unseasonable diligence</hi> to call in question the <hi>decency</hi> or <hi>expediency</hi> of the things so established, yea with <hi>intolerable pride,</hi> to refuse <hi>obedience</hi> thereunto meerly upon this pretension, that they are <hi>undecent</hi> or <hi>inexpedient</hi>; is it self in-the most <hi>indecent</hi> and <hi>inexpedient</hi> thing that can be imagined.</p>
            <p>For that the fear of <hi>offending a private brother,</hi> is a thing not cnnsiderable in comparison of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>obedience to a publike Governour</hi>; might be shown so apparantly by sundry arguments, if we had time to <hi>enlarge</hi> and <hi>illustrate</hi> them, as might sufficiently <hi>convince</hi> the judgement of any man not wilfully obstinate in that point. I shall only crave leave briefly to touch at some of them. <hi>First</hi> then, when <hi>Governours</hi> shall have appointed what seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them <hi>expedient</hi>; and <hi>private men</hi> shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to observe the same, pretending it to be <hi>inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient</hi>: who shall judge thereof? Either they themselves that take the exceptions must be <hi>judges</hi>; which is both unreasonable and preposterous: or else <hi>every man</hi> must be his own judge, which were to overthrow all Government, and to bring in a confusion, every man to do what is <hi>good in his own eyes</hi>: or else <hi>the known gavernours</hi> must judge; and then you know what will follow, even to <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi> and <hi>obey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> to allow men under the pretence of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expediency,</hi> and because of <hi>some offence</hi> that may.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50684:43"/>
be taken thereat, to disobey <hi>laws</hi> and <hi>constitutions</hi> made by those that are in authority; were the next way to cut the sinews of all <hi>authority,</hi> and to bring both <hi>Magistrates</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> into contempt. For what <hi>Law</hi> ever was made, or can be made so just and so reasonable, but some man or other ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did, or might take offence thereat? And what man that is disposed to <hi>disobey,</hi> but may pretend <hi>inexpediency</hi> or other, wherewith to countenance out such his <hi>disobedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it is agreed by consent of all that han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the matter of <hi>Scandal,</hi> that we may not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any sin whatsoever, be it never so small, for the avoiding of any <hi>scandall,</hi> be it never so <hi>great.</hi> But to <hi>disobey</hi> lawful authority in lawful things, is a <hi>sin</hi> against the <hi>fifth Commandement.</hi> Therefore we may not redeem a <hi>scandall</hi> by such our <hi>disobedience</hi>; nor refuse to do the thing commanded by such <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> whosoever should take offence thereat.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> though <hi>lawfulnesse</hi> and <hi>unlawfulnesse</hi> be not, yet <hi>expediency</hi> and <hi>inexpediency</hi> are (as we heard) capable of the degrees of <hi>more</hi> and <hi>lesse</hi>; and then in all reason, of <hi>two inexpedient things</hi> we are to do that which is <hi>lesse inexpedient,</hi> for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding of that which is more <hi>inexpedient,</hi> Say then there be an <hi>inexpediency</hi> in doing the thing commanded by authority, when a Brother is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by offended; is there not a greater <hi>inexpediency</hi> in <hi>not doing</hi> it, when the <hi>Magistrate</hi> is thereby <hi>diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed</hi>?
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50684:44"/>
It is not more <hi>expedient,</hi> and conducing to the <hi>common good,</hi> that a <hi>publick Magistrate</hi> should be obeyed in a <hi>just command,</hi> then that a <hi>private person</hi> should be gratified in a <hi>causelesse scruple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> when by refusing <hi>obedience</hi> to the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full commands of our <hi>Superiours,</hi> we think to shun <hi>the offending of one or two</hi> weak brethren; we do in truth incurr thereby a far <hi>more grievous scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall,</hi> by giving <hi>offence to hundreds</hi> of others: whose consciences by our <hi>Disobedience</hi> will be embold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to that, whereto corrupt nature is but too too prone, to affront the Magistrate, and <hi>despise the authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> where we are not able to discharge both, <hi>debts of justice</hi> are to be payed, before <hi>debts of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> Now the duty of <hi>obedience</hi> is <hi>debitum justitiae</hi> and a matter of <hi>right,</hi> my superiour may challenge it at my hands as is <hi>due</hi>; and I do him <hi>wrong</hi> if I with-hold it from him. But the care of not giving offence is but <hi>debitum charitatis,</hi> and a matter but of <hi>courtesie.</hi> I am to perform it to my brother <hi>in love,</hi> when I see cause: but he cannot challenge it from me as <hi>his right</hi>: nor can justly say I do him <hi>wrong,</hi> if I neglect it. It is therefore no more law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for me, to <hi>disobey</hi> the lawful command of a <hi>Superiour,</hi> to prevent thereby the <hi>offence</hi> of one or a few <hi>brethren</hi>: then it is lawfull for me to do one man <hi>wrong,</hi> to do another man a courtesie withall;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50684:44"/>
or then it is lawful for me to rob the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> to relieve an <hi>Hospital.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I see not yet how any of these <hi>six reasons</hi> can be fairly avoided: and yet, (which would be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,) if but <hi>any one</hi> of them hold good, it is enough to <hi>carry the cause</hi>: And therefore I hope there need be no more said in this matter. To conclude then, for the point of <hi>practise,</hi> (which is the main thing I aimed at in the choiee of <hi>this Text,</hi> and my whole meditations thereon,) we may take our direction in these <hi>three Rules</hi>; easie to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood and remembred, and not hard to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in our practise, if we will but bring our good wils thereunto. <hi>First,</hi> If God command, we must <hi>submit</hi> without any more adoe; and not trouble our selves about <hi>the experiency,</hi> or so much as about <hi>the unlawfulness</hi> for both <hi>Abraham</hi> never dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted whether it were <hi>expedient</hi> for him, not yet whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were <hi>lawful</hi> for him to sacrifice his son or no, when once it appeared to him. that God would have it so.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If our <hi>Superiours,</hi> endued with lawful authority thereunto, cammand us any thing; we <hi>may</hi> &amp; (where we have <hi>just cause of doubt</hi>) we <hi>ought</hi> to enquire into <hi>the unlawfulness</hi> thereof. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>withstanding such <hi>anxious curiosity,</hi> as if we desired to find out some <hi>loop-hole</hi> whereby to evade; but with such <hi>modest ingenuity,</hi> as may witness God and the world the unfeigned sincerity of our desires
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:50684:45"/>
both to <hi>fear God,</hi> and to <hi>honour those</hi> that he hath set over us- And if having used ordinary <hi>moral diligence bona fide</hi> to informe our selves the best we can, there appear no <hi>unlawfulness</hi> it it; we are then also to <hi>submit</hi> and <hi>obey</hi> without any more adoe never troubling our selves farther to enquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be <hi>expedient</hi> yea or no. Let them that <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> us look to that: for it is they must <hi>answer for it,</hi> and not we.</p>
            <p>But then <hi>thirdly,</hi> where <hi>authority</hi> hath left us <hi>free</hi>; no <hi>command,</hi> either of God, or of those that are set over us under God, having <hi>prescribed</hi> any thing to us in that behalf: there it is at our own <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> and <hi>choyce,</hi> to do as we shall think good. Yet are we not left so loose, as that we may do what we list, so as the thing be but <hi>lawful</hi>; (for that were <hi>licentiousness,</hi> and not <hi>liberty</hi>:) but we must ever do that. which according to the exigence of <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent circumstances,</hi> (so far as all <hi>the wisdome</hi> and <hi>charity</hi> we have will serve us to judge,) shall seem to us <hi>most expedient,</hi> and profitable to mutual <hi>Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi> This is the way: God give us all grace to walk in it. So shall we bring <hi>glory</hi> to him, and to our selvess <hi>comfort</hi>: so shall we further his <hi>work</hi> onward, and our own <hi>account</hi> at the last.</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>Whether they that have taken the</hi> Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>may Renounce it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ. Thirdly,</hi> beware of <hi>engaging thy left to sin.</hi> It is a fearful thing, when sin hath got <hi>a tye</hi> upon a man. Then is one properly <hi>in the snare of the Devil</hi>; when he hath him as it were in a string,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50684:45"/>
and may <hi>lead him captive</hi> to what measure of <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption</hi> he will. And sundry wayes may a man thus entangle himself: by a <hi>Verbal,</hi> by a <hi>Real,</hi> by a <hi>Sinful Engagement.</hi> He shall do best to keep himself out of all these <hi>snares.</hi> But if once he be in; there is no way out again but one: even this, <hi>To loose his pledge,</hi> to break in sunder <hi>the bonds</hi> wherein he is tied, as <hi>Sampson</hi> did the <hi>green witths,</hi> and to cast away those <hi>cords</hi> from him.</p>
            <p>A man hath bound himself rashly by some <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, vew,</hi> or <hi>covenant,</hi> to do something he <hi>may not do,</hi> or not to do something he <hi>ought to do.</hi> He is now <hi>engaged</hi> in a sin: the Devil hath got <hi>this tye</hi> upon him. And though <hi>his conscience</hi> tell him he cannot proceed without <hi>sin</hi>; yet because of his <hi>Vow,</hi> or his <hi>Oath,</hi> he is <hi>wilful,</hi> and must on. It was <hi>Herods</hi> Case; for taking of the <hi>Baptists</hi> head. It was <hi>against his conscience</hi> to do it: for he knew he had <hi>not diserved</hi> it: Ey, and it was <hi>against his minde</hi> too to do it; for the Text saith, he was <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding sarry</hi> that his neice should put him upon it. But yet, saith the story withall, <hi>for his Oath sake,</hi> and because <hi>the great ones</hi> about him should not say but the King would be <hi>as big as the word,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved it should be done, and <hi>gave commandment</hi> accordingly to have it done. This I call <hi>a Verbal Engagement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>Whether we English-men may think our selves bound by the Solemne League and Covenant?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Not without betraying the Liberty, which by our Protestation we are bound, and in the third
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50684:46"/>
Article of this Covenant must swear, <hi>with our lives and fortunes to preserve.</hi> To which Liberty the imposition of a new Oath, other then is established by Act of Parliament, it expressed in <hi>the Petition of Right,</hi> and by the Lords and Commons in their <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations</hi> acknowledged to be contrary.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Without acknowledgeing in the imposers, a greater power then, for ought that appeareth to us, hath been in former times challenged; Or can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist with our former Protestation (if we rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it) in sundry the most material branches thereof.</p>
            <p>Neither, secondly, are we satisfied; although the Covenant should not be imposed on us at al, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recommended to us, and then left to our choice.</p>
            <p n="1">1. How we should in wisedom and Duty (being Subjects) of our own accord and free will enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Covenant, wherein He, whose Subjects we are, is in any wise concerned, without His consent, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expressed or reasonably presumed. It being in his power (as we conceive) by the equity of the Law, <hi>Numb.</hi> 30. to annull and make voyd the same at his pleasure.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How we can (now that His Majesty hath by His publique <hi>Interdict</hi> sufficiently made known His pleasure in that behalfe) enter into a Covenant, the taking whereof he hath expresly forbidden; without forfeiting that Obedience, which (as we are perswaded) by our natural Allegiance and former Oathes we owe unto all such His Majesties Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, as are not in our apprehensions repugnant to the wil of God, or the positive laws of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:50684:46"/>Quest. <hi>What shall a man do that scruples in Conscience what Authority enjoyns as unlawful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then <hi>thirdly,</hi> if <hi>the liberty</hi> of the agent be determined by the command of some <hi>superiour power</hi> to whom he oweth <hi>obedience</hi>; so as he is not now <hi>sui juris ad hoc,</hi> to do or not to do at his own choice, but to do what he is <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded:</hi> this one circumstance quite altereth the whole case, &amp; now he is bound in conscience to do <hi>the thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi>; his <hi>doubtfulnesse</hi> of mind whether that thing be <hi>lawful</hi> or no, notwithstanding. To do that whereof he <hi>doubteth,</hi> where he hath <hi>free liberty</hi> to leave it undone, bringeth upon him (as we have already shewn) the guilt of <hi>wilful transgression</hi>: but not so where he is not left to his own <hi>liberty.</hi> And where <hi>lawful authority</hi> prescribeth <hi>in alterutram partem,</hi> there the liberty <hi>ad utramque partem contradictionis</hi> is taken away, from so many as are under that authority. If they that are over them have deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined it <hi>one way</hi>; it is not thenceforth any more at their choice, whether they will take <hi>that way,</hi> or <hi>the contrary:</hi> but they must go the way that is appointed them without gainsaying or grudging. And if in the deed done at <hi>the command</hi> of one that is endued with lawful authority there be a <hi>sin,</hi> it must go on his score that requireth it wrongfully, not on his that doth but his duty in obeying. A Prince commandeth his <hi>Subjects</hi> to serve in his <hi>Warres</hi>: it may be the quarrel is <hi>unjust,</hi> it may be there may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to the understanding of the Subject great likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods of such <hi>injustice</hi>; yet may <hi>the Subject</hi> for all that <hi>fight</hi> in that quarrel; yea he is bound in conscience so to do: nay he is deep in disloyalty and treason if <hi>he refuse</hi> the service, whatsoever pretensions he may make of <hi>conscience</hi> for such refusal. Neither need that fear trouble him lest he should bring upon himself the guilt of <hi>innocent

blood</hi>; for <hi>the blood</hi> that is unrighteously shed in that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, he must answer for that <hi>set him on work,</hi> not he that <hi>spilt it.</hi> And truly it is a great wonder to me, that any man endued with understanding, and that is able in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to weigh the force of those <hi>precepts</hi> and <hi>reasons</hi> which bind <hi>inferiours</hi> to yield obedience to their <hi>superiours,</hi> should be otherwise minded in cases of like nature. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is commanded us by those whom God hath set o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us, either in Church, Common wealth, or Family, (<hi>Quod tamen non sit certum displicere Deo,</hi> saith S. <hi>Bern.</hi>) which is not evidently contrary to <hi>the Law</hi> and will of God, ought to be of us received and <hi>obeyed</hi> no otherwise, then as if <hi>God</hi> himself had commanded it, because God himself hath commanded us to <hi>obey the higher powers,</hi> and to <hi>submit our selves to their ordinances.</hi> Say it be not well don of them to command it! <hi>Sed enim quid hoc refert tuâ?</hi> saith he, What is that to thee? Let them look to that whom it concerneth: <hi>Tolle quod tuum est, &amp; vade.</hi> Do thou what is thine own part faithfully, and never trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thy self further. <hi>Ipsum quem pro Deo habemus, tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam Deum in his quae apertè non sunt contra Deum audire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bemus; Bernard</hi> still. Gods Vicegerents must be heard and <hi>obeyed</hi> in all things that are not manifestly contrary to <hi>the revealed will</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>But the thing required is <hi>against my conscience,</hi> may som say, and I may not go against my <hi>conscience</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for any mans pleasure. Judg I pray you what perverseness is this, when the blessed Apostle commandeth thee <hi>to obey for conscience sake,</hi> that thou shouldest <hi>disobey,</hi> &amp; that for <hi>conscience sake</hi> too: He chargeth thee upon thy conscience to <hi>be subject</hi>; and thou pretendest thy conscience to <hi>free thee</hi> from sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. This by the way; now to the point. Thou sayest it is <hi>against thy conscience</hi>: I say again, that (in the case
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50684:47"/>
whereof we now speak, the case of <hi>doubtfullness</hi>) it is not against thy conscience. For doubting properly is <hi>motus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differens in utramque partem contradictionis</hi>; when the mind is held in suspence between <hi>two ways,</hi> uncertain whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of both to take to. When the scales hang even (as I said before) and <hi>inaequi<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>libero,</hi> without any notable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension or inclination to the one side more than to the other. And surely where things hang thus <hi>even,</hi> if <hi>the weight of authority</hi> will not cast the scale either way: we may well suppose, that either <hi>the authority</hi> is made very <hi>light,</hi> or else there is a great fault in <hi>the beame.</hi> Know (brethren) the <hi>gainsaying conscience</hi> is one thing, and the <hi>doubting conscience</hi> another. That which is done <hi>repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nante conscientià,</hi> the conscience of the doer flatly <hi>gainsay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> it, that is indeed <hi>against a mans conscience,</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science having already passed <hi>a definitive sentence</hi> the one way:) and no respect or circumstance whatsoever can free it from sin. But that which is done <hi>dubitante consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiâ,</hi> the conscience of the doer onely doubting of it and no more; that is in truth no more <hi>against a mans conscience</hi> than <hi>with</hi> it, (the conscience as yet not having passed <hi>a definitive sentence</hi> either way) and such an action may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be <hi>a sinne,</hi> or <hi>no sinne</hi>; according to those qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which it may receive from other respects and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances. If the conscience have already passed <hi>a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> upon a thing, and <hi>condemned</hi> it as simply unlawfull; in that case it is true that a man ought not by any meanes to do that thing, no not at <hi>the command</hi> of any Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, no not although his <hi>conscience</hi> have pronounced a wrong <hi>sentence,</hi> and erred in that judgement: for then he should do it <hi>repugnante conscientiâ,</hi> he should go di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly against his own <hi>conscience,</hi> which he ought not to do whatsoever come of it. In such a case certainly he
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50684:48"/>
may not obey <hi>the Magistrate</hi>: yet let him know thus much withall, that he sinneth too in <hi>disobeying</hi> the Magistrate; from which sinne the following of <hi>the judgement</hi> of his own <hi>conscience</hi> cannot acquit him. And this is that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>perplexity</hi> whereof I spake, whereinto many a man casteth himself by his own <hi>error</hi> &amp; <hi>obstinacy,</hi> that he can neither go <hi>with</hi> his conscience, nor <hi>against</hi> it but he shall sinne. And who can help it, if a man will needs cherish <hi>an errour,</hi> and persist in it? But now if <hi>the conscience</hi> be onely <hi>doubtfull</hi> whether a thing be <hi>lawfull</hi> or no, but have not as yet passed a <hi>peremptory judgement</hi> against it, (yea although it rather incline to think it <hi>unlawfull:</hi>) in that case if the Magistrate shall <hi>command</hi> it to be done, the subject with a good conscience <hi>may</hi> do it, nay he cannot with a good conscience <hi>refuse</hi> to do it, though it be <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitante conscientiâ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you will yet say, that in doubtfull cases <hi>the safer part</hi> is to be chosen. So say I too; and am content <hi>that rule</hi> should decide <hi>this question</hi>: onely let it be rightly applyed. Thou thinkest it <hi>safer,</hi> where thou doubtest of the unlawfulnesse, <hi>to forbear</hi> then <hi>to do</hi>: as for example, if thou doubtest whether it be lawfull <hi>to kneel</hi> at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, it is safest in thy opinion therefore for thee <hi>not to kneel.</hi> So should I think too, if thou wert left meerly to thine own <hi>liberty.</hi> But thou dost not consider how thou art caught in thine own net, and how the edge of thine own weapon may be turned upon thee point-blank not to be avoided, thus. If authority command thee <hi>to kneel,</hi> which whether it be lawful for thee to do, or not, <hi>thou doubtest</hi>; it cannot chuse but thou must needs <hi>doubt</hi> also, whether thou maiest lawfully <hi>disobey,</hi> or not. Now then here apply thine own Rule, <hi>In dubiis pars tutior,</hi> and see what will come of it. Judge, since thou canst not but
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50684:48"/>
               <hi>doubt</hi> in both cases, whether it be not <hi>the safer</hi> of the two, <hi>to obey</hi> doubtingly, than to <hi>disobey doubtingly. Tene cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, demitte incertum,</hi> is S. <hi>Gregory</hi> his rule: where there is <hi>a certainty,</hi> and <hi>an uncertainty,</hi> let the uncertainty go, and hold to that which is certain. Now <hi>the general</hi> is <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> that thou art to obey <hi>the Magistrate</hi> in all things not contrary to the will of God; but <hi>the particular</hi> is <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,</hi> whether the thing now commanded thee by <hi>the Magistrate</hi> be contrary to the will of God: (I say uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>to thee,</hi> because thou <hi>doubtest</hi> of it) Deal <hi>safely</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and hold thee to that which is <hi>certain</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and obey.</p>
            <p>But thou wilt yet alledge, that <hi>the Apostle</hi> here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth the doing of any thing, not only with a <hi>gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saying,</hi> but even with <hi>a doubting</hi> conscience: because <hi>doubting</hi> also is contrary to <hi>faith</hi>; and <hi>he that doubteth is</hi> even for that <hi>condemned, if he eat.</hi> Oh beware of mis-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying <hi>Scripture!</hi> it is a thing easily done, but not so easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly answered. I know not any one gap that hath let in more and more dangerous errours into the Church, than this: that men take <hi>the word,</hi> of the sacred Text fitted to <hi>particular occasions,</hi> &amp; to the condition of the <hi>times</hi> wherin they were written; &amp; then <hi>apply</hi> them to themselvs &amp; others as they find them, without due respect had to <hi>the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> that may be between those <hi>times</hi> &amp; <hi>cases,</hi> &amp; the present. Sundry things spoken of in Scripture agreeably to that <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy</hi> of the Church, would sort very ill with the Church in her fulness of <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>stature</hi>: &amp; sundry directions very expedient in times of <hi>persecution,</hi> and when believers lived mingled with <hi>Infidels,</hi> would be very unseasonably urged where the Church is in a <hi>peaceable</hi> and <hi>flourishing</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, enjoying the <hi>favour</hi> and living under <hi>the protection</hi> of gracious and religious <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. Thus <hi>the Constitutions</hi> that the Apostles made concerning <hi>Deacons</hi> &amp; <hi>Widowes</hi> in
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50684:49"/>
those primitive times, are with much importunity, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry importunely withal, urged by <hi>the Disciplinarians</hi>: And sundry other like things I might instance of this kind, worthy the discovery, but that I fear to grow tedious. Briefly then, the Apostles whole discourse in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and so wheresoever else he toucheth upon the point of <hi>Scandals,</hi> is to be understood only in that case where men are left <hi>to their own liberty</hi> in the use of indifferent things: the <hi>Romans, Corinthians,</hi> &amp; others to whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote about these matters, being not <hi>limited</hi> any way in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of their <hi>liberty</hi> therein by any overruling <hi>authority.</hi> But where the Magistrates have interposed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; thought good upon mature advice to <hi>impose Laws</hi> upon those that are under them, whereby their <hi>liberty</hi> is (not <hi>infringed,</hi> as some unjustly complain, in the <hi>inward judgement,</hi> but only) <hi>limited</hi> in the <hi>outward exercise</hi> of it: there the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical directions will not hold in the same <hi>absolute man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> as they were delivered to those whom they then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; but only in <hi>the equity</hi> of them, so far forth as the cases are alike, &amp; with such meet <hi>qualifications</hi> and <hi>mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> as the difference of the cases otherwise doth require. So that a man ought not out of private fancy, or meerly because he would not be observed for not doing as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do, or for any the like weak respects, to do that thing of the <hi>lawfulness</hi> whereof he is not <hi>competently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,</hi> where it is <hi>free</hi> for him to do otherwise: which was the case of these <hi>weak ones</hi> among <hi>the Romans,</hi> for whose sakes principally the Apostle gave these directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But the <hi>authority</hi> of the Magistrates intervening so alters the case, that such a forbearance as to them was <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,</hi> is to as many of <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 span">

               </gap> regard they were <hi>free</hi> and we are <hi>bound:</hi> for the reasons already shewn, which I now
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50684:49"/>
rehearse not. But you will yet say, (for in point of <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> men are very loth to <hi>yield</hi> so long as they can find any thing to <hi>plead,</hi>) those that lay <hi>these burdens</hi> upon us, at least wise should do well to satisfie <hi>our doubts</hi> and <hi>to inform</hi> our consciences concerning <hi>the lawfulnesse</hi> of what they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn that so we might render them <hi>obedience</hi> with better <hi>cheerfulness.</hi> How willing are we sinful men to leave the blame of our miscarriages any where rather than upon our selvs! But how is it not incongruous the while, that those men should <hi>prescribe rules</hi> to their governours, who can scarcely brook their governours should <hi>prescribe laws</hi> to them? It were good we should first <hi>learn</hi> how <hi>to obey,</hi> ere we take upon us <hi>to teach</hi> our betters how <hi>to govern.</hi> However, what <hi>governours</hi> are bound to do, or what is fit for them to do, in the point of <hi>information</hi>; that is not now the question. If they fail in any part of <hi>their</hi> bounden <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> they shall be sure to reckon for it one day: but <hi>their failing</hi> cannot in the mean time excuse <hi>thy disobedience.</hi> Although I think it would prove a hard task, for whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever should undertake it, to shew that <hi>Superiours</hi> are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies bound <hi>to inform</hi> the consciences of their inferiours concerning the <hi>lawfulness</hi> of every thing they shall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. If somtimes they do it, where they see it <hi>expedient</hi> or <hi>needful</hi>; somtimes again (and that perhaps oftner,) it may be thought more <hi>expedient</hi> for them, and more <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible</hi> for the publick peace and safety, only to make known to the people what their pleasures are, reserving to themselvs <hi>the reasons</hi> thereof. I am sure, in the point of <hi>Ecclesiastical Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Constitutions</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (in which case the aforesaid allegations are usually most stood upon,) this hath been abundantly done in our Church, not onely in the learned writings of sundry <hi>private men</hi> but by the <hi>publick declaration</hi> also of authority, as is to be seen at large
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:50684:50"/>
in <hi>the preface</hi> commonly printed before <hi>the book of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayer</hi> concerning that argument: enough to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie those that are peaceable, and not disposed to stretch their wits to cavil at things established. And thus much of the <hi>second Question,</hi> touching <hi>a doubting conscience:</hi> whereon I have insisted the longer, because it is a point both so proper to the <hi>Text,</hi> &amp; whereat so many have stumbled.</p>
            <p>There remaineth but one <hi>other Question,</hi> and that of far smaller difficulty: What is to be done, when the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is <hi>scrupulous?</hi> I call that a <hi>scruple,</hi> when a man is reasonably well perswaded of <hi>the lawfullnesse</hi> of a thing, yet hath withal some <hi>jealousies</hi> and <hi>fears,</hi> lest perhaps it should prove unlawful. Such scruples are most incident to men of <hi>melancholy</hi> dispositions, or of <hi>timorous</hi> spirits; especially if they be <hi>tender-conscienced</hi> withall: and they are much encreased by the false <hi>suggestions</hi> of Satan; by reading <hi>the books,</hi> or hearing <hi>the Sermons,</hi> or frequenting <hi>the company</hi> of men more strict, precise, and austere in sundry points, than they need or ought to be; and by sundry other means which I now mention not. Of which <hi>scruples</hi> it behooveth every man, <hi>first,</hi> to be wary that he doth not at all <hi>admit</hi> them, if he can chuse: or, if he cannot wholly avoid them, that <hi>secondly,</hi> he endeavour so far as may be <hi>to eject</hi> them speedily out of his thoughts, as <hi>Satans snares,</hi> and things that may breed him worser in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies: or, if he cannot be so rid of them, that then <hi>thirdly,</hi> he resolve to go on according to the more <hi>profitable perswasion</hi> of his mind, and <hi>despise</hi> those scruples. And this he may do with a good conscience, not only in things <hi>commanded</hi> him by lawful <hi>authority,</hi> but even in things <hi>indifferent</hi> and arbitrary, and wherein he is left to his own <hi>liberty.</hi>
